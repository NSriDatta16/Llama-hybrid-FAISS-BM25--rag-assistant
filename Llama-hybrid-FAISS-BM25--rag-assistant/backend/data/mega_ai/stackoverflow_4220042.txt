1) Perfectly fine for the mapper/Gateway or however you call it. 2) You can do but i highly disencourage this. Why? Later on in your application you can't tell from where you did get the model. So you'd have to check if a value is set in your model each time you're not sure if it is set or you'd need some autoloading stuff for missing values (which is as worse as missing stuff). Another reason is that you can't reuse the function for other porposes where you might need other properties of the user model. Last reason afaik is, that a model represents the complete entity at any time, not parts of it. And there's no real reason why not to load all fields (beside references to other entities why should be autoloaded anyways).
