Your model is $$E[Y \vert Z]=\Pr(Z=1 \vert X)\cdot \beta_1 + \cdots + \Pr(Z=k\vert X)\cdot \beta_k.$$ You want to know how that changes with $X$ , so you can take the derivative: $$\frac{\partial E[Y \vert Z]}{\partial X}=\frac{\Pr(Z=1 \vert X)}{\partial X}\cdot \beta_1 + \cdots + \frac{\Pr(Z=k\vert X)}{\partial X}\cdot \beta_k.$$ These derivatives are the marginal effects from the multinomial model. You can calculate the overall effect by averaging this expression in your estimation sample.
