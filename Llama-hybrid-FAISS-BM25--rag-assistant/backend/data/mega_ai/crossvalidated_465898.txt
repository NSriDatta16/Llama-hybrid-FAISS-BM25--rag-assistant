You already know how to atribute the summed, yearly electric use to the real building ; you are only interested in the hourly pattern of electric usage. So I assume you can standardize each hourly electric usage so that it becomes a distribution (i.e. which percentage of the electric usage was used before 8am ; 5pm ; 12pm). Intuitively: You may choose a distance between distributions. Then for each of the 40 virtual buildings of a given set, you may compute for instance the sum of distances to all other 39 virtuals buildings in your cluster. The most representative point of the set would be the one minimizing its sum of distances. This would be an equivalent of medians to distributions (considering that the median of a random variable X is the minimizer of the mean absolute error with respect to X) A limits of the median quickly appears: there are obvious cases of equality, for instance in the case of only two virtual building. (you may select at random?) But at least, you would opt for a real pattern, and not an average one.
