Can smoothing a histogram be considerd a kind of kernel density estimation?

Let's say that I would like to estimate a PDF of a random variable, and I obtained the histogram with 1000 bin. Subsequently, I smoothed the histogrm with a moving average filter of 5 taps. Is this similar to any type of kernel estimation?
