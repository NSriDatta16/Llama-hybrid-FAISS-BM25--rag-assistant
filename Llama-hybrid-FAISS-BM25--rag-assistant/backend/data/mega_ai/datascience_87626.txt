Xgboost : A variable specific Feature importance

I have a data set something like this: data = [['Alex',10,13,1,0],['Bob',11,14,12,0],['Clarke',13,15,13,1],['bob',12,15,1,1]] df = pd.DataFrame(data,columns = ["dealer","x","y","z","loss"]) I am trying to predict binary column loss, I have done this xgboost model. I got Overall feature importance. Now I need t op 5 most important features dealer wise . How to do that? I have tried to use lime package but it is only working for Random forest. If I get Feature importance for each observation(row) then also I can compute the feature importance dealer wise. kindly help Desired Output :
