Agree with other posters that it seems like a strange thing to want to do. Of course, if you really want to, there is (as always) an elegant way to do it in Python (2.6+): from itertools import product map("".join, product(*[['A', 'C'] if x == "M" else [x] for x in "GMTTMCA"])) Full solution with input handling: import sys from itertools import product base_globs = {"M":['A','C'], "R":['A','G'], "W":['A','T'], "S":['C','G'], "Y":['C','T'], "K":['G','T'], "V":['A','C','G'], "H":['A','C','T'], "D":['A','G','T'], "B":['C','G','T'], } def base_glob(glob_sequence): production_sequence = [base_globs.get(base, [base]) for base in glob_sequence] return map("".join, product(*production_sequence)) for line in sys.stdin.readlines(): productions = base_glob(line.strip()) print "\n".join(productions)
