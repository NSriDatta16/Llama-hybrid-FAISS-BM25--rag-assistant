calculations inside do while are not working properly

Inside this do while loop, the calculations to calculate yearly average and the yearly low average temps and yearly high average temps are not working properly. while (inFile.hasNext()) { //extract Month name from file month = inFile.next(); //Remove comma for better presentation String formatMonth = month.replace(',', ' '); //calculate high temperature from text file highTemp = inFile.nextDouble(); //extract low temperature file from text file lowTemp = inFile.nextDouble(); //Calculate averaget Temperature from values averageTemp = (highTemp + lowTemp)/2; //Calculate Range range = (highTemp - lowTemp); //Calculate low temperature minTemp = Math.min(minTemp, lowTemp); //Calculate high temperature maxTemp = Math.max(maxTemp, highTemp); //Sum up high temperatures highSum =+ highTemp; //Sum up low Temperatures lowSum =+ lowTemp; //calculate yearly sum yearlySum =+ averageTemp; //Calculate average of all the high temperatures totalAvgHigh = highSum/12; //Calculate average of all low temperatures totalAvgLow = lowSum/12; //Calculate the average of the years totalAvgYearly = yearlySum/12; //Calculate averge of the range totalRangeAvg = (highSum +lowSum)/12; System.out.println(formatMonth + " | " + highTemp + " | " + lowTemp + " | " + averageTemp + " | " + range ); outFile.println(formatMonth + " | " + highTemp + " | " + lowTemp + " | " + averageTemp + " | " + range ); } //Print out calculated values System.out.print("Average High Temps: " + totalAvgHigh + " Average Low Temps: " + totalAvgLow + " Total Average: " + totalAvgYearly + " Total Range Average: " + totalRangeAvg); System.out.println("High Temp " + maxTemp); System.out.println("Low Temp " + minTemp); outFile.print("Average High Temps: " + totalAvgHigh + " Average Low Temps: " + totalAvgLow + " Total Average: " + totalAvgYearly + " Total Range Average: " + totalRangeAvg); outFile.println("High Temp " + maxTemp); outFile.println("Low Temp " + minTemp); the output is this: enter code here: --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Month | High Temperature | Low Temperature | Average Temperature | Range --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- January | 72.0 | -12.0 | 30.0 | 84.0 February | 75.0 | -5.0 | 35.0 | 80.0 March | 80.0 | 8.0 | 44.0 | 72.0 April | 98.0 | 15.0 | 56.5 | 83.0 May | 98.0 | 29.0 | 63.5 | 69.0 June | 100.0 | 28.0 | 64.0 | 72.0 July | 103.0 | 48.0 | 75.5 | 55.0 August | 106.0 | 40.0 | 73.0 | 66.0 September | 102.0 | 35.0 | 68.5 | 67.0 October | 90.0 | 26.0 | 58.0 | 64.0 November | 85.0 | 14.0 | 49.5 | 71.0 December | 76.0 | -10.0 | 33.0 | 86.0 Average High Temps: 6.333333333333333 Average Low Temps: -0.8333333333333334 Total Average: 2.75 Total Range Average: 5.5High Temp 1.7976931348623157E308 Low Temp -12.0
