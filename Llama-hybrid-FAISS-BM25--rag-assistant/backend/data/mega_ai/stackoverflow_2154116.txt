Parsing a range of integers in a list

I've just began learning Python and I've ran into a small problem. I need to parse a text file, more specifically an HTML file (but it's syntax is so weird - divs after divs after divs, the result of a Google's 'View as HTML' for a certain PDF i can't seem to extract the text because it has a messy table done in m$ word). Anyway, I chose a rather low-level approach because i just need the data asap and since I'm beginning to learn Python, I figured learning the basics would do me some good too. I've got everything done except for a small part in which i need to retrieve a set of integers from a set of divs. Here's an example: *88 Now the numbers i want to retrieve all the ones inside (in that case, '588') and, since it's quite a messy file, i have to make sure that what I am getting is correct. To do so, that number inside must be preceded by "left:1020" , "left:1024" or "left:1028" . This is because of the automatic conversion and the best choice would be to get all the number preceded by left:102[0-] in my opinion. To do so, I was trying to use: for o in re.finditer('left:102[0-9]"> (.*?) ', words[index]) out = o.group(1) But so far, no such luck... How can I get those numbers? Thanks in advance, J.
