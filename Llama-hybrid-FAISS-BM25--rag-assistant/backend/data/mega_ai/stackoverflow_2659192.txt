How to organise my code in order to be able to use two different view type?

I have setup my models and now I would like to build the application so that I can easly switch between swing views and html views (2 differents builds). Could you recommand me any library that let me do that ? or a Controller/View architecture that let me do that myself ? edit: MVC architecture in java is the point of my question, if I use SWING my controller call the method of a View class to show the results, whereas (at least in python django) the controller returns a "View" class (and something takes care of rooting the resulting view to the user, possibly getting the view from cache directly if it's already there.) which is 2 different ways to implement MVC. I don't know how html views are sent to the user with Java (I suspect that there is different methods) that's why I'm asking the question to get the general idea behind MVC architecture in Java as it may have it's own ideomatic/reference interface to achieve this job.
