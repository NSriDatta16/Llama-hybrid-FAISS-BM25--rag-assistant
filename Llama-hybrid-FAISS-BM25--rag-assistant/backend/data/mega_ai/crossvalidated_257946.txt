How to choose the "family" in gbm.step?

I try to model species abundance data using the gbm.step function in R by Elith et al. 2008. In this function you have to choose a family aka loss function. There are several options: "gaussian" (for minimizing squared error) "laplace" (for minimizing absolute loss) "bernoulli" (logistic regression for 0-1 out-comes) "poisson" (count outcomes; requires the response to be a positive integer) (Look here: GBM: impact of the loss function ) As I work with proportional data ranging from 0% to 90% percentage cover of Lupinus nootkatensis (invasive plant species) in 1 gird cell of my abundance raster, gaussian or laplace are the two possibel choices to make. Laplace seems to be more robust against outliers. How do I decide between gaussian and laplace? Is there a rule or is the choice just a matter of taste?
