Can I model a trend and seasonal component for a stationary time series?

I modelled quarterly german inflationdata in a state space model with a stochastic level and stochastic seasonal. But now I recognized that I need a stationary time series because I have to compare it with a Arima in state space form. According to the Augmented Dickey Fuller test the time series is stationary but by looking at the acf a seasonal pattern is observable. I took the difference between Q1 in one year and Q1 in the previous years. My question now: Can I still model a stochastic level and stochastic seasonal to the stationary time series? As far as I know differencing removes trend and seasonality, which is why you can never have a model with a trend or seasonal component for a stationary time series, can you?
