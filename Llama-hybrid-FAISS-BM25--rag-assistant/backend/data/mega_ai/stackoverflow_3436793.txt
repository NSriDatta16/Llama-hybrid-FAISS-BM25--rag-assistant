I suggest looking up WOFF (Web Open Font Format). There should be various applications (at least one free web app) available for converting regular desktop fonts to WOFF. The only real obstacle to embedding any font you want are licensing restrictions, and that is what Typekit was created to solve. They provide a means to legally embed web fonts that they've obtained licensing rights for from type foundries—hence the subscription cost. You can do as Aillyn suggest if you can find free fonts that don't have such licensing restrictions, or you can acquire WOFF fonts that are licensed specifically for web use, and which are also compressed for faster loading. Alternately, you can convert your TrueType/OpenType fonts into WOFF and use any font you want, regardless of legality. However, the way Typekit embeds fonts is by embedding them directly in the CSS: @font-face { font-family: "bello-pro-1"; src: url(data:font/woff;base64,...=); font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; } —where ... is the WOFF file encoded in Base64. You can also do this yourself once you've acquired a WOFF font. There's no innate DRM in WOFF, so I'm not sure what has prompted font foundries to suddenly embrace web fonts through WOFF, but from what I've read from a few font designers, it appears that there might be some fundamental misunderstanding of how web pages work and what the "same-origin" policy actually implies.
