Modelling changes in a distribution over time

ggridges does a nice job of visualizing the change in a distribution over time. df % ggplot(aes(x = age, y = year, group = year)) + geom_density_ridges() Clearly the data is becoming less concentrated at 80, and expanding to people in the 50s-70s range. How would I go about modelling this change over time? Since I am dealing with ages, my data is discrete. I could run a time series for each age, but it seems like I would miss out on the overall trend. I would be particularly interested in any Bayesian methods that might accomplish this.
