I encourage you to read a post on the UAC team's blog regarding why startup applications are blocked from requiring elevation . One thing to consider: requiring elevation completely prevents standard users from using your app. The official guidance: your startup program should not require elevation. To be honest, I'm having difficulty imagining a scenario where you could legitimately require elevation in a startup app. Could you provide more details about why you need elevation?
