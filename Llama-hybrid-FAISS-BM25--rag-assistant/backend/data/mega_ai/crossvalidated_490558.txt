SVM can be used to generate predicted values, which can be used as estimates of propensity scores or potential outcomes, just like any other supervised machine learning method. It is not special in that regard. These predicted values can be used to estimate causal effects when other assumptions about the data-generating process are known. In addition, Ratkovic (2014) proposed a form of matching with SVM that can be used to estimate causal effects. The method is available in the R package SVMMatch . The method has received little attention.
