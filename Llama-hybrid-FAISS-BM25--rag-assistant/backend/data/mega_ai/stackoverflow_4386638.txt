Pointcut is what connects advices ("pure" code fragments that don't care where exactly it will be run) and join points (points of execution like method call or return, that don't care what code will be run). I would call pointcut a predicate function that chooses which join points are going to be used with current aspect (predicate that gives true/false for each join point for each advice).
