CustomValidator on User Control not working

I've set up a CustomValidator with a ClientValidationFunction as: I've set up my Javascript function as: function checkClients(sender, args) { if ($find(" ").get_items().get_count() > 0) { args.IsValid = true; } else { args.IsValid = false; } } I'm putting this all in a User Control which I'm dropping into a form on another page. When testing, the validation is firing and in fact the JS function is executed and works appropriately. However - the form is submitted whether IsValid is true or false. Like it's executing but not paying attention to the result. Any ideas?
