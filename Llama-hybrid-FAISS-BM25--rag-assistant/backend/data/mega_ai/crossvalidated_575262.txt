creating index using pca

i want to create an index. it has 3 subindices A,B,C. each subindex further consists of 3 different variables A1,A2,A3,B1,B2,B3 and so on. in total there are 9 variables. i want to assign weights using PCA. my question is do i assign weights to the variables A1,A2,A3 then aggregate to find an overall score for subindex A, repeat the process for subindex B and C and then assign weights to subindex A,B and C, or do i calculate it for all the variables combined together?
