What's the best way of skip N values of the iteration variable in Python?

In many languages we can do something like: for (int i = 0; i How can I do the same in Python? The following (of course) does not work: for i in xrange(value): if condition: i += 10 I could do something like this: i = 0 while i but I'm wondering if there is a more elegant ( pythonic? ) way of doing this in Python.
