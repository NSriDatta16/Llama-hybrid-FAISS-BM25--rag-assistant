Why does frequentist statistics have a reputation for not giving uncertainty?

We can compute confidence intervals in frequentist statistics. That gives us an indicator on how uncertain our estimate is. I've read numerous times that Bayesian statistics is way better because we can interpret the uncertainty of our model by observing the width of the posterior. That makes sense. But why does frequentist statistics have this profound reputation for not providing uncertainty estimates?
