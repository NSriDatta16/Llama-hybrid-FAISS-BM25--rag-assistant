Let me start off by presenting a possible solution that I just experimented with. I would like to encourage feedback and better solutions, however... Its not very neat, but I can append GET-style query parameters to the source URL of the popup: var popup = window.open("popup.html?" + identifier, somename, ""); Now in my particular situation, the popup is a view to some model identified by a unique ID, so the popup window can ask for the parent window for data related to that ID: var model = window.opener.getModel(document.location.href.split("?")[1]); do_something_with_model(model); This strategy won't work in all cases, especially when the data is not easily marshaled into the getModel() implementation. However, in my case, I think this approach may work. I'd appreciate feedback on this strategy. Thanks!
