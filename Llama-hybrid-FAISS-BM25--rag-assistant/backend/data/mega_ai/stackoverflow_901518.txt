I would avoid serialisation because it is a bit fragile, difficult to do safely and difficult to diagnose. You say it's a small project, so does the metadata really have to pass from client to server? Would you not be much better off very simply writing the metadata (really code) as Java code? (FWIW, my first commercial Java project was creating forms dynamically from a database specification (with regular additions). Previous to that I working with C++ running an interpreter for training systems. In both cases I would now (and for the last decade), have written them as Java. Don't be put off by people mumbling disapprovingly about "hardcoded".)
