Almost certainly your bosses tests are system tests pretending to be unit tests. If they are suppsoed to be unit tests and are just slow they should be refactored to use mocks so that they run quicker. Anyway, a more pragmatic and diplomatic approach than confronting your boss over this might be to just try and run the faster ones yourself. I've seen a hack to do this in a project where slow tests had SytemTest in their names. Then there were two ant targets created in the build file. One that ran all tests and one that filtered out by class name the SytemTest s . To implement this all you would have to do is rename some of the tests and write your ant target.
