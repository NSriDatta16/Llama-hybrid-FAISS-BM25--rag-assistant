Well value types are not supported. Implication and the reason behind, as far as I know, mainly involves the difference in storage of arrays. Let's imagine we have: Byte[] bb = new Byte[20]; byte b = 255; bb[0] = b; // here value is copied into the array b = 128; Console.WriteLine(bb[0]); // will print 255 So changing the b does not change the value we have assigned and this is expected. But what if we do something like this: object[] bb = new Byte[20]; // throws exception System treats object arrays differently and stores the pointer and not the value. We actually have only one type of object array (from the structure point of view not type) and that is pointer array while arrays for value types store the value.
