Infinite dice roll probability

The following is an interview question: Two players A and B play a game rolling a fair die. If A rolls a 1, they immediately reroll, and if the reroll is less than 4 then A wins. Otherwise, B rolls. If B rolls a 6, they win, otherwise A rolls again, and so on. What is the probability A wins? My approach: I have 4 states S (initial starting state), 1, 1-{1,2,3}, 6, and this is my markov chain matrix $ \begin{array}{c|cccc} & \text{S} & \text{1} & \text{1-{1,2,3}} & \text{6} \\ \hline \text{S} & 4/6 & 1/6 & 0 & 1/6 \\ \text{1} & 33/36 & 0 & 3/36 & 0 \\ \text{1-{1,2,3}} & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ \text{6} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\ \end{array} $ Using this I calculate probability of absorption to state 1-{1,2,3} and get 0.0769. Is this matrix the right set up? And is there a simpler way of doing this? Thank you!
