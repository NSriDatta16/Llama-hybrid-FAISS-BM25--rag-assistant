Is it better to use MAE or MSE for perfomance measure?

My data set is about forest fires in Portugal. I want to define a model that can predict better wildfires. In my data set, the outliers are entries referring to big fires. What is the best performance measure in this situation? I'm using the model SVM, which is the one that gives me a lower value of MAE but with RandomForest i get better values of MSE and NMSE. I don't know what is the best in this situation. Thanks for your help.
