Conditional Distribution in logistic regression

In a logistic regression, given that $\pi_i=Pr(Y_i=1|X_i=x_i)=\dfrac{\text{exp}(\beta_0+\beta_1 x_i)}{1+\text{exp}(\beta_0+\beta_1 x_i)}$, is it correct to say that logistic regression assumes that the conditional distribution $f(Y|X) \sim Logistic$?
