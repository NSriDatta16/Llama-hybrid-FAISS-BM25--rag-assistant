Can machine learning learn a function like finding maximum from a list?

I have an input which is a list and the output is the maximum of the elements of the input-list. Can machine learning learn such a function which always selects the maximum of the input-elements present in the input? This might seem as a pretty basic question but it might give me an understanding of what machine learning can do in general. Thanks!
