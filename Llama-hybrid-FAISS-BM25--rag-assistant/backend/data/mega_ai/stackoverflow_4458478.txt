Where to place view specific logic in a project structure?

I'm adding some code to my project that allows drag and drop. The Form used for the actual dropping is obviously part of the view/presentation layer. However, there's a question mark on a TransferHandler class that contains the actual logic which detects and validates objects dropped on the window. Considering I have presentation, logic and data layers, where could this class be placed in the structure?
