These models are a class of generalized linear models (GLMs) using cumulative links to borrow information across several possible polytomous groups when the usual probability model for such an outcome has a restrictive support (e.g. 0/1 responses). Ordinal logistic regression is a popular method for analyzing ordinal response variables. Ordinal responses are variables that can be ranked in terms of the relative severity or intensity of associated response, but there may be no associated units or conventional scale to relate differences meaningfully across groups. Examples of ordinal variables include Likert responses about inclination toward voting for a political candidate, pain severity scales, or ECOG status. Ordinal logistic regression employs a cumulative link where a separate likelihood is generated comparing thresholds at each possible value of the ordinal response and jointly fitting logistic regression models for each threshold, having common odds ratios but differing intercepts for each likelihood. The odds ratio(s) is/are then interpreted as the ratio of odds for an incrementally higher ordinal response for a unit difference in the fitted variable(s). Valid and alternative approaches to analyzing data from a similar setting include a linear regression model treating ordinal outcomes as a direct numeric value. The slope parameter(s) are then interpreted as the expected difference in ordinal responses comparing groups differing by 1 unit in the covariate(s). Alternately, a single thresholded binary outcome can be estimates from a standard logistic regression model for this purpose. Literature references; Wooldridge, J. M. (2002).
