SQL Server Reporting Services - Fast TimeDataRetrieval - Long TimeProcessing

An application that I support has recently begun experiencing extended periods of time required to execute a report in SQL Server Reporting Services. The reports that are being executed are not terribly complex. There are multiple stored procedures (between 5 and 8) which return anywhere from a handful to 8000 records total. Reports are generally from 2 to 100 pages. One can argue (and I have) the benefit of a 100 page report, but the client is footing the bill. At any rate, the problem is that even the reports with 500 records (11 pages) being returned takes 5 minutes to return to the browser. In the execution log the TimeDataRetrieval is 60 seconds, but the TimeProcessing is 235 seconds. It seems bizarre to me that my query runs so quickly, but it takes Reporting Services so long to process the data. Any suggestions are greatly appreciated. Kind Regards, Bernie
