It depends. Some algorithms, for example ID3 are able to handle categorical variables. Other, like CART algorithm are not. There are two basic approaches to encode categorical data as continuous. One-hot encoding Mean encoding One-hot encoding is pretty straightforward and is implemented in most software packages. The drawback is that it runs into problems if you have many categories (because the number of encoding dimensions is equal to number of categories). Mean encoding (also sometimes called target encoding) consists of encoding categories with means of target (for example in regression if you have classes 0 and 1 then class 0 is encoded by mean of response for examples with 0 and so on). There are some answers on this site on that which provide more detail. I also encourage you to see this video if you want to get more about how it works and how you can implement it (there are several ways that to do mean encoding and each has its pros and cons). In Python you can do mean encoding yourself (some approaches are shown in the video from the series I linked) or you can try Category Encoders from scikit-learn contrib.
