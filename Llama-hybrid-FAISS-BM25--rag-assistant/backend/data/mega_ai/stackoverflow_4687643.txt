How do games like GTA IV not fragment the heap?

I'm interested in the type of memory management a game like GTA IV might use given that it needs to create and delete lots of objects very quickly. How do the avoid fragmenting the heap and other things. If someone could point me in the right direction I'd really appreciate it.
