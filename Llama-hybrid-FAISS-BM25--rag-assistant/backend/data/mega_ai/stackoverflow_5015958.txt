A cache is a data-access mechanism that involves temporarily storing data in places that are faster to access than the original storage location. data can be machine code instructions, images, documents, or web pages, for example. The purpose of a cache is to reduce access time, bandwidth usage, server load, and perceived lag. Different applications where cache mechanisms are used include: CPU Cache (see also cpu-cache ) Disk Cache (see also diskcache ) Web Cache (see also browser-cache , or specific frameworks like memcached , apc , etc.) Useful Links Wikipedia page on caching Wikipedia article on web caches
