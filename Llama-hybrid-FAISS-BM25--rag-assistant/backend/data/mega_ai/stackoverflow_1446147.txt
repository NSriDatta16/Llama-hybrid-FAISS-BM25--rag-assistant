Considering that the structs don't have at least a similar layout, there are limited ways to accomplish this, neither are short or elegant: Use a hash table instead of structs to store your data . Doing so will make it possible to access fields with their name as the key in the hashtable, regardless of the actual type. This requires a lot of trouble in C, and only if you need to access say, a hundred fields, I wouldn't recommend it. Stick to strong typing and update the fields distinctly . Yeah, it's what you don't want, but for a moderate amount of fields this might be ok. Use a macro as others suggested . However I think it's best to avoid macros whenever possible. It isn't worth it. It is not easy nor good to hack something like this together in C (there is no duck typing). This is a typical example where a dynamic language would be more comfortable (maybe you could call python from your code? :) )
