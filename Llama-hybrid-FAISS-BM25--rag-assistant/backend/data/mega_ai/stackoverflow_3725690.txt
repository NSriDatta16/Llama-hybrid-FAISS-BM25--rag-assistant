NSDate for first day of the month

This is quite a simple concept, but as of yet I have been unable to find an elegant (and calendar locale independent) solution. I need to find the first day of the month for an arbitrary NSDate . For example, given an arbitrary NSDate ( arbitraryDate ) another NSDate object will be returned (let's call this firstDayOfMonthDate ) which represents the first day of the month in arbitraryDate . The time component does not matter, as I just need the NSDate object for the first day of the month (although for neatness it would be useful if the time was just zeroed out). Thanks in advance for any assistance.
