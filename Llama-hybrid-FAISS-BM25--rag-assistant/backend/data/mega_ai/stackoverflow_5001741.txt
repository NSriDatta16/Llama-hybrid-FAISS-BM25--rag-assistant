Well output is a List. Since you have coded Example as a method, which returns a list, to access it you need to call it using method syntax with empty parentheses. The return value is an instance of a List . If you hit the decimal point after typing Example() you will see in intellisense the members of this object. One of them will show as square brackets like this [] . this is the member you need to use to access whatever you have put in the list. The values you would provide are zero-based, that is they start at zero (for the first item in the list), and increase from there. So to access the first item in the list, you would write: Debug.WriteLine(Example()[1]); using the square brackets, not parentheses. You still need the parentheses in Example(), because it is a method... If you recoded it as a property: public List Example { get { ManagementObjectSearcher searcher = new ManagementObjectSearcher("root\\WMI", "SELECT * FROM MSStorageDriver_FailurePredictStatus"); List output = new List (); foreach (ManagementObject queryObj in searcher.Get()) output.Add(System.Convert.ToString(queryObj["InstanceName"])); return output; } } Then you would not need those parentheses and could just write Debug.WriteLine(Example[1]);
