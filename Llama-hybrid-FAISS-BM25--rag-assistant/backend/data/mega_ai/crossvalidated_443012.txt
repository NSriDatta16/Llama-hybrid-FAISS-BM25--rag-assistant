Image classifier from text files

I have a data set of thousands of images of hundreds of pixels in gray scale ranging from -1 to 1. The labels represent 0 to 9. The issue is that the data set is in .txt format. How can one make an image classifier using CNN without pictures but only .txt format ? I'm not sure what to do with the data set. I need help in so far as I never did any image classifier. How could I break down the problem into smaller problems in order to solve this ? What are the steps involved ?
