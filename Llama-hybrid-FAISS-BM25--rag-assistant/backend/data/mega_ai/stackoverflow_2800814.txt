How do I use VS2010 One-Click Publish (MsDeploy) to deploy remotely from the command line?

On the remote web server I have installed the remote service http://x.x.x.x/MsDeployAgentService . If I use the Web Application Project's Publish command in VS2010 I can successfully publish to this remote web server and update a specific IIS website. What I want to do now is execute this capability from the command line. I am guessing it is two steps. First build the web application project using the relevant build configuration: msbuild "C:\MyApplication\MyWebApplication.csproj" /T:Package /P:Configuration=Release Then issue the MsDeploy command to have it publish/sync with the remove IIS server: msdeploy -verb:sync -source:package="C:\MyApplication\obj\Release\Package\MyWebApplication.zip" -dest:contentPath="My Production Website", computerName=http://x.x.x.x/MsDeployAgentService, username=adminuser,password=adminpassword Unfortunately I get an the error: Error: (10/05/2010 3:52:02 PM) An error occurred when the request was processed on the remote computer. Error: Source (sitemanifest) and destination (contentPath) are not compatible for the given operation. Error count: 1. I have tried a number of different combinations for destination provider but no joy :( Has anyone managed to replicate VS2010 Web Application Project "One Click" Publish from the command line?
