Here we go: So the first 128 characters (US-ASCII) need one byte. The next 1,920 characters need two bytes to encode. This includes Latin letters with diacritics and characters from Greek, Cyrillic, Coptic, Armenian, Hebrew, Arabic, Syriac and TƒÅna alphabets. Three bytes are needed for the rest of the Basic Multilingual Plane (which contains virtually all characters in common use). Four bytes are needed for characters in the other planes of Unicode, which include less common CJK characters and various historic scripts. More details: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mapping_of_Unicode_character_planes , Basic Multilingual Plane, Codes from 0x8000. Some examples: Indic scripts, Thai, Philippine scripts, Hiragana, Katakana. So all East Asia scripts and some other.
