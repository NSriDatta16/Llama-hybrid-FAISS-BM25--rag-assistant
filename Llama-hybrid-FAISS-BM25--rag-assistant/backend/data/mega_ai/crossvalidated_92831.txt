Clarification in information geometry

This question is concerned with the paper Differential Geometry of Curved Exponential Families-Curvatures and Information Loss by Amari. The text goes as follows. Let $S^n=\{p_{\theta}\}$ be an $n$-dimensional manifold of probability distributions with a coordinate system $\theta=(\theta_1,\dots,\theta_n)$, where $p_{\theta}(x)>0$ is assumed... We may regard every point $\theta$ of $S^n$ as carrying a function $\log p_{\theta}(x)$ of $x$... Let $T_{\theta}$ be the tangent space of $S^n$ at $\theta$, which is, roughly speaking, identified with a linearized version of a small neighborhood of $\theta$ in $S^n$. Let $e_i(\theta), i=1,\dots,n$ be the natural basis of $T_{\theta}$ associated with the coordinated system... Since each point $\theta$ of $S^n$ carries a function $\log p_{\theta}(x)$ of $x$, it is natural to regard $e_i(\theta)$ at $\theta$ as representing the function $$e_i(\theta)=\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta_i}\log p_{\theta}(x).$$ I don't understand the last statement. This appears in section 2 of the above mentioned paper. How's the basis of the tangent space are given by the above equation? It would be helpful if someone in this community familiar with this kind of material can help me understand this. Thanks. Update 1: Although I agree that (from @aginensky) if $\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta_i}p_{\theta}$ are linearly independent then $\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta_i}\log p_{\theta}$ are also linearly independent, how these are members of the tangent space in the first place is not very clear. So how can $\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta_i}\log p_{\theta}$ be considered as basis for the tangent space. Any help is appreciated. Update 2: @aginensky: In his book Amari says the following: Let us consider the case where $S^n=\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{X})$, the set of all (strictly) positive probability measures on $\mathcal{X}=\{x_0,\dots,x_n\}$, where we regard $\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{X})$ as a subset of $\mathbb{R}^{\mathcal{X}}=\{X\big|X:\mathcal{X}\to \mathbb{R}\}$. In fact, $\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{X})$ is an open subset of the affine space $\{X\big |\sum_x X(x)=1\}$. Then the tangent space $T_p(S^n)$ of $S^n$ at every point can naturally be identified with the linear subspace $\mathcal{A}_0=\{X\big |\sum_x X(x)=0\}$. For the natural basis $\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta_i}$ of a coordiante system $\theta=(\theta_1,\dots,\theta_n)$, we have $(\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta_i})_{\theta}=\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta_i}p_{\theta}$. Next, let us take another embedding $p\mapsto \log p$, and identify $S^n$ with the subset $\log S^n:=\{\log p\big |p\in S^n\}$ of $\mathbb{R}^{\mathcal{X}}$. A tangent vector $X\in T_p(S^n)$ is then represented by the result of operating $X$ to $p\mapsto \log p$, which we denote by $X^{(e)}$. In particular we have $(\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta_i})_{\theta}^{(e)}=\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta_i}\log p_{\theta}$. It is obvious that $X^{(e)}=X(x)/p(x)$ and that $$T_p^{(e)}(S^n)=\{X^{(e)}\big |X\in T_p(S^n)\}=\{A\in \mathbb{R}^{\mathcal{X}}\big |\sum_x A(x)p(x)=0\}.$$ My question: If both $\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta_i}$ and $(\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta_i})^{(e)}$ are basis for the tangent space then would this not contradict the fact that $T_p$ and $T_p^{(e)}$ are distinct and $\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta_i}^{(e)}\in T_p^{(e)}$? I guess there seems to be an association between ($S^n,T_p$) and $(\log S^n,T_p^{(e)})$. If you can clarify this, it would be of great help. You may give it as an answer.
