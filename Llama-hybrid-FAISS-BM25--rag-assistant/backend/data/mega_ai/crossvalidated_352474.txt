In order to correctly interpret the acf/pacf one often needs to have an observed series that has no pulses has no level/step shifts has no deterministic trends has no seasonal pulses has constant error variance over time. Post your data and we will see what your data knows. Sample size comes into play in aiding the interpretation of the acf/pacf . EDITED AFTER RECEIPT OF DATA: Time series analysis requires equally spaced observations with NO missing observations .... your are not equally spaced BUT nearly so ..thus I continue . A useful model for your 25 observations is here (3,0,0) with 1 pulse outlier at period 25 . More statistics are here . The one anomaly at period 25 somewhat clouded your identification scheme. AUTOBOX my tool of choice autonatically identified and adjusted the anomaly ... an easily suggested the AR(3) model Here are the residuals from the model and their acf . The Actual/Fit and Forecast graph is here with forecasts here for the next 12 periods Model identification without considering anomalies is quite limited and misleading see I have correlogram ACF and PACF below for a temperature time series. Can I say it is MA(2) from ACF? What about AR? for a discussion of this.
