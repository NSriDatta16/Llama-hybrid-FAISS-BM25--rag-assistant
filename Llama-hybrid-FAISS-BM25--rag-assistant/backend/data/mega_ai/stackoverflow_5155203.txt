Sproutcore Datastore Local Storage sync

I was wondering if it is possible to sync the Sproutcore Datastore (in-memory) with a choice of browser storage mechanisms such as WebSQL, localStorage etc. I do know about SC.UserDefaults but my use case is not about saving app-level or user-level settings. If there is no such in-built way to achieve this, is there a project attempting to do this somewhere that I could fork?
