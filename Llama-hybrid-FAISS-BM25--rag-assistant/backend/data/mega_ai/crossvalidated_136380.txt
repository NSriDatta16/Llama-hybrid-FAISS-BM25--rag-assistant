The prominent feature of the original is the weekly sums. The individual values are meaningful only after you've learned the colors, and I imagine that's a big reason the plot doesn't work for new viewers. Related to that, the time aspect of the days is lost. A sequential set of colors may help (e.g., 7 shades of blue). I normally don't care to label every item -- are the exact values that important? The graph isn't doing its job if you can't interpret it without every value labeled. On to my try . Given the apparent importance of the weekly sums, I've plotted the weekly cumulative sums. It shows the weekly sums and the days in time order. Exact day values are less clear, but outlier values will still stand out. For these kinds of small line plots (which could be reduced to sparkline size) it's helpful to have a reference line or area. For illustration, I've added a target range. If a target is not appropriate, then the reference could be something like the range over the last three weeks or some fixed reference value. I've used red to indicate which weeks were below target for quick scanning. With a lot more weeks, you might organize them into a grid rather than a vertical list.
