The Google Docs embedding in iframes via the viewer is problematic in IE8 if not already cached, and is is just not equal to the much better Scribd's facility that allows you to simply make a simple html page with the document embeded via their supplied object code for the document. I then use it as the source file for my iframe. It shows the print (and also a full screen button), right in the embedded frame page. Much more friendly and reliable for the page's visitors.
