This is a bug with the Skia graphics library that is leveraged by Chrome. It's reproduceable in Windows and Linux... but as of today, it's fixed and available in the dev channel! (It'll be between 4 and 10 weeks when it goes to everyone in the stable channel) More details: http://paulirish.com/2011/chrome-inset-box-shadow-bug-fixed/
