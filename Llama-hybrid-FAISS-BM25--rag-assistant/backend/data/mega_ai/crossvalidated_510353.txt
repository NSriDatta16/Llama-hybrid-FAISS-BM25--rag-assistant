Simply correcting OLS standard error in time series context

In microeconometrics, it is sometimes advised to always use heteroscedasticity-robust standard error (instead of testing for heteroscedasticity and using generalized or weighted least squares or something else). This is the case because heteroscedasticity or autocorrelation / serial correlation affects the interval estimates only but not the point estimates. If I am applying OLS in a time series context, is there a similar advise to simply address autocorrelation (even if disputed)? does it depend on whether the time series is short or long (small vs large T)? I asked a similar question before , but this one is much more specific to the time series context, and I am happy even with suggestions not every agrees with.
