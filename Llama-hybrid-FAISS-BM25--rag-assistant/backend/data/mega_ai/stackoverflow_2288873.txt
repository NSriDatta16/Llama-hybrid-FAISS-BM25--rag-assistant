Why are you concerned? I don't see an issue with any I/O for getting the unread threads. It doesn't have to be live. A 15 minute delay based on a cache value would work. So for unread threads you just Pseudo code.. $result = SELECT id,viewcount from my_forum_threads $cache->setThreads($result['id'],$result['viewcount']); Then on a page load you just get the cache values rather than querying the database again. Its really not a big issue at all. The average page on my website takes 20 mysql queries. When I cache it is only two to four queries.
