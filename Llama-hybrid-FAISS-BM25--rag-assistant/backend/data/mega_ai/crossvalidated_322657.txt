How does an individual feature affect predictions in neural network classification problem?

In the literature, I've come across statements like " People with higher income and with long working hours are more likely to be diagnosed with chronic diseases such as stroke ". The above-mentioned study (p. 8) explores the association between behavioral habits and chronic diseases using ANN. I am unable to figure out how to make such conclusions with feature study in neural networks or other machine learning techniques. Secondly, is there a way to quantify the likelihood in ANN similar to logistic regression wherein regression coefficients give the change in the log odds of the outcome for a one unit increase in the predictor variable?
