How to calculate pedigree function in diabetes prediction?

I am developing a model for diabetes prediction using this dataset using Logistic Regression . I have completed the model and my input variables are - Pregnancies, Glucose, blood pressure, BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction etc. The model gives an accuracy of 78% which is quite good for me. Now when I predict new values which are not in the dataset I have all the required inputs except Pedigree function . I searched for it and I understand what it is but how can I calculate that?
