You have data that is recorded every minute (60) for 24 hours for 10 days for 5 sites. Just because you have readings every minute doesn't mean you need to forecast at that level of granularity. It complicates the analysis significaantly due to the three possible levels of seasonality (minute/hour/day). I suggest that you initially forecast at the hourly level thus significantly reducing the analytics. In this way your data csv file could contain readings for the hourly values i.e. 24 per day (:00 readings). Time series analysis leans heavily/requires one having readings at each and every period and care must be taken to verify that. I found that your csv file seemed to have a flaw in that regard as there was no record for hour 2:00 for day 8/30 thus any analysis of the time dependent structure would be flawed. There may be other occurences of this so please check your data carefully . Please resubmit a corrected csv file and I will attempt to model hour-of-the-day and day-of-the-week effects taking into account any level shifts and/or outliers. Since you only have 10 days any holiday effects would be not-identifiable. Normally in cases like this we suggest 3+ years of daily observations at the hourly level in order to assess holiday event activity. If other activity is known to have occurred (special one-off variables) then the user should include that information to keep the software free of unwanted outlier detection. Since this is a demonstration of what should/could be done you can limit your data set to just 1 site to illustrate the art-of-the-possible and how you might proceed. EDITED AFTER RECEIPT OF CORRECTED DATA: The data set contains 145 values (7 on day 0 and then 11 full days of 12 hourly values starting at day1/AUG28/Friday followed with 6 values for day12/Tuesday ). The first 7 values were discarded as being part of a day thus the 138 vales reflect 12 readings for 11 days plus 6 for today Sept 8/Tuesday was used. Thus the data used started at hour 1. A scan of the historical data suggested either a level shift lasting two days (observations 49-72) or a Tuesday/Wednesday effect (day 5 and 6). It is impossible just having 11 complete days to conclude either way. On the off chance that this was a Tuesday/Wednesday effect rather than a step/level shift , AUTOBOX ( my software of choice ) was set up to consider daily effects and to automatically develop a model and to predict out the next 24 hours (6 for today(Tuesday/12 for tomorrow(Wednesday)/6 for (Thursday). Here is the Actual/Fit/Forecast graph . The Forecasts are here and here The model is a hybrid causal/ARIMA/pulse detected example ..here and here and here . The plot of the residuals suggests randomness and is confirmed with the acf of the residuals
