Why use factor graph for Bayesian inference?

I don't understand why converting a Bayesian network into a factor graph is good for Bayesian inference? My questions are: What is the benefit of using factor graph in Bayesian reasoning? What would happen if we don't use it? Any concrete examples will be appreciated!
