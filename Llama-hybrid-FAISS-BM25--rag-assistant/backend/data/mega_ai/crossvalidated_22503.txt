Estimators for Bernoulli trials

I have failure data for an experience over $T$ years: at the beginning of each year I have $n_t$ subjects and $d_t$ of these subjects experience a "failure" at the end of the year. Now if I assume that the trials are iid Binomial and the probability of failure $p$ is homogenous (i.e. constant over time), the ML estimator is given by $$\hat{p}=\frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^T d_t}{\sum\limits_{i=1}^T n_t}$$ However, there is an alternate estimator: $$\bar{p}=\frac{1}{T}\sum\limits_{i=1}^T \frac{d_t}{n_t}.$$ What would be the assumptions and the model so that the estimate is $\bar{p}$? =========================== EDIT: The question is not about the relative merits of the two estimators. For example, it is not necessary to assume homogeneity for the second estimator. I am wondering about the assumptions that would "naturally" lead to the second estimator. =========================== EDIT2: I am in a situation where $\bar{p}$ is imposed as an estimator. I need to come up with confidence intervals or credible intervals for the estimate. My idea was to determine the assumptions (possibly a hierarchical model) and do a MCMC using JAGS ...
