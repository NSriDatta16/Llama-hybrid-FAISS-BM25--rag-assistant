JQuery Change Event Loop

I have several checkboxes. If a user checks any of them, I have to see if they are allowed to do that, if not, notify them and uncheck it. However, this get me in a loop as it triggers the change again! How can I over come this? $('#step_1, #step_2, #step_3, #step_4').change(function(event) { if(!$('#section_2_active').attr('checked')){ alert('You can not select output options when "Create Output" has not been selected.'); $(this).attr('checked', false); $('#other_stages :checkbox:not(#section_2_active, #co_t)').change(); } }); I can not unbind and then rebind the change event as there is another plugin that is reliant on this event. What other options do I have? I can attach a function call to each checkbox but I am hoping for something a bit more elegant, if not, I will default to this. Thanks all for any help
