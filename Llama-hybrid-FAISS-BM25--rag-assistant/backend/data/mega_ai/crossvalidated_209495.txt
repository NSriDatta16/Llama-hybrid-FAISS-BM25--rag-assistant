Multinomial Logistic Regression aka Softmax Regression

In optimization point of view of generalized linear modeling, there is a transfer function that maps a linear score to a final target. There is also a loss function that is minimized in training to obtain the parameter. Considering multinomial logistic regression , I am trying to figure out these two functions. Are both the loss and transfer functions, considered to be -softmax in softmax regression? If not what is each of them? Aslo is the loss function convex in parameter? Finally is there any relation between CRFs and softmax regression models?
