Significance of intercept only in Logistic Regression analysis

Having performanced a logistic regression in R with the glm function, I'm not sure how to interpret the results for the Intercept (as shown below). So I found that my intercept is significant but all the predictors coefficients was non significant, May I consider that the intercept significance give us any inference about the relationship between variables? Call: glm(formula = Sales~ Service, family = binomial, data = train) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.4337 -1.4337 0.9411 0.9411 0.9411 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 0.5849 0.1998 2.927 0.00342 ** Service2 -17.1510 1696.7344 -0.010 0.99193 Service3 15.9811 2399.5447 0.007 0.99469 --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 (Dispersion parameter for binomial family taken to be 1) Null deviance: 147.13 on 111 degrees of freedom Residual deviance: 142.17 on 109 degrees of freedom AIC: 148.17 Number of Fisher Scoring iterations: 15 I decided to perform the Hypothesis Test on the same data and I found that there is a relationship between the two variables, then I can reject the null hypothesis H0 because the p-value is less than small threshold (0,05). Welch Two Sample t-test data: sales and service t = -9.6086, df = 215.53, p-value If There is a relationship between the variables why when I use gml function in my model the dependent variables return insignificant? Additional: My dataset Service Sales 1 2 3 0 56 3 0 1 100 0 1
