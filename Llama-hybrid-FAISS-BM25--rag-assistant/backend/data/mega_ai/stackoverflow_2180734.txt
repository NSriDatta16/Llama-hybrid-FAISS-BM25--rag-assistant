In the question I mention a blog post containing a possible solution. That solution works, but entails changes to generated code, which is obviously as fragile as a solution gets. Here's a robust way to apply the solution: change the code generator. On the EDMX designer surface right-click for the context menu and choose Add Code Generation Items... Try to improve on "Model1.tt" as a name and save the TT file. Open the TT file. Search for "return (" to directly find the method template you need to change. Edit as shown. Rebuild the solution. Change this return /* big hairy expression */; to this var entity = /* big hairy expression */; if (!entity.IsLoaded) entity.Load(); return entity;
