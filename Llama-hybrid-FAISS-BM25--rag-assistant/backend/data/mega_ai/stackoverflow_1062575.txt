I suspect that "it doesn't matter". Jeff Atwood's got a great post about micro optimizations: The Sad Tragedy of Micro-Optimization Theater (while not the same as what you're doing, it highlights the fact that spending time on certain "optimizations" just isn't worth it). As others have already pointed out profile your code and the different methods and see the results for your application. My gut feel is that you won't see a heck of a lot of difference between the various methods, unless you've got a very big control hierarchy or a whole bunch of text that you're manipulating. I'd say the most important thing to do is ensure that you have a maintainable solution. One option would be writing your own server control that can be embedded in your SEO optimized pages.
