Depending on the kind (and amount) of searches you'll be doing, you might need to consider using something else than pure-MySQL for that. MySQL by itself is not quite well-suited when it comes to fulltext search : Using like '%...%' will result in bad performances (scanning all the lines of your table) Using a FULLTEXT index means using MyISAM as storage engine. If you need to do a lot of searches, it might become more interesting to invest in a solution dedicated to indexing/searching through text, like Solr , or Sphinx .
