As you mentioned, MySQL is just a database. You could in theory use Oracle or SQL Server or PostgreSQL, which are all MySQL's "competitors", if you will, in the database space. What's generally done is that there is a program that sits alongside the web server on the box that reads the content from the database and then translates that content into HTML, where it's served up to you as a web page. This program is usually referred to as a Content Management System or "CMS" (You might want to Wikipedia for "Drupal", which is one popular CMS out there). Web pages are rarely stored as whole HTML files in MySQL. Usually what's done is that the content (paragraphs of text, comments on a blog, upvotes and downvotes) are stored in some structured format, and the CMS takes that structured data from the database and presents it to you. The upshot of structuring the data in this way is that end-users who want to update content don't have to worry about coding the HTML -- they just write their content and the CMS takes care of the presentation bits.
