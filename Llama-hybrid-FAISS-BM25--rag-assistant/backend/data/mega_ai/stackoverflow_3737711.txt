Why doesn't Array's == function return true for Array(1,2) == Array(1,2)?

In Programming in Scala the authors write that Scala's == function compares value equality instead of reference equality. This works as expected on lists: scala> List(1,2) == List(1,2) res0: Boolean = true It doesn't however work on arrays: scala> Array(1,2) == Array(1,2) res1: Boolean = false The authors recommend to use the sameElements function instead: scala> Array(1,2).sameElements(Array(1,2)) res2: Boolean = true As an explanation they write: While this may seem like an inconsistency, encouraging an explicit test of the equality of two mutable data structures is a conservative approach on the part of the language designers. In the long run, it should save you from unexpected results in your conditionals. What does this mean? What kind of unexpected results are they talking about? What else could I expect from an array comparison than to return true if the arrays contain the same elements in the same position? Why does the equals function work on List but not on Array ? How can I make the equals function work on arrays?
