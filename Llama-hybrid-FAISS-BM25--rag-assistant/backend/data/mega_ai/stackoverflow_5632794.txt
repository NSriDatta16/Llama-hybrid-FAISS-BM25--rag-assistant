The following code is cross-browser compatible. You can control the indent of the fieldset legend independently. In padding the fieldset you also indent the legend. While this may be the desired effect in some cases, the following method offers more flexibility. Also adding the margin to the inner div will give you better control of your layout (because adding padding to a container can add unwanted width). http://jsfiddle.net/nRAGM/35/ fieldset { border: 2px solid silver; } fieldset legend { border: 2px solid silver; margin-left: 30px; } fieldset div { border: 1px dotted silver; margin: 30px; }
