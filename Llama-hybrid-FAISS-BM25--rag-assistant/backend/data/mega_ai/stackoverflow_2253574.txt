shaking on 3.0 in a UITableViewController

after reading some posts about implementing shaking on 3.0, I think I get the idea but I'm not getting any call to the: motionBegan motionEnded motionCancelled this is an example of what I've read: how to detect and program around shakes for the iphone I'm sure I've added the [self becomeFirstResponder]; and the -(BOOL)canBecomeFirstResponder { NSLog(@"First responder"); return YES; } Should I enable a special delegate for those events ? I understand that those events are controlled by the system, and they are passed to the first responder, and go on ... any idea ? thanks, r.
