If you want to predict at locations where you don't have data, and you assume that there is a continuous surface of your variable of interest (ie it is defined at all locations) then you can use kriging, but you'll need to be careful with 30M points. Otherwise inverse distance weighting (IDW) will do it but without uncertainty prediction since its not model-based, although you can use IDW with a variable distance coefficient and optimise by cross-validation. Or regress the value at X on the K-nearest neighbours. There's a whole world of spatial statistical modelling out there. Questions are probably best asked on the stats.stackexchange.com site though, since what you have a is a statistical problem and not a data science one.
