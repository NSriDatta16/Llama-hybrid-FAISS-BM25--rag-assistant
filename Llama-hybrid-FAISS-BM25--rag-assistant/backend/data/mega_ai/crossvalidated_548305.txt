Time series to forecast a probability

I'm looking to forecast a time series, that is, forecast the next period give historical time series data. At the end of the day, what I want is to forecast a probability. The metric that I'm forecasting follows the beta distribution and so, the parameter that I am working with are alpha and beta. What I have tried so far, is a SARIMA model for each parameters separately, and then combining the two afterwards to create a probability. The issue that I keep running into with regression frameworks is getting results that are above 1 or below 0. Is there perhaps a better way to do this? Furthermore, I'm working in Python for this, so for the sake of keeping things not too complex I would say that I don't have much of an ability to perform a beta regression.
