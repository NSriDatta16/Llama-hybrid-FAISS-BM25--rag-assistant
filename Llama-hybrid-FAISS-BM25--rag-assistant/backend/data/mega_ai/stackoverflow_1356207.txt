Commons Digester add Singleton Object

I Have a XML and I am using commons-digester1.8 to create a object of my bean. My bean contains a reference to another Bean which is singleton. Is there any way I can create/get the reference of singleton object and get my bean populated. My xml contains tag and for this tag bean has Language.class reference. Language.class is singleton and to get the instance of Language.class , I have to call getInstance(String name) of language class. But When I try d.addObjectCreate("rights/language",Language.class); d.addCallMethod("rights/language", "getInstance",1); d.addCallParam("rights/language",0); It gives an error. Is there a way to achieve this. Thanks, Gagan
