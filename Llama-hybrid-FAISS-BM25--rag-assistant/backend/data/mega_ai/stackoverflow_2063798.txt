Regarding Online/Free Storage It's not specifically for VCS online storage, but mozy.com allows you to backup up to 2Gb of current data online for free. What this means is that you can back up 2Gb of your stuff, but it also keeps historical backups for 30 days, -> if you were backing up daily you could conceivably use 60Gb for free. Once it's set up, its a simple Task/System Tray app and single click to backup whenever you want (as often as you like). For a VCS like GIT, this would be sufficient, as you could simply include the GIT repository in your list of files to back up. It may be more difficult to use for a more "centralised" repository like SVN, but still possible - or you could at least just backup your working (but not historical) copy
