How should I store a AES Encryption Key?

I run a DV 3.5 server on MediaTemple with Linux CentOS 5, php and mysql DB and am trying to encrypt phone records with AES. I came across what seems to be good script as PHPAES but I am not sure of the following: Where do I actually store the AES Encryption key used to encrypt and decrypt the phone number? How do I call on the AES encryption key when a user submits their data via form and stores into our MySQL database? When I want to descrypt that information for our internal customer service agents - how do they in turn call on the AES key? I realize this is probably very simple but please don't insult. I am trying to learn best practice for how to move forward with any type of encryption whatsoever. Something (to this point) we have not had need for.
