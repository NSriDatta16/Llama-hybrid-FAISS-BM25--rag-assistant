Estimating conditional entropy of a series

I have a time series $Y$ (continuous values) and I want to estimate its conditional entropy such that $H(y_{t+1}|y_t)$ represents the conditional entropy of $Y$ at time $t+1$ given its value at time $t$ : $$ H(y_{t+1}|y_t) = - \sum_{y_{t+1},y_t} p(y_t+1,y_t) \log \frac{p(y_{t+1},y_t)}{p(y_t)} $$ Could someone tell how I could implement this in Python? Should I use KDE?
