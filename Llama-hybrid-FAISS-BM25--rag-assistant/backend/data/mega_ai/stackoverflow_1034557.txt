C# Ambiguous call in DirectSound

I'm trying to use DirectSound to capture sound from a microphone. Here's my code: using Microsoft.DirectX.DirectSound; public MicrophoneSensor() { CaptureBufferDescription micBufferDesc = new CaptureBufferDescription(); WaveFormat format = new WaveFormat(); format.SamplesPerSecond = 22000; format.Channels = 1; format.BitsPerSample = 8; format.AverageBytesPerSecond = 22000; format.BlockAlign = 1; micBufferDesc.Format = format; micBufferDesc.BufferBytes = 100000; micBufferDesc.ControlEffects = false; micBufferDesc.WaveMapped = true; micBuffer = new CaptureBuffer(micBufferDesc, microphone); } The instantiations of the micBufferDesc and format variables cause Visual Studio 2008 to throw the following error: The call is ambiguous between the following methods or properties: 'Microsoft.DirectX.DirectSound.CaptureBufferDescription.CaptureBufferDescription()' and 'Microsoft.DirectX.DirectSound.CaptureBufferDescription.CaptureBufferDescription()' and The call is ambiguous between the following methods or properties: 'Microsoft.DirectX.DirectSound.WaveFormat.WaveFormat()' and 'Microsoft.DirectX.DirectSound.WaveFormet.WaveFormat()' I've tried quite a few different combinations of stating the namespace and using statements but no luck. I've also checked the references in the solution explorer and as far as I can tell there are no duplicates. A brand new test project with only the Microsoft.DirectX.DirectSound reference and nothing else still throws the same error. I have also uninstalled and reinstalled the DirectX SDK (March 2009) as well as the DirectX SDK (November 2008). Still no luck. Finally, I've tried a new project on another computer here in the lab and it still doesn't work. Here are the references I have: Graph Microsoft.DirectX.DirectSound Microsoft.DirectX.DirectInput PresentationCore PresentationFramework Service System System.Core System.Data System.Data.DataSetExtensions System.Deployment System.Drawing System.Runtime.Serialization System.ServiceModel System.Windows.Forms System.Xml System.Xml.Linq UIAutomationProvider WindowsBase WindowsFormsIntegration
