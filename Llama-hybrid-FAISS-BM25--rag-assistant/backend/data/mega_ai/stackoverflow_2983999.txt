hg clone create hard links on unix file systems, so only changes introduced by new change sets use space in the storage. When you don't want a working copy, you can update the repo to the 'null' revision, which consist only of the repository without working copy. Git also has the option of bare repositories and shared repositories, but I never tried them.
