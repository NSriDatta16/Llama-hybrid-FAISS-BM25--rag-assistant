It looks like the empty-cells property suggested by strager might do the trick. If it doesn't do what you need, I would look at using some clever javascript library like jQuery . You can probably set a hook to update the border style of the cell to be getBorderStyle(this) When the content of this cell change. Look at the jquery "change" hook here: http://docs.jquery.com/Events/change If you select all your cells (which you can do using a css selector) and add a change hook to run some function you write called updateBorder() or some such, you should be good. I imagine it would be something like this: $("table.someClass td").change(function() { updateBorder(this) })
