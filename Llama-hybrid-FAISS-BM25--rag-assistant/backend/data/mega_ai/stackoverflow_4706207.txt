HTML5 Offline storage web framework

I am looking for a web app framework which can automatically generate an HTML5 offline storage based app, so while the users become disconnected they still can view the data which normally is stored on a server Also currently I am using Django and it would be great if there was a framework which could pull data from Django and present that as an offline app. From the related questions suggested by stackoverflow, while writing this question, I found one interesting link mentioning that GWT has such functionality, I would like to know more about that if possible and if it can generate an HTML5 offline app Thanks in Advance
