After researching different approaches of machine learning, I think that reinforced learning and Markov Decision Processes are appropriate to apply to decision making in a dice game like Yahtzee. Previously I had only been exposed to supervised and unsupervised learning. I've written up my approach here ( http://rpubs.com/ggraham412/117575 ) and created a toy implementation in Python here ( https://github.com/ggraham-412/RLDiceGame ).
