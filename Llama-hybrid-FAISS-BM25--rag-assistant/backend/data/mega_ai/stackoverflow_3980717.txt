Yet another python import issue of mine

Looks like I am having a real tough day with python imports.I am using Flask and am trying to organise my app structure.I am using it on GAE and thus have to put python packages in my app itself. It looks something like this below:- -MyFolder -flask -werkzeug -Myapp - __init__.py -templates -static -views.py -blinker As of now I import the blinker library into Myapp's __init__. But I wanted to organise these extra packages like blinker into a helper package so as to look like this. -helper -__init__.py -blinker (blinker's __init__.py file looks like this) from blinker.base import..... But when I try importing blinker into Myapp's __init__ using from helper import blinker I get an import error saying no module named blinker.base.Why should that happen. Looks like it looks for a blinker package outside of the current one. Why should it happen?
