Performance implication on nvarchar(4000)?

I have a column that is declared as nvarchar(4000) and 4000 is SQL Server's limit on the length of nvarchar. it would not be used as a key to sort rows. Are there any implication that i should be aware of before setting the length of the nvarchar field to 4000? Update I'm storing an XML, an XML Serialized Object to be exact. I know this isn't favorable but we will most likely never need to perform queries on it and this implementation dramatically decreases development time for certain features that we plan on extending. I expect the XML data to be 1500 characters long on average but there can be those exceptions where it can be longer than 4000. Could it be longer than 4000 characters? It could be but in very rare occasions, if it ever happens. Is this application mission critical? Nope, not at all.
