(SVM) Difference between linear kernel and polynomial kernel of degree 1?

I am new to machine learning. Could anyone tell me the difference between linear kernel vs. polynomial kernel of degree 1 wrt SVM (if there is any difference)? The reason I asked, I am getting different accuracy for both on the spam dataset from UCI.
