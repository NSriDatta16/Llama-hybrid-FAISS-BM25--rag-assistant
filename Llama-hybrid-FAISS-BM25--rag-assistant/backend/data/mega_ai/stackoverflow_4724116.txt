Looking for open source Delphi project with good unit test coverage

For educational reasons I am looking for an open source Delphi project with good unit test coverage. Projects which are under Test Driven Development are preferred. The size of the project doesn't matter. Subject should be business or game development, but no web projects. Any hints? Edit: Thanks for the suggestions, but I prefer projects where the requests come from "normal" users, not from programmers like for a CRM or ERP system. For example, a task planner or jump-and-run game. Has anybody seen something like this?
