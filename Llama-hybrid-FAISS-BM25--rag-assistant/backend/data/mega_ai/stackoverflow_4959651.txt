Magento Connect 2.0 - Connection Error try again later

Is anyone else having problems installing new addons using the new Magento Connect version (2.0)? I just installed the latest version, went to install my language packs using the new url’s and i get "Connection Error try again later.” I tried all yesterday and today and still get the same problem. This is an example addon: http://connect20.magentocommerce.com/community/Locale_Mage_Core_fr_FR
