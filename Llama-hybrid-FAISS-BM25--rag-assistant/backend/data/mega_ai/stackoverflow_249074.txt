How to change onClick handler dynamically?

I'm sure there are a million posts about this out there, but surprisingly I'm having trouble finding something. I have a simple script where I want to set the onClick handler for an link on initialization of the page. When I run this I immediately get a 'foo' alert box where I expected to only get an alert when I click on the link. What stupid thing am I doing wrong? (I've tried click= and onClick=)... function init(){ document.getElementById("foo").click = new function() { alert('foo'); }; } Click to run foo Edit: I changed my accepted answer to a jQuery answer. The answer by ' Már Örlygsson ' is technically the correct answer to my original question ( click should be onclick and new should be removed) but I strongly discourage anyone from using 'document.getElementById(...) directly in their code - and to use jQuery instead.
