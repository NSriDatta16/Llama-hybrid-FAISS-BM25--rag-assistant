The connection between Bayesian statistics and generative modeling

Can someone refer me to a good reference that explains the connection between Bayesian statistics and generative modeling techniques? Why do we usually use generative models with Bayesian techniques? Why it is especially appealing to use Bayesian statistics in the absence of complete data, if at all? Note that I come from a more machine learning oriented view, and I am interested in reading more about it from the statistics community. Any good reference that discusses these points would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.
