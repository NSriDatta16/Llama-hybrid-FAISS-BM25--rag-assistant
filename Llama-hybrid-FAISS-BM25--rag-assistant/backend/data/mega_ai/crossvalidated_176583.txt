Is there an NLP or text classification method for word order and pre-specification of terms?

I'm fairly new to NLP and text classification world, and so far I haven't been able to find the answer to the following problem: I have text entries for a large number of observations. My goal is to classify (supervised) by text into one of two outcomes. However, the text I'm looking to classify has phrases where ordering matters, especially when it comes to negation prior to the word. Are there robust methods that allow for this accommodation of strings and negation terms prior to strings? Ideally, the method would also allow me to specify a priori which terms that are already known to denote an observation as having a specific classification, but then learn beyond those terms how to classify.
