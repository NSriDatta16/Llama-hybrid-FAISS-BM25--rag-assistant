I have used the Levenshtein Distance to do fuzzy matching recently. I compute the distance between two possible matched strings and give the match a score that is the inverse of the distance. I then do a weighted average of the scores across the fields to determine a score for the record and allow more important fields to count more heavily than less important fields. It is used in a CRM application where there were leads coming in from many different sources. The client needed to match these against existing leads/opportunities/cleints/resellers etc. It took a bit of adjusting of the thresholds of what score was a match and what wasn't. In the end we got about a 1% false positive rate which i think is quite good really.
