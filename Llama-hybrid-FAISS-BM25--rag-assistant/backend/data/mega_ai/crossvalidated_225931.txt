Why is my high degree polynomial regression model suddenly unfit for the data?

I'm building a ridge regression model in scikit-learn and trying to find the optimal degree polynomial to use. The data I'm working with is a fairly predictable time series of hourly traffic volumes, and I'm predicting said volumes from the date, hour, and day of the week. R-squared values increase for both my train and test sets as I generate higher degree polynomial features, but suddenly drop from .91 to -1.4 when I go from degree 8 to 9, signifying that the 9th-order model is worse than the 0-order model. Any idea why this happens?
