importing projects in Xcode

I have an iPhone app, that contains a lot of "sub-apps". I basically develop each component separately as it's own project, and when I feel that it is ready, I manually drag all the files into Xcode. I know you can import Xcode projects into other projects, but I'm not really sure what this does. Does any have a better way to do this?
