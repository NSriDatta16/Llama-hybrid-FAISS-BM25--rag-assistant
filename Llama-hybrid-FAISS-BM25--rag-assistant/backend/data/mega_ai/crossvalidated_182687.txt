Given the group-level effects, this should probably be modeled hierarchically; the tricky bit is that some observations are part of a hierarchy and others are not. One possible approach may to have the intercept as a fixed effect and the coefficient of individual effect to be random. $$x_{i|j}=\begin{cases} 0 & j=0 \mbox{ (Groups)}\\ 1 & j>0 \mbox{ (Individual)} \end{cases}\\ \eta_{i|j}=\alpha+\beta_{j}x_i\\ \alpha\sim N(0,k_{\alpha})\\ \beta_{j}\sim N(\beta_{\mu},\sigma_{\beta})\\ \sigma_{beta}\sim half\mbox{-}Cauchy(0,k_{\sigma})\\ \beta_{\mu}\sim N(0,k_{\beta})$$ In this case, $\alpha$ would represent the average number of pauses taken at the group level, $\beta_\mu$ is the average effect of individual control on the number of pauses, and $\beta_j$ codifies the assumption of non-independence of individuals within each group. The $k$ values are user-specified constants that control for the scaling of the prior distributions. You could then fit your linear predictor $\eta$ to an appropriate distribution (e.g., $y\sim Poisson(log(\eta))$, $y\sim N(\eta,\sigma)$, etc.
