How can I use asp.net to generate and return an HTML document as a string (outside of a web context)

I need to write a system to generate HTML email from a data model - I was going to create a templating system to build the model into an HTML representation using HTML 'fragments' stored in an xml template. But it occurs to me that these it might be better to use asp or asp.net than write my own templating system? What I am wondering is whether/how it would be possible to use asp (maybe asp.net mvc?) to return an HTML string - I wouldn't be running on a web server, or in response to an HTTP request. I have not done any asp or asp.net yet- My experience of ASP stretches to 'Create new project' in visual studio - but maybe now is a good time to learn! Thank You!
