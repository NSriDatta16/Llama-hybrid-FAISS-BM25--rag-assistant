I was intrigued by this and took the pragmatic approach of playing with it in Excel. I generated three random numbers for x, y, and d in the range 1-100. I then did the comparison between d and x and between x and y and looked at the result, right or wrong. I did this 500 times and repeated that several times and regularly got the right answer arounf 330 out of 500, as predicted. I then increased the range of d to 1-10000 and the correct answer dropped to about 260 for 500 runs. So yes, the selection of d is dependant on the expected values of x and y. BoB
