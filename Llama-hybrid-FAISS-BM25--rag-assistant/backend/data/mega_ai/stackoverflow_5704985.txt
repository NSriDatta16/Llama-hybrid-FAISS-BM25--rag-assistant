Ranking objects in List<> by multiple criteria

I have a list of objects representing plants - each of which have member properties which represent a range of tolerable environmental conditions. I want to re-order this list such that the plant objects are ranked in order of suitability. I figure I want to give each item in the list a rank for temperature/pH suitability based on the proximity of the middle of their temperature/pH range to the environment data supplied. I would then average the ranks and sort the list by this number. However, I'm unsure what the best approach would be for tracking the ranks given to each item in the list. Does anybody have any recommendations on how best to approach this?
