Different Joinpoint/Segmented regression results and Durbin-Watson test

I used the Joinpoint trend software ( https://surveillance.cancer.gov/joinpoint/ ) and found interesting results to my data that really intrigued me. I have mortality rates from 2001 to 2021 as follows: Year Population Deaths Crude_Death_Rate_100k 2001 172402407 86228 50.02 2002 174652142 87190 49.92 2003 176890584 88838 50.22 2004 181586609 90758 49.98 2005 184948540 89878 48.60 2006 187018382 96471 51.58 2007 188994445 96705 51.17 2008 190965853 98871 51.77 2009 192935881 99139 51.38 2010 194845069 99647 51.14 2011 196557572 100648 51.21 2012 198268222 100103 50.49 2013 199956927 99954 49.99 2014 201669726 99190 49.18 2015 203427301 100436 49.37 2016 205107655 102886 50.16 2017 206755270 101132 48.91 2018 208444882 99835 47.90 2019 210096571 101000 48.07 2020 211704612 98749 46.64 2021 213266044 102980 48.29 From the Joinpoint Regression Software I got the standar errors estimated from the data, so: test 1) applying it using the uncorrelated errors option, I got 1 joinpoint as the best model (with 1 significative trend). test 2) After this, I tested using the first order autocorrelation estimated from the data and got a negative autocorrelation parameter and 1 joinpoint as the best model (with 2 significative trends). test 3) Finally, I tested the series above by the Durbin-Watson test using the car::durbinWatsonTest() function which resulted: lag Autocorrelation D-W Statistic p-value 1 0.5390758 0.8688534 0.002 In other words, positive autocorrelation of ~0.54. After applying to the Joinpoint software, I got a best model of 0 joinpoints and no significance at all (please, see the uploaded image to better understand). My doubt is which model should I use for this time series? Which one of these approaches is correct? Thanks in advance.
