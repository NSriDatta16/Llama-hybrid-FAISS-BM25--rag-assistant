Logistic Regression - Odds Ratio

I have the following two logistic regression models where the independent variables are the same for the two models: logit(Brand1) = b0 + b1 x1 + b2 x2 logit(Brand2) = c0 + c1 x1 + c2 x2 I can't use multinomial logistic regression because the respondents can choose more than one brand (that is, Brand1 and Brand2 can equal 1 at the same time). My question is, can I compare the odd ratios across the two models? If, for example I have odds ratio (Brand1,x1) = 3 and odds ratio (Brand2,x1) = 5, can I say odds ratio (Brand2, x1) is higher than odds ratio (Brand1,x1)? That is, can I say Brand2 is more likely than Brand1 to have characteristic x1? Thanks for your help.
