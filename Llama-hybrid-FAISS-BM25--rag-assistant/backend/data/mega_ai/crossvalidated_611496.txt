any identical set of my explanatory variables can result in multiple values of the target variable. That's to be expected in a Poisson model. A standard Poisson regression models the log of the average number of counts as a function of a linear predictor, which is based on covariate values and regression coefficients. But the actual observed values vary about that mean, as the variance of a Poisson-distributed variable equals its mean. For example, say that the linear predictor for one set of predictor values gives a mean of 1 count. Then only about 37% of observations would have a count value of 1. The same fraction of observations would have a value of 0, and about 18% would have a value of 2. You can explore this behavior yourself with the dpois() function in R. For example: print(dpois(0:5,lambda=1),digits=2) # [1] 0.3679 0.3679 0.1839 0.0613 0.0153 0.0031 gives the probability of finding each of 0 through 5 counts when the mean count is 1. Similarly, different sets of predictor values can result in the same number of observed counts in many cases. Say that a second set of values gives a predicted mean of 2 counts. There's a lot of overlap in the distribution of count values with what's seen with a mean of 1 count. print(dpois(0:5,lambda=2),digits=2) # [1] 0.135 0.271 0.271 0.180 0.090 0.036 You might, however, need to go beyond a simple Poisson model if the dispersion around model predictions differs substantially from the strict "variance equals mean" assumption of a Poisson model. A "quasi-Poisson" or a negative-binomial model can handle that situation while respecting the count-based nature of your outcome values.
