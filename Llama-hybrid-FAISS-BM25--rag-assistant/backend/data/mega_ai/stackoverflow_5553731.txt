A little bit more tricky without knowing full details, the landing server for your cURL script might be denying access. EG: curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_USERAGENT, 'Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:2.2a1pre) Gecko/20110324 Firefox/4.2a1pre'); Just add that, see if it helps as if you're not sending a user_agent over, or an unrecognised 1 is picked up, maybe they are denying access.
