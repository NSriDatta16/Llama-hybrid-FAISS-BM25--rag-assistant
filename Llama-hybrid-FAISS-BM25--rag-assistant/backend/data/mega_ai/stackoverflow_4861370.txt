PDF displays in Chrome, Firefox, but not in IE8

I have an ASP.NET MVC application that produces a PDF file when calling an action on one of the controllers. The PDF file renders correctly in Chrome and Firefox, but when I try to open the PDF in IE, a blank HTML page appears. The HTTP response looks like this (captured in Fiddler): HTTP/1.1 200 OK Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store Pragma: no-cache Content-Type: application/pdf Expires: -1 Server: Microsoft-IIS/7.5 X-AspNetMvc-Version: 2.0 X-AspNet-Version: 4.0.30319 X-Powered-By: ASP.NET Date: Tue, 01 Feb 2011 09:48:53 GMT Content-Length: 3176569 > When I do a view source in IE, the following HTML appears: The action is requested from a Silverlight 4 application. If anyone knows of some quirks that IE has interpreting the HTTP protocol, please answer - it may just solve my problem. The request is made over HTTPS.
