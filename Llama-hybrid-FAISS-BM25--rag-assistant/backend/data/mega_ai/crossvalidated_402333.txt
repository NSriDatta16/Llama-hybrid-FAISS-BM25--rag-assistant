What must someone know in statistics and machine learning?

There seem to be two different worlds in statistics. On one hand, there are the practitioners which run the same tests again and again. On the other hand, there is this overwhelming and seemingly endless world of statistics and machine learning where one gets lost easily in specific questions - just like here on Cross Validated. So my question is: What do you consider a statician/ ML professional must to know about statistics and machine learning? I know there will be comments that it depends on the area where you work. But still, there are things all statisticians (should) know like multicollinearity, power analysis or linear regression. I really would love to have a profound foundation in statistics, but for me it is hard to tell where to go next. So if statistics and machine learning were a craft occupation what knowledge and what tests / methods would you put in your toolbox? The answers to my question can give a feeling for what needs to be known to be a statistician to many people that are at the beginning of their career.
