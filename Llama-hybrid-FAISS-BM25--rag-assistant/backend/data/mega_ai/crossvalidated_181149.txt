Dynamic regression and prewhitening

I'm working on a time series forecasting problem where sales needs to be predicted using weather variables. The weather variables are auto correlated and hence pre-whitening is needed to find the true relationship between each of the input variables with the target variable. I didn't come across a complete end to end process that needs to be followed. Based on my understanding, below is the detailed process. Kindly take a look at it and let me know if the approach is right or not. I am doing this in SAS and am using PROC ARIMA Fit an ARIMA model to the input variable. Use this model to filter both the input and target time series and compute the cross correlation plot between them. The code for the same is as follows: proc arima data=in; identify var=temp; estimate p=1 q=1; identify var=sales crosscorr=temp; run; If the CCF plot shows significant correlations at positive lags, the variable has an effect and can be used in the final model. Formulate the transfer function based on the CCF plot Repeat steps 1 and 2 for all the input variables If you feel the input variables are correlated among themselves, select one input variable as x variable and another input variable as target variable and repeat step 1. If the CCF shows only lags at 0, the two variables are highly correlated and one of them can be dropped from the final model for predicting the sales Fit a model for the target variable( find p and q values) and use them along with the transfer functions for all the input variables identified proc arima data=in; identify var=sales; estimate p=1 q=1 input = ( $(1) temp /(1 3) humidity); identify var=sales crosscorr=temp; run; Forecast and see the model's performance metrics and fine tune if needed
