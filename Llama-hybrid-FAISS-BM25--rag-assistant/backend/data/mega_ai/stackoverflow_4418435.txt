How to filter POST requests using pcap?

I am playing around with the pcap library in C. I can filter http traffic using the filter expression "port 80" in the pcap_compile call, but now I'm wondering whether I can filter POST requests specifically. Does anyone know of a filter expression for filtering http POST requests?
