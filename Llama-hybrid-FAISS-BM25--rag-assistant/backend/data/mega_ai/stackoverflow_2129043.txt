Windows drag and drop problem with console app

I have a program that creates a file and writes to it using ofstream. I need the program to be able to parse command line parameters later on. But for some reason, it does not create a file when I drag-and-drop a file onto the compiled executable, even if the program doesn't involve any command line parameters at all. If the executable is run normally, it works. So I'm left totally confused. Here is the source: #include #include using namespace std; int main () { ofstream outfile; outfile.open("test.txt"); if(outfile.is_open()) { outfile Does anybody have any ideas? I appreciate any help.
