How do I programmatically set all 's to have the wmode set to opaque?

I have a client who is embedding videos into his WordPress blog. The problem is they have a large CSS dropdown that sneaks behind the flash video. I understand that setting the video's wmode to opaque will fix this, but I obviously need this to apply to every video they upload and not have to go to the HTML to add this tag Is there any way I can do this programatically?
