As best as I have been able to figure out EWS is a little buggy when it comes to populating the full EmailAddress details both in Appointments for Organizer and for other things like "EmailMessage.From". When you do a query for multiple items, you don't get the EmailAddress properties being fully populated. E.g. using APIs like: Folder.FindItems ExchangeService.FindAppointments I find that only the display name in the EmailAddress fields gets populated. To get the EmailAddress fully populated I find I need to load/bind to the specific item and specify the relevant EmailAddress property, e.g. AppointmentSchema.Organizer in your case. So although you specify exactly the same property to load, you are loading using a single item call rather than a bulk query. E.g. using: ServiceObject.Load Which is available for both Appointment and EmailMessage as they both derive off ServiceObject. Using Item.Bind with the appropriate property set defined should also work. As an aside I figured this out looking at the code for EwsEditor which is mentioned here: http://blogs.msdn.com/webdav_101/archive/2009/11/10/ews-has-more-happy-now-ews-managed-api-and-ewseditor.aspx The usability of EwsEditor is fairly sucky, and the code takes some trawling to figure out, but at least it does show examples of exercising many of the APIs.
