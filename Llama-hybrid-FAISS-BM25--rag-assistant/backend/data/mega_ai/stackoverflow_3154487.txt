From the posted trace, it seems the MDB can't write to the database because the DataSource fails at being injected: No unique bean of type [javax.sql.DataSource] is defined There is a collision somewhere. I think you need to tell us more for a more precise answer. Update: I wonder if using the same name for the @Resource and the DataSource property ( database in this case) is not causing the problem. So, instead of: // Datasource declaration @Resource(name = "database", mappedName = "datasource/oracle-11g") private DataSource database; Could you try this (assuming datasource/oracle-11g is the global JNDI name): // Datasource declaration @Resource(mappedName="datasource/oracle-11g") private DataSource database; See also: Component Dependencies and Ease Of Development Improvements in Java EE 5/App Server 9 located at https://glassfish.dev.java.net/javaee5/ejb/#Docs (highly recommended reading)
