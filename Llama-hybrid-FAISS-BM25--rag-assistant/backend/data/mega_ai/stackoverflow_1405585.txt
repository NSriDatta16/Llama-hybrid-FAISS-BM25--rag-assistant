KVO - problem retrieving object from storage and displaying for edition

I've a problem with KVO and I just can't find out what it is. I have a screen that can be used to edit or create a record. That record is represented by a model object that holds a number of variables of type NSString. The controller for that string has an instance variable to hold the model currently being worked on. When I open the window to create a new record, I create a new entity on my managed object context, assign the newly created entity to that instance variable and display the window - no problems. I am using manual notifications in some fields of my model object because it inherits from NSManagedObject. But when I try to edit a record - by fetching it from Core Data and doing the same thing - I get the error: [ addObserver:forKeyPath:options:context:] is not supported. Key path: username NSLogging the object shows that its of the correct type. Any clues?
