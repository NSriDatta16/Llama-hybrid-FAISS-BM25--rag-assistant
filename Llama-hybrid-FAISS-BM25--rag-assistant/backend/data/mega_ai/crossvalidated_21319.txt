Hidden Markov models with Baum-Welch algorithm using python

I'm looking for some python implementation (in pure python or wrapping existing stuffs) of HMM and Baum-Welch. Some ideas? I've just searched in google and I've found really poor material with respect to other machine learning techniques. Why?
