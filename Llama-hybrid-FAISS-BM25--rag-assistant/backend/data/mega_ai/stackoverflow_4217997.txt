You would need to mark the item as a resource , NOT an embedded resource . From MSDN ... The Properties window in Visual Studio provides several other values in the Build Action drop-down list. However, you can use only the previous three values with Silverlight projects. In particular, Silverlight embedded resources must always use the Resource build action, and not the Embedded Resource build action, which uses a format that Silverlight cannot recognize. A great walk through can be seen here entailing what you are trying to accomplish. Since you are not trying to access files on disk but as resources this is not a problem. IsolatedStorage nor elevated permissions are pertinent here.
