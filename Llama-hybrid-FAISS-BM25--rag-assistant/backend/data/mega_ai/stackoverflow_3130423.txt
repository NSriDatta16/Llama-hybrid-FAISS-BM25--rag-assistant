Microsoft broke .NET compatibility?

A few days ago my .NET 3.5 applications began to fail while start issuing the error "Unable to find a version of the runtime to run this application". As I did not do anything with them, this looked weird to me. After some investigation, I discovered, that the reason is Windows automatic update which installed service pack for .NET 3.5 or .NET 4 to my computer (I did not figure which of two is guilty). That update was not be possible to uninstall as it was not shown in Installed Windows updates list at Control Panel. I had to revert to system restore point! Today one of my customers complained to the same problem. I cannot force him to revert to system restore so I need to know how to overcome this silly Microsoft thing. Can anyone please share your ideas on that? P.S. The software is protected with CodeVeil 1.2, maybe this matters.
