Lack of accuracy for my open market price forecasting

I'm trying to solve a problem to train my skill. I've daily data (each day during 10 years,2010 to 2020, except saturday and sunday). I would like to predict like ten day after my data end. Problem is my model are atrocious. I tried xgboost, svm and Prophet for now. I think the problem is : I always worked on monthly data, and with monthly it's far easier to detect seasonality and so on. With daily data I'm kind of lost. I thought : "Why not transform into monthly instead of daily ?" But how to predict only few days with monthly ? I don't think it's possible. So if you have some tips to improve my work with daily data, I'll be very grateful. I'm quite new so any hel would be appreciated. Thanks. :)
