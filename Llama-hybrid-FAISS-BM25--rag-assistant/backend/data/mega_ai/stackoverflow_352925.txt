tomcat application missing displayname

I have a little project with some jsp deployed on an Tomcat 5.5. Recently the Servlets which are also deployed with the jsp files (one war archive) stopped working. I also checked out a previous version from my svn which should work. What I noticed that the displayname (I use a german version of Tomcat , so I guess that is how I would translate it, the name in the second column in the Tomcat manager) disappeared. I use Eclipse Ganymede on vista. Tomcat is running on Debian. A local Tomcat shows the same behavior. Hope someone have an idea. Thanks.
