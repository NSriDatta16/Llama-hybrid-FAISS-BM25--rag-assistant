I have seen application of machine learning algorithms, like the Stochastic approximation Expectation Maximization (SAEM) that solve ODES that cannot be solved analytically. If you know the equations defining your dynamic system but not the values of the constants in them, you could use such algorithms to do Parameter Inference. I am guessing you could also apply Nueral Networks for it. Could you offer the papers and dissertations you have read? I can try to explain them.
