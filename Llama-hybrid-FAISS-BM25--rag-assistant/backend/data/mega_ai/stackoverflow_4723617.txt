According to the HTML specs , the checked attribute is boolean. That is, if you don't set it to a value that implies false, the user agent will probably decide that it is true, i.e. checked. Historically the mere presence of this attribute indicated that the box should be checked, hence why this is the likely default value. You can test this by looking at the source - I suspect you'll have your page rendered with checked="unchecked" , which will still render the box as checked. You can fix this by changing "unchecked" to "false" in your PHP source, in order to get the correct boolean behaviour you're looking for. Edit: the specs further go on to define that boolean attributes can only take one legal value (which implies true ) - so to produce correct HTML with this attribute set to false , the only way to do this is to omit the attribute altogether. Shakti Singh's answer describes how to achieve this (and gets a +1 from me).
