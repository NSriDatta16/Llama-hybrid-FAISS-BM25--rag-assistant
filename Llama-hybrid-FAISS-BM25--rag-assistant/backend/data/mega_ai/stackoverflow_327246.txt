You might have to use .htaccess to deny some bots to screw with your logs. See here : http://spamhuntress.com/2006/02/13/another-hungry-java-bot/ I had lots of Java bots crawling my site, adding SetEnvIfNoCase User-Agent ^Java/1. javabot=yes SetEnvIfNoCase User-Agent ^Java1. javabot=yes Deny from env=javabot made them stop. Now they only get 403 one time and that's it :)
