Python is more suited for a 'real' data scientist work whose work needs to be productized and used in a software or website. We need to remember that ultimately whatever we do needs to be productized. Although R has Shiny library that can be used for web hosting, we need to remember that a website will not have only machine learning component, it will have many other aspects, which cannot be built in R, but needs a full fledged software development language. I sent my resume to senior level data scientist for job application and the response i received is in the linked question. Why do internet companies prefer Java/Python for data scientist job?
