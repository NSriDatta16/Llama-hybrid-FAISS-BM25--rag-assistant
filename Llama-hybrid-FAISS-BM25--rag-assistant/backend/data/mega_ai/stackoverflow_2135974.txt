Though often maligned, as Max pointed out, MFC provides CTaskBar , which is designed for exactly this sort of thing. What you have inside it looks a lot like a CTreeCtrl (or CTreeeView ) with an associated CImageList to display the icons for the bookmarks. Resizing the mainframe while the sidebar is open is handled automatically. To create a project that includes this, select the "Visual Studio" application type (after choosing "MFC Application"). Just as a note for the record, I'm reasonably certain that FireFox does not actually use an MFC CTaskBar. FireFox's sidebar is quite limited by comparison -- it only allows one sidebar with one pane in one position. CTaskBar supports multiple task bars, that the user can rearrange at will, each of which can have multiple tiled and/or tabbed panes (and, for example, the user can not only move a complete task bar by dragging, but also drag panes between task bars, drag a pane out on its own to become a separate task bar, etc. Note that nearly all of this is handled internally by MFC -- you simply create window classes for storing and drawing data in the panes, and it handles things like keeping track of where a pane is at the moment.
