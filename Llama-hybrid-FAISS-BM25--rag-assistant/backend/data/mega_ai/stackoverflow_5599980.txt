how to download page source info of a webpage in vb.net or perl

I want to download the same information which is obtained when we right click view page source in browser. I want to do this either in vb.net or perl I need it for google image search result webpage. When that page is saved then html code is not same as view page source info. Tags for images are absent. In vb.net I tried Dim objHttp As Object, strURL As String, strText As String objHttp = CreateObject("MSXML2.ServerXMLHTTP") strURL = "http://www.google.co.uk/images?as_q=aboriginal&hl=en&output=search&tbs=isch:1,iur:fmc&btnG=Google+Search&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&as_sitesearch=&safe=images&as_st=y&biw=1600&bih=799" objHttp.Open("GET", strURL, False) objHttp.setRequestHeader("User-Agent", _ "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0)", "Accept", "image/png,image/*;q=0.8,*/*;q=0.5") objHttp.Send("") strText = objHttp.responseText objHttp = Nothing RichTextBox1.Text = strText Though above method gives the links to the search result image it does not return the image tags (by image tag i am referring to short sentence below every image in google image search). Is there any way to get the whole view page source info in vb.net or perl
