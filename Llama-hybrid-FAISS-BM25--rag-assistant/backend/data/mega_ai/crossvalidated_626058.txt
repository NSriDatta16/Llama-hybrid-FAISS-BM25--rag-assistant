If the example data is representative of your real data, it's not sufficient to choose the negative binomial regression over the Poisson regression. One issue is that the NB GLMM implemented by lme4::glmer.nb has one dispersion parameter. Groups A & B and Groups C & D have different dispersions, so lme4::glmer.nb would estimate the overall dispersion to be somewhere in-between; the end result would be that the model doesn't fit any group well. One solution is to estimate a different dispersion parameter for each group. I show how to do such analysis using the brms package. So this is a Bayesian solution. First let's fit a negative binomial model with a single dispersion parameter, which is shared by all groups. fita How good is the fit? A posterior predictive check ( PPC ) warns us it's not very good at all: Keep in mind that the issue is not that this is a Bayesian model but that all four groups share the same shape (inverse overdispersion) parameter. Next let's fit a negative binomial model with a shape parameter for each group: fitb How good is this fit? The posterior predictive check doesn't raise obvious concerns: NB: I used the default brms priors. It's a start but there were warnings about divergent transitions and large R-hats (diagnostics which indicate issues in the model or in the estimation). So more work is required to make the Bayesian approach work well.
