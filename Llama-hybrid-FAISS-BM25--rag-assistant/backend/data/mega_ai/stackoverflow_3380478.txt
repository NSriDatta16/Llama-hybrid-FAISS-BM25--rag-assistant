Creating two resources at once with a form in Rails

Say you have a Post model that has a :title , :author , :content , etc. It also has a :thread_id attribute, and it belongs_to :thread . The thread model doesn't have any custom fields. The only ones you'll be needing are those created by default such as :id , :created_at , and :updated_at . Threads have_many :posts . How do you create a form for a Thread that simultaneously creates both a Thread and a Post? Related questions, possibly: Should I say or ? Should the form be in the Thread view code or the Post view code? Thanks for your help, I am new to Rails and I'm still learning how to organize my code in it.
