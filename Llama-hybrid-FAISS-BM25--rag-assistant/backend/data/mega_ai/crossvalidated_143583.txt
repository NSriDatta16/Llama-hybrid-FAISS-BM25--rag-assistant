In case when some transition does not occur at all in a dataset, you may approximate it probability by treating P(X_n+1 | X_n = j) (where j is some fixed state) as a multinomial distribution and take every transition which starts in a state j, as a data for this model. You may use then the results included in the following article : http://www.math.wsu.edu/faculty/genz/papers/mvnsing/node8.html to compute confidence intervals for such transition probabilities. Another method is The Bootstrap with smoothing. It's nicely described in Iuliana Teodorescu, "Maximum Likelihood Estimation for Markov Chains" article. Of course you may also try The Bayesian Bootstrapping which is a very powerful method. In Cheng-Der Fuh and Tsai-Hung Fan, "A Bayesian Bootstrap for Finite State Markov Chains" you may find the comprehensive description of it.
