Take a look at this page: http://apiwiki.twitter.com/Things-Every-Developer-Should-Know The tricky part is the curl options. You can see how I used them in the example below. The part you want from the apiwiki is the example in answer #8. Specifically: Here's the friends timeline docs. You can get the info you want in XML, JSON, RSS, or Atom form. JSON would probably be the easiest, since you can parse that simply with PHP. Ok, to turn this into PHP you can use this: ` 'http://api.twitter.com/1/statuses/friends_timeline.json', CURLOPT_USERPWD => 'USERNAME:PASSWORD', CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER => true ); // set URL and other appropriate options curl_setopt_array($curl, $options); // grab URL and pass it to the browser $json = curl_exec($curl); // close cURL resource, and free up system resources curl_close($curl); $obj = json_decode($json); foreach($obj as $var => $value) { echo "Message number: $var "; echo "Name: " . $obj[$var]->user->name; echo "Handle: " . $obj[$var]->user->screen_name . " "; echo "Message: " . $obj[$var]->text; echo "Created" . $obj[$var]->created_at . " "; echo "URL" . $obj[$var]->user->url . " "; echo "Location" . $obj[$var]->user->location . " "; echo " "; } ?>` try this bcoz already i got the problem like this.. i did succeed. hope it helps magana
