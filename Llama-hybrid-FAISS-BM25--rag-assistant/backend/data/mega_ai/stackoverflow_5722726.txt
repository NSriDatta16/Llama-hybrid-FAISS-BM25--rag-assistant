Based on your question, I'm not sure if your intent is make it so the select box is scrollable or not. I'm not sure how to make it so the options don't scroll and line up to two options per field. However, here my answer to your question as you [originally] stated. This is a bit more elegant than the previous answer as the select box keeps the same relative height if you resize the text on the page. li { height:2em; padding:0px; font-size:1em; line-height:2em; vertical-align:middle; } select { height:20em; font-size:1em; } Note that if this isn't exactly what you want, you can also style the option element if it helps: option { padding:0; margin:0; } http://jsfiddle.net/xsPr6/1/
