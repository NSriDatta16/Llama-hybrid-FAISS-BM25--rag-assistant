The speed of the call itself isn't going to vary between MicrosoftAjax.js and jQuery. Using jQuery does allow you to avoid the extra overhead of downloading the ASMX's JavaScript proxy though. If you're not using ASP.NET AJAX for anything else, it also allows you to avoid the overhead of downloading MicrosoftAjax.js. If you do want to use jQuery to call the service directly, it's not very difficult. This is a basic example of how to do it: http://encosia.com/2008/03/27/using-jquery-to-consume-aspnet-json-web-services/ Once you understand that basic form of the call, this is a more refined usage that isolates you from a breaking change in ASP.NET 3.5+ and allows you to leverage the browser-native JSON parsing in newer browsers: http://encosia.com/2009/07/21/simplify-calling-asp-net-ajax-services-from-jquery/
