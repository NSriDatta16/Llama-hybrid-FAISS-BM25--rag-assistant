What kind of model should I use?

I am working with a dataset with about 10,000 customers. About 3,000 engaged with dozens of marketing campaigns over the years. I am trying to create a model to find which marketing campaign to use on a given customer. I was thinking of creating affinity scores based on conversions from these campaigns and do some sort of random forest/logistic regression. It gets tricky because only 3,000 have engaged and I am not sure what to recommend for the other 7,000. Any suggestions?
