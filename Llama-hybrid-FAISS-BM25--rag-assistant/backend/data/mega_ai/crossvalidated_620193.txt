What kind of Neural Networks are required for Diffusion models?

It appears that regular feed-forward and convolutions are not enough to make diffusion models work (from some personal limited testing, they do not work at all). The typical infrastructure was a U-Net and now Transformer Models seems like they are taking over as well. I understand the analogies for a residual network in the "regression" settings, and transformer abilities in the context of language models - but I do not understand what is the minimal capacity of a network to memorize the diffusion gradients. In other words, what would be the minimal requirement say for an example of a small diffusion model with mnist dataset.
