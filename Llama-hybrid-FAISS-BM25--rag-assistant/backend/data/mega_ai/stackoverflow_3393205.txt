Sounds like a SQL Script file to me. Can't you just use ISQL or SQLCmd? [Addendum] Sorry, I assumed a MSSQL back end since you referred to ExecuteNonQuery. If these statements are consistent, you can inline the value. * read and ignore first line. * read 2nd line and strip out value between quotes. * read 3rd line, replace the @x string with the value from line 2. * execute modified 3rd line. * repeat if they differ in data type, you will need to use the declared type to read and insert the value (i.e. don't use quotes for numeric). At root, this really is a bad design and/or organizational issue.
