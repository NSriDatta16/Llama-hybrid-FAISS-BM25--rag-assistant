Time series prediction of discontinuous data

In the context of time series prediction, I have read that time series is a series of data that taken at successive equally spaced points in time (which means its in order). What if I have a discontinuous time series data, for example: If I have data that represnt a room temperature within the working hours, specifically from 7:00 am - 3:00 pm. And this data is repeated on the day of the week. So we have something similar to this: Saturday: [ Time series data from 7:00 am - 3:00 pm] Sunday: [ Time series data from 7:00 am - 3:00 pm] Monday: [ Time series data from 7:00 am - 12:00 pm ] -- Only up to 12 pm The first question: Is that considered as time series data Now if I want to predict the room temperature on Monday @ 1:00 pm. How can I do this using given this type of datasets?
