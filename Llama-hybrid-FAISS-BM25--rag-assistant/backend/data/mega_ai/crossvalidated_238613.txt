Flaw in all scientific studies/experiments?

If you draw conclusions in your study based on reasoning like this paragraph below, it's automatically flawed, is it not? "At the end, we compare the average energy levels of the two groups based on the observational study even if we find the difference between the average energy levels of these two groups of people, we can't attribute this difference solely to working out. Because there may be other variables that we didn't control for in this study, that contribute to the observed difference. For example, people who are in better shape might be more likely to regularly work out and also have higher energy levels. However, in the experiment, such variables that might also contribute to the outcome are likely equally represented in the two groups due to the random assignment. Therefore, if we find a difference between the two averages, we can indeed make a causal statement attributing this difference to working out. " The paragraph says you can make a causal conclusion because of random assignment: "such variables that might also contribute to the outcome are likely equally represented in the two groups due to the random assignment" but that isn't guaranteed. Random means you could have, by chance, ended up selecting only participants, or a large majority of patients that have higher energy levels to start with.. So, is this just a really bad hypothetical example, or are all science experiments just as flawed as this one because they believe random assignment fixes everything? I realize that the paragraph might need the rest of the context for anyone to really judge what I'm talking about, it's from https://www.coursera.org/learn/probability-intro/lecture/Qw8iF/observational-studies-experiments and, the entire study is described here: In an observational study, researchers collect data in a way that does not directly interfere with how the data arise. In other words, they merely observe. And based on observational studies, we can only establish an association. In other words, correlation between the explanatory and the response variables. If an observational study uses data from the past, it's called a retrospective study. Whereas if data are collected throughout the study, it's called prospective. In an experiments on the other hand, researchers randomly assign subjects to treatments and can, therefore, establish causal connections between the explanatory and response variables. Let's pause for a moment to clarify what we mean by random assignment with an example, suppose we want to evaluate the relationship between regularly working out and energy level. We can design this study as an observational study or an experiment. In an observational study, we sampled two types of people from the population. Those who choose to work out and those who don't, then find the average energy level for the two groups of people and compare. On the other hand, in an experiment, we sample a group of people from the population, then we randomly assign these people into two groups. Those who will regularly work out through the course of the stud and those who will not. The difference is that the decision of whether to work out or not is not left up to the subjects as in the observational study, but is instead imposed by the researcher. At the end, we compare the average energy levels of the two groups based on the observational study even if we find the difference between the average energy levels of these two groups of people, we can't attribute this difference solely to working out. Because there may be other variables that we didn't control for in this study, that contribute to the observed difference. For example, people who are in better shape might be more likely to regularly work out and also have higher energy levels. However, in the experiment, such variables that might also contribute to the outcome are likely equally represented in the two groups due to the random assignment. Therefore, if we find a difference between the two averages, we can indeed make a colossal statement attributing this difference to working out. My entire point being:
