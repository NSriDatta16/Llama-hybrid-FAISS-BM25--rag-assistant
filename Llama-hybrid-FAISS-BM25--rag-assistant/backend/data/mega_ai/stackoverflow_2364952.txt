Calculating average age in Django

I need to find out average age of items (groupped by various criteria, but it does not seem to be the issue). However I fail to find how to effectively create aggregation over DateTimeField using Django (on top of MySQL). Pure Item.objects.all.aggregate(Avg('created')) seems to produce absolutely bogus values (eg. 20081988007238.133) and using Item.objects.all.extra(...) I have not found a way how to aggregate. Of course I can manually create SQL query (something like SELECT AVG(UNIX_TIMESTAMP(created)) FROM items_item ), but I'd prefer to avoid using MySQL specific code in the application. Just for the reference, sample model I use for testing: class Item(models.Model): name = models.CharField(max_length = 255) created = models.DateTimeField()
