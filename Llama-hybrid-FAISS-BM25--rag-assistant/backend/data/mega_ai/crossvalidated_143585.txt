The paper below does K-means for DTW. While non-trivial, medoids are defined under DTW. However, if speed-up is important under DTW, you will get more speed-up by using constrained DTW, and with a careful (iterative, not recursive) implementation of DTW. http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/ICDM_2014_DTW_average.pdf
