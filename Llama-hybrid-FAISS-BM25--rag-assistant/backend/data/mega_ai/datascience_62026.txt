cross validation issues

I have come here from this great answer. I have come across many approaches for using cross validation and the answer to the attached question is by far explaining it the best to me. My dilemma is that now that I m not able to figure out what to use Kfold cross validation for:- Testing overfitting? Hyperparam tuning? Any other use case? and that too how? I am unable to figure out what to do with the average score that comes after kfold cross val, what to do with the folds and what to do with a model trained on k-1 folds of train data?
