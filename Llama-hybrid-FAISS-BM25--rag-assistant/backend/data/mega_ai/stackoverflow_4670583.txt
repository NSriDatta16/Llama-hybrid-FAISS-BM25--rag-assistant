Although your question was not very clear, I assume your referring to the functionality of dragging and dropping different clothing items onto the game avatars. A custom CCSprite object would be much more appropriate for doing that. However, there is not an easy answer for what you are asking. Creating a game like "Plane Jane" will involve many problems that I'm sure have not crossed your mind. I recommend you complete a few Cocos2d-iPhone tutorials before you go any further. Once you do that, you will have a much better understanding of the functionality you will need to create your game. Here is a nice tutorial for starters: http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org/archives/582
