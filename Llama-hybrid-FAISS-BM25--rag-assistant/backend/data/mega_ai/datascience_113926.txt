I suggest imputing the missing values and converting any columns to numeric data types as your first steps. Then you can deal with outliers and make transformations. Most machine learning packages (e.g. scikit-learn) will generally require you to have all numeric data before feeding the data to machine learning algorithms. As you go, just make sure you document what you're doing so that other people can follow and share you code so you can reproduce your work.
