I suggest you organize all your data in a user-readable way and ask the user where he wants it stored on his computer (using one or many XML files). This way the user can store the XML files wherever he likes and understand what they do. He can use them to share his "library" with others, he can apply changes to these XML files manually, he could even make his own program which uses the same file (some kind of add-on to your own program).
