I'd be inclined to treat it as a Bayesian problem. If you do that, you end up with the ratio of posterior probabilities of the two multinomials being the likelihood ratio times the ratio of prior probabilities $P(M_1|x_1,x_2,...)/P(M_2|x_1,x_2,...) = P(x_1,x_2,...|M_1)/P(x_1,x_2,...|M_2)\times P(M_1)/P(M_2)$ Assuming your prior probabilities are both 0.5, you just get the likelihood ratio. $P(x_1,x_2,...|M_1)/P(x_1,x_2,...|M_2) = {\Lambda}_{12}$ From that and the fact that the posterior probabilities sum to 1, you can back out the two posterior probabilities: $P(M_2|x_1,x_2,...) =1/[1+\Lambda_{12}]$ $P(M_1|x_1,x_2,...) =1-1/[1+\Lambda_{12}]$ (And if the prior probabilities aren't equal, it's only a simple additional term in the calculation). From here you can figure out what the chances are for concluding correctly at some sample size. If you set some cutoff for what constitutes 'high probability', you can find a suitable $n$.
