What's SHAP contribution dependency plots from xgboost package in R?

clf = xgboost(data.matrix(train2), label = train$MACROSOMIA,objective = "binary:logistic", nrounds = 20) pred = predict(clf, data.matrix(test[, -12])) xgb.plot.shap(data.matrix(test2), model = clf, plot_loess =TRUE,features= "GESTAC") This is my code, and I get a SHAP feature contribution to prediction dependencies on feature value. I just have a hard time understanding it. I wonder what is it? How do I interpret it? Here's a link ! Could you help me understand what does this plot mean? xgb.plot.shap()
