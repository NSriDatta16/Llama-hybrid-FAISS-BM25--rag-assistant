Interestingly, Fiddler started to show HTTPS requests today. The Flex app behaves like it couldn't access the server side (which is probably because the response from Fiddler is signed with a self-signed certificate which Flash Player correctly recognizes as different than the target site certificate) but still, the HTTP request has been sent already and is visible via Fiddler. Also, Robert Bak suggested that Charles Proxy can use the target site's certificate which I guess would be by far the best method (I didn't try it as the Fiddler experiment already proved enough for us).
