Do Organizational culture and social power bases interact to determine follower outcomes or should I study a moderation effect?

I am writing my dissertation on the "Effects of Social Power Bases within Varying Organizational Culture." I keep writing that I am looking at how organizational culture and social power bases will interact to determine follower outcomes of compliance and commitment. However, I am confused as to whether I should actually be studying whether organizational culture is a moderator of the relationship between the power bases and the follower outcomes, which relationships have been widely studied in the literature. Any advice you can give would be greatly appreciated.
