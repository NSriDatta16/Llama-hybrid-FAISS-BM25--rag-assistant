Your 25 questions are ordinal; you can look at correlations among them using rank correlation. Similarly for their correlation with age. Gender and race are nominal variables (depending on how you code gender) and therefore, you can't use correlations with them. Do you mean association? Or, perhaps you want to somehow combine the 25 questions into one or more scales and then see if those scale scores relate to demographics? That would be regression. Or, if you want to see how each individual question among your 25 relates to the demographics, you probably want ordinal logistic regression. Dichotomizing any of the variables is not recommended, it leads to loss of power and information and increases both type I and type II error.
