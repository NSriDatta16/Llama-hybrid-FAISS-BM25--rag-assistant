How do I fire an intent to start a flv or swf to Flash Player 10.1?

I have a bunch of flv video files stored on a media server , and I am trying to get them to launch in the flash player. Have been looking around but haven't found much help. I have downloaded the flv file into temporary storage, and try passing it using an intent . This is what my code looks like (from what I have seen on the net): try{ URL urlLink = new URL("http://206.188.19.131/p4p101.flv"); // Serve the file InputStream in = urlLink.openStream(); FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream("/sdcard/tempFlash.flv"); byte[] buf = new byte[4 * 1024]; // 4K buffer int bytesRead; while ((bytesRead = in.read(buf)) != -1) { fos.write(buf, 0, bytesRead); } fos.close(); in.close(); } catch(Exception e){} try{ Intent intent = new Intent(); intent.setAction(android.content.Intent.ACTION_VIEW); File file = new File("/sdcard/tempFlash.flv"); intent.setDataAndType(Uri.fromFile(file), "flash/*"); startActivity(intent); } catch (ActivityNotFoundException e) { Toast toast = Toast.makeText(this, "No apps to launch activity", 1000); toast.show(); }
