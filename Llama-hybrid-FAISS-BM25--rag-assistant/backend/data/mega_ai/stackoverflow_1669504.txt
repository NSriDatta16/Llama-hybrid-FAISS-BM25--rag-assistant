In summary, here's what you want: If someone has input a value, display the value in the textbox, if someone hasn't entered a value (the value is null ) display a blank. Unfortunately there isn't a way that I could find to do this naturally, so you have to do the following: 1. Use an Integer on your form for those properties, set these values from the database so that they are null or the actual value. 2. On your jsp you will have to hand craft the input tag like so: '/> Where FORM_NAME is your form's name and PROPERTY_NAME is the name of your Integer property. It's not elegant, but it should work (I haven't tested it though)
