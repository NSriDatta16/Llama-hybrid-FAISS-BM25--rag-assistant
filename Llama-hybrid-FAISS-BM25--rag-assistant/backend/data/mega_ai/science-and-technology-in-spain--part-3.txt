Radiation Facility. Institut Laue-Langevin. ISIS, pulsed neutron and muon source. CERN. Scientific and technological fields Spain was ranked 28th in the Global Innovation Index in 2024. Physics In 2020 Pablo Jarillo-Herrero was awarded the Wolf Prize in Physics, considered the prelude to the Nobel Prize. In 2009 Juan Ignacio Cirac was nominated for the same prestigious award for his research in quantum computing and quantum optics. Chemistry Among the Spanish contributions to chemistry are the research of Francisco Mojica that led to the birth of the CRISPR gene editing technique, a term he personally coined. Mariano Barbacid is one of the most internationally recognized biochemists, among his contributions is that he managed to isolate the human H-ras oncogene in bladder carcinoma. This was an incredible breakthrough in the study of the molecular basis of cancer. He currently directs the Spanish National Cancer Research Centre (CNIO). Mathematics In 2020, Spain ranked seventh in the world in terms of scientific impact in Mathematics. Internationally, centers such as the Institute of Mathematical Sciences (ICMAT), founded in 2007, and the Basque Center for Applied Mathematics (BCAM), founded in 2008, stand out. Carlos Beltrán solved Smale's Problem number 17, finding a probabilistic algorithm with polynomial complexity, and published his solution in 2009. Medicine Michael Servetus described in the 16th century the pulmonary circulation of the blood. Francisco Romero in 1801 performed the first heart operation. Spain has a Nobel Prize in Medicine, Santiago Ramón y Cajal (1906), pioneer in the description of the functioning of the nervous system. Others were on the verge of being nominated, such as Jaime Ferrán y Clúa, discoverer of the cholera vaccine, which put an end to the epidemic that devastated Spain in the 19th century. He would later develop vaccines for tetanus, typhoid, tuberculosis and rabies. Also nominated were José Gómez Ocaña and August Pi i Sunyer. In the 19th century, the Balmis Expedition was the first international health expedition in history, with the aim of bringing the smallpox vaccine to all continents, a disease that was causing thousands of deaths of children worldwide. In 1921, surgeon Fidel Pagés developed the epidural anesthesia technique. The engineer Manuel Jalón Corominas invented the disposable hypodermic needle. Today Pedro Cavadas is internationally recognized for his milestones in transplant surgery. Engineering The galleon, a Spanish invention, enabled the birth of the Spanish Empire and its conquest of the seas. Narcís Monturiol, inventor of air-independent propulsion, and Isaac Peral were among the creators of the submarine. Juan de la Cierva invented the articulated rotor and the autogyro, precursor of the helicopter. In 1907, Leonardo Torres Quevedo (1852–1936) started up the world's first aerial lift for passengers on Mount Ulía in San Sebastián. Biology and biotechnology In the biotechnology sector, institutions such as the National Biotechnology Center, companies such as PharmaMar and Zendal and researchers such as Mariano Esteban stand out. Nuclear energy Spain currently has generation II nuclear reactors, with the most advanced countries developing the generation IV reactor. It can be said that the father of nuclear energy in Spain was José María Otero de Navascués. Today the Center for Energy, Environmental and Technological Research (CIEMAT) is the main Spanish research center in this area, which has the TJ-II stellarator, and is planning a successor, the TJ-III. Pablo Rodríguez Fernández is a leading researcher in the race for nuclear fusion. Granada is a candidate to host IFMIF-DONES from 2030 onwards. Computer science Hardware and electronics Ramón Verea (1833–1899) created the first mechanical calculator capable of direct multiplication. Leonardo Torres Quevedo (1852–1936) created modern wireless remote-control operation principles and analog calculating machines that could so
