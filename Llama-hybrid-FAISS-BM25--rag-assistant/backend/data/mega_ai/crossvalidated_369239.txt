The PC scores are in inherently on different scales; we can actually find the scale of each one by checking its corresponding eigenvalue. That said, no, do not normalise the PC scores . The suggestion you read relates to original input data prior to PCA. Given that your current input data are already valid PCA scores (i.e. created using a normalised sample as input) there is no reason to renormalise them again. If anything that will distort their importance. Usual t-SNE implementations perform a PCA step internally to bring the dimensionality of the input data to a reasonable number. In R, the Rtsne::Rtsne() function by default uses $50$ dimensions as a "reasonable number of dimensions", in the 2008 and 2014 JMLR papers by van der Maaten this number is $30$ . In any case though, we already provide PC scores as input we can skip that step. Performing PCA on PC scores will result to identical outputs (up to the sign).
