The url fragment (the part after #) is never passed to the server and so the PHP script would never see it. The way you can handle it is using javascript on callback page which would take the url's hash part and post it to another page as query string parameter. callback1.php var h = window.location.hash; window.location = 'http://example.com/callback2.php?'+h; callback2.php Although I'd suggest you have a look at Facebook Javascript and PHP SDK for what you're trying to do. All the basic oAuth functionality is already built in there.
