How many are many, one million? The built in List .Sort() takes O(n * log(n)) on average. log2(10^6) ~=20, that is not very much slower than O(n) for 10^6 elements. If your strings are more than 20 characters long radix sort O(n * k) will be "slower". I doubt a radix sort will be significantly faster than the built in sort. But it would be fun to measure and compare.
