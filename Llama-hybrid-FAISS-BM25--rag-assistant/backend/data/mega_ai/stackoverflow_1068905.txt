I've worked on a number of these... at early stages of just trying to get all the players in the same room to actually building out something that was "agreed" upon. No matter what happens, who does it, how it comes about, etc, etc, it's painful. The problem within an existing organization is that each group - sometimes department, sometimes product team - has developed their own tools and methods for getting the job done. No matter how inefficient or out of date it might be, it's theirs . If you can get these people willing to check out the system, that's a starting point. The next problem you'll run into is that each team does things a bit differently, has different jargon for the same things, and wants to store/interact with the information a bit differently. While this doesn't seem like a huge thing, it is. The complexity compounds with each and every group you add to the mix. And if you think "well, I'll start with this group and add more and more groups as I go!", it doesn't quite work that way. Once you launch it with one group (sales?), the other groups will see it as the "sales system" and be adverse to doing it. Trust me... there are reasons why ERP-type system runs into the 10's of M's... it's not all technical, lots has to deal with the willingness to put up with this crap.
