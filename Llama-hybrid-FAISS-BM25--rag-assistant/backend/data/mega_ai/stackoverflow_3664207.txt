More elegant way of adding a percentage?

I'm wondering if there is a more elegant way of adding a percentage. For example, if I wanted to add 12% of $a 's value to $a I'm doing: $a = 100; $a = $a + (($a / 100) * 12); Which gives me 112 as the new value, of course. But I can't help but feel this is a little too verbose and there must be a better way of doing the percentage addition. I tried: $a = $a + 12%; But, as expected this doesn't work. Before I consider writing a function myself to make this easier, is there a pre-existing way to do this?
