Java: Cut item from JTree with lazy-deleting

I've implemented Drag'n'Drop and CCP on my JTree (I've created my Transferable and TransferHandler classes). By default Cut action (CTRL-X or SHIFT+DELETE keys) delete item from JTree (JTreeModel), but I want just to mark it with gray color and delete it only after Paste action . How could I make Cut action to avoid deleting items? I don't know all the magic of swing DnD, but it looks like Cut action is implemented in TransferHandler.getCutAction()
