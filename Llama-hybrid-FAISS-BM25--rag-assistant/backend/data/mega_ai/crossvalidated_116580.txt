Calculate sample statistics for estimated parameters of a model

How some standard package (eg R, SAS or Excel) calculate Standard error for the estimated parameters for a model. my understanding : While using gradient descent optimization method( as performed in Machine learning tutorial from Andrew Ng) we get a point estimate (right?) But suppose I have to find the confidence interval of the estimated parameters we'll have to form multiple samples using bootstrap(or any other method?) to find parameters for each sample. Then we can calculate the sample mean , std error and thus call Z-score to calculate the confidence interval of the estimate. Am I thinking in the correct direction?
