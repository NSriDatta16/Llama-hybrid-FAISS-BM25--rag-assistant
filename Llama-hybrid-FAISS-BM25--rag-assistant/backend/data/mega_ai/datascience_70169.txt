A the end of a big DS project, should I make trained models available on GitHub?

I almost completed two big Data Science personal projects based on Deep Learning. They are the fanciest models I've implemented up to now, and I'm pushing all my code on GitHub. Do you advice to upload trained models too? Or should I let other users run the code and get their own? What do you do? What are pros and cons?
