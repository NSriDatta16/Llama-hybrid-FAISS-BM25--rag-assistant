it really depends on the learning to rank algorithm you are going to use. I suggest you to study it and evaluate how the queryId is affecting it. It could be that the queryIds are used to group training entries and optimize the model per query. It could be that the queryIds are used to group the test data and an average of the test score per query is then returned. I will use LambdaMART and I have no queries. This means that I will generate the queryId pseudo randomly or with similar approach. Cheers
