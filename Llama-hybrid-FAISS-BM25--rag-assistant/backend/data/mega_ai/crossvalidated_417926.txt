Ratio as independent variable for logistic regression

I am trying to model the association between "previous 2 year history of no shows for consult (independent variable)" with current no shows (dependent variable) using a logistic regression model. The independent variable is measured as: $\dfrac{number \thinspace of \thinspace missed \thinspace appointments \thinspace * 100 \thinspace }{total \thinspace number \thinspace of \thinspace appointments}$ The dependent variable is binary (Yes/No). The Odds Ratio we observe = 14.05 The independent variable will be 0% for those who do not miss any appointments. Questions: What does this odds ratio tell us? Is it ok to use the independent variable as a ratio ? If answer on Question 2 is no, how can we model the independent variable?
