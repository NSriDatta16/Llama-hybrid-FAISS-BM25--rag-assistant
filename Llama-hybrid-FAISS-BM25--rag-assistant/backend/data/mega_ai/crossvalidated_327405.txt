Unsupervised learning examples in Matlab

I am trying to classify ECG data into abnormal and normal using unsupervised learning methods in Matlab. The problem is that whilst I am used to supervised learning algorithms, I have never seen how unsupervised neural networks look like in Matlab. Anyone with advice on what first steps I should take, what are the best features to extract, a tutorial or even any example of such a network?
