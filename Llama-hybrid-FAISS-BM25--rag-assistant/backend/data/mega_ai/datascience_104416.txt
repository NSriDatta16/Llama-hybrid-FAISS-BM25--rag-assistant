I asked this question as I was unsure if it was possible for a Deep Learning model to generalise with good results across such diverse aerial imagery. I have since ran experiments with 20 plus national aerial imagery data sets training a model to extract buildings footprints from imagery. Using a resnet101 there was no issue in training and predicting on imagery datasets that had varying resolution (5-30cm was tested), colour properties and geographies. Better prediction results were achieved with the higher resolution imagery datasets. This was put down to the extra detail about buildings provided in the high res data sets. The greatest difficulty was false positives in unique landscapes that made up the background class (i,e not building). This was as initially the more unique landscapes were not in the training data and predictions across these images with these landscape resulted in (buildings) false positives. This was easily managed by adding example images of these background classes to the training data. One the machine had seen this context in training, the false positives were removed.
