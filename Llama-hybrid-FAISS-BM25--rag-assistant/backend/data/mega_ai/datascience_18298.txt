There are very good suggestions made above regarding the problem. In another approach, (somewhat similar but not same as PCA based menthods mentioned above) is to use an compressional autoencoder network and train it classwise (or one autoencoder). The compression can be from multi-dimension to 2 dimensions and can be easily plotted. Since the autoencoder(s) would learn to represent different classes, if the features selected for the original dataset can partition the data space adequately, then in a 2D scatter plot the differences could be made out.
