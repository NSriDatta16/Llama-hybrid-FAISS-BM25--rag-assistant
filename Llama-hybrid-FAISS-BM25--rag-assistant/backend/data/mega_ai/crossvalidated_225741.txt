The most obvious reason is that there is often no time sequence in the values. So if you jumble the data, it makes no difference in the information conveyed by the data. If we follow your method, then every time you jumble the data you get a different sample variance. The more theoretical answer is that sample variance estimates the true variance of a random variable. The true variance of a random variable $X$ is $$E\left[ (X - EX)^2 \right]. $$ Here $E$ represents expectation or "average value". So the definition of the variance is the average squared distance between the variable from its average value. When you look at this definition, there is no "time order" here since there is no data. It is just an attribute of the random variable. When you collect iid data from this distribution, you have realizations $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$. The best way to estimate the expectation is to take the sample averages. The key here is that we got iid data, and thus there is no ordering to the data. The sample $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$ is the same as the sample $x_2, x_5, x_1, x_n..$ EDIT Sample variance measures a specific kind of dispersion for the sample, the one that measures the average distance from the mean. There are other kinds of dispersion like range of data, and Inter-Quantile range. Even if you sort your values in ascending order, that does not change the characteristics of the sample. The sample (data) you get are realizations from a variable. Calculating the sample variance is akin to understanding how much dispersion is in the variable. So for example, if you sample 20 people, and calculate their height, then those are 20 "realizations" from the random variable $X = $ height of people. Now the sample variance is supposed to measure the variability in the height of individuals in general. If you order the data $$ 100, 110, 123, 124, \dots,$$ that does not change the information in the sample. Lets look at one more example. lets say you have 100 observations from a random variable ordered in this way $$1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, ... 100.$$ Then the average subsequent distance is 1 units, so by your method the variance will be 1. The way to interpret "variance" or "dispersion" is to understand what range of values are likely for the data. In this case you will get a range of .99 unit, which of course does not represent the variation well. If instead of taking average you just sum the subsequent differences, then your variance will be 99. Of course that does not represent the variability in the sample, because 99 gives you the range of the data, not a sense of variability.
