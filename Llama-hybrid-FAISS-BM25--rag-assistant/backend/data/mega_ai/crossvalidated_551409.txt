Consistency of Posterior

I have a conceptual question regarding the definition of the consistency of a Bayesian posterior. I found this definition on the web: Given the i.i.d. data $x_1,...,x_n$ and the model $f_\theta(x)$ , the posterior distribution $\Pi_n$ is consistent if $$\forall \epsilon >0 \lim_{n\to\infty}\Pi_n(|\theta - \theta_0|>\epsilon)\to 0,$$ where $\theta_0$ is the true parameter. Is this the right definition? I don't understand how the "true" parameter $\theta_0$ can be used as a constant in a Bayesian setting, because I read that the distinction to the frequentist approach is, that in a Bayesian setting the parameter is conceptualized as a random variable and not a constant. Thank you very much in advance!
