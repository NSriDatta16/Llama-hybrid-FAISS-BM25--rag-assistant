There's not much info out there, as you've found. What you can do is have a look at the following three links, hopefully they'll cover everything you may still wish to learn: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb310772.aspx - Information on the Extensible Storage Engine Architecture. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms683068%28EXCHG.10%29.aspx - Extensible Storage Engine Files; lists other file types associated with the Extensible storage engine. http://everything.explained.at/Extensible_Storage_Engine - Extensible Storage Engine Explained. Hope that helps!
