Which machine learning algorithms can be scaled using hadoop/map-reduce

Scalable machine learning algorithms seem like the buzz these days. Every company is handling nothing short of big data . Is there a textbook which discusses what machine learning algorithms can be scaled using parallel architectures like Map-Reduce, and which algorithms cannot? Or some relevant papers?
