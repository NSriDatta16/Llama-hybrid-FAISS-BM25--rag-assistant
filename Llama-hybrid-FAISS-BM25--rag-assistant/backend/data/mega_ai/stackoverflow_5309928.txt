The actual name of the foreign key field doesn't matter much; it's mostly for documentation. The usual naming convention for tables is that they are the plural of whatever each row represents, while the column name is the singular. The tables are tied together by specifying a foreign key constraint in the dependent table (comments, in your example). Be aware that the storage engine used for each table affects whether the foreign key constraint is enforced by the system. The default MyISAM storage engine does not enforce constraints; the InnoDB storage engine does.
