Enter key is not doing what it's supposed to on a subform, ideas?

I'm calling the subform with the following command: var frm: TForm2; begin try frm := TForm2.Create(Application); frm.ShowModal; finally frm.Free; end; end; There's a Rich Edit inside that subform, however, when I press [enter] it acts as a Tab key and switches focus (This is true to all subforms I create inside this particular application, nothing to do with RichEdit itself). Notes : I tried RichEdit.WantReturns true/false, RichEdit.WanTabs true/false, and KeyPreview true/false on the main and subform. My thoughts : The main form does not have any onkey events at all, the ancestor forms does have but nothing to do with [enter]. Since the code is gigantic there might be a place somewhere specifying enter to act as tab, however that'd be too difficult to find. So I just figured if there is a way to make enter act like enter it'd be easier. Any ideas? Thank you ! EDIT I found the problem buried deep within a remote .pas file. if Msg.wParam = 13 then begin //bunch of code Msg.wParam := 9; //Ta-da Thank you everyone for the support.
