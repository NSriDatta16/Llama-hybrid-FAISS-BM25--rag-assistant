This is a strong argument why you should never use a discontinuous improper accuracy scoring rule. It should also be a clue that any scoring rule that tempts you to remove data from the sample has to be bogus. If you were truly interested in all-or-nothing classification then just ignore all the data and predict that an observation is always in the majority class. Better would be to develop a probability model (e.g., logistic regression) and use a proper accuracy score to assess the model's value (logarithmic probability scoring rule = deviance = log-likelihood = pseudo $R^2$ for this purpose; Brier score).
