Indeed, the ANSI SQL standard is not often followed. Just read SO: most SQL threads never refer to the standard while, for instance, discussions on network protocols often include the actual quote, chapter and verse of the relevant RFC. I always suspected that one of the reasons is the fact that the SQL standard is not freely distributable. Simply getting it is not trivial. Various unofficial copies float around.) Another reason is that it is a very complicated text and poorly organized. It uses a strange vocabulary (such as "authID" instead "user"). You need books just to understand the standard ("A guide to the SQL standard", C.J. Date, Hugh Darwen - Addison-Wesley).
