So my question is what is going on here? There must be some type of memory fragementation happening internally with the virtual memory manager, because allocating 100mbs memory mapped files will consume up to the 30gb of the system page file (commit limit). Sounds about right. If you don't need large contiguous chunks of memory, don't ask for them if you can get the same amount of memory in smaller chunks. To find the largest possible memory map size I can allocate on my machine. Try it with size X. If that fails, try with size X/2 and repeat. This gets you a chunk at runtime, maybe not the exact largest possible chunk, but within a factor of 2.
