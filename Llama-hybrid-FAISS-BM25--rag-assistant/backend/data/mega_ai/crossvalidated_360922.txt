OLS with Lagged DV

I am interested in building an OLS model with a lagged (lag 1) DV as a right-side explanatory variable. This is relatively straightforward in R, however my problem is the rest of the data. I have six separate data frames of countries that each measure the same three variables of interest (lets say: Y, $X_1$, $X_2$), and these dataframes fall into one of two categories (1 or 2). It has been suggested to me that I pool all of these countries together into one model and include a dummy variable as opposed to running a model on each dataframe. However, I am unclear as to how to pool the time series data in such a way that maintains the structure (i.e., maintaining the categories of each country). It seems that any configuration will involve multiple variables for each country and not at all what has been suggested. Is it best to add the variables data together and simply have one summed column of data per category per variable? Or, is it the case that the only data that needs to be in time-series format is the DV and the other data ($X_1$ and $X_2$) can be in non-time-series format?
