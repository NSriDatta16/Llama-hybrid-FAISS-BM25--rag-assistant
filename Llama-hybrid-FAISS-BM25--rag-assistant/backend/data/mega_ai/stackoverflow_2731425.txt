C# Drag and Drop - e.Data.GetData using a base class

I am using C# and Winforms 3.5 I have a list of user controls all derived from one base class. These controls can be added to various panels and I'm trying to implement the drag-drop functionality, the problem I'm running in to is on the DragDrop event. For DragEventArgs e.Data.GetData(typeof(baseClass)) doesn't work. It wants: e.Data.GetData(typeof(derivedClass1)) e.Data.GetData(typeof(derivedClass2)) etc... Is there a way I can get around this, or a better way to architect it?
