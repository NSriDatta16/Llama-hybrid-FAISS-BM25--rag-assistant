Twilight Dragon Media track and regularly release GCC releases usable for MinGW environments. The current release is based on GCC 4.3.2. The packages can be downloaded here . I've started using the 4.3.2-TDM1 release in production after testing it extensively for over two months. The only iffy thing I hit is cross-DLL exceptions in C++, but C++ exceptions have been broken in MinGW for ages and most of our code doesn't use them anyway, or ar least doesn't use them across library boundaries. There's a more recent release available (4.3.2-TDM2, been out for a couple of days). The release notes say it "differs from the first only in two bugs that have been fixed -- one related to temporary files and one related to header paths. A new TDM/MinGW installer has been released concurrently." Haven't tested it yet, though. Edit: 4.3.3-TDM1 appears to be stable so far - haven't come across any errors in pre-production use. After having tested it exensively, I can recommend 4.3.2-TDM2 for production use.
