For this kind of analysis I have used LingPipe: http://alias-i.com/lingpipe/index.html . It is an open source Java library, parts of which I use directly or port. To incorporate your own data, you may use a classifier, such as naive bayes, in conjunction. my experiences with statistical nlp is limited, but it usually follows a cycle of setting up classifiers, training, and looking over results, tweaking.
