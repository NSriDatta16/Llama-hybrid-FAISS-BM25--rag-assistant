Regarding the mechanics of how to do it, it looks like the MSIE conditional comments will allow you to handle that. Regarding the wording, be cautious. You don't want to annoy people, even if you don't support their browser. You should probably recommend something like "This site works best using Firefox, Safari, Opera or Chrome". If your site will work under MSIE but not as elegantly, then say so - carefully. One of the internal corporate sites I have to use does not support Firefox on MacOS X (and it renders lousily in the browser - I've not investigated why; it works fine with Firefox on XP, but I only occasionally boot the XP machine these days, mainly to keep it more or less up to date with security patches). It pops up a dialogue box telling me as much, but allows me to continue. The stuff works - it just looks rotten.
