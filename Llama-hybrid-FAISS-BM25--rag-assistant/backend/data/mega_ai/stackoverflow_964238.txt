How should the Joel Test be updated for 2010?

I believe the Joel Test was written in 2000. It is time for an update to more align with modern times. I'll start: Do you use source control? changed to Do you have quality gates in place for each check-in? Many of the Joel Test assumptions are no longer true. I don't think we need to ask today if an organization uses source control, contains a bug database, or has a "spec". On the other hand, some of the Joel test items are as relevant as ever: up-to-date schedule and state-of-the-art tools. Help me update the list for 2010 so I can take it to management once again.
