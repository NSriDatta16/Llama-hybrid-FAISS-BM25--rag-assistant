Notation If your notation refers to R, when using * for interaction terms, both the main effect and the interaction are included in the model. In this regards, model 2 and model 3 will be equivalent. If you only want to specify the interaction terms (under the form of an equation), then you should consider to include the main effect as explained by Franck Harrel here: Including the interaction but not the main effects in a model Including all levels of categorical variable As stated by Robert Long here: changing reference level , the difference between model 1 and model 2 (including giraffe ) will not change your results... but only the way you interpret them. In your first model, giraffe will be included in your intercept (as reference) and other coefficients will be interpreted based on this reference. For example, the coefficient for lion will represent the variation (increase/decrease) in happiness score compared to giraffe . On the other hand, your second model will specify the "direct effect" of each spicy on the outcome happiness (i.e. intercept from model 1 + coefficient of lion ).
