plot(forecast(fit,h=12)) ets() fitted an ETS(M,A,M) model. That is: a multiplicative error, additive trend and multiplicative seasonality model. Multiplicative errors and multiplicative seasonalities, especially fitted off very small baselines, can leverage up and explode. As you just saw. When I'm done here, I'll be off to downvote Rob's post that gave you the idea of adding a small epsilon to your zeros. You have so-called intermittent data. It's much better to use a dedicated forecasting method in such a case, rather than ETS. One such method is Croston's method . Alternatively, if you can reasonably assume that the data generating process does not change over time, you can simply assume your data are IID and fit a Poisson distribution to your entire history. (Croston's method addresses a time changing DGP, but I wouldn't even be sure you can detect such dynamics with only three years of daily data.)
