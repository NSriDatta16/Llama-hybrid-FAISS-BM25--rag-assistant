Logistic regression - specific hypothesis

I am doing a logistic model explaining if the physical health of a person has been impacted or not during COVID. To do that, I am using many socio-demographics factors as sex, income, education level, and ethnicity. My hypothesis is that women with low income, less education, and are non-white are more impacted than other groups. How can I test this specific hypothesis ?
