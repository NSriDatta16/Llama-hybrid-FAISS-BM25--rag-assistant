I recently designed a new repository and struggled with this same question. I ended up including my additional methods in the repository. Looking back at it now though, I feel that a better solution would have been to keep my repository more focused, and to have put my additional methods into a Service that integrated closely with my repository. For your example above, you could then have a "DeleteProductImage" method in ProductsService that would call ProductsRepository.DeleteImage & then also handle deleting the images from the storage medium. This keeps your Repository clean and focused on just the "DeleteImage" logic, while still giving you a single method you need to call ("DeleteProductImage") which takes care of calling the repository to delete the image while also handling interacting with the storage medium and any other things that may need to happen when an Image is deleted that aren't directly related to your repository.
