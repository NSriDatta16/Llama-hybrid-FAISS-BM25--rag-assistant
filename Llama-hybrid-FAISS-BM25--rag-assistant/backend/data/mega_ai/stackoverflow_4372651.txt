NFS isn't about mounting a directory on software but mounting a remote share on a directory. Whether the storage device is remote or not doesn't matter that much, it is still through layers of kernel software. Solaris use VFS to provide the first layer. You should implement the underlying one. That would be quite a difficult task for someone already familiar with VFS. As you obviously are not familiar with writing kernel code, I would be very pessimistic about your project ... What I would suggest you to do instead would be a simpler and less risky approach. Implement an interposition library that would intercept the application I/O code (open, read, write, close, and the likes or perhaps libc fopen, fwrite, you have to figure out what is the best location to interpose) and call your storage software instead. Here is a simple example of the process: http://developers.sun.com/solaris/articles/lib_interposers.html
