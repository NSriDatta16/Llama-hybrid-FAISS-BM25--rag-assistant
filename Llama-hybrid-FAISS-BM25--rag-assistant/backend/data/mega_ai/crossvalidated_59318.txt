How many measurements should be done?

I am measuring time of a computer operation. The operation should run roughly same time each time I measure it. How many times should I measure it to get good average and standard deviation? originally posted here: https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/64917/how-many-measurements-should-be-done , but I think that this forum is more appropriate for my question
