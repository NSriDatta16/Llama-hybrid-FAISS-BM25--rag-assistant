Machine intelligence programs generally start at the Award level on Mazlow's Hierarchy of Needs because they don't have a way to perceive Physiological, Safety & Security, or Social needs. However... At the physiological level the computer feeds on electricity. Plug in a UPS that tells the computer when it is running on battery and you have a potentially useful input for perceiving physiological needs. Give it the ability to "perceive" that it has "lost time" or has gaps in its time record (due to power failure) and you might be able to introduce the need for Safety and Security. Introduce social needs by making it need to interact. It could "feel" lonely when lots of time passes between inputs from the keyboard. Detecting lost time, time passed since last keyboard interaction, and running on battery could be among the inputs available to the unconscious layer that can periodically be bumped to the attention of the conscious layer. The computer scientists in Two Faces of Tomorrow approach a similar problem, training a computer sandboxed on a satellite to become aware. They give it those needs by, for example, making it aware that it will cease to function without electricity then providing appropriate stimulation and observing the response. The Adolescence of P-1 is another interesting work along these lines.
