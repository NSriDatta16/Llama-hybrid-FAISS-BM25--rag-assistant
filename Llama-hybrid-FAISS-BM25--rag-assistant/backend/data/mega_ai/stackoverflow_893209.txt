Getting list of cities and countries from a SQL Table

I have a SQL table where in each row I store the country and the city of a things location. For example: record1, New York, USA record2, Rome, Italy record3, Milano, Italy record3, Birghiman, UK record4, London, UK record5, London, UK record6, London, UK record7, Birmingham, UK I would like to generate a list that is ordered by country and city, and each city show up only once in the result. I would like to know how to solve this in SQL and Linq To SQL in an elegant way.
