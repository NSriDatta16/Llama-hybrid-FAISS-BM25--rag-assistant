I get this occasionally across Google's services. They seem to have code that tries to pick up bots doing things they shouldn't, and asks you to confirm you're not a bot. I'm sure Google will never tell us the factors they're using to decide this, but it could include things like IP address, user agent, speed of requests, etc. I'd recommend posting it in the App Engine Group , since Google staff frequently stop by, and can probably flag it to be looged at.
