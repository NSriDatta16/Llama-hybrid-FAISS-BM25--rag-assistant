Why is there a difference between chi-square and logistic regression?

I have two categorical variables: gender (male & female) and eye color (blue, brown, & other). And I also have age. I used the chi-square test and the multinomial logistic regression. When doing the chi-squared test, I set gender vs eye color. The Pearson Chi-Square and Likelihood Ratio p-values were not significant, meaning there is no association between the two. The Linear-by-Linear Association, was significant though, meaning there is an association between the two. Could this be explained to me, I'm not sure why these are different . In addition, I also ran the multinomial logistic regression. Eye color was my dependent variable, while gender and age were my independent variables. Eye color = Gender + Age When looking through the Parameter Estimates table (other and male are the reference categories), I see that female is significant in relation to blue, but it's not significant in relation to brown. Is this normal to have the chi-square say there is no association between the categorical variables, but the logistic regression say that there is a significant association? If not, what is happening? { I am using SPSS }
