You could rank your observations and report the proportion of ranked values in each of the group and say something like, Proportion of higher ranked values in A > Proportion of higher ranked values in B. Visualising the mean rank helps. Here is a resource that helped me: Kruskal–Wallis test: compare more then two groups by Dr. Yury Zablotski . As you can see, the mean (in red) and the median (in blue) of group salaries are showing similar trend, but neither of them catches the high-salaries-bump of “Advanced” education group. The mean-rank (in black) does. If you are specifically looking to answer a question like this: Is the performance of A better than performance of B, or does A have higher proportion of greater scores (values) than B, then the Vargha Delaney A effect size measure might be one way to go. Here are a couple of resources: 1. A nice blog post talking about when and how to use it Instead, we could use the Vargha-Delaney A measure, which tells us how often, on average, one technique outperforms the other. When applied to two populations (like the results of our two techniques), the A measure is a value between 0 and 1: when the A measure is exactly 0.5, then the two techniques achieve equal performance; when A is less than 0.5, the first technique is worse; and when A is more than 0.5, the second technique is worse. The closer to 0.5, the smaller the difference between the techniques; the farther from 0.5, the larger the difference. Vargha and Delaney's paper Note: It only compares two groups
