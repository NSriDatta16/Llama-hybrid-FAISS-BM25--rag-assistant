You can't connect between nibs but if those nibs share a controller you can connect through that controller. In addition, as you create these new windows you can pass in the NSManagedObjectContext to the new nib and then bind to it. As an example, if you had the NSManagedObjectContext configured in your AppDelegate (most common) then you could pass that NSManagedObjectContext to the next window as the AppDelegate creates it. In the nib associated with that window, you can then set up a binding to that NSManagedObjectContext property on the window's controller and bind to it. update Any object can be referenced across nibs so long as it is in your controllers somewhere. However referencing array controllers across windows is a bad design in general. If you want the selected item passed around then consider passing around just the object using notifications or something. Hard wiring everything is very fragile and an indication that there is something wrong with the design. MVC and dependency injection are the two designs you should be aiming towards in general.
