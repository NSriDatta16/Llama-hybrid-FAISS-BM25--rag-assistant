Need help to determine if a poisson.test in R is the best approach and how to do it?

Hi supposed I have 1000 bins. On average each bin has 100 blue balls and 20 yellow balls. What I like to do is to test whether each bin has significantly more blue or yellow ball than the average. For example, if bin x has 200 blue balls and 25 yellow balls I would like to know if this bin has blue or yellow ball then it is by chance? is this is a good case use of a poisson test. I tried looking at how R does but a bit confused how to set it up since there were no good examples. to test for the blue ball in bin X is it as simple as poisson.test(200, r = 100) ? thanks in advance.
