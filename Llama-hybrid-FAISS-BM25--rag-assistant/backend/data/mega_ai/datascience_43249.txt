No, you shouldn't have the same numbers. All depends on the additional parameters: tf.metrics.auc( labels, predictions, weights=None, num_thresholds=200, metrics_collections=None, updates_collections=None, curve='ROC', name=None, summation_method='trapezoidal' ) This means that this curve will have 200 points, so very smooth. sklearn version doesn't have this kind of parameters: roc_auc_score(y_true, y_score, average=’macro’, sample_weight=None, max_fpr=None) The number of outputs depends on the curve and the number of points if I remember properly.
