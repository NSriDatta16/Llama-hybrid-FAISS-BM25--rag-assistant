Adding Event Listeners to an Array that Execute Drag and Drop Functions in AS3

This is my first real programming endeavor and this is the last thing holding my little project back from being a success. My goal with this code is to add event listeners to an array of Movie Clips that will drag and drop them on the stage. Here is the code: var itemBank:Array = new Array(d1_anim.drawer1.test01.movieClip_1, d1_anim.drawer1.test01.movieClip_2); for(var i:int = 0; i Right now the MC does not drag and the trace statement says: pickUp added to [object MovieClip] EDIT: Here is my fla, I give up. I don't know why it wont work. Please help. [Download it here](Edit: removed download link)
