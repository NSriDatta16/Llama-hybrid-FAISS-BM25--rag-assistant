This is a classical application of Statistical Process Control : you use the initial "in control" period to establish detection limits (e.g., by fitting a time series model to the data and calculating a one-step-ahead prediction interval), and whenever the series is outside these limits, you raise an alert. This is actually supervised in a sense: given the data up to time $t$ , you have an expectation for what should happen at time $t+1$ , and if something unexpected happens, up goes the flag. (See here for a motivation for short answers. Longer answers are always welcome.)
