Have you already considered to use localstorage instead? You have 4/5 Mb of space depending of which browser you are using http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/html-css-techniques/quick-tip-learning-about-html5-local-storage/ Anyway on older browser not supporting localstorage I would choose the first solution because cookies are passed with http headers so I'd prefer less cookies solution.
