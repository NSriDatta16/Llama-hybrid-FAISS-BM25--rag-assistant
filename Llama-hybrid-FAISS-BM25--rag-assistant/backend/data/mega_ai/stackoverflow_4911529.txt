Need help with regex and negative match in php

I am trying to match a paragraph: content A simple (.*?) works, but sometimes that paragraph contains another paragraph inside so my pattern matchs after the first paragraph ends and not until the second one. The paragraph that causes me the problem looks like this: something content How can I match the main paragraph ignoring the any other p tags inside that one? I tried (.*?)(? ) But it didn't work. I am using preg_match_all php function.
