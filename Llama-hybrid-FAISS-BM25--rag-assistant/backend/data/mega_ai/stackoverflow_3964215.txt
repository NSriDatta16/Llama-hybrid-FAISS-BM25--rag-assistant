You can't specify a timeout for thread execution. However, you can try to Join each thread with a timeout, and abort it if it doesn't exit. foreach(Thread t in threads) { t.Start(); } TimeSpan timeOut = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10); foreach(Thread t in threads) { if (!t.Join(timeOut)) { // Still not complete after 10 seconds, abort t.Abort(); } } There are of course more elegant ways to do it, like using WaitHandle s with the WaitAll method (note that WaitAll is limited to 64 handles at a time on most implementations, and doesn't work on STA threads, like the UI thread)
