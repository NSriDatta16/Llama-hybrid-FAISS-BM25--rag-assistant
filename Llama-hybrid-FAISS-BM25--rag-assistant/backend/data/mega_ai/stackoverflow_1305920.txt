In your touchesBegan:withEvent: method, create an NSDate object and store it in an instance variable. (For non-debugging purposes, create one date per touch and use CFMutableDictionary to associate the date with the touch.) Then, in touchesEnded:withEvent: , retrieve the stored date and create a new date, and send the latter a timeIntervalSinceDate: message to subtract the older date from it, giving you the result in seconds.
