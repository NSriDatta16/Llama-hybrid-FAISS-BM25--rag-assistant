Java Web Start might be your solution. To start a Java Web Start application, you simply direct the browser to the location of the JNLP file. Basically, the browser detects that instead of simply downloading the file, it should run it in Web Start. Most major browsers support Java Web Start. Java Web Start is cross platform (works on Mac and PC). So, in Javascript, it's done simply like this: window.location = "http://www.examples.com/myapp.jnlp"; You'll also need to sign your Java application, or the user will get a nasty warning.
