Firstly, don't remove atypical values unless you are sure that are out of the study! They may contain some important information (variability). You should drop them if it's obvious that the outlier is due to incorrectly entered or measured data. If you don't know the sampling method used to obtain your data, then you should identify atypical values and their effects as follows: Degree of abnormality: it is expected a 5% of the observations with standarized residuals ($e_i*$) > 2. If you have some more higher residuals you can suspect outliers. Degree of distance to the center gravity in the space of x's: $h_{ii}$ (leverage). When some $h_{ii}$ is very high you have an observation that may distort your model because is out of the range of your study. Degree of influence on the fitted model: Influential points are those which have enough weight to change your model. Then, cofficients of fitted model using all n observations are very different from coefficients of the fitted model using all points but not this observation $i$-th. Cook's distance or Cook's D is a commonly used estimate of the influence of a data point. : $DC_i=ei*^2·h_{ii}/[(1-h_{ii})·p]$ Possible solutions: Transforming variables and / or adding new variables to the model. For influential observations which are nothing but outliers, if not many, you can remove those individuals.
