Creating groups using two continuous variables without using median-splitting?

I have two continuous variables, one of individuals' retrospective childhood anxiety and another regarding their current level of anxiety. Research has demonstrated that during a snapshot of development individuals' trajectory of anxious emotion fall into four groups: increasers (e.g., becomers), decreasers (e.g., escapers), stable-high, and stable-low. I have a small sample (n = 123) of sub clinical undergraduates, and would like to split them into these groups, but have been warned about using a median split (see: On the practice of dichotomization of quantitative variables , pdf ). My questions are: Since my groups are based on previous research can I use a median-split? If not, what are my alternatives? EDIT: The study plans to use a multinomial logistic regression to predict group membership into these groups based on 4 other continuous variables (e.g., measures of behavior, cognitive, and social constructs)
