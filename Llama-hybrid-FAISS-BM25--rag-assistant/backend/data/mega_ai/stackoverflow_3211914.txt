Elegantly check if a given date is yesterday

Assuming you have a Unix timestamp, what would be an easy and/or elegant way to check if that timestamp was some time yesterday? I am mostly looking for solutions in Javascript, PHP or C#, but pseudo code and language agnostic solutions (if any) are welcome as well.
