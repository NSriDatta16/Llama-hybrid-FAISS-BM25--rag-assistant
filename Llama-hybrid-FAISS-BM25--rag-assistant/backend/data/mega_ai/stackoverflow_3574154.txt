Is there a nice Java object to hold a 2D grid of doubles?

Is there a data type that simply holds a 2D grid of doubles? Preferably in the JDK but I'm happy to use an open source 3rd party library like apache commons etc. I'm looking for a class, and/or complimentary helper classes, that allow methods like these: Grid g = new DoubleGrid(100, 100); double min = g.getMinValue(); double someCell = g.getValueAt(x, y); double origin = g.getValueAt(Coordinate.ORIGIN); Ideally, more complicated things like: Grid newGrid = GridTransformer.transform(g, new CellValueSquarer()); I'm completely making these classes up, and I don't need those particular methods per se, It's just an example of the sort of thing I'm looking for...
