If your goal is to detect unusual activity at an hourly level then build a time series model to predict hourly values. This model may include day-of-the-week effects, holiday effects and trends/level shifts among others. A byproduct of this will be the empirical detection of unusual activity (one-time pulses). This list can be shown foe the last 24 hours and will pinpoint the extra-ordinary activity.
