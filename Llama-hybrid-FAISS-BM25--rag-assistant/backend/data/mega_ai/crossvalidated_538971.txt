Weight for Samples on SVM (Support Vector Machine)

there is a option sample_weight in fit(X[, y, sample_weight]) function ( OneClassSVM, sklearn library ). If I use the option sample_weight , I might give some weight to some point(that are likely to be more normal points), right? Otherwise, what does mean the sample_weight ? link: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.OneClassSVM.html#sklearn.svm.OneClassSVM.score_samples
