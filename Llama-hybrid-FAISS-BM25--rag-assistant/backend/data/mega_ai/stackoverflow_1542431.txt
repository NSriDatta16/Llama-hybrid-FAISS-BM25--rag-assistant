If you want to drag a composite widget, you need to have a reference to the "drag handle" wich is one of the elements in the composite widget that implements HasAllMouseHandlers . The easiest (and in my mind, cleanest) way to do this is to have the composite widget extend the interface HasDragHandle wich requires the composite to have the method: Widget getDragHandle(); the interface does not explicitly tell you so but the returned widget must be a widget implementing the HasAllMouseHandlers interface (or you'll get a runtime error). (Non-composite widgets implementing HasAllMouseHandlers can be used directly) I'd reccomend using a Label as a drag handle (it doesn't need to contain any text it could just be styled so the user understands it can be used for dragging), and not a form element because then you're overloading it's behaviour in a way the user most likely won't expect. I'm not really sure how a disabled element would work as a drag handle, quite possibly disabling an element will stop any mouse listners from working to so it won't work as a drag handle (haven't tried it though).
