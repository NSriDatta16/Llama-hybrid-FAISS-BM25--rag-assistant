Model suggestion for "suspicious interactions finding"

Given: 10 nodes (people), it's known that 3 of them are criminals There are n ( My naive plan : create a weighted sum of these matrixes outcome with criminals selection algorithm by result matrix run a ML algorithm on it Issues : which selection algorithm to choose? in case we have complex selection algorithm we have to use reinforcement learning only, am i right? in case we find good selection algorithm and we can use linear regression, how do we represent input and output rather than matrix expansions? Another plans are welcomed
