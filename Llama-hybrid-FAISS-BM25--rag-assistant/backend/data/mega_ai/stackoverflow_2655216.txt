null pointer exception comparing two strings in java

I got this error message and I'm not quite sure whats wrong: Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException at Risk.runTeams(Risk.java:384) at Risk.blobRunner(Risk.java:220) at Risk.genRunner(Risk.java:207) at Risk.main(Risk.java:176) Here is the relevant bits of code (i will draw attention to the line numbers within the error message via comments in the code as well as inputs i put into the program while its running where relevant) public class Risk { ... public static void main (String[]arg) { String CPUcolor = CPUcolor () ; genRunner (CPUcolor) ; //line 176 ... } ... public static void genRunner (String CPUcolor) // when this method runs i select 0 and run blob since its my only option. Theres nothing wrong with this method so long as i know, this is only significant because it takes me to blob runner and because another one of our relelvent line numbers apears. { String[] strats = new String[1] ; strats[0] = "0 - Blob" ; int s = chooseStrat (strats) ; if (s == 0) blobRunner (CPUcolor) ; // this is line 207 } ... public static void blobRunner (String CPUcolor) { System.out.println ("blob Runner") ; int turn = 0 ; boolean gameOver = false ; Dice other = new Dice ("other") ; Dice a1 = new Dice ("a1") ; Dice a2 = new Dice ("a2") ; Dice a3 = new Dice ("a3") ; Dice d1 = new Dice ("d1") ; Dice d2 = new Dice ("d2") ; space (5) ; Territory[] board = makeBoard() ; IdiceRoll (other) ; String[] colors = runTeams(CPUcolor) ; //this is line 220 Card[] deck = Card.createDeck () ; System.out.println (StratUtil.canTurnIn (deck)) ; while (gameOver == false) { idler (deck) ; board = assignTerri (board, colors) ; checkBoard (board, colors) ; } } ... public static String[] runTeams (String CPUcolor) { boolean z = false ; String[] a = new String[6] ; while (z == false) { a = assignTeams () ; printOrder (a) ; boolean CPU = false ; for (int i = 0; i ... } // This } closes the class The reason i don't think i should be getting a Null:pointerException is because in this line: a[i].equals(CPUcolor) a at index i holds a string and CPUcolor is a string. Both at this point definatly have a value neither is null. Can anyone please tell me whats going wrong?
