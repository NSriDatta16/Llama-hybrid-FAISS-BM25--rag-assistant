A centralized source repository using GitHub or your own SVN server should be all you need. Sounds like your development environment has been the Wild West for a while; you just need to get a new sheriff in town. I would also suggest setting up CI if this really is a team environment; TeamCity is, I believe, free for a single-agent installation (Edit: as was commented, it's free for up to 3 agents). It can perform unit and integration testing, code coverage, FxCop analysis, and other automated build tasks based on check-ins to an SVN or other repo. This can be your "sheriff"; any checkins to the repo will be examined by TeamCity and if the build "breaks" TeamCity will be able to call out who checked in the change that broke the build.
