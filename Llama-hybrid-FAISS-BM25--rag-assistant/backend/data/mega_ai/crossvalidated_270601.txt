Your question has several facets including understanding the structure of data that includes sparsity as well as clarifying what is meant by "correlation." Xie and Xing have a nice paper Cauchy Principal Component Analysis which describes a typology (paradigm) of data structures based on whether they are probabilistic or non-probabilistic as well as their sensitivity to noise, denseness and sparsity of the information. They point out that classic Gaussian based PCA is "fragile to noise of large magnitude," and recommend alternative methods including their implementation of Cauchy PCA. I think you need to clarify what you mean by "correlation." A naive assumption is that you are referring to Pearson correlation, a standardized measure of linear association. A less naive and stringent assumption is that you could mean Spearman correlation for ordinal and monotonic association. Many other metrics of association are possible including nonlinear measures of dependence such as maximal correlations, others leveraging reduced kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) such as distance correlations, partial distance correlations, and information theoretic, entropy-based measures such as the Reshef brothers' mutual information criterion (MIC). Once your meaning of the term "correlation" is clarified, then people can begin to address your concerns with magnitudes of association.
