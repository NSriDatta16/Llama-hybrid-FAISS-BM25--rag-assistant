This doesn't seem to be the kind of problem you solve with solver. Why not write a macro that loops through the values of A1, X times, keeping a running sum of the TOTAL values for each A1? When it's all over, the largest sum is also the largest average. The inner loop will be something like this: Redim tSum(1 to maxA1) for i = 1 to maxA1 tSum(i) = 0 for j = 1 to X [A1] = i Application.calculate tSum(i) = tSum(i) + TOTAL next j next i 'now step through tSum. The index of the largest value ' is the value of A1 desired. Put it in a handy cell. It has to be a macro, not a function because it changes A1.
