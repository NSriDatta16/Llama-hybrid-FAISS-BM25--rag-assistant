The real problem here is that the public key is, well, public . Meaning freely available, meaning it's providing zero security of encryption. Heck, anyone on this thread has all the information they need to decrypt everything. So do googlers. Please try to encourage your users not to use public key data like that. At the very least, get them to give a password or some other slightly-more-secure chunk you can use to generate a consistent key. One more thing. Certificate keys vary in size. It can probably handle throwing away extra bytes in the key, but you'll probably get an Array Index / Out Of Bounds exception if the key happens to be shorter than the 3DES key needs. I doubt that'll happen, 3DES only needs 56bits, and cert keys are almost always 256bits or larger.
