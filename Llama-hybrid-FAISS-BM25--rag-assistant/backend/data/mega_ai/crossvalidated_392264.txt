A\B Testing with Sorting

In my company while splitting site users for AB test we do the following: we choose parameters that seem the most important for us (for example: gender, life time value, average check, etc), if they are continuous we bin them, sort all our users based on this parameters in descending order, enumerate them and assign every 1st and 4th to A-group and every 2d and 3d to B-group. Is this a valid approach? I feel that something is not right. Does this method have enough "randomness" in assigment to groups? If yes, then what is the difference between this approach and stratified sampling? Thank you in advance.
