adonis in vegan: order of variables or use of strata

I am using the adonis() function in in the vegan package to determine 1) if co-occurring host species vary in their microbial community across multiple sites, and 2) if sites are different. I have examined all posts on CV and SO, and there is no clear answer to how to determine significance of multiple factors using the adonis function. I first did this, as suggested by https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26768779/vegan-adonis-unbalanced-design-ss-type-ii-or-iii : where jacc is a dissimilarity matrix using the jaccard metric adonis F) Species 2 0.6055 0.30273 1.7690 0.04981 0.004 ** Site 4 2.1378 0.53445 3.1231 0.17587 0.001 *** Residuals 55 9.4122 0.17113 0.77432 Total 61 12.1554 1.00000 --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 Then reverse the order: adonis_2 F) Site 4 2.4385 0.60962 3.5623 0.20061 0.001 *** Species 2 0.3048 0.15238 0.8904 0.02507 0.716 Residuals 55 9.4122 0.17113 0.77432 Total 61 12.1554 1.00000 --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 But I don't know how to interpret that, because the order matters, and I'm not really sure if there are differences among species. After some searching I decided to use strata. I think this is saying: are co-occurring species different when you only compare species at the same sites. species_adonis F) Species 2 0.6055 0.30273 1.5464 0.04981 0.335 Residuals 59 11.5500 0.19576 0.95019 Total 61 12.1554 1.00000 Then to ask the question about site, I used species in the blocking. I think this is saying: are sites different when you only comparing the same species site_adonis F) Site 4 2.4385 0.60962 3.5761 0.20061 0.001 *** Residuals 57 9.7169 0.17047 0.79939 Total 61 12.1554 1.00000 --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 My conclusion is that the microbial community on a given species differs among sites, but that the microbial community does not differ among host species. Is my approach correct or am I misinterpreting the use of strata (i.e. blocking)? Or is there a way to somehow average over the tests when I switched the order of the variables?
