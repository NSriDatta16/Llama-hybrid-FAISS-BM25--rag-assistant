The reason you can't find one is because there aren't any hosts who can offer you unlimited bandwidth because it is a finite resource. Check the terms of all these offerings and you will see that they generally mean "there's no arbitrary limit" when they say "unlimited" but that's not the same as "you can use any amount of bandwidth". Using that list you gave, I went to HostMonster who happened to be top of the list and they state in their terms: What "Unlimited" means . HostMonster.Com does not set an arbitrary limit or cap on the amount of resources a single Subscriber can use. ...snip ... As a result, a typical website may experience periods of great popularity and resulting increased storage without experiencing any associated increase in hosting charges . Basically, if you get slashdotted then they won't cut you off. That's not the same as being permanently busy. What "Unlimited" DOES NOT mean. ... snip ... HostMonster.Com's offering of "unlimited" services is not intended to allow the actions of a single or few Subscribers to unfairly or adversely impact the experience of other Subscribers. HostMonster.Com's service is a shared hosting service, which means that multiple Subscriber web sites are hosted from the same server and share server resources . HostMonster.Com's service is designed to meet the typical needs of small business and home business website Subscribers in the United States. It is NOT intended to support the sustained demand of large enterprises, internationally based businesses, or non-typical applications better suited to a dedicated server . If you want as much bandwidth as you will need, you need to pay for it.
