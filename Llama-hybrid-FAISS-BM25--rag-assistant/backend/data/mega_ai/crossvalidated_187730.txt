Sample size question, 7 samples with different sample sizes

I am looking at the measurements of different organisms (in nanometers). I have 7 different populations. 1 is what I know the origins of, and I want to compare the size of this to my other 6 populations, which I do not yet know the origins of. I want to compare both width and length (so I have 14 columns on SPSS). The issue is, all of the sample sizes are different. One population is 3400, and the others barely touch 60 but vary. Would it be okay to randomly generate a population of the 3400 of around 60 using a number generator? Regarding comparing the rest, is an ANOVA okay to assess size difference within and between the groups? I have to use SPSS. Thanks so so much in advance. My supervisor has proclaimed he is "not a statistician", so I'm pretty desperate for help!
