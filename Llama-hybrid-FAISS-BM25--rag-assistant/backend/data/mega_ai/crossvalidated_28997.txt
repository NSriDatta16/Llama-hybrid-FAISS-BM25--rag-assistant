In R you do not need to compute the covariance matrix etc. yourself. Better use the prcomp() function. If data is your 524x50 matrix you need to do # scale. = TRUE if you want to scale variables to same variance. pca The latter plot is a screeplot, with the amount of explained variance per principal component. To get the loadings, you simply do pca$rotation pca$rotation[,1] It is fine to have only positive or negative loadings on the first component. If all your variables are very correlated that can be the case. Not knowing what you want to do with this PCA, you can do a biplot. biplot(pca) This shows the individuals projected on the first 2 principal components, and the variables with an identical projection so that you can compare them. You can also do it manually on each principal component. data %*% pca$rotation[,1] # Get projecions on both axes. data %*% pca$rotation[,1:2] Regarding Q4, it means that you can simplify your 50-dimensional space in a 20-dimensional space while keeping 80% of your variance. The score you are proposing is a 1D space. If you want to keep the first 20 PC, you need to project on the first 20 PC as follows: projects But 20-dimensional can barely be called a simplification. Most of the time the aim is to have 2-3 because you can still represent them in our space. Keeping 20 might make sense though. Depends on how you want to follow up.
