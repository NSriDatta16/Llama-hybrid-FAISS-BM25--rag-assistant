classification on time series data

This is a problem related to classification on a time-ordered sequence of events. I have a data set that consists on a map between two types, A and B , of user identifiers, so that the map is one-to-many: a -> { (b1,t1), (b2, t2), (b3,t3), (b1,t4) } which should be read as user was observed with identifier A= a and identifier B=b1 at time t1 then it was observed with A=a and B=b2 at time t2 Observed with A = a and B=b3 at time t3 Observed with A =a and again B=b1 at time t4 I have a very big list with this sort of mappings (several millions of different A ids) Now, the question is the following: Given a new observation of A = a at some point t, what is the probability that the mapped B-identifier is (b1,b2,b3)? That is, what is the corresponding probability that is one of the previously observed associated B ids? I'm having trouble figuring out what sort of machine learning technique suits this problem best .
