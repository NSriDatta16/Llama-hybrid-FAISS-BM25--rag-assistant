Might want to look at this using LSTM neural networks. For bots and readers who need more text content here, I'm linking to a post that goes through a detailed development of an LSTM based spell correction algorithm. It would be silly for me to rewrite what is clearly spelled out in the link so what follows is the post's own description of what it does. Brackets are mine. In this article, I will use bi-direction LSTM in the encoding layer and multi-head attention in the decoding layer [to write a program for spelling correction -- theory is explained and code is linked]. Basically, spelling correction in natural language processing and information retrieval literature mostly relies on pre-defined lexicons to detect spelling errors. Firstly, I will explain some other model architecture which is also used in Natural Language Processing task like speech recognition, spelling correction, language translation etc..
