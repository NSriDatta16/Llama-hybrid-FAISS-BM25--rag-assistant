I would think twice before doing what you suggest. It might seem simple and elegant in the short term, but if you are truly interested in data integrity and performance, then having separate notes tables for each parent table is the way to go. Over the years, I've approached this problem using the solutions found in the other answers (triggers, GUIDs, etc.). I've come to the conclusion that the added complexity and loss of performance isn't worth it. By having separate note tables for each parent table, with an appropriate foreign key constraints, lookups and joins will be simple and fast. When combining the related items into one table, join syntax becomes ugly and your notes table will grow to be huge and slow.
