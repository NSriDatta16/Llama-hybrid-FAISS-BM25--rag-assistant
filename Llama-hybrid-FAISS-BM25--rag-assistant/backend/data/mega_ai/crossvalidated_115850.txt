I would recommend not performing stepwise model building , unless you are looking for biased (inflated) coefficients, biased (deflated) p -values, and inflated model fit statistics. The fundamental problem is that all of the inferences in one's final model carry a typically invisible/silent and usually uninterpretable series of "conditional upon all these other choices based on other variables in some order" statements.
