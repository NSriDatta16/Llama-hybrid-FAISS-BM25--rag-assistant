Why do we need the SD line?

Why we need the SD line(magenta) and how does it help us, besides just passing through all standard units of x and standard units of y pair points on the xy plot? The SD line goes through the point of averages, and has slope equal to SDY/SDX if the correlation coefficient r is greater than or equal to zero. The SD line has slope âˆ’SDY/SDX if r is negative. http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~stark/SticiGui/Text/regression.htm
