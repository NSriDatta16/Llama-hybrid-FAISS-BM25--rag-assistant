Wald vs likelihood ratio is secondary to the fact that comparing $y\sim B$ to $y\sim A+B$ is a test of $A$ , not a test of $B$ . I hope this is a typo in the referee report. Agresti’s Foundations of Linear and Generalized Linear Models gives some reasons to prefer likelihood ratio testing to Wald testing in logistic regression, though the difference usually is not considerable. However, the reviewer is all kinds of wrong to have you testing $A$ to say how good of a predictor $B$ is. That is roughly equivalent to running ANCOVA by testing the slope instead of the factor—complete nonsense.
