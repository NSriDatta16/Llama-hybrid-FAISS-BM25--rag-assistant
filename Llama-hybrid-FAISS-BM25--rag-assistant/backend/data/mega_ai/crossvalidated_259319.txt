Reliability of Mode from an MCMC sample

In his book Doing Bayesian Data Analysis, John Kruschke states that in using JAGS from R ...the estimate of the mode from an MCMC sample can be rather unstable because the estimate is based on a smoothing algorithm that can be sensitive to random bumps and ripples in the MCMC sample. ( Doing Bayesian Data Analysis , page 205, section 8.2.5.1) While I have a grasp on Metropolis algorithm and exact forms like Gibbs sampling I'm not familiar with the smoothing algorithm that is alluded too and why it would mean the estimate of the mode from the MCMC sample is unstable. Is anyone able to give an intuitive insight into what the smoothing algorithm is doing and why it makes the estimate of the mode unstable?
