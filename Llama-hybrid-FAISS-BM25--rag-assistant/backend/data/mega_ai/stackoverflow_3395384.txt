jquery how to retrieve the number of characters in a p tag?

my problem is very simple: I want to know how many characters are inside a 'p' tag and if the number is over 100 fire an event on hover. I tried to retrieve the char number like this: var charLength = $('.myPar').val().length; this is the content of the paragraph it returns always zero as value and it seems to work only for textarea or input tags. Any idea? Thanks in advance! Mauro
