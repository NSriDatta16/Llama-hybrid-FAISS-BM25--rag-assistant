Testing for a difference

Here's the scenario: Students watch 2 videos for several different areas of content. Each video includes various examples. If I know the average number of students who included an example in their notes from video 1 (across the different contents) and the average number of students who included an example in their notes from video 2, how do I tell if there is a significant difference? I am trying to see if examples from video 1 are more likely to appear in the students' notes than the examples from video 2.
