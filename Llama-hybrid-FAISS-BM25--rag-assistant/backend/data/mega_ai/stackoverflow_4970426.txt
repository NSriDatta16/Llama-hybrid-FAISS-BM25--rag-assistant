HTML Truncating in Python

Is there a pure-Python tool to take some HTML and truncate it as close to a given length as possible, but make sure the resulting snippet is well-formed? For example, given this HTML: This is a header This is a paragraph it would not produce: This is a hea but: This is a header or at least: This is a hea I can't find one that works, though I found one that relies on pullparser , which is both obsolete and dead.
