I think you're probably missing INTERNET permission in your manifest.xml Pay attention to tag provided in the code below. I tested your code in eclipse, and it works. BTW I think using String result in this way wont work. Didn't test that far though. But I think you cannot just add string to a string. You need to use stringBuilder and append new strings. EDIT: tested this String result metod, and it works. Maybe the problem is that you are trying to throw so many toast all at once. Your code throws a toast for every line of retrived html code. I set your getHtml() method to type String, and to return result , and it returned it properly... I can't think of any other reason for exception, except missing INTERNET permission in your AndroidManifest.xml.... Cheers!
