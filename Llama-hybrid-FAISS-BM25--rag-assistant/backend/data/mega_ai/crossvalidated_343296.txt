The different tests have different power properties for different patterns of structural changes. The supF test has been designed for single abrupt shifts but also has good power for many other patterns. The Recursive-CUSUM test, on the other hand, works only well for single shifts occurring early in the sample. The latter is not the case and hence the Rec-CUSUM is not significant. Using an OLS-CUSUM instead would surely yield a significant result as well. Thus, the tests can be used to show that the mean (aka the level) of your time series is not constant over the full sample. However, you didn't need a significance test to reject that null hypothesis - it's clearly not a plausible null model. I'm not sure what would work best here or what would be a plausible model to hold within each segment. Potentially, taking logs would yield a pattern for which a piecewise linear curve would fit...
