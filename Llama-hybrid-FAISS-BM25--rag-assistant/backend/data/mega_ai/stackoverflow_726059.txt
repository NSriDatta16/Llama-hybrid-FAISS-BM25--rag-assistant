What you can do (and I have done) is to have the link not work if the person clicking on it is not using Internet Explorer and open a new window, reveal a DIV or pop up an alert() informing them they must be using Internet Explorer for the target site to work. Something like: some link window.external.AddFavorite is (as far as I know) only available in Internet Explorer, so using it to detect IE should be fairly safe. You could also examine navigator.userAgent for MSIE , however some browsers such as Opera might spoof the IE user agent.
