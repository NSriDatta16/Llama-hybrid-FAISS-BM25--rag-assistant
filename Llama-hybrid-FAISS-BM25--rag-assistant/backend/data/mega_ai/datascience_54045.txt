In the context of machine learning, an embedding is a low-dimensional, learned continuous vector representation of discrete variables into which you can translate high-dimensional vectors. Generally, embeddings make ML models more efficient and easier to work with, and can be used with other models as well. Typically, when I stumble upon jargon I'm not familiar with I first turn to Google, and if it can't be found I ping my colleagues and data science forums.
