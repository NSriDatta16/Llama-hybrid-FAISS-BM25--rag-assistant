In addition to Brian's recommendation of Clean Code by Robert C Martin , you may want to read up on "Uncle Bob's" SOLID Principles of Object Oriented Design . You can hear him talking about the SOLID Principles on Hanselminutes Podcast 145 and clean code on .NET Rocks! Show #388 . There is also more with him on .NET Rocks! Show #410 , but what he talks about isn't really related to your question, I just included it in case you enjoyed the first two. Of the three podcasts I preferred the Hanselminutes.
