Empirical Risk formulation

I am trying to get an intuitive understanding of the empirical risk below. Based on my understanding, we are unable to compute a function that minimizes the expected risk because we do not have access to the true underlying distribution i.e. we don't have access to all the training data in the world. We do however, have training samples that we can use to compute an estimate from, called the empirical risk. From the photo below, since the expected risk is defined as $R(f) = E_z(l(f,Z))$ where Z represents all the training data in the world, then the empirical risk is $\hat R(f) = E_z(l(f,D))$ where D represents a subset of the training data. My question is , why do we take the expectation over $\hat R(f)$ and what does this mean ? From my understanding $\hat R(f)$ is the average of the losses over D, which is a scalar. Why and what does taking an average over a scalar mean ?
