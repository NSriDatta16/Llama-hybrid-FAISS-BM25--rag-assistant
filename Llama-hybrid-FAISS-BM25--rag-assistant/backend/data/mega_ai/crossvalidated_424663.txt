Opponent play in Monte Carlo Tree Search

I have not been able to find a definitive answer about how opponent play works in Monte Carlo Tree Search. It makes sense that the agent is trying to optimize the moves that they make, but when we traverse the tree through the process of selection and expansion, etc., they are also "testing out" different moves by the opponent. I get the sense that the agent then makes its moves based on the opponent's making an optimal move - is this correct? What happens if the opponent does not behave optimally - is it possible that this makes the agents decision sub-optimal as well, or does it not matter because the agent throws out the stats tree after that turn and now makes new decisions based on the opponent's real move? I am asking because I am trying to visualize the process for tic-tac-toe and it feels weird that the agent plays out the opponents moves too, as in the visualization I created below:
