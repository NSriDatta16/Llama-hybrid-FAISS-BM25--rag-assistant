There are several "averages." Just think of this trick question: "What is the probability that the next person you meet has more than the average number of arms?" The "mean" or "arithmetic mean" or "arithmetic average" is one average that you learned in the past. But the median (the value with half the observations greater and half less than it), the mode (the most common value), the geometric mean (multiply the values then take the nth root), the harmonic mean (the reciprocal of the mean of the reciprocals of the data), and others all fall under the general term "average."
