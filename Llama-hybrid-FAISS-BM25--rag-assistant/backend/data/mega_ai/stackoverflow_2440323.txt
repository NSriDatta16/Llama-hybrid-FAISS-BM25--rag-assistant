You didn't mention what version of VS are you using but if it is VS 2010 RC give Pex and Moles Visual Studio 2010 Powertools a try... " Pex automatically generates test suites with high code coverage . Right from the Visual Studio code editor, Pex finds interesting input-output values of your methods, which you can save as a small test suite with high code coverage. Microsoft Pex is a Visual Studio add-in for testing .NET Framework applications." " Moles allows to replace any .NET method with a delegate . Moles supports unit testing by providing isolation by way of detours and stubs. The Moles framework is provided with Pex, or can be installed by itself as a Microsoft Visual Studio add-in."
