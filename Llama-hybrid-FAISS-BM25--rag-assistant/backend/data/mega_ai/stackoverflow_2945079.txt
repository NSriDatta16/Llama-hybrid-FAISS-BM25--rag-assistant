Many thanks Mark. I removed iCount and made the outer loop parallel, but I am digging the code since I am observing no speedup still when compared to the serial version. I would like to take this opportunity to get a basic fact clarified...in a nested loop environment like the above...which one could be generally better: Making the inner loop parallel pragma omp parallel for(...i...) pragma omp for for(...j...) Making the outer loop parallel, (just a ...pragma parallel for... before the outer loop) Using Collapse (for Omp 3.0) Thanks Sayan
