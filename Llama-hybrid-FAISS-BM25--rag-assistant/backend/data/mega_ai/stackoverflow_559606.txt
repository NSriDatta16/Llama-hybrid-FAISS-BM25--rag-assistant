WPF ListView Databound Drag/Drop Auto Scroll

I've been working with Bea's solution here for a while and finding it very helpful. Problem now I'm having is when I drag-n-drop items within or to another ListView control and I want to scroll up/down "during" the drag (moving an item from index 30 to index 1), it's not happening. I would have to drag to the top of the visual items in the ListView, manually scroll up, then drag again, eventually ending at the position I want. This isn't very user friendly. Now I found the function (DragDropHelper.DropTarget_PreviewDragOver) that I would want to do the testing of which item is being dragged over, and I'm getting that. Dim pt As Point = e.GetPosition(DirectCast(Me.targetItemsControl, UIElement)) ' Perform the hit test against a given portion of the visual object tree. Dim result As HitTestResult = VisualTreeHelper.HitTest(Me.targetItemsControl, pt) Now from there I can get the DependencyProperty of this visual hit Dim lvi As ListViewItem = TryCast(GetDependencyObjectFromVisualTree(TryCast(result.VisualHit, DependencyObject), GetType(ListViewItem)), ListViewItem) Which is of a ListViewItem. Now in the function DropTarget_PreviewDragOver I have the "DraggedItem" which is of type Picture in Bea's example, but that can change depending on the ObservableCollection you have bound to the ListView. Now, I want to drag the ListView up or down depending on where the mouse is on the control. I've attempted with the below un-finished non-working code If lvi IsNot Nothing Then If pt.Y 1 Then lv.ScrollIntoView(lv.Items(index - 1)) End If End If Else If pt.Y >= Me.targetItemsControl.ActualHeight - 25 Then Debug.Print("Scroll Down") End If End If End If Can someone point me in the right direction to get this ItemsControl or ListView to scroll when dragging over the items?? Thanks!
