Use Qt4 model/view if you can use Qt4 in your project. You will have to write your own model which can be tedious if you've never done so, but once setup you can reference/update multiple instances of the same object easily. Selections/Multiple selection can be handled too. I'm not a big fan of Qt's model/view implementation (given model/view/controller design pattern is quite old) but it helps to organize data in gUIs
