Intercept in Multiple logistic regression

I've run a multivariable logistic regression on 8 variables and my results are a bit puzzling. The intercept (that is the log odds when the other covariates = 0) is significant (p My question for performing this regression is to answer the question: what variables predict the use of Tool X? The nonsignificant coefficients for all of the variables mean they don't predict the use, but it doesn't make sense that if you don't have these variables, it will suddenly be able to predict usage? I don't think I have a strong grasp of multivariable logistic regression, so I would be very grateful if anyone can give some advice on this matter.
