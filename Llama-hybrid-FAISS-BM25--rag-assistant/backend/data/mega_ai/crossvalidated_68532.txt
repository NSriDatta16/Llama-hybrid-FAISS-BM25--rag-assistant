Alternatives to ANCOVA when assumptions are violated

I am doing research on organisational change and looking at how certain types of change (e.g. closures of offices, layoffs, investment on activities/functions) have affected seven psychological variables (commitment, trust in leaders, procedural fairness, perception of organisational support, etc.). Now, I want to know how the changes (related to the types of organisational change described above) in the content of the psychological contract (measured through four of the psychological variables) impact organisational commitment (if at all). My original idea was to run an analysis of covariance in SPSS, but in checking for the basic assumptions I found that the regression slopes are not homogeneous, and that is the end of ANCOVA according to several authors. I am left without a clear idea of how to circumvent this problem. What kind of analysis can be performed when: The covariates and the factor (type of change) are related, and The regression slopes are not homogeneous? Please, bear in mind that mine is NOT an experimental design, rather observational, change happens without my intervention and I just look at an internal survey that studies the psychological and demographic variables.
