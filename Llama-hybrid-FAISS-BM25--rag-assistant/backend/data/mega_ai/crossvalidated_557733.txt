Bayesian updating with discrete support

Suppose I have a coin that is either fair ( $Pr(H)=0.5$ ) or biased ( $Pr(H)=0.2$ ). I have a prior probability $Pr(fair)=\tau_{0}$ . I observe a sequence of tosses with outcome $X_{1},X_{2},...,X_{n}$ , where $X_{i} \in \{H,T\}$ . Does the posterior $\tau_{n}=Pr(fair|X_{1},...,X_{n})$ follow any well known/well behaved probability distribution? Is there a way to show that, for $n$ sufficiently big, the posterior converges to the truth?
