Upgraded Infragistics and my application is not allowing Ultrawingrid to be editable anymore

I have an application that uses the Ultra Win Grid and has a column with a check box in it. It used to be that when I clicked on the check box it would allow you to edit it but now you can't. Already checked and I am setting CellClickAction to Edit and CellActivation to allow edit. I used to be using 6.3 and upgraded to 9.1. The problem started as soon I changed the application to reference they new assemblies.
