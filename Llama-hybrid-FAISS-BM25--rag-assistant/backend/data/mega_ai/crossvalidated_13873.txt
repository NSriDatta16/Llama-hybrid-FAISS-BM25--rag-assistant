Does a distance have to be a "metric" for an hierarchical clustering to be valid on it?

Let us say that we define a distance, which is not a metric , between N items. Based on this distance we then use an Agglomerative hierarchical clustering . Can we use each of the known algorithm (single/maximum/avaerage linkage etc), to get meaningful results? Or put differently, what is the problem with using them if the distance is not a metric?
