Have you tried profiling the requests using strace/dtrace/truss (depending on your platform)? There are a wide variety of issues that could be causing this. What version of openssl is being used by wget - there could be an issue there. What OS is this running on (full information would be useful there). There could be some form of download slowdown being enforced due to the agent ID being passed by wget implemented on the site to reduce the effects of spiders. Is wget performing full certificate validation? Have you tried using --no-check-certificate?
