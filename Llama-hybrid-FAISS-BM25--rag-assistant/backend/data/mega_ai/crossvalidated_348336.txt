In the absence of the knowledge of the event , what you are looking for is a procedure to simultaneously identify and refine an arima model AND also automatically identify and include 2 level/step shift indicators (possibly collapsing into 1).... reflecting the temporary effect via Intervention Detection procedures http://docplayer.net/12080848-Outliers-level-shifts-and-variance-changes-in-time-series.html . If you post your actual data in a column oriented csv file I will try to help you further. Alternatively if you are aware of the timing and length of the intervention you can construct an X variable of the form ...0,0,0,0,0,...,1,1,1,1,...0,0,0,0,0, detailing the known beginning and termination points and then try to identify the arima portion of this armaX model. EDITED AFTER RECEIPT OF DATA: The data that you posted is different from the graph you posted. Here is a graph of the data you posted which is the data I analyzed. Your data suggest the need for a differencing factor of order 1 ....thus a level shift detection requires 2 pulses. When you difference a step/level you get a pulse ... thus a model that has differencing requires pulses to reflect the abrupt upwards effect and the abrupt downwards effect. A partial picture of the model is here .. .272 up and .241 down suggesting a different return to the baseline. I submitted the 151 monthly numbers to my favorite time series program and it automatically developed a use model .Here is the Actual/Fit and Forecast graph and less cluttered here . The equation is here detailing four seasonal pulses covering Feb, Sept and Nov suggesting non-seasonal activity for the other 9 months and 4 additional pulses . Note that the differencing operator is distributed across all series in the equation. Also note that {1-B}level = pulse thus {1-B]pulse = {1-B}{1-B}level . The AUTOBOX equation shows {1-B}pulse which if you wish can be restated as {1-B}{1-B}level . Restated a pulse in a non-stationary can be interpreted as an intercept change. Visually one can confirm the identified Pulses as points of change for the model-implied intercept. A significant change in error variance (downwards) was found at or about time period 60. The mo del statistics are here and here The forecasts are detailed here . EDITED TO ANSWER THE OP'S COMMENT Adjusting the 12 observations and then identifying an ARIMA model is a sound approach. The only problem is there are 4 seasonal factors ( seasonal pulses ) and 3 pulses that need to be adjusted for before identifying the first difference model (0,1,0)(0,0,0) with a constant while dealing with a non-constant error variance. Your resultant ACF of the er rors should look something like this ...suggesting sufficiency. By the way .. why did you post data that was different from your graph ????
