In Xcode, is there a way to sort the dropdown list for methods

In Xcode, there is a preferences option to sort the Editor Function pop-up alphabetically which is great. However, this does not take into consideration the #pragma mark headings which also appear in this list. It would be great to have this list sorted alphabetically first by #pragma heading, then by method. Is this possible? Perhaps with a script?
