Inflection Point of Time Series and cumulative function?

I am reading the paper from here: https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.25.20043893v1 The problem is to predict the inflection point of daily Covid cases. The method that is employed is to estimate the cumulative case as function of time $t$ as $I(t) = c t^w e^{-d t}$ (with $c,d,w$ being parameters to be estimated from data) and solving for $\frac{dI}{dt} = 0$ , which gives $t = \frac{-w}{d}$ . But I do not see why the maximum point of the cumulative function would give me the inflection point. For the inflection point, I would want $f''(t) = 0$ where $f(t)$ is the function of daily cases with respect to time $t$ . Then the function $I$ is just $I(t) = \int_0^t f(x) dx$ , and $I'(t) = f(t)$ , which means $I'(t) = 0$ just means $f(t) = 0$ . Where am I going wrong?
