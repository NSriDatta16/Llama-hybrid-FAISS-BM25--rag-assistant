Matched fragment when using Lucene's RegexQuery

I'm performing query operations on a Lucene index with a RegexQuery. For example, I do a RegexQuery to obtain all documents containing a URL, using new RegexQuery(new Term("text", "https?://[^\\s]+") (I know, the RegEx is over-simplified). Now I want to retrieve the text fragment, which actually matched my query, like http://example.com . Does Lucene offer an efficient possibility therefore? Or do I have process the whole text again, using Java's RegEx matcher?
