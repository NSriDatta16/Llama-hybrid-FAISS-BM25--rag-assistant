Getting a representative sample from sorted data

I'd like to sample a Market Place API which for each call returns a group of items sorted by relevance or price. I can get up to 100 items per call. Another issue is that the items are organized by a hierarchical structure of categories and I'd like to get a sample by category. The first thing that comes to my mind is to make calls to the API by randomizing the offset. For example the first call could be /products/?catid='notebooks'&limit=100&offset=343. But the result(the 100 items) will be sorted by some metric and I guess it would compromise the "representativeness" of the sample.
