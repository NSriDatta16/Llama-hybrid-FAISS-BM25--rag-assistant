Everyone is completely missing the point. Development using a version control system is a great thing and has massive upside even for developers working on their own. The question here is about deployment using version control systems. This is a newer and great idea, consider something like Magento which has 6,744 files in the base install, not mentioning when you start adding your own skins which usally run to around 500 files. Using version control to DEPLOY something like this saves major time uploading this many tiny files via FTP as only the modified ones are sent. Asside from this, I've never actually tried deploying like this so I can't offer any real world experience, however there are several good articles on how to get this setup, a good one can be seen here .
