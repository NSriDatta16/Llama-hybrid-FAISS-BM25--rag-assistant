Finding it hard to use a href template tag in Django

I seem to have some difficulty trying to use a href template tag. Here is what I want to do. I have an edit order form at (r'^orders/edit/(?P \d+)/$', views.edit_order), I want a link that could take me to this html template items.html I will name this url (r'^orders/edit/add_items/(?P )/$', views.add_items), And my views looks like this. @login_required def add_items(request, client_id = 0): client = None items = None try: client = models.Client.objects.get(pk = client_id) items = client.storageitem_set.all() except: return HttpResponse(reverse(return_clients)) return render_to_response('items.html', {'items':items, 'client':client}, context_instance = RequestContext(request)) @login_required def return_clients(request): clients = models.Client.objects.all() return render_to_response('clients.html', {'clients':clients}, context_instance = RequestContext(request)) In my edit order form template I have this. Add Item Now when I restart my server, I click on the link and I go for some reason to this page. /orders/edit/add_items// I think maybe I need a 'for' loop, but for some reason when I tried to do this, the href disappeared. EDIT: I have put in views.edit_order client = models.Client.objects.all() and in edit_order template {% for c in client %} {{c.name}} {% endfor %} While running server again, this displays all clients names but like before all clients links goes again to /orders/edit/add_items//
