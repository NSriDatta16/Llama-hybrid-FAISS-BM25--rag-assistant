What is concordance probability?

In one of my questions: How to measure test set error with logistic regression One of the answers mentioned "concordance probability" or c-index. Unfortunately I'm not familiar with the term and there seems to be no Wikipedia page and Google turns up nothing. It's my understanding that it relates to classification.
