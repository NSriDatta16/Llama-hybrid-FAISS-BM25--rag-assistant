What is the correct way of normalizing data in machine learning?

I generate input data for my model at different temperatures. At each temperature I generate 1000 samples and in each sample I have 16 features. So the shape of array is (1000,16) at each temperature. I want to normalize data between 0 and 1. But I am really confused that what is the strategy of normalization in machine learning language? Should I normalize feature of each single sample such that each sample is like [0,.....1] or should I normalize along column axis. Secondly I also want to know that should I perform this normalization separately for each temperature?
