My UIImageView doesn't get all the methods of my subclassed UIImageView

I created a subclass (called MyPicture) of the UIImageView with this methodes: - (id)initWithFrame:(CGRect)frame { if (self = [super initWithFrame:frame]) { self.userInteractionEnabled = YES; } return self; } - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { NSLog(@"-- I AM TOUCHED --"); } //â€¦ When I create a UIImageView with the InterfaceBuilder with the class MyPicture everything works and the console writes: "I AM TOUCHED". But only, when I activate User Interaction Enabled in IB. But when I create the UIImageView programmatly, it doenst work. in the ViewController.h: MyButton * foo; In the ViewController.m: - (void)viewDidLoad { flo = [[UIImageView alloc]initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0.0, 45.0, 324, 52.0)]; foo.userInteractionEnabled = YES; foo.image = [UIImage imageNamed:@"Picture 1.png"]; [self.view addSubview:foo]; [super viewDidLoad]; } I can see the picture, so it has to be my UIImageView subclass. But why doesn't he detect the touches?
