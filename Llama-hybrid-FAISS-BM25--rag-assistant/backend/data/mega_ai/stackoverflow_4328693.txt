How can I effectively document a database?

I am developing a database that organizes scientific data from my group and diverse experiments reported in the literature, (my background is in science rather than project management or programming). I currently have three documentation documents for: end users of data data enter-ers developers (e.g. myself and my successor) Other than following the users guides and descriptions from other databases, are there any best-practices I should follow, perhaps a latex template, or a mysqldump option that will automatically do some of the documentation?
