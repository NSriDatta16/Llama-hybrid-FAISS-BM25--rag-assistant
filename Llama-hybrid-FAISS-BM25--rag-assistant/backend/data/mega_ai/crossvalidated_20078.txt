Given your explanation I think one easy solution (without resorting to making new variables) would be to use temporary and select if statements to produce summary statistics for the desired categories. For instance, the below statement would produce the mean for reaction_time_1 when the category_1 and the procedure_1 both equal 1 (and eliminate all other cases from the calculation which do not meet that criteria). temporary. select if category_1 = 1 and procedure_1 = 1. freq var reaction_time_1 /statistics = mean. execute. Unless your procedures and categories are not mutually exclusive, there is surely a better way to organize your variables, but this will produce the requested output as is.
