I think it's important to differentiate between null values in your features or null values in your target value . Null values for features, there exist several ways to impute null values check this sklearn doc https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/impute.html As @spectre pointed out is mandatory avoid data lakeage e.g compute the mean of your dataset, and then use that mean to impute null values in your test dataset. To avoid that, I highly recommend the use of imputers combined with sklearn pipelines, below a couple of links with examples. https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/compose/plot_column_transformer_mixed_types.html https://towardsdatascience.com/improve-your-data-preprocessing-with-columntransformer-and-pipelines-b6ff7edd2f77
