Interpretations of coefficients with interactions The interpretation of the main effect, cont1, after controlling for its interaction with both cont2 and the categorical predictor cat is an average difference in the response for a unit difference in cont1 having cont2=0 and cat=its referent level. By controlling for an interaction between cont1 and cat, you allow the trendline for cont1 to assume different values for the various levels of cat. The main effect is implied to be the stratum-specific trendline for the referent level. As such, the estimate and inference for cont1 is affected by the choice of referent level. Reasons for the findings you describe One possible implication in the scenario you describe here is that the interaction between cont1 and cat is non-zero. The interaction term need not be statistically significant to produce this effect; if a sparse level of "cat" is chosen to be the referent level, this aversely affects the precision of the main effects with which "cat" interacts. This sparse level may also be the only level for which the response shows any non-zero mean-level difference from other levels of "cat". Another possible implication is that cont2 interacts with cat, and due to lack of a three-way interaction, cont2's modified main effect, correlation, and/or interaction with cont1 affects the inference. A third possibility is heteroscedasticity... I think this may be at play. With mixed models, the residual variance and inference is affected by the structure of covariates in a linear model, and the consequent assumed values of the mixed effects. Changing the estimates of the mixed effects random intercepts terms for block will possibly affect the inference and predictions. About choosing factor levels In R, for categorical predictors, the first factor level is chosen to be the referent level. This is often a bad idea for interpretation because many "first" level factor codings are chosen arbitrarily (based on alphabetical order, or first appearance in the data set) or in an informative way (based on minimum value): for instance, education is often measured as less than high school, high school, or some college or more. "Less than high school" is the first factor level, and often the least prevalent in samples. Recoding this value to "high school" (often the mode education) creates more interpretable and precise effects. Taken together, the solution to your problem seems to be to a) standardized cont1 and cont2 to interpretable and observable ranges so that main effects aren't extrapolated to obtuse levels, and choose a factor coding for "cat" that improves interpretability.
