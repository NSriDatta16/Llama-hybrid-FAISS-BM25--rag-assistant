Is there any way for an MSBuild project to determine whether the 32-bit or 64-bit version of MSBuild is running?

After having found the answer to my question about the 64-bit version of MSBuild attempting to load 32-bit extensions, it has now become necessary for me to determine whether the 64-bit or 32-bit version of MSBuild is running so I can load the correct version of the DLL. I can check the $(MSBuildBinPath) variable against a list of known paths, but that will not work if MSBuild is running from some non-standard location. This is not an elegant solution. Is there some way to reliably determine whether the currently running MSBuild (or other process hosting the MSBuild engine) is 32-bit or 64-bit?
