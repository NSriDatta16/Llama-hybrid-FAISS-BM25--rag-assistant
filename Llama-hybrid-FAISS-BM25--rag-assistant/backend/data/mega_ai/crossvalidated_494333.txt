I found this set of lecture notes to be quite helpful: https://mlhcmit.github.io/slides/lecture15.pdf There are two common approaches for counterfactual inference, Propensity Scores, and Covariate adjustment. For Covariate Adjustment you explicitly model the relationship between treatment, confounders, and outcome. Obviously there are lots of options on how to model the relationship, from linear regression, to more advanced techniques, for example random forests and deep learning To be honest, I'm not sure of why to prefer one approach vs. the other, one thought is perhaps if you're not confident about how to model the causal relationship, or if you've captured all the confounders, but you're able to predict treatment well, then you might favor propsensity score matching?
