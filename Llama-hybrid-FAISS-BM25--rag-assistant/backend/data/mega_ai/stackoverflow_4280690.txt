Windows batch filename globbing

In short, I would like to port this bash expression to a windows batch file: echo {foo,bar,baz}/*.{agent,event,plan} Currently I use echo foo/*.agent foo/*.event foo/*.plan bar/*.agent etc... but as the number of directories grow and some new extensions are used it gets very tiresome to modify this line.
