UITextView doesn't accept more than one style of text, so syntax coloring isn't possible with the control. You'll have to do you own displaying and editing with the Core Text framework and the UITextInput protocol. As for the actual coloring, there are some open source code editors that it might be worth taking a look at, for example Fragaria . Though it is a Cocoa project, not Cocoa Touch, it should still be of use to you.
