Using Only Categorical Variables to Predict a Continuous Variable

Data : The dataset that looks like this (fabricated but similar to real data): Goal : Use 70 (categorical) variables to predict each household's electricity usage (numerical). Independent Variables : "id": each household's ID. "sex": 2 categories. (1 for men, 2 for women.) "age": 4 categories. (1 for 18-25 years old, etc.) "occupation": 5 categories. "heat_home": 2 categories (1 for yes, 0 for no.) "education": 5 categories. "income": 5 catogories. (1 for less than 15k, 2 for between 15k-20k, etc.) Dependent Variable : "usage": numerical, measured in kwh. Question : I coded the categorical variables as factors in R, but it gave me errors. How would you deal with these categorical variables? Is it better to code them as dummies instead of factors? You're also welcome to give me advice on how to run 5-fold cross-validation using lasso and double machine learning. Sample code : Here's my sample R code using forward selection method: train However, it gives me error like this:
