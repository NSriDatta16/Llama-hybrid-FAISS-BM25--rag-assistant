Understanding Product of individual PDF for Joint PDF

Let's say that we make multiple noisy observation from a sensor node where $h$ is the parameter we want to deduce and $v$ is the noise. $$y[k] = h + v , k=[0,1,..n] $$ Question: The PDF for each individual measurement shall be of the following form: $$F(y(k)) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma^2}} e^\frac{(y(k)-h)^2}{2 \sigma^2}$$ Then for joint PDF why do we use the product of individual PDFs using the following formula assuming noise is i.i.d.? What is the purpose of product in laymen terms? Shouldn't it be summation and averaging of individual PDFs? $$ \prod_{k=0}^n F(y(k)) $$ . The YouTube reference at 6:54
