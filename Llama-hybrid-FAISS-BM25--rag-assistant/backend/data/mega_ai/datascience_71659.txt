Is there any paper of object detection that detect not trained class or object?

After reading some object detection papers (kinds of R-CNN , YOLO ,...) I'm wondering if there is a detector that detects objects about not trained class. For example my model is not trained to detect buildings, but is it possible to make my model detect building or some vehicles just with pixel data?
