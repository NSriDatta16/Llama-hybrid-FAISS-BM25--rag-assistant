There are two kinds of USB media providers. The USB Mass Storage devices that act just like drives and Windows Media Devices for simple cameras and portable media players. Some camera (usually the cheap ones) only implement the Windows Media Device model while others implement the USB Mass Storage model. From what you explain, the iPhone is treated as a Windows Media Device while the camera is a USB Mass Storage. I know there is an "issues" with some Apple devices (notably the touch generation) suddenly switching to the WMD model when there are pictures or screenshots on the device. Try deleting any screenshots or pictures you've taken with the iPhone and see if it fixes the problem, if so, this is because your code doesn't support the Windows Media Devices model. The MSDN library can help you sort through that mess. They updated the API several times, discontinued some parts of it, added more elsewhere and now it seems they have a new version that will fix-it-all TM.
