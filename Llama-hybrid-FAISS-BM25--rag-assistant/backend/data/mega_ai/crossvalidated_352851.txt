Yes this type of thing is commonly done in natural language processing. It is referred to as hierarchical rather than concurrent. Example uses are to have the first LSTM process the characters in a word to create a representation for each word and the second LSTM operates on words in a sentence. Another example is to have the first LSTM process words in a sentence and the second can do sentences in a paragraph.
