I would recommend creating a "Blank Solution" to start that would be a *.sln file (Say EnterpriseSolution.sln) that would sit in a folder named EneterpriseSolution. A blank solution can be created from "Other Types". I would then add in the additional parts you described as seperate projects, each within its own folder under the "EnterpriseSolution" folder. For instance, each of your client facing websites would each have their own project folder. It looks like you will have more than one website so you will need to make sure you setup different "ports" for each to run under if you use one solution wrapper. However, you can aslo create different solution "wrappers" (as a blank solution to start and then project reference the projects you want) to include each website sperately in your folder structure so you can focus on a portion of your enterprise solution. But physically you will know where everything is and how it is organized. This way, when you look at your Enterprise Solution folder thru windows explorer the only thing you will see is your solution file(s) and your project folders. Thanks and good luck with your project.
