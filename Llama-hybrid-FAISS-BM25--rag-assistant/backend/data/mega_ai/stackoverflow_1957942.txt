But i would like to have a paragraph of text under the 'playArea' div, but because all the divs inside playArea is absolute, the text doesnt appear at the bottom of the last absolute positioned div. As you seem to know all the dimensions and positions already, just add another absolutely positioned div to it and put the relative content in it. I have looked into this and found an alternative by using float:left and clear:left however after using this method on the first div, you cannot position the div correctly as the starting point of the second div is under the first div and not at (0,0). Any ideas of how i can get by this. You need to remove position: absolute to get the floats right. Just width and height are enough.
