XPath: Nodes that have a child node that have an attribute

XML Fragment What I want is all "group" nodes which have a child node of type "field" and a name "StipulationType". This is what I've tried so far: dictionary.XPathSelectElements("group[field[@name='StipulationType']]") dictionary.XPathSelectElements("group[./field[@name='StipulationType']]")
