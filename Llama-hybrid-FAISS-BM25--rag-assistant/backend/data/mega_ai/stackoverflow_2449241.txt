I think it's feasible without third-party software. My first design would look like this: The producer writes data to the database To guarantee consistency it has to use transactions The consumer process the data (read and delete) also using transactions. Because of the transactions requirement InnoDB is the logical choice of the storage engine. Also you have to carefully choose the isolation level. My first guess is "serializable" to avoid phantom reads, but perhaps a weaker level also is possible. If performance and scalability is an issue, you should consider using a "real" messaging solution. Rolling out your one will most likely lead to performance and/or scalability issues.
