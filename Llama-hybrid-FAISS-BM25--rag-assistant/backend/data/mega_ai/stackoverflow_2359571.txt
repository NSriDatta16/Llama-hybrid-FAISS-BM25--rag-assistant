Artificial neural networks benchmark

Are there any benchmarks that can be used to check if implementation of ANN is correct? I want to have some input and output data, and some information like: - The output of Feedforward neural network with 3 layers should be correct in 90% of test data. I need this information to be sure that this kind of ANN is able to deal with such problem.
