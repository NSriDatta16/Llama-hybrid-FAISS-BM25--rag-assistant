GET/HEAD requests should not have any harmful side-effects (from HTTP 1.1 spec, 9.1 : "In particular, the convention has been established that the GET and HEAD methods SHOULD NOT have the significance of taking an action other than retrieval."), that's what POST/PUT/DELETE methods are for. Other than that - Django won't forbid deleting a row from DB on GET request, if that's what you ask.
