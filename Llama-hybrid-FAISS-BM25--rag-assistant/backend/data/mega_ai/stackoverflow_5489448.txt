Use vector in programs where applicable. If you really need to use a raw new , you can use placement new. Square *squares = static_cast (operator new(sizeof(*squares) * 10)); for (int i = 0; i (squares + i)) Square(i, i); } And delete it with operator delete(squares); . Notice that you need to manually call the destructors of these objects then. Alternatively, you can create the objects with a raw storage iterator std::raw_storage_iterator rsi(squares); for (int i = 0; i The need to manually call the destructors at the end of use stays, of course.
