There's a difference between predicting variables and finding out correlation. Logistic regression is predictor, more specifically, binary classifier . "Classifier" means that it tries to assign some class to every observation. "Binary" means that there are exactly 2 classes. Moreover, logistic regression produces probability with which each observation belongs to each class. If you want to predict extroversion/introversion, there are 2 options for you: Use each of them as a class and give binary answer. This is simple: person will be assigned either "extrovert" or "introvert" label. Use fuzzy logic. Logistic regression will give you some number between 0 and 1, which represents how much person belongs to specified class. E.g. if you set introversion to 0 and extroversion to 1, and logistic regression return 0.7, then we can say that person is 70% extrovert and 30% introvert. This one is good for capturing things like ambiversion . Logistic regression works with both - continuous variables and categorical (encoded as dummy variables), so you can directly run logistic regression on your dataset. Pearson , on other hand, defines correlation . Correlation is simply normalized covariation , and covariation measures how 2 random variables co-variate, that is, how change in one variable is related to change in another one. Strictly speaking, Pearson correlation cannot deal with categorical variables (mostly because categorical variables don't have a notion of mean, which Pearson is based on). However, having only 2 binary variables you can consider them as continuous (with values of 1 and 0) and calculate a kind of correlation. This is clearly a hack, but it should work for simple explorational analysis.
