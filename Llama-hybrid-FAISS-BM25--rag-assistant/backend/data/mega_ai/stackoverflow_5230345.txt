How do I copy multiple files to the same directory without overwriting in MSBuild

I have multiple CodeCoverage.xml files in seperate directories and I want to copy them to a single directory with new names so that they don't get overwritten. Does anyone have an idea of how to copy these files to the $(TestResultsDir) without them being overwritten? Is there a way to generate a random number that could be pre-pended to the filename so they would be unique?
