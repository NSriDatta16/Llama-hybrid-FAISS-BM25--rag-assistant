I posted the same question on Course Machine Learning forum discussion, and here is a response from one of those mentor: "No analysis of the system is needed. It may be useful, that is up to you. You may with to apply many different ML techniques and see which ones give the best predictions. One method of exploratory analysis is by observing the theta values after training the system. Theta values that are near zero have little impact on the system, for example." Tom Mosher
