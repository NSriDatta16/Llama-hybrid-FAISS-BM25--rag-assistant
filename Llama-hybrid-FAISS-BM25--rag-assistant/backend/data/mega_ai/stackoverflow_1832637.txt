There's a few things to pay attention to here. So, first of all, your $money array captures every value the user submits. Next, the way you have your HTML statement set up, there's no default value. The first option in $_POST["quarters"] is going to be .25 even if the user never touches that pulldown. To avoid this, you would want to add to the Quarters : -- Select Quarters -- But still this doesn't allow you to use a switch/case statement. You're still going to be submitting a value for EVERY HTML tag. Florian Peschka's solution is better, since it checks every pulldown, making sure they only used one, and perhaps displays a message if they don't. Finally... I don't know what $selection refers to in your example. You're populating the $money array, so the $selection variable doesn't exist. I can further help if you clarify your question.
