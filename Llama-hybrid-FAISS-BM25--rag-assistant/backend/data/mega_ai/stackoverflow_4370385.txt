How do I see the statistics for rcov from the command line?

I'm running the built-in rake task to generate rcov reports: rake spec:rcov This generate files in my coverage directory, but I would like to see some aggregate stats output to the command console. Something like the total coverage and number of lines being tested in a format similar to what you get when you run "rake stats" Anyone know of a way to do this?
