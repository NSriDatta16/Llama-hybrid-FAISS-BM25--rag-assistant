Following up on the link provided by @mkt in a comment, after the coefficient vector $\beta$ has been determined, the hazard as a function of time, $h(t)$ , for a new case with predictor values $X^T$ is: $$ \ln h(t) = \ln h_{0}(t) + \beta_{1} X_{1} + \dots + \beta_{p} X_{p} = \ln h_{0}(t) + X^T \bf{\beta}. $$ where $h_0(t)$ is the baseline hazard over time. In a linear or logistic regression the linear predictor $X^T \beta$ can be written to include the intercept and provide the predicted outcome value (linear regression) or log-odds (logistic regression) for the new case. The equivalent of the intercept in a Cox regression is an empirical baseline hazard not constant in time. That's the hazard as a function of time if all predictor values were 0, a situation that often does not represent a real-world possibility. It's usually more informative to examine the difference in linear-predictor values for two realistic scenarios; that difference is the difference in log hazard between the scenarios, and exponentiating that difference gives the hazard ratio between them.
