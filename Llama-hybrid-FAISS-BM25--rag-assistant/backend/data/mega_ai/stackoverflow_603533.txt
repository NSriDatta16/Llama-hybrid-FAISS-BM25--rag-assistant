The general strategy would be to use Clover (or Cobertura or a similar tool) when you compile your web application. If you use maven for doing your builds, you can use the cobertura plugin: http://mojo.codehaus.org/cobertura-maven-plugin/instrument-mojo.html To add this easily with the cobertura:instrument goal. You then drop the generated war into JBoss just as before. You'd probably also be interested in Glassbox: http://www.glassbox.com/glassbox/Home.html It doesn't generate code coverage, instead it gives you a high-level report at what's going on and can tell you where you may have bottlenecks.
