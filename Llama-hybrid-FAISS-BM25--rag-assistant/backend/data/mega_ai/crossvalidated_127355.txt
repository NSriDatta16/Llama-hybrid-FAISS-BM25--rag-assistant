Likert scale based composite variables

I am conducting a small research into the adoption of smart home technologies for elderly people. In this research I have conducted both questionnaires and interviews, with the questionnaire being conducted among people who were interviewed. In total 11 people were interviewed and so 11 responses were obtained for the questionnaire. Currently I am trying to analyze the questionnaire, I am, however, a little bit stuck so maybe you can provide us with some advice. In my questionnaire I am aiming to measure both loneliness and the health status of elderly people. These variables are measured through 3 and 6 five point Likert scales (strongly disagree - disagree - neutral - agree - strongly agree) respectively. Now that I have got the questionnaire results, I'd like aggregate the different Likert scales, measuring the same concept, into one score that represents the concept, in order to be able to compare participants on their scores. I, however, have no clue how to do this. What I do know is that averaging the scores composing one scale is not reliable as the data is ordinal. Furthermore, median and modes do not make sense either as the number of statements is too low for them to be valuable. Simply adding the scores might be a solution, though I have the feeling that this is not entirely correct due to the possible implied intervals that are suggested by this method. Do you have any advice on how to best calculate a composite score for each of the two scales consisting of 3 and 6 items respectively?
