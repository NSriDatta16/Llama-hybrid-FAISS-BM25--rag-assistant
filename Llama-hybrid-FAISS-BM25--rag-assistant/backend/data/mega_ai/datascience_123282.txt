Machine log detection and removal

I don't know if there's a terminology for the following problem: Suppose I have a collection of data samples where each sample is a long text. A sample may contain machine logs. The DS problem is to train an ML model to remove the machine log; the machine log could be this long text or very short. Anyone know if there's a particular name for this NLP problem, perhaps you can send me some references. I didn't get much luck from searching the term machine log removal ML or similar phrasing. I have tried feeding in my question in ChatGPT, and it responded with log analysis anomaly detection (though this is not exactly what I wanted).
