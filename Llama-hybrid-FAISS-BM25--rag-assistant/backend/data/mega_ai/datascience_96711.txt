Looking at the source code , it seems that the first value is the median value for the epoch and the second value in parentheses is the global average/mean. The difference between the value for loss and loss_classifier is that the value for loss is the sum of the losses of the individual parts (including that of the classifier, 0.1807 + 0.0592 + 0.6662 + 0.2528 = 1.1589 ), whereas the value for loss_classifier is the loss for just the classifier of the model, i.e. the part that classifies the pixels into the different classes.
