predicting time series with support vector machine using R

I am planning to do time series prediction using support vector Machine. I could not find any materials about time series application of support vector machines using R or Mat-lab. Similar question was asked earlier but no answer.It would be great if anybody can help to solve this issue with some examples. Thanks
