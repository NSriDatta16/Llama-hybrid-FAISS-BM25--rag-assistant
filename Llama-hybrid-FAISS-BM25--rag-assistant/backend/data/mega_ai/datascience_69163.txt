The problem you are facing is that the majority of variance is explained by one class with the other class only making a small contribution. Dimesionality reduction via PCA is less than helpful since the focus there is on explaining "majority" of data. One way, I suggest that you try out, is to first classify the data into more than 2 (for argument lets say 50) classes. This will force the unsupervised learning algorithm to account for "minority" factors. The collection of class centroids would be devoid of large part of the population variance and you can then run a classification on the centroids to identify the sub-classes of interest.
