The question underlines a simple fact often overlooked even in statistical circles: for two variables, correlation (and its square) quantify linearity of relationship (does $y = a + bx$?), not agreement (does $y = x$?). A trivial example is that an exact proportionality $y = bx$ implies correlation of 1 for any $b > 0$, but as $b$ moves away from 1 agreement (with ideal as equality of corresponding values) certainly diminishes. Comparison of distributions quantile to quantile, i.e. comparing corresponding order statistics, imparts one or two twists to comparisons that might be made between paired variables. The first twist is required if two distributions are being compared through different-sized samples, say sizes of $m, n, m Concordance correlation (a measure most associated with L. I-K. Lin, but invented earlier) is a correlation-like measure of agreement. If (and only if) two variables have identical values, the concordance correlation will be 1. Note that the question makes no sense unless the variables have the same units of measurement or more generally are recorded in the same way. The concordance correlation can be factored into the usual Pearson correlation and a bias correction. Conversely, Pearson correlation and concordance correlation both return 1 when $y = x$ and departures from that condition will reduce concordance correlation even if they don't reduce Pearson correlation. For an informal introduction to this area, see Cox, N.J. 2006. Assessing agreement of measurements and predictions in geomorphology. Geomorphology 76: 332-346. http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169555X05003740 Here "in geomorphology" indicates the field of the examples, not a restriction of statistical scope. However, use of concordance correlation for paired quantiles is not covered there. Using the data for the example above these calculations in Stata show what is possible. Stata users would need to download concord after identifying locations using search concord, sj . A complete explanation is not given here. The main point for this example is that concordance correlation at 0.259 is quite different from the Pearson correlation at 0.989. (Incidentally, that implies $R^2$ of 0.978.) No adjustments are made here for the effects of monotonicity constraints on confidence or significance results. . concord y x Concordance correlation coefficient (Lin, 1989, 2000): rho_c SE(rho_c) Obs [ 95% CI ] P CI type --------------------------------------------------------------- 0.259 0.027 96 0.205 0.312 0.000 asymptotic 0.204 0.311 0.000 z-transform Pearson's r = 0.989 Pr(r = 0) = 0.000 C_b = rho_c/r = 0.262 Reduced major axis: Slope = 3.133 Intercept = 0.008 Difference = y - x Difference 95% Limits Of Agreement Average Std Dev.
