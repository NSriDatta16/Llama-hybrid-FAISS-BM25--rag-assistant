While I don't encourage using regex to parse HTML, this is simple enough that a regex will suffice. For more complex operations, do use a proper (X)HTML parser like HtmlAgilityPack. This regex should work: ]*\s+action=(["'])(.*?)\1 EDIT: Updated regex so it will work with apostrophes in URLs. Note that the URL is now in the 2nd capture group. See it on rubular
