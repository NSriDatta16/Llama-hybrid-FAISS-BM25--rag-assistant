Confusion about XAML namespace values

I have read that xml namespace value is any arbitrary string value. But in the next paragraph in the book, I have read that : This namespace (xmlns:x) contains the required language components that are defined in the xaml specification, such as the ability to set an objects's name. Please anyone clear me this line. Because this string does not map to any namespace or assembly or anything in .net framework, then how can this namespace contain the language components or types such as Name in x:Name ?
