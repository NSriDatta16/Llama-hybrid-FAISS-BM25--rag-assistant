Build Agent runs from the SYSTEM account by default. SYSTEM account environment variables differ from your normal account which you've used for testing. I suspect that java.exe is not in PATH for the SYSTEM account. Either adjust PATH by adding JDK_HOME\bin to it or configure the Agent service to run from a different account. Remember you need to restart the build agent service before changes to PATH will take effect.
