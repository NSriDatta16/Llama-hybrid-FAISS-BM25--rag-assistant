How about using R code to write an SVG file with the arrow widths set according to your data, and a simple layout. Then load into Inkscape and bend the arrows around, add labels etc etc to your heart's content to make something pretty. Obvious problem: you need to redo all your prettification in Inkscape if your data changes (although you might be able to use your pretty SVG from Inkscape as a template and just substitute new arrow widths in). But honestly, if that multi-coloured mess of straggling squiggles at the top is a good Sankey diagram, I'd hate to see a bad one on a full stomach [although staring at it for a few more minutes has given me a clue about what it's about, a good graphic shouldn't need that].
