Feature Engineering/FS

I've a dataset which consists of 33 features. Out of which first 32 features are latitude & longitude positions for 16 machines at 16 different locations (16latitude & 16 longitude values). The target is sum of power generated by 16 machines at 16 different locations. The task is to build regression model using these 32 features to predict total power generated. My question is what approach should i take to solve this task. How to find whether the positions of these machines matters a lot? Can i build random forest model, if yes then whether the positions will not be lost? (considering it will be built on subset of features) e.g, if i build simple regression, all the features will be taken from 1 to 32 as it is, but if i build random forest it might consider any feature randomnly from 32.
