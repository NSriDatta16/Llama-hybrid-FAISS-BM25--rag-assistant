Dealing with widows in a multicol environment

I have problems with dealing with widows within a multicols environment, that is, I have not managed to instruct LaTeX to remove the them. This PDF document shows an example of the problem. At the top of the second page, I get a widow from the last paragraph of the first page. I have tried a couple of approaches, without luck: setting both \widowpenalty and \clubpenalty to high values switching between \raggedcolumns and \flushcolumns adjusting the collectmore and unbalance counters I've also read through the documentation for multicol but have not found anything useful. Is there anything else I could try? ( The complete LaTeX document for the above example )
