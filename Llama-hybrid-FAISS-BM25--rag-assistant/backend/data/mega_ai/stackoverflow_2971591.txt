default document in web form does not work after using MapPageRoute

I have two strange problems when I use routing in a web form application. Environment: IIS 7.5; .NET 4.0 and Windows 7 64 bit. default document does not work if I use ( http://www.)mydomain.com . The exception message is "The controller for path '/' was not found or does not implement IController". However, if I debug in VS 2010 ( http://localhost:8080 ), this problem has never come out. Here mydomain.com and http://localhost:8080 hit the same code in the same folder of the same computer. I trapped the value of request.path. When local host is used, the value is "default.aspx" while "/" if mydomain.com is accessed. I can use one line (if "/" then redirect to default.aspx) to "fix" the problem but I believe it should have a better way. when I detect request.path, I got such a VERY strange request which I have never seen before: 192.168.1.11/StableWSDiscoveryEndpoint/schemas-xmlsoap-org_ws_2005_04_discovery! I have no idea where it is from. I do not use any web service in my code. The request is posted to the server, and the user agent is WSDAPI. I tried to debug the code from a different browsers other than IE. It looks like I do not get such a request. Edit: I just found the 192.168.1.11/StableWSDiscoveryEndpoint/schemas-xmlsoap-org_ws_2005_04_discovery request is sent from the domain control. Your help will be greatly appreciated.
