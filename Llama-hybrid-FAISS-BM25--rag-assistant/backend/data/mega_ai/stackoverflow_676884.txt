PHP - Alfresco integration

I am currently receiving a Strict Standards error when trying to make an alfresco web service call. I am using the Zend Framework. The tutorial works fine when not using the Zend Framework. If i use the Zend_Soap_Client i get a segmentation error, when i use the PHP Soap_Client i get the following error message: Strict Standards: Declaration of AlfrescoWebService::__call() should be compatible with that of SoapClient::__call() in /opt/work/intranet/shamraiza/src/intranet/library/spectrum/Alfresco/AlfrescoWebService.php on line 130 Strict Standards: Declaration of AlfrescoWebService::__soapCall() should be compatible with that of SoapClient::__soapCall() in /opt/work/intranet/shamraiza/src/intranet/library/spectrum/Alfresco/AlfrescoWebService.php on line 130
