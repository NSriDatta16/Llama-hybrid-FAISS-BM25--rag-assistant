Flex - Passing request data with URL fragments

I'm passing the following parameter as an url fragment to flex. (#groupID=2385) This works great on the development box, but when I put it on the production server.. nothing. Do you think this is a server configuration issue. I presume that flex is talking to the javascript file 'AC_OETags.js' to make this all happen. Any pointers much appreciated. Thanks
