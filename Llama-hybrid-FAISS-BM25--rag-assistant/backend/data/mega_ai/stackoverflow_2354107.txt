Authenticating desktop-based program with online web services (rememberthemilk.com)

I'm trying to create a desktop program that will interact with the online todo list manager rememberthemilk.com. The final step in the authentication process is launching a link where the user can log in to the service and verify that they want to allow the program to access their account. However, right now I don't have a way to determine when they actually tell the web service to authorize my program. Does anyone know how I can figure out when the person has authorized or denied the program? Here's the code I'm currently using: String url = this.GetAuthenticationUrl(frob, AuthenticationPermissions.Write); //open external webpage to make user authenticate this program with RTM System.Diagnostics.Process.Start(url); this.AuthToken = this.GetToken(frob);
