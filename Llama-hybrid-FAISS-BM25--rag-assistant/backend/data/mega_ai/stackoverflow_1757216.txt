The line Agent theAgent(void); Is actually viewed by the compiler as declaring the function theAgent that takes no arguments and returns an Agent. This is explained the the C++ FAQ Lite . To call the default constructor and set up an object of type Agent (as opposed to the statement above that's interpreted as a function declaration,) you can just declare theAgent without using parentheses at all, as in: Agent theAgent; All normal member calls, such as loadSAG will work as expected after this point. As an alternative, if you must have the object on the heap, use this instead: Agent* theAgent = new Agent(); // Notice the * theAgent->loadSAG(); // Use -> instead of . // The code where theAgent is used delete theAgent; // This frees the memory allocated by new
