AIR File.resolvePath doesn't work anymore

I'm having a very strange issue, it looks like my application can't create file anymore. It works w/ directories, but the so-many-times-used resolvePath() methods doesn't. Here is what I do : var databaseFileContent : File = new File(File.desktopDirectory.nativePath + "/testing"); databaseFileContent.createDirectory(); databaseFileContent.resolvePath("test"); (Here I'm trying on desktop but that's the same w/ applicationStorageDirectory) When I execute this, it works only for the "testing" folder which is actually created, but my file isn't. I tried to create another application, doing this : trace(File.desktopDirectory.resolvePath("maiswtf.db").exists); trace(File.applicationStorageDirectory.resolvePath("wtf.db").exists); Both are displaying "false". Am I missing something here? I have another application with this code : var databaseFileContent : File = File.applicationStorageDirectory.resolvePath(File.separator + "sitra.db"); When I run this one, it works perfectly! My file is created at /sitra.db! Any hints? I thinks I'm going mad :/ Thanks!
