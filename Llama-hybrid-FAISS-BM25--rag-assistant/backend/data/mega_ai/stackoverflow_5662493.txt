Sort out Books - Search related question

I've recently been asked a question in technical interview that goes like this. You have to find a specific book in a library, and the moment you went inside, you saw that all the books are scattered all around the library, i.e. books are not placed in organized way inside library. How will you proceed to look for that specific book? There is no specification about the book except that you know the Name of the Book . I know this is related to some search algorithm, but what algorithm can be used for searching book in this case?
