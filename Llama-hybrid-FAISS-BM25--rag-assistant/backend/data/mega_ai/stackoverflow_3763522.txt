Ah.. I would be setting GraphicsDevice.DepthStencilState to an instance of DepthStencilState with any number of properties set. Seems like the RenderState was broken into a bunch of other states. I was looking for in the individual properties inside of GraphicsDevice before, but they seem to be better organized now for easier state management. depthState = new DepthStencilState(); depthState.DepthBufferEnable = true; /* Enable the depth buffer */ depthState.DepthBufferWriteEnable = true; /* When drawing to the screen, write to the depth buffer */ GraphicsDevice.DepthStencilState = depthState;
