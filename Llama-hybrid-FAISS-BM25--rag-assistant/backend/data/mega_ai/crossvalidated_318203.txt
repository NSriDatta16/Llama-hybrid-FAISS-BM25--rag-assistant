I think you definetly have to mix over the sampled values eventually. There are also lecture notes by Peter Hoff on "Introduction to Bayesian Statistics for the Social Sciences" saying so. Otherwise you wouldn't have taken into account the masses recieved from the posterior. So, you build the empirical distribution of your samled values x^{*j} and then sample again from this distribution. As an example: If your posterior was discrete (only point masses on atoms) then some of your parameter samples are going to take on the same values. If you finally mix over them, you take into account "how often" such parameter emerged from the posterior - put differently, how likely it is. Then averaging according to this appearances gives the posterior predictive which should appro. be the same as doing above procedure with the eventual mixing, at least if the sample size(s) is(are) large.
