Is the posterior distribution random?

The posterior distribution in a bayesian setting, $p(\theta \mid X)$ , is random as it depends on the random observations $X$ . However, my question is, as seen as our belief over the parameter space $\Theta$ , does it makes sense to refer to it as something that is random ? Since the prior distribution $p(\theta)$ is not random (if we exclude the case of hierarchical models) why would the posterior distribution, i.e. the new prior, be random? Sorry in advance if this is off-topic.
