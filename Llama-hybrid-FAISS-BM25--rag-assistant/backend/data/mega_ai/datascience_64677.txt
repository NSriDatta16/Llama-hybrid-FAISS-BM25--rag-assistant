TL;DR If you are training the document-embedding model, then split the data before you convert the text into embeddings. If you are using a pre-trained document-embedding model, then it won't matter and it is pre-processing step that it doesn't matter when you execute it. Pipeline when training your own document-embedding model Split your text data into train/validate/test sets. Use your train set to train the document-embedding model. Use your trained document-embedding model to convert train and validation sets to train your other model (e.g. classification model). Test your final model by using your trained document-embedding model to convert the test set and test the trained final (classification) model.
