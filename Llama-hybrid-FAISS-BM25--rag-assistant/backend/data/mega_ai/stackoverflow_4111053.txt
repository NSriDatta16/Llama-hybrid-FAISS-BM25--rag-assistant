Consider HTML 5 and related features About " better way of achieving my goal altogether ", yes indeed! The proof of concept of a full fledged browser game has already been successfully carried out in Google's implementation of Quake in HTML 5 . What you'll want to do is rejig your technology to be more in line with the way HTML 5 works (or will work). For example, you might want to use Web Sockets instead of AJAX calls. Additionally take a look through Google's code blog for an overview of this game implementation and the project homepage to get sample code and learn from it. Do some research on HTML 5 implementation levels in the various browsers to know in advance where your game will work right now . (e.g. consider HTML tag support , media support , Canvas support , etc). Also see info and wiki from the WHATWG . Here's a nifty slide presentation I like to show for demo . These technologies are still in their infancy though, so be informed. Also the W3C specs and related info . You might have something good going if you pull it off in the early days of HTML 5 rather than following up later. A while has passed since April 2010 when Google proved Quake in the browser. This technologic will only continue to progress and be more broadly implemented over time so I suggest that you go ahead and start experimenting in that direction. Be amazed by Google Chrome Experiments (specific to the Chrome browser of course). These examples will give you some great ideas. Pay particular attention to those games already implemented and their features to use as a gauge for your own work. Good Luck! And have fun while increasing your skill set too.
