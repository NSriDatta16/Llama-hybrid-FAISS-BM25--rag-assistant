Unfortunately FTP and SFTP do not support any form of client notification. Much like HTTP they are based on a request/response scheme, where each data transfer is initiated by the client. What makes things worse is that, contrary to HTTP, there is no way to ask the server to inform the client of any changes since a specific date. This means that not only you have to use polling, but also that said polling will by no means be lightweight. As far as FUSE is related, most FTP and SFTP modules that are available only update their view of the filesystem when the userspace applications ask for a directory listing (e.g. hitting Refresh in a file browser window). They do not perform polling on their own. Your userspace application will have to initiate the refresh by polling the directory itself. EDIT: To clarify a couple of things, recent versions of FUSE do support notification events. They simply pass through the events from the modules to the kernel. The modules still have to generate them and in the case of an FTP/SFTP client module that is impossible without polling the server. Also keep in mind that many current NFS implementations do not support change notifications either, despite the fact that NFSv4.1 has the necessary provisions. Many SMB/CIFS servers (esp. those in cheap Network-Attached-Storage embedded systems) also have limited to no support.
