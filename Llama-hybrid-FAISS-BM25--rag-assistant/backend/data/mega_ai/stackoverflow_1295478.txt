Directly fetching a list from a column's data with MySQL

Let us suppose I have to deal with lots of grandmothers that have lots of cats. I have a table granny_cat : granny_id | kitty_name -------------------- 1 Kizzy 1 Jimmy 1 Katty 2 Georges 2 Albert 3 Panther and I want to retrieve a list of granny 1 cat's, i.e. to get something like (with php syntax) array("Kizzy","Jimmy","Katty") However, the query SELECT kitty_name WHERE granny_id = 1 returns something like array ( array('kitty_name' => "Kizzy"), array('kitty_name' => "Jimmy"), array('kitty_name' => "Katty") ) what is quite logical, as I can fetch two, or more fields with a similar query. I can obviously map this array to get what I want, however, I wonder whether there is a (simple) way to get it directly from mysql, or not. Thanks.
