completely agree with @Robert. It cannot be stressed enough, hibernate session objects should be treated with the same care as a JDBC connection, you should be aware of when and where it is opened and when and where it is closed in all cases. This is of course one of the reasons people find spring very useful, it provides a very complete framework for managing the life cycle of resources like jdbc connections and hibernate sessions.
