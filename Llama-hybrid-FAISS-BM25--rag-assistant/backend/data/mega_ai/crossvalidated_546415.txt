Should a numerical predictor be removed in favour of a logical predictor when both are highly correlated to each other?

The easier way to understand it might be with an easy example. Let's imagine we have 2 predictors/variables: hours_studied and exam_failed. These two variables are highly correlated: -0.91, which is easily understandable when you plot the data: Generally, out of a couple of correlated variables, I tend to remove the one with a higher average correlation to all predictors. In this case, let's imagine that the one to be removed is 'hours_studied'. Even though theoretically it makes sense, I still consider 'hours_studied' to be probably a more informative predictor than 'exam_failed_binary'. Thus, is my original strategy flawed, or is it irrelevant to remove either of those? A possible explanation might be that you should not remove predictors based on the correlation between different predictor classes. Correlation should only be performed between similar class predictors, in order to only remove highly correlated predictors that do not provide extra information in any other way.
