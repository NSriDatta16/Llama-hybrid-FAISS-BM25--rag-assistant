You are a bit out of luck here. In the least there will need to be created 300k strings. With an average length of 8-10 char and 2 bytes per char thats 6Mb in the minimum. Add object pointer overhead per string (8 bytes) and you run into your memory limit. If you absolutely must have that many files in a single dir, which i would not recommend as your file system will have problems, your best bet is to run a native process (not JNI) via Runtime.exec. Keep in mind that you will tie yourself down to the OS (ls vs dir). You will be able to get a list of files as one large string and will be responsible for post processing it into what you want. Hope this helps.
