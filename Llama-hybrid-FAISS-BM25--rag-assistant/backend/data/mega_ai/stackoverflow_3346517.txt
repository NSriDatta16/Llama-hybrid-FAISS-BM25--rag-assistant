Visual studio 2010 IDE layout

My current visual studio panel layout looks similar to the drawing below: ----------------- | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |--| | | | | | |---------| | | | | | ----------------- I really don't need the full height of the screen for the toolbox or server explorer and was wondering if there was a way to change the layout so that the bottom section extended all the way to the left edge of the screen like in this drawing: ----------------- | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |--| | | | | |------------| | | | | ----------------- I am space constrained on the right side, so a symetric layout with the bottom section running full width wouldn't be acceptable. I've tried dragging stuff around but haven't had any luck in getting VS to position the panels as I want. Is my desired layout not possible or am I missing the right way to coax the layout into fitting?
