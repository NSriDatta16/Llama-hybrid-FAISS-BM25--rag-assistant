DOM Manipulation with PHP

I would like to make a simple but non trivial manipulation of DOM Elements with PHP but I am lost. Assume a page like Wikipedia where you have paragraphs and titles ( , ). They are siblings. I would like to take both elements, in sequential order. I have tried GetElementbyName but then you have no possibility to organize information. I have tried DOMXPath->query() but I found it really confusing. Just parsing something like: Title1 Paragraph1 Paragraph2 Title2 Paragraph3 into: Title1 Paragraph1 Paragraph2 Title2 Paragraph3 With a few bits of HTML code I do not need between all. Thank you. I hope question does not look like homework.
