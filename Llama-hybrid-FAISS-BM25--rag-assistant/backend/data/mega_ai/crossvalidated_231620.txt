Understanding lack of fit in logistic regression

How does one interpret the fact that a dataset has a poor fit / lack of fit with respect to a logistic regression model? I can make sense, for example, of a lack of fit in the case of a linear regression: the data cannot be modeled linearly. But I can't make sense of a lack of fit for a logistic regression. Do we just mean that there is no S-curve that effectively models the probability distribution of the data ( edit per the top comment : log odds of the data)?
