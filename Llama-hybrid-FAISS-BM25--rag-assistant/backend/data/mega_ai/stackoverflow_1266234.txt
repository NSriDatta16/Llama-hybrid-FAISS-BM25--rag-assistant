I've seen WordPress's backend used as a CMS without a front end template. They used WordPress to write, organize, and otherwise manage content, but used their existing site plus a few database queries to pull in the content from WP. It may be easier to just create a basic WordPress template from your existing site's design. It takes about 10 minutes when you've done it a lot, or a few hours for a newbie.
