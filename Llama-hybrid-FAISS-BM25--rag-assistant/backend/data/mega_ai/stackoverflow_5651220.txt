What version of Internet Explorer is built into Pocket PC 4.20 (build 14053)?

I'm trying to find the IE version that's on a mobile device with 'Pocket PC 4.20' (shown on the About screen). Also what's the official brand of this OS, is it 'Pocket PC 2002' or 'Windows Mobile 2003'? I was hoping to get jQuery Mobile running on it but it doesn't seem to work, nor does the standard jQuery library. The user-agent sent by the browser is IE 4.01
