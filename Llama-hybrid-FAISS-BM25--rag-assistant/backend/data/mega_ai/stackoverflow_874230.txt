In app-engine-patch there's a FakeModelListProperty and FakeModel (import both from ragendja.dbutils). Derive MyTuple from FakeModel and set fields = ('field1', 'field2'). Those fields will automatically get converted to JSON when stored in the list, so you could manually edit them in a textarea. Of course, this only works for primitive types (strings, integers, etc.). Take a look at the source if this doesn't suffice. http://code.google.com/p/app-engine-patch/
