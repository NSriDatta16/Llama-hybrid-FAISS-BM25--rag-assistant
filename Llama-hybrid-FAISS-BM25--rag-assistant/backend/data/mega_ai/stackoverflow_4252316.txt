Changing the URL and not reloading a page (this time without a url fragment)

Just wondering as to how did Google code this website without it reloading the website when the page AND url are changed. Take a look and go from page to page. http://www.20thingsilearned.com/ I've done a similar technique using a # hash change operation (with use of by the onhashchange event) to achieve the same result, however, this technique is far more cleaner. Is this a chrome-specific feature? Or do all HTML5-enabled browsers support it? Or is there some complex combination of frames that are used together?
