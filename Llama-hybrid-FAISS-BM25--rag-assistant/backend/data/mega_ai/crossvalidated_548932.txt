I follow this area pretty closely, but I think this subfield is so new no textbook exists (yet). However, there are some course videos that are fairly good: Machine Learning & Causal Inference: A Short Course at Stanford (accompanying tutorial ) Summer Institute in Machine Learning in Economics (MLESI21) at University of Chicago There is also a nice survey paper: "Machine learning methods that economists should know about" by Susan Athey, Guido Imbens in the Annual Review of Economics ( link to draft )
