Can confirmatory factor analysis be used to test the components form a principal components analysis?

I have completed a PCA on a data set in study 1 (using the principal function in the psych package in R) and now I am wondering if I can complete a CFA on my study 2 data to confirm my results from study 1 are reliable. Is this the acceptable method or is there a different analysis that I should complete for my goal?
