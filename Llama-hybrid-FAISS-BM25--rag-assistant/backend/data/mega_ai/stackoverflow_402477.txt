You're definitely looking for 'Autosuggest/Autocomplete' This is rather time-consuming to implement fully if you want to do it in pure javascript, but yes, you could use the example from strager to get started. What I recommend is using JQuery instead. JQuery has a very nice plugin for autocomplete that you can use. I just implemented in one of my projects a couple of days ago and it seems to work fine. There's an important saying that you must remember while making software -- 'Don't try to re-invent the wheel.' If other programmers have done it already, and they are kind enough to share, use it, and thank them. Cheers!
