Does a model fitted in a Regression Tree will also fit a NN?

I currently have a quite ok model fitting my data with Regression Tree and a Random Forest. However, while trying to move on to a Neural Network (to evaluate other models), I have been struggling to put above average R2_score results. Even though my RF model could put good results. So far I: Tested several combinations of activation (relu, tanh etc.) Tested different layers-size combinations Normalizing/Standardizing my Data Removed a couple features (which actually performed OK in the Random Forest) Tried different random samplings by changing the stratification and the RandomSeed values As I'm pretty much getting a bit confused by those approaches, my question might be a bit elementary, but: Does a model that was able to be fit by a regression tree, should also be able to be fit by a NN? Is there any restriction I'm unaware of?
