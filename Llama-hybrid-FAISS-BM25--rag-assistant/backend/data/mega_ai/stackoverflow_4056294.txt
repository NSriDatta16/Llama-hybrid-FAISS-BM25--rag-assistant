There could be many possible problems going on here. Since you didn't post the Create method of CBoard I don't know if you're ever properly allocating storage for fields . Regardless, it's possible that CField* operator() (int x_, int y_) const may simply be returning null because the condition you wrote isn't evaluating to true. Are you checking for a null pointer here? Also, instead of getting involved in this crazy double-pointer memory management, why not just use an std::vector ?
