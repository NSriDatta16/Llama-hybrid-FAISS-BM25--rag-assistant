Multinomial logit with different sample sizes in three groups

I have 3 groups in my dependent variable. The sample sizes on the 3 are very different. I have about 10000 in the first group, 35000 in the second and 100,000 in the third. My question is: Should we sample down group 2 and 3 before modeling? Paul Allison talks about this topic briefly in his book on logistic regression using SAS, where he says if you have two groups with different sample sizes, we could sample down one and finally adjust the intercept of the regression equation. I want to know how this will work in a multinomial situation. Any help is appreciated. If anyone can help me with what the equations would look like for a multinomial logit model, that would be great with intercepts being adjusted. I believe there are two equations. Wonder how the intercepts would get adjusted. Thank you
