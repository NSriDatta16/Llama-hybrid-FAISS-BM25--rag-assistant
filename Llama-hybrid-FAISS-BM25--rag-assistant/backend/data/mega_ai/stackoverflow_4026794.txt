I got an answer from Arun Ranganathan, the editor of the File API: The programmer (using the File API to programmatically manipulate user's file selection) cannot contravene a user's decision. So the API does NOT allow the programmer to either add a file to the user's selections or delete a file from the user's selection. If we allowed this, this would be a gaping security hole. Bad Web Sites might be able to do Very Bad Things or at least Very Annoying Things. This is why the current paradigm does NOT allow any interaction with the underlying file system that is NOT user approved at least via the File dialog box (currently spawned with input type="file"). I agree that the FileList should reflect what the user initially selected in the file picker and that being able to add things to the FileList would be a huge security hole. I can't see that being able to remove things would cause such huge security issues, but I can see how it could be used for less than positive purposes.
