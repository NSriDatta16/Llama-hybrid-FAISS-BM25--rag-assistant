Natural language processing (NLP) is a field of computer science, artificial intelligence, and computational linguistics. ElasticSearch is a search engine based on Lucene. ElasticSearch uses parts of NLP (e.g., tokenization and stemming). ElasticSearch also includes software engineering elements to ensure a search solution is performant. Since NLP is entire discipline, there are many parts of NLP that are not related to ElasticSearch.
