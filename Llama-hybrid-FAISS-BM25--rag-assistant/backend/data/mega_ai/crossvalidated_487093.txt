explain the cost function of scalar vector machine (SVM)

I am unable to understand the above cost function. The two possible outputs ( $y$ ) are $-1$ and $+1$ . As far as i know, $x_i$ values are individual training example values, $y_i$ are actual true values for that example and w is the weights that we are adjusting so as to minimise the cost. if the actual output is $1$ and and my SVM predicts it as $-1$ my classifier is penalised, how will my SVM penalise? how much will be the penalty? I know this function gives cost 0 for that training example when prediction is correct and some penalty if predicted wrong. I am also confused how $\max(0,1-y(wx+b))$ outputs the cost for one training example. please enlighten me how this cost function works.
