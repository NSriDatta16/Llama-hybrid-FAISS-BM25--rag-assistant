Embedding a winform within a winform (c#)

Is it possible to embed a windows form within another windows form? I have created a windows form in Visual Studio along with all its associated behaviour. I now want to create another windows form containing a tab view, and I want to embed the first windows form into the tab view. Is this possible?
