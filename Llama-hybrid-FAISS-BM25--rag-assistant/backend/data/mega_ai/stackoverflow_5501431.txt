Was PreferenceFragment intentionally excluded from the compatibility package?

I'm looking to write preferences that can be applied to both 3.0 and pre-3.0 devices. Discovering that PreferenceActivity contains deprecated methods (although these are used in the accompanying sample code), I looked at PreferenceFragement and the compatibility package to solve my woes. It appears, though, that PreferenceFragment isn't in the compatibility package. Can anyone tell me whether this was intentional? If so, can I easily target a range of devices (i.e. =3.0) or will I have to jump through hoops? If it wasn't intentionally excluded, can we expect a new release of the compatibility package? Or is there another workaround that is safe to use?
