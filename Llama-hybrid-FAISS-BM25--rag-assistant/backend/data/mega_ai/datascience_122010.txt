After one hot encoding of the tags, your features will increase. Then the curse of dimensionality will occur. In this case, you should apply PCA(Principal Component Analysis) to reduce the dimensionality or you can plot the correlation matrix and remove the low-correlated & high-correlated features with labels or Choose a machine learning algorithm that is suitable for your recommender system task, such as decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting models, or linear models to find out the important features.
