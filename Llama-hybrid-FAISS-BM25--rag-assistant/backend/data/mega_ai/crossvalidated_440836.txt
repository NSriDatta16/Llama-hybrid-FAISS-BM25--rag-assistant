Compare two distributions with bias

I have been programming in R and have a dataset containing the results (succes or not) of two Machine Learning algorithms which have been tried out using different amounts of parameters. An example is provided below: type success paramater_amount a1 0 15639 a1 0 18623 a1 1 19875 a2 1 12513 a2 1 10256 a2 0 12548 I now want to compare both algorithms to see which one has the best overall performance. But there is a catch. It is known that the higher the parameter_amount, the higher the chances for success. When checking out the parameter amounts both algorithms were tested on, one can also notice that a1 has been tested with higher parameter amounts than a2 was. This would make simply counting the amount of successes of both algorithms unfair. What would be a good approach to handle this scenario?
