Interpreting importance of features in logisitic regression model

I am trying to find the importance of a specific feature or how much impact a specific feature has on a model by looking at feature weights. To my knowledge the feature weights are not scaled in ML implementation of logistic regression. Is there a way to obtain feature importance (other than recursive feature elimination method) or get standardized feature weights in ML -PYSPARK implementation. Any help will be greatly appreciated. Thanks.
