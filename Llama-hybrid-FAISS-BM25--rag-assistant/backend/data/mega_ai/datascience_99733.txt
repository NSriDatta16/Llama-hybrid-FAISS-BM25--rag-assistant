Plotting SVM hyperplane margin

I'm trying to understand how to plot SVM hyperplane and its margins by this example: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/svm/plot_svm_margin.html And I got stuck at the plotting the parallels part: # plot the parallels to the separating hyperplane that pass through the # support vectors (margin away from hyperplane in direction # perpendicular to hyperplane). This is sqrt(1+a^2) away vertically in # 2-d. margin = 1 / np.sqrt(np.sum(clf.coef_ ** 2)) yy_down = yy - np.sqrt(1 + a ** 2) * margin yy_up = yy + np.sqrt(1 + a ** 2) * margin At the comment section we see: This is sqrt(1+a^2) away vertically in 2-d. So, my question is why np.sqrt(1 + a ** 2) * margin is the vertical distance from a hyperplane to its parallel line? How did we come up with it? *Note: a here is just a slope of a hyperplane, and margin is a magnitude of the distance between the hyperplane and the parallel dashed line. I also drew a picture as I can see the problem:
