Anyone else notice that $(SolutionDir) resolves to ProjectDir when loading Wix projects into Vs2010?

I'm using Vs2010 and Wix 3.6.0917.0, for the record. I use the $(SolutionDir) property quite a bit in my .wixproj file, since I only ever build the installer as part of a solution build or as part of a team build, and never by itself. However, while building from the command line works just fine (both from cmd on the desktop and when building on build agents), when I attempt to reload the .wixproj file into the IDE, I get errors because all the $(SolutionDir) variables are resolving to the project directory, not the solution directory. Consider: C:\workspace\projectCollection\teamProject\branch\solution.sln C:\workspace\projectCollection\teamProject\branch\source\installer\installer.wixproj and assume a shared custom targets file: C:\workspace\projectCollection\teamProject\branch\build\shared.targets which is referenced inside installer.wixproj with: Command line builds work fine... C:\workspace\projectCollection\teamProject\branch\> MSBuild /t:build /property:Platform=x64;Configuration=Debug solution.sln 0 Errors 0 Warnings Build succeeded! But load into vs2010 and you see... The imported project "C:\workspace\projectCollection\teamProject\branch\source\installer\build\shared.targets" was not found. Confirm that the path in the declaration is correct, and that the file exists on disk. C:\workspace\projectCollection\teamProject\branch\source\installer\installer.wixproj You can see here that the resolved result of $(SolutionDir)build\shared.targets is getting the project directory and not the solution directory. What gives?
