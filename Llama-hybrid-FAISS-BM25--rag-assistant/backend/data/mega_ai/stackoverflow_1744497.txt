WPF Layout of user control as a run

In WPF, I want to create a Window that looks like the following: Application with user controls http://www.freeimagehosting.net/uploads/86209e1a87.png On the screen are four user control, #1, 2, 3, 4. As you can see, user control 2 should not be rendered as a box, but inlined. If this were a WPF flow document: 1, 3, 4 would be a paragraph (boxing) 2 a run (inlining) The reason is that 2 could be used in another form without splitting for 3. Do you have any idea how to do this in a proper manner ? Some idea already thought of: 2 is and ordinary user control (boxing). When placed in the window, 2, 3, 4 are placed in a canvas, using there Z-Order and margin ton control how they are rendered 2 has a grid already formatted so that it could accept 3 and 4 in it as ContentControl, and we inject them via Xaml or code behind 2 exposes the main Grid as a property, and via the Attached Property goodness, we add the data for 3 and 4 We create our own layout control and implement the Arrange and Measure methods to create a layout acting like a Run And some others that are not as clean... Any thoughts ? Thanks, Patrick
