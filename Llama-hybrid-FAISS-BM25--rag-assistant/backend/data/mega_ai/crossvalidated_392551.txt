7 accidents per 30 days on average, but variance is 12. Why Poisson distribution can't be used here?

Let's say a city has 7 accidents per 30 days on average. We can use Poisson distribution formula where $\lambda = 7$ $$\frac 1 {n!} (\lambda t)^n e^{-\lambda t}$$ But in Poisson distribution the lambda equals variance. In this case variance is $12.$ So we can't use Poisson. But why we can't use Poisson distribution, what does it mean variance is not equal to lambda?
