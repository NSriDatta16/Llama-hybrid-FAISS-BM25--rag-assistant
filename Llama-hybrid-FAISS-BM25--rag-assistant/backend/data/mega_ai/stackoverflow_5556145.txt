NHibernate Hierarchichal data fetching with single query

I have a table in DB where columns are like below. Id Name Publisher ParentId ------------------------------------------ 100 Sample1 ExamplePublisher NULL 200 Sample2 ExamplePubl3 100 NHibernate mapping is like below. When I query NHIbernate like below I am successfully getting the object with child collections filled in properly. IList allList = se.CreateQuery("select e from PaperMaster e join fetch e.ChildCollection where e.Id=100") .SetResultTransformer(new DistinctRootEntityResultTransformer()) .List (); The problem I am facing is for each child a query runs to fill the object which seems to be very costly. Is there a way to simplify this? For example in a single query I should be able to get the full relation.
