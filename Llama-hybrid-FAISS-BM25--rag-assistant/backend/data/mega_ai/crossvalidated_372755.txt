Bias and variance of coefficient estimation of logistic regression

For a linear regression problem $y=X\beta + \epsilon$ , I think we know very well that the estimated $\hat{\beta} = \dfrac{X^Ty}{X^TX}$ is unbiased, and has the variance introduced by $\epsilon$ . It sounds reasonable to me that over the years, we might have a good understanding of this same question for logistic regression also, but I cannot find any. I wonder if we have these studies for Logistic regression, or maybe it's not even possible to study these questions because Logistic regression does not have a closed-form solution of $\beta$ ?
