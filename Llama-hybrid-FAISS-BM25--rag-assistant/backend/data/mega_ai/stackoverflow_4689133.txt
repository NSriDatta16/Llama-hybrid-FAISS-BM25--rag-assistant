Check out SpringSource Tool Suite. I started using it a couple of months ago. It comes with a pre-configured SpringSource tc Server (development version). Basically when I am working on a web application I simply drag it from the Project Explorer onto the SpringSource tc Server and continue developing. The code including Java class changes and the JSP changes are reloaded on the fly. So any changes you make can be viewed pretty much instantly. The other thing I do is with Jetty, similar to what Yuval mentioned however my configuration is in Maven 2's pom.xml and looks something like org.mortbay.jetty maven-jetty-plugin /tas /tmp ${basedir}/jetty-env.xml org.mortbay.jetty.webapp.parentLoaderPriority true I do however prefer to do manual reloading with jetty so I usually add manual into the element. The manual reload only applies to changes that I make in Java files. So after a number of substantial changes and successful pass of the test cases then I hit enter in the Jetty console and the whole thing is reloaded. (I like the Ctrl-S shortcut too much and hence hit it after every second line, but I don't want Jetty to reload after every second line of code I write). Also keep in mind that the manual reload applies only to Java class changes and is required only when you change the Java class or perhaps an XML configuration. If all you have changed is the JSP then you should not need to reload the change is picked up automatically and you can hit refresh in the browser to see the JSP change without the manual reload. Hope this helps!
