Floating point numbers prove the existence of God by negation, as they are most certainly the work of the devil... One day after a long day of running the universe God and Satan got together for a beer and began reminiscing. "Hey, remember the stuff we pulled on that guy Job?" said God. "Yeah," Satan replied, "those were the days, eh? Lots of smiting and damning unto eternal perdition..." "Not to mention all the prophesying and plagues and everything", said God. "Yeah - those were they days". God sighed. "Say, I know it's been a while but, um, how'd you feel about doing something like that again?". "Funny you should mention it," said Satan smoothly. "You know I've always been interested in technology...". "Sure", said God, "plenty of opportunity to get folks to sell their souls for another round of funding, eh?" He chuckled. "So, whatcha got in mind?" "Well", said Satan, "I've put my best daemons on it. They've been working like the very devil to come up with something new and I think they've got it. It's a little something we call 'floating point'..."
