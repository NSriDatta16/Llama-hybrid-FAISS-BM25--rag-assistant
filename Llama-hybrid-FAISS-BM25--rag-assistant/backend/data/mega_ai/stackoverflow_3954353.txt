Detecting shape coordinates in Canvas

I'm writing drag & drop functionality in my HTML5 Canvas application and am wondering how to detect if I'm clicking on a shape other than a rectangle or square, in which case I would do something like this inside of my 'mousedown' event handler: if (evt._x > 13 && evt._x I don't see how to easily do something like that with an arc like this: ctx.arc(25, 25, 20, 0, (Math.PI/180)*360); I hope that is clear, thank you in advance.
