Your outcome variable $y$ is very overdispersed relative to a binomial, so the binomial model is misspecified. From one example of fit2 , modified to quasibinomial: > summary(glm(formula = y ~ x + probe0 + probe1 + probe2, family = "quasibinomial")) Call: glm(formula = y ~ x + probe0 + probe1 + probe2, family = "quasibinomial") Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -61.135 -22.809 -9.250 9.047 189.121 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) -9.539830 0.005434 -1755.604 If you don't have any allowance for the overdispersion, larger models will always fit better. Basically, you are accepting a new model if it improves the binomial deviance by 2, and a random predictor will improve the binomial deviance by an average of over 800. You can't just use AIC with quasilikelihood, you'd need something like Takeuchi's criterion, or you'd need to fit something like a beta-binomial model.
