Multivariate Time Series

I am trying to learn multivariate time series using R. I have two time series and I want to see if I could use one of those to predict the other one, and after that check if the model holds or there is no relationship between both variables. Does anyone have an example that I could use to understand this concept? Thank you and kind regards
