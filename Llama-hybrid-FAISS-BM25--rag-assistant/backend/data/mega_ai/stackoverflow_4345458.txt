Advice on MoM and large messages

I'm designing a system that will use jms and some messaging software (I'm leaning towards ActiveMQ) as middleware. There will be less than 100 agents, each pushing at most 5000 messages per day through the queue. The payload per message will be around 100 bytes each. I expect roughly half (2500) of the messages to cluster around midnight and the other half will be somewhat evenly distributed during the day. The figures given above are all on the higher end of what I expect. (Yeah, I'll probably eat that statement in a near future). There is one type of message where the payload will be considerably larger, say in the range of 5-50mb. These messages will only be sent a few times per day from each agent. My questions are: Will this cause me problems in any way or is it perfectly normal to send larger amounts of data through a message queue? For example, will it reduce throughput (smaller messages queuing up) while dealing with the larger messages? Or will the message queue choke on larger messages? Or should I approach this in a different way, say sending the location of the data through jms, and let the end receiver pick up the data elsewhere? (I was hoping not to have a special case due to coupling, security issues, and extra configuration). I'm completely new to the practical details of jms, so just tell me if I need to provide more details. Edited: I accepted Andres truly awesome answer. Keep posting advices and opinions, I will keep upvote everything useful.
