If I understand your question correctly, you are trying to tune a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. A standard set-up would be to have a Markov Chain $(X_t)$ targeting distribution $\pi$ , with at step $t$ $$\begin{eqnarray} Y_t&=&X_{t-1}+\epsilon_t\quad \epsilon_t\sim\mathcal N(0, \sigma^2)\\ \alpha_t&=&\frac{\pi(Y_t)}{\pi(X_{t-1})}\\ X_t&=&\begin{cases}Y_t \text{ if }\alpha_t>U_t\quad U_t\sim U(0,1)\\X_{t-1} \text{ otherwise.}\end{cases} \end{eqnarray}$$ The choice of $\sigma$ will impact the behaviour that you describe. If $\sigma$ is small, then $Y_t$ is very close to $X_{t-1}$ : the value will often be accepted, but the chain will move by small steps (thus the autocorrelation is high). If $\sigma$ is large, then the proposed value will often be rejected (thus the autocorrelation is also high), but when it is accepted, the chain moves by a lot. There is a sweet spot in the middle, where you make changes that are large enough to make the chain move quite fast, but small enough that you don't reject too often. In a simple case, Gelman, Gilks and Roberts (1997) have shown that this sweet spot is obtained when $E[\alpha_t]=0.234$ . In practice, as long as the dimension of your problem is reasonable, an acceptance probability in that area will lead to good results.
