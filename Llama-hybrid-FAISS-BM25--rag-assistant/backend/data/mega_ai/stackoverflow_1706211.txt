you have to use the server side to do that on all browser. If you choose the server side way, you would have to parse the User-Agent header and add the valid CSS from that parsing. I advise you not to do that because User-Agent parsing is a tedious task and there is more elegant way to deal with browser quirks. Worth to be noted that if you are interested only adding special CSS rules(files) for Internet explorer there is a special syntax: for IE 6 and up Also please note there is some CSS framework to avoid to have per browser rules. The biggest one in my opinion is probably YUI 3 Grid . This would give you the same look and feels on all browsers if used properly.
