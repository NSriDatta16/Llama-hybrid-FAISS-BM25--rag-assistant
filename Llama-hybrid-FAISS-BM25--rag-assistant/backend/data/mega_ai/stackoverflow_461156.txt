In terms of simplicity, FORTH is going to be one of the easier languages to develop. It's threaded interpretive rather than truly compiled, but you'll still be dealing with parsing, variable storage, etc.. For a compiler, I'd go with C or Pascal, both of which are quite compact and have source for compilers available.
