How to select variables in R from NHANES dataset to fit a logistic regression?

I need to fit a logistic regression of the NHANES dataset available in R. It has 76 variables in it but I have been able to filter it to 40 variables by removing NA columns. I still need to select the best variable out of these 40. Is there any way to conduct this variable selection in R in a simple way?
