I use a format similar to yours except that I put the ON keyword on the same line as the join and I put AND and OR operators at the end of lines so that all of my join/selection criteria line up nicely. While my style is similar to John Sansom's, I disagree about putting join criteria in the WHERE clause. I think that it should be with the joined table so that it's organized and easy to find. I also tend to put parentheses on new lines, aligned with the line above it and then indenting on the next line, although for short statements, I may just keep the parentheses on the original line. For example: SELECT my_column FROM My_Table WHERE my_id IN ( SELECT my_id FROM Some_Other_Table WHERE some_other_column IN (1, 4, 7) ) For CASE statements, I give a new line and indentation for each WHEN and ELSE , and I align the END back to the CASE : CASE WHEN my_column = 1 THEN 'one' WHEN my_column = 2 THEN 'two' WHEN my_column = 3 THEN 'three' WHEN my_column = 4 THEN 'four' ELSE 'who knows' END
