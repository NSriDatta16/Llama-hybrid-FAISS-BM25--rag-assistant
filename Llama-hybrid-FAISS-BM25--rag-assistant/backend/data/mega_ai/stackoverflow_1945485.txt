I would use SQLite over Access - for SQLite you just need to ship the DLLs, for Access you need an installer (although I think it's built into recent versions of Windows). Also SQLite is a better DB. Or you could of course abstract the data stoarage mechanism using the Repository pattern or similar? If you were to store the data in a file, then load it and expose it from your repository using Linq-To-Objects, then later you could just drop-in replace that with Linq-to-SQL without changing any of your client code.
