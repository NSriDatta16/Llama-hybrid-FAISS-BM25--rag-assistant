Code coverage in unit testing

This is about .NET libraries (DLLs). What are the options for measuring code that is covered by unit test cases? Is it actually worth the efforts (measuring the code coverage)? I wonder it might be too easy to cover 70% of code and almost impossible to go beyond 90%. [EDIT] Another interesting question (put up by "E Rolnicki") is: What is considered a reasonable coverage %?
