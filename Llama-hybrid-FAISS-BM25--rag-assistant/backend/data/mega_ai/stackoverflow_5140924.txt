Detect only double or single tap with UIViews?

I want to detect JUST double / single tap when the user touches a view. I made something like this: - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; CGPoint prevLoc = [touch ] if(touch.tapCount == 2) NSLog(@"tapCount 2"); else if(touch.tapCount == 1) NSLog(@"tapCount 1"); } But it always detect 1 tap before 2 taps. How can I detect just 1 / 2 tap?
