Regression analysis accommodates situations where the explanatory variables/covariates can have any values, including zero. There is no particular model needed for this --- it can be implemented in almost any model. If there are lots of zeros for a particular covariate, the only issue this creates is that it affects the leverage of the data points and one must therefore be careful to assess the functional form of the posited relationship with the response variable.
