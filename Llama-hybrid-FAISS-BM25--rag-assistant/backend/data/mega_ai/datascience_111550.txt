Which machine learning models allow online training and which don't?

I am working on a project where I have to update my model every time I get feedback x times. For example, showing an Advertisement on an App and then, when the person doesn't click on in it after seeing it multiple times in a day generates negative example. When they do that's positive. My initial dateset is not very big ( I have been searching for each model if it can be trained online or not and if yes, how. I am able to find answers but I am unable to understand the reason why some are fine with online training, some bad and why some don't allow it at all. I understand every model that uses gradient descent or modification of it (RMSProp, Adam etc.) can easily update weights seeing new data. But what about the rest? Is there a general rule?
