Can you use your MainWindow (UIWindow) as the container view as UIWindow inherence from UIView? Also iPhone 3.0 introduced the flip transaction via the presentModalViewController method: CustomViewController *vc = [[CustomViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@"CustomViewController" bundle:nil]; vc.delegate = self; // The magic statement. This will flip from right to left. // present the modal view controller then when you dismissModalViewController // it will transition flip from left to right. Simple and elegant. vc.modalTransitionStyle = UIModalTransitionStyleFlipHorizontal; [self presentModalViewController:vc animated:YES]; [vc release];
