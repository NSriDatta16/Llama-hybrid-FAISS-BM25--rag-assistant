What is the most efficient data structure to store time series of partially changing array?

My problem is I have an array of objects of size N. after every time (t+1), some of the values of the array may or may not change. so lets say t+1 index 15 changes but everything else stays the same. What is the most efficient way to store something like this (in memory ) apart from just having an array of arrays of course? I want to be able to get all the values of the array for any time, say getValues(long time) in the most efficient way possible. Say for 4 arrays time 1 null null null xyz time 2 null null abc xyz (note that only abc changed here) but we still keep the values of the last index from time 1.
