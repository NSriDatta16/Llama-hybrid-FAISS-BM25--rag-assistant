What do you call a weighted summary statisitc?

I want to present a summary statistic of 20+ simultaneous classes where each class has an AUC-statistic that I would like to describe in a single statistic, e.g.: | Class | Test cases | AUC | |-------|------------|------| | A | 34 | 0.81 | | A1 | 23 | 0.77 | | A2 | 2 | 0.98 | | B | 11 | 0.94 | |.... | Simply doing a mean over the AUC will risk that many of the top-performing small categories get too much influence over the average and therefore I would like to do a weighted mean: $$\overline{AUC_{weighted}}=\frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{categories}{AUC_i * n_i}}{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{categories}{n_{i}}}$$ Weighting the outcome measures based on the number of test cases in that group seems a nice way of presenting this type of statistics (the same approach could be used for Youden's J etc). It so nice that someone must have presented this before... My question : Is there a name for this type of a weighted mean based on the number of test cases that I can refer to?
