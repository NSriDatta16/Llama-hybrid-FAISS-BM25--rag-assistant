The default behaviour of HttpClient is compliant with the requirements of the HTTP specification (RFC 2616) 10.3.3 302 Found ... If the 302 status code is received in response to a request other than GET or HEAD, the user agent MUST NOT automatically redirect the request unless it can be confirmed by the user, since this might change the conditions under which the request was issued. You can override the default behaviour of HttpClient by sub-classing DefaultRedirectStrategy and overriding its #isRedirected() method.
