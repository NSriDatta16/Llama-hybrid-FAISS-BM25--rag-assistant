Do not rely on user agent or any kind of browser fingerprint, HTTP headers are easily forged/spoofed. You could add some secret token (eg. password/login) to the request and send it through SSL to prevent eavesdropping. Or better, use an SSL client certificate. Edit Are you going to distribute the VB program? If so, as bobince mentioned, there's no way you can prevent a determined hacker to forge requests. You can raise the bar but it will be security through obscurity . Even with client certs, the hacker will be able to extract the cert from your program and send modified requests. As long as you accept requests from the client, these requests can be forged. Deal with it.
