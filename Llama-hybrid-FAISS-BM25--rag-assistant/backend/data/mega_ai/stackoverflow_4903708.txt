What is the proper way to set my drawable directories to support the new Dell Streak without losing support for older devices?

This seems to be a widespread problem . I have the following drawable directories: drwxr-xr-x 18 mike staff 612 Feb 4 17:28 drawable/ drwxr-xr-x 51 mike staff 1734 Feb 4 17:32 drawable-nodpi/ drwxr-xr-x 44 mike staff 1496 Feb 4 17:30 drawable-normal-mdpi/ My xml drawable resources are in drawable. My resources intended for the large-mdpi (Dell Streak) and normal-hdpi (Droid, Nexus, Incredible, etc.) are all in drawable-nodpi. My resources for normal-mdpi (older phones like the G1) are in drawable-normal-mdpi. Unfortunately, the normal-hdpi phones like the Droid are pulling their resources from drawable-normal-mdpi instead of from drawable-nodpi. This is likely because of the rules in How Android Finds the Best-matching Resource . So the question is, how do I provide support for large-mdpi devices like the Streak along with normal-hdpi devices like the Droid, as well as normal-mdpi devices like the G1? The simplest solution would probably be to make two copies of my large resources, one in normal-hdpi for the droid and one in large-mdpi for the streak, but i'd like to avoid duplicating all of these resources. Update Per Mayra's suggestion, I could make an alias for every resource. However, there are a lot of resources I'd have to make aliases for, which would make maintenance a nightmare going forward, so I'm hoping for another solution.
