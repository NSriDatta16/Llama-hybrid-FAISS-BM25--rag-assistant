"Average" case for conditional probability?

I understand the basics of conditional probability. Intuitively it should be possible to calculate some form of average for a simple conditional probability series. In the following example: There is a bag with 10 marbles (1 red and 9 blue), on average how many blue marbles would one draw from the bag before a red one is drawn? 10% of the time it will be no marbles, because $\frac{1}{10}$ will be red. I think I can work out the probability of drawing $n$ blue balls: $P(\{n\ blue\}) = \frac{9}{10} \times \frac{9-1}{10-1} \times \cdots \times \frac{9-n}{10-n}$ Now I can work out any desired probability, say 50%: $$0.5 = P(\{n\ blue\}), \therefore n=5$$ Does this 50% equate to some typical case? Or how would I work out the typical case for this series? I wrote some python code to find the mean of 100'000 simulations of this, and got an answer of approximately 4.5. Which is not what I calculated.
