just in case you might be interested in some portability: yes(1) is nonstandard in that it's not described in the Single Unix Specification (POSIX by another name). but it's quite portable anyway (see the HISTORY paragraph; pity The MYYN didn't quote the whole thing): YES(1) FreeBSD General Commands Manual YES(1) NAME yes — be repetitively affirmative SYNOPSIS yes [expletive] DESCRIPTION The yes utility outputs expletive, or, by default, “y”, forever. HISTORY The yes command appeared in Version 32V AT&T UNIX. FreeBSD 9.0 June 6, 1993 FreeBSD 9.0 edit in case you hit an odd system that does not implement this command, it's trivial to provide it yourself. this from FreeBSD-9: int main(int argc, char **argv) { if (argc > 1) while (puts(argv[1]) != EOF) ; else while (puts("y") != EOF) ; err(1, "stdout"); /*NOTREACHED*/ }
