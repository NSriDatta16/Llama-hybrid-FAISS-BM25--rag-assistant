Whether to use EFA or PCA to assess dimensionality of a set of Likert items

This follows on from my previous question on assessing reliability . I designed a questionnaire (six 5-points Likert items) to evaluate the attitude of a group of users toward a product. I would like to estimate the reliability of the questionnaire for example computing Cronbach's alpha or lambda6. So, I need to check the dimensionality of my scale. I have seen that some people use PCA to find out the number of dimensions (e.g. the principal components), other people prefer to use EFA. Which is the most suitable approach? Further, if I find more than one principal component or more than one latent factor does this mean that I am measuring more than one construct or several aspects of the same construct?
