Chi square test of homogeneity for histogram comparison

I have two algorithms that simulate some process. The result of each algorithm run is a histogram of proportions of produced simulated entities, where each bin represents one type of objects. I need to compare the "average histograms" (per bin average proportions over multiple algorithm runs) for both algorithms in order to reason about their equivalence. I believe the chi square test of homogeneity is one possibility. However, while the counts/proportions across the two histograms are independent (one algorithm does not affect the other), the counts within groups are not (completely) independent. For instance, the entities being counted interact in a simulation so a higher count of one type of entity may result in a lower count of another type of entity. In short, the intra-group independence assumption does not hold. My question is whether the chi square test of homogeneity is still applicable in this case and, if not, what other test should I use to compare the histograms. Should I instead use some kind of multiple paired t-test (one test per bin), which would also account for the variance?
