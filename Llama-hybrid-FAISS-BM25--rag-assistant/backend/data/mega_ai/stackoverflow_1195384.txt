The only way I could think that this might be possible is if the output is printed via the RAISERROR command. In that case, you might be able to capture it elsewhere using TRY/CATCH. But that's just an idea: I've never done it. In fact, the only thing we do that's remotely close is that we have a command line tool to run stored procedures in batch jobs rather than using sql server agent to schedule them. This way all of our nightly jobs are scheduled in one place (the windows task scheduler) rather than two, and the command line tool captures the anything printed to the message window into a common logging system that we monitor. So some of procedures will output quite a lot of detail to that window.
