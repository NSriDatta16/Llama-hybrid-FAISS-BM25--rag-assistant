jQuery UI has a standard naming convention, you can view a full list of widgets/effects here . Comparing to that list you're looking for the corresponding methods mostly: .draggable() .droppable() .dialog() etc... However , and this is a big however, if your main goal is to reduce page payload size, this should have no effect . Your users shouldn't be downloading this every page load, it should be cached on the client as determined by cache headers , additionally your scripts should be minified (already provided version when you download it) and delivered gzipped . Also if it's an option, I'd consider using a CDN for both jQuery and jQuery UI , and the stylesheets as well , if you're using one of the default themes.
