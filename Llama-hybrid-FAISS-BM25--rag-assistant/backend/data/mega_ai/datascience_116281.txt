It is not possible to know what is the best model, method or library with so little information on the problem. The nature of anomalies, the performance targets, the computational requirements, the need for explainability, the amount of data available, et.c. are all undefined. But even with all these things, it may not be possible to know the optimal one up-front. Such is the nature of many data science problems, because they are task and data dependent, in hard to predict ways. So, start with the simplest thing that could possibly work, and move up from there!
