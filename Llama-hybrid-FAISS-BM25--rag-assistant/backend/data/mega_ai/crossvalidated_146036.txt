I think that the experimenters' decision fits into general resampling statistical strategy . Having said that, I'm not sure what specific aspects, if any, might be used to criticize this approach from the machine learning perspective . In regard to reducing noisy data , while I'm not sure how applicable it is in your subject domain, you might want to check my hopefully relevant answer . Moreover, I think that it might make sense to use clustering to detect and eliminate noisy data by applying bootstrapping technique. Please see my answer on using bootstrapping for clustering.
