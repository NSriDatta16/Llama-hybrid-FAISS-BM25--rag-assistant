It's exciting to think that one has seen a fatal flaw in some published work. But sometimes that vision of a "fatal flaw" is a mirage, arising from a misunderstanding of the question at hand, the nature of the study, or its interpretation. Sudden sensorineural hearing loss Sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) is an "unexplained, rapid loss of hearing—usually in one ear—either at once or over several days." Should this happen to you, get medical treatment immediately as "eighty-five percent of those who receive treatment from an otolaryngologist (sometimes called an ENT surgeon) will recover some of their hearing." Treatment typically involves steroids, best given as soon as possible after the hearing loss is noted. About 90% of cases are idiopathic; that is, the hearing loss has no identifiable cause. A viral infection can sometimes be identified as a cause. The SARS-Cov-2 virus that causes COVID-19 might be among such viruses . Alexander and Harris estimated the annual incidence of SSNHL in the US by examining medical and pharmaceutical claims information from more than 60 million patients: During 2006 and 2007, the annual incidence of SSNHL was 27 per 100,000 in the United States. The incidence increased with increasing age, ranging from 11 per 100,000 for patients younger than 18 years to 77 per 100,000 for patients 65 years and older. That range of 11 to 77 cases per 100,000 per year is shown in the Figure of the paper you cite by Formeister et al. COVID-19 vaccination and SSNHL As Formeister et al reported: Anecdotal reports are rapidly emerging from the otolaryngology community of SSNHL occurring after inoculation by SARS-CoV-2 vaccines that are currently in use in the US under US Food and Drug Administration Emergency Use Authorizations. The authors noted patients coming to their own practice to report SSNHL starting within 24 hours of COVID-19 vaccination. Their practice, a major referral center, tends to be over-represented with difficult problems like SSNHL. Together with the small numbers of SSNHL cases, preparing single-institution case reports on this matter would not have been very useful. The goals The critical clinical issue facing the authors was whether nationwide SSNHL incidence following COVID-19 vaccination might be greater than expected from the historical incidence of SSNHL, representing an unexpected side effect of vaccination. Their goals were to (1) estimate the national incidence of SSNHL after COVID-19 vaccination using data from the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) maintained by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and (2) compare this with the expected incidence of SSNHL in the wider population. VAERS is the repository for patients and clinicians to report suspected side effects from vaccination. The findings The authors found 127 unique reports of potential SSNHL reported to VAERS between December 14, 2020 and March 2, 2021, the first 3 months of widespread COVID-19 vaccination in the US. During that period, 86,553,330 vaccine doses were administered. With the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines then available, 2 doses were possible per individual. The total number of doses sets an upper limit on the number of people at risk for vaccine-related SSNHL; the lower limit (assuming 2 doses for all individuals) is half that: 43,276,665. The authors reported post-vaccine SSNHL incidence estimates between 0.3 (minimum) and 4.1 (maximum) cases per 100,000 per year, respectively. Even the maximum incidence estimate was well below the range of normal SSNHL incidence. Authors' conclusions the incidence of SSNHL occurring after COVID-19 vaccination does not exceed that of the general population, and may be lower. That provided one less thing to worry about in the midst of a pandemic that was taxing the medical profession nationwide and worldwide. The authors certainly did not claim that vaccination prevented SSNHL. There is no reason to put that claim into their mouths. Sources of the annualized estimates In their brief report (~700 words, about half the length of this answer), the authors were unfortunately vague about some details of the "sensitivity analysis" that led to those estimates. In particular, it's not clear (a) what's meant by "100% VAERS underreporting bias" in deriving the maximum incidence estimate or (b) the observation period used to calculate annualized incidence. In a situation like this, it can help to try to reverse-engineer the reported result to see what specific assumptions might have been made. Their minimum-incidence estimate of 0.3 per 100,000 per year, applied to the corresponding assumed population of 86,553,330, works out to 260 estimated cases per year in that population. I suspect that the estimate of 0.3 was rounded up from 0.277, which would work out to 240 cases per year in that population. That estimate was based on the 40 reports in VAERS that were most likely to have been associated with vaccination, assuming all cases were reported to VAERS (no reporting bias). Thus this annualized estimate is 6 times the corresponding numbers reported during the study period. Their maximum-incidence estimate of 4.1 per 100,000 per year, applied to the corresponding assumed population of 43,276,665, works out to 1774 estimated cases per year in that population. That estimate was based on all 147 unique cases of hearing loss reported to VAERS.* This annualized estimate is about 12 times the corresponding numbers reported during the study period. (a) Put those extreme estimates together in terms of the ratio of estimated cases per year to corresponding observed numbers: 6/1 for the minimum-incidence estimate, 12/1 for the maximum-incidence estimate. Then the authors evidently meant by "100% VAERS underreporting bias," in the maximum-incidence estimate, a situation with only 1/2 of SSNHL cases reported to VAERS. Then the VAERS-reported value of 147 used for the maximum-incidence estimate would have represented 294 "actual" cases--again, a ratio of annual incidence to "actual" numbers of 6/1. (b) So how do you get from an observed (or bias-corrected) number of cases to 6 times that many per year? To get the annualized rate you need to know the observation period. Reports would only be made to VAERS after a vaccination, so the numbers under observation for vaccine-associated SSNHL increased over the 3 months of data examined by the authors. The observation period is longer for those vaccinated in December 2020 than for those vaccinated in February 2021. It seems that the authors assumed 2 months for an average observation time, for annual numbers 6 times the observed (or bias-corrected) numbers. Sensitivity to assumptions There clearly are several assumptions at work here. For example, I might have chosen 1.5 months for the average observation period (one half of the 3 months of data collection, assuming that individuals were added linearly over time as they got their first vaccine doses). That would give a maximum-incidence estimate of 5.5 per 100,000 per year. Or if you prefer 3 weeks for an average observation period (which seems low), then 11 per 100,000 per year following vaccination as maximum incidence. Perhaps a more important assumption is that at least half of SSNHL cases in vaccinated individuals would be reported to VAERS as a reaction to vaccination. What if that's an overestimate? How much does that matter? For that, let's go back to the estimates of SSNHL incidence by age from Alexander and Harris. The population getting vaccinated during the time period in question was primarily the elderly (with already high incidence of SSNHL) and healthcare workers. Let's use the incidence for 55-64 year-olds in that study as a guide to what might be expected of that population pre-vaccination: 47 per 100,000 per year (their Fig. 1). That's 10 times the maximum-incidence post-vaccination estimate by Formeister et al. For COVID-19 vaccination to represent a higher than normal risk of SSNHL (the point of this study), they would need to have made an order-of-magnitude set of errors in their assumptions. Summary A question in early 2021 was whether COVID-19 vaccination was going to lead to a major increase in SSNHL incidence. This preliminary report was what one used to call a "back-of-the-envelope" calculation, a rough estimate to get a sense of the magnitude of a problem. It might be best to think of this as a first pass at a non-inferiority study, showing that SSNHL is certainly no more prevalent following vaccination than it is in the general population. That's the point of the paper. *The authors did not "limit the possible adverse side effect window to 3 weeks post-vaccination," as you claim. They used that time window, among other data, as a guide to selecting the cases with the greatest likelihood of SSNHL causally related to vaccination. Those 40 cases are a basis only for the "minimum-incidence" estimate, which is of only secondary importance in this type of study. The clinically critical "maximum-incidence" estimate, needed to see if vaccination might be accounting for the anecdotal reports of SSNHL following vaccination, took all 147 reports of hearing loss during the reporting period and doubled that number to account for reporting bias.
