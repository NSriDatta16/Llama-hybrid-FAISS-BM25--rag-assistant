IIRC, yylval is declared by Bison, but you have to supply the type. Without that, the compiler gets confused and can give misleading errors. You need to define YYSTYPE. In your case, you may get away with "#define YYSTYPE double". Do this in the grammar, in a %{ ... %} block near the top. %union is also available for declaring YYSTYPE as a union. This looks like the Bison manual standard rpcalc example, so I'll assume you can look up "YYSTYPE" and "%union" easily enough.
