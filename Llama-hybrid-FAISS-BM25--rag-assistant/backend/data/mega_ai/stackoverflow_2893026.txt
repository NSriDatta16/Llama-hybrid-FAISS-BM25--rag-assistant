With method 2, you'll be able to take advantage of browser caching. If appropriate, if the site has a "front door" entry page with nav etc. and no need of the widget library, you can pre-load the CSS and JS for the other pages after the landing page loads. If you run your JS through something like YUICompressor and then make sure the server gzips JS and CSS files, you're really not talking about that much stuff unless you're code is really flabby. If you leverage a library that's hosted at a reliable site like Google's API repository, then you can probably keep your own code smaller. (I don't know anything about Zend, so that may or may not be relevant.)
