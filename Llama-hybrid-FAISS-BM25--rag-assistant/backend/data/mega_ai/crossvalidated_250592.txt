Text paragraphs generation

My goal is to generate a whole article. I have ~70 example articles and I was able to generate good-looking and plausible sentences with Markov chains. However, I don't know how to generate paragraphs now. I thought about topic modeling (LDA), but it does not work well with hundreds of random sentences. Are there better techniques/models that I can use? Producing a coherent paragraph would be a great result already, I don't need a whole text right away.
