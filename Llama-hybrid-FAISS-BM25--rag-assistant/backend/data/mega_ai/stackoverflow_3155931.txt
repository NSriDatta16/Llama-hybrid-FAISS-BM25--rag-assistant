MVC add child to parent

assuming I have a Child and Parent object each of which has a repository and a controller. Update: A Parent has many Child objects. the parent's controller for creating would look something like. the post to create will be made using the auto-generated form. public ActionResult Create() { return View(); } [AcceptVerbs(HttpVerbs.Post)] public ActionResult Create(Parent parent) { var parentRepo = new ParentRepository(); parentRepo.Save(parent); return View(); } how would I go creating a child after I have created the parent? 1) one solution would be using a url like child/create/{idParent} 2) or even embedding the parent id in the child creating form so it is posted with the rest of the child data. Both seem not in the spirit of MVC.
