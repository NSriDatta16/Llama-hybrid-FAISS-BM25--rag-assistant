To show the fragmentation state of a filesystem, you would have to find out which blocks of the disk belong to which files. All files that do not solely consist of consecutive blocks are fragmented; they contain holes and/or the blocks are scattered over the disk. To defragment a filesystem you would have to move around the blocks so that all files are consecutive and rewrite the metadata to have the filesystem in a consistent state in the end.
