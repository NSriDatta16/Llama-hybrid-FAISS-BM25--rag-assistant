Java many to many association map

I have two classes, ClassA and ClassB , as well as a "many to many" AssociationClass . I want a structure that holds the associations between A and B so that I can find the counterpart for each instance of A or B. I thought of using a Hashmap, with pair keys: Hasmap , AssociationClass> associations; This way, I can add and remove an association between two instances of ClassA and ClassB , and I can query a relation for two given instances. However, I miss the feature of getting all associations defined for a given instance of ClassA or ClassB . I could do it by brute force and loop over all keys of the map to search for associations between a given instance, but this is inefficient and not elegant. Do you know of any data structure / free library that enables this? I don't want to reinvent the wheel. NB : This is not a "database" question. These objects are pure POJO used for live computation, I don't need persistence stuff.
