One obvious error is that you're expecting to return the first case where your conditions match (hence the first Index variable name), but you're really returning the last point where they match. This is also bad because it means you keep looking after finding your match. Another is that if the very first word in a sentence is "Second", you'll try to reference a negative index, which is very bad. Try this instead: int returnDateIndex(Paragraph para) { for (int i = 1; i This code fixes both errors, and also completely side-steps your assignment problem.
