Sortable clone helper not working

Maybe I don't understand how clone works with sortable, but here is what I would like to do. When sorting an item I would like a clone of the item I am dragging remain until I stop drop the item in its new position. Here's the code: .sort { width: 150px; } .ui-state-highlight { background-color: #000; height:2px; } Item 1 Item 2 Item 3 Item 4 $(function() { $('.sort').sortable({ helper: 'clone', placeholder: 'ui-state-highlight', opacity: '.5' }) }) Thanks in advance for the help!
