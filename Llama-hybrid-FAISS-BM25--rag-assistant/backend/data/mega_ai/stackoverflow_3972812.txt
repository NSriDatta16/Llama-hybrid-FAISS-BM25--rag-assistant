Are there any active reinforcement learning competitions?

I like doing part-time research in reinforcement learning. In recent years (up to 2009) there was a reinforcement learning competition held at rl-competition.org with some very interesting problems, but this seems to have been discontinued. I'd love to improve my skills and knowledge and measure it against other enthusiasts in the field - are there still any such competitions around?
