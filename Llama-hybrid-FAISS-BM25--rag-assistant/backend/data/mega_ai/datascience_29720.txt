Supervised learning for variable length feature-less data

I have data in following form: a: 1,2,3,2,3 a: 2,4,5,6,7,8,0,9,7,6,5,6,2 a: 7,8,9,3,4 b: 4,5,3,5,6,3,5,1,2 b: 1,6,3,2,4,5 b: 2,4,5,6,7,8,0,9,7,6,5,6,2 c: 7,8,9,3,4 c: 4,5,3,5,6,3,5,1,2 ... (in reality, each case has about 100-200 numbers, though the length is variable) Here, a, b and c are groups (their number is fixed - taken as 3 here) and the numbers indicate a vector associated with each case. How can I apply supervised machine learning with such a data so that if I get a new series of numbers, e.g. following: 3,2,3,4,1,5,6 I should be able to determine which group (a, b or c) does this case belongs to. Following features of each list of numbers may be important: length of series mean value of series variance of series maximum of series minimum of series type of distribution of series (normal or non-normal) How can I apply machine learning methods to such data. Thanks for your insight.
