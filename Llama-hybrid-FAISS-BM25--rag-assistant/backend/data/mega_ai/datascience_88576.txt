Machine Learning Method For Creating Chemical Formula

We work at chemical company . We have nearly 3000 chemical formulas which is composed with chemical raw materials. Our chemical formulas is composed of 20-25 raw materials. As you guess, amount of these raw materials are very important for our formulas. As a result we obtain different products via using different raw materials and different amount of raw materials. Here is some examples: Sample Formula 1: %10 Raw material A %25 Raw material B %5 Raw material C %60 Raw material D Result product has such properties : Property X: 3 Property Y: 10 Property Z: 2 What kind of machine learning method or methods should we use? I have looked for CNN but as you see there are many input and output properties as parameters. Our goal is training a network via using our exist formulas then we will want that our network will create new formulas according to input parameters which we will give.
