Another thing that should get run first is in an App Delegate (Defined like so: NSObject and setup in the nib) the method applicationDidFinishLaunching This is obviously not technically the first thing to be run. The main loop and whatever is in UIApplication will be executed first, but in general this is good starting point for iOS applications and the first place you really have control. You can also create a class called like "Controller" and drag an NSObject into your nib and set the class to Controller. Then the method awakeFromNib will be called. Either of these should be fine to set up your app.
