Since endstuff() is returned every single time, you do not have to short circuit the return call. The function is going to return endstuff() no matter what happens, why place that code in every check? Unless you don't want to do doStuff4() if there are errors. The more elegant way would probably be to perform endstuff() in the finally block and assign that value to a variable, and then return that variable at the end.
