Chart is not rendering with Jqplot - Any ideas?

Does anyone have any idea why my chart is not being rendered with Jqplot? I have followed all the instructions, yet it is just blank. I am tearing my hair out here as I have done this successfully with another website, yest cannot seem to do it with this one....Maybe ive just missed something really really simple. http://healthinteractive.co.uk/assess/node/1/done?sid=5 EDIT This is the link the the same page but on a different website that I have done successfully in case anyone can see glaring differences between the two. http://www.beatinganger.com/node/353/done?sid=781
