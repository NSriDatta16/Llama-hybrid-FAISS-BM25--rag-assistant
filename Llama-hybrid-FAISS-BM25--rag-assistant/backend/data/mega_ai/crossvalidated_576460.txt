Average VIF after dummy variables

I have classified (label encoding) independent variables. To calculate VIF, I converted them to dummy variables. When I calculate VIF for dummy variables, there are VIF values for each class of an independent variable. If I calculate the average of VIF values of all classes of an independent variable, can I say it is the VIF value of that independent variable?
