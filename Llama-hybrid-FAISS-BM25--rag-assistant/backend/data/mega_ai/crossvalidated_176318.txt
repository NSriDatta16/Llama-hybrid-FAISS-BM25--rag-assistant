The prior answers regarding sample size are good ones. I want to address the issue of using n-th select to choose your sample. In a famous example from the 50s Paul Lazarsfeld, the great Columbia sociologist, did a huge study of The American Soldier where he selected every 10th name from a list provided by the Army. Using this criteria, what he got back was a sample of non-commissioned officers (NCOs) since the basic unit in the Army was the platoon containing 9 men plus an NCO as the 10th. Luckily, Lazarsfeld discovered the error before the study was done and was able to correct it in time. The point is that in using n-th select, unless your list of diplomats is randomized, any structure, organization, sorted order, etc., of any kind that exists in the original list will result in a nonrandom sample.
