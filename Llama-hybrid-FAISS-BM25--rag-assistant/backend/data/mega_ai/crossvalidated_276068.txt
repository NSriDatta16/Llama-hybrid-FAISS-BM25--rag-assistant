The logloss is simply $L(p_i)=-\log(p_i)$ where $p$ is simply the probability attributed to the real class. So $L(p)=0$ is good, we attributed the probability $1$ to the right class, while $L(p)=+\infty$ is bad, because we attributed the probability $0$ to the actual class. So, answering your question, $L(p)=0.5$ means, on average, you attributed to the right class the probability $p\approx0.61$ across samples. Now, deciding if this is good enough is actually application-dependent, and so it's up to the argument.
