How to improve the accuracy of a neural network model?

I am attempting to create a neural network model using R that estimates the sine function for a given x variable, i.e. sin(x) . Dataset has 5000 observations with x iterating by 0.05 each time: However, when I estimate using the model, my error is quite high at 219.2 and my prediction remains fairly constant at a value of 0.48 or thereabouts, while the actual value deviates sharply between 0 and 1: The steps I am taking to estimate the model are as follows: 1) I am scaling my sin and x variables using max-min normalization: sinscaled=(sin-min(sin))/(max(sin)-min(sin)) xscaled=(x-min(x))/(max(x)-min(x)) 2) I am then fitting my training and test data: trainset 3) The neural network is fitted as below, and the resulting output tested: #Neural Network library(neuralnet) sinscalednet Note that while I am using 2 hidden layers in this instance, the error is remaining consistent even when the number of hidden layers are being manipulated: 4) Resulting output is tested and accuracy obtained: #Test the resulting output temp_test Would be grateful for any advice on steps I need to take to improve this model. I am experimenting by trying to modify the hidden layers, but the error is remaining consistently high.
