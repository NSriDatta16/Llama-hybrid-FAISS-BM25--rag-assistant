Bayesian Optimization: How do we compute the maximum increase in information for the next step

If I understand correctly, Bayesian Optimization works by having a prior and choosing the next step by finding the direction that will maximize the mutual information between the prior and posterior. How do we normally compute that maximum on real data? Do we use derivatives?
