OCaml: How does List.fold_left work?

I'm trying to find the average of a list of floats. let avg l = List.fold_left ( +. ) 0 l /. List.length l;; How does List.fold_left work? (Applies the first argument to a list (the third arg)... but then what is the second argument?) Toplevel returns this error: Characters 43-44: List.fold_left ( +. ) 0 l /. List.length l;; ^ Error: This expression has type int but is here used with type float What is the preferred way to iterate through a list in OCaml?
