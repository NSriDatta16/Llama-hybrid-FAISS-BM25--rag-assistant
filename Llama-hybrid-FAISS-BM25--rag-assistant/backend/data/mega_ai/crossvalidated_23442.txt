There is a somewhat recent paper on this topic: R. P. Adams, H. Wallach, and Zoubin Ghahramani. Learning the structure of deep sparse graphical models. This is a bit outside the usual neural network community and more on the machine learning side. The paper uses non-parametric Bayesian inference on the network structure.
