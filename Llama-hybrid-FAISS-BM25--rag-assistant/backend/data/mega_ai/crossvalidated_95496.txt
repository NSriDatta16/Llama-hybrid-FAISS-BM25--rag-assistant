What effect does data averaging have on the variogram?

What effect does data averaging have on the variogram? To be specific, please see a simple example: #Simulate a pure random walk data set, call this *PROCESS A* n Theoretically $\gamma(h) = \frac{1}{2} Var(y(t) - y(t+h))$ and for a linear variogram of a simple process without the nugget effect this is $\frac{1}{2}\sigma^2 |h|$ where $\sigma^2$ is the variance of the underlying process. Thus, we expect (1) the two variogram are parallel and (2) the proportion of the nugget effect of PROCESS A to PROCESS B is 4/3. Compare the plots and the Math: (1) is confirmed, but (2) is not. Why? Is this a simple example of the 'change of support' problem in geostatistics?? Thanking you in advance.
