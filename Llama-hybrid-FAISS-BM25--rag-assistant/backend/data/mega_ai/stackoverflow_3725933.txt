Define custom User-agent header in the HTTP request?

I would like to get a glimpse of web-sites created for iPhone devices. In order to be able to view those sites I have to modify the User-agent header in the HTTP request that my browser sends. That way I can trick the web-server into believing that my browser is an iPhone browser, and then the web-server would send my the iPhone version of the web-site. So, how can I modify the User-agent header that my browser sends in each HTTP request. Maybe there is an Firefox plug-in that allows modifying request headers? Also, I think I heard that Safari allows that somehow....
