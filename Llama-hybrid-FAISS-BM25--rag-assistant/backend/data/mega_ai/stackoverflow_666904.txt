A simple XPath 1.0 one-liner : concat(., substring(',', 2 - (position() != last()))) Put it into this transformation: and apply it to the XML document : apple orange banana to get the wanted result: apple,orange,banana EDIT: Here is a comment from Robert Rossney to this answer: That's pretty opaque code for a human to read. It requires you to know two non-obvious things about XSLT: 1) what the substring function does if its index is out of range and 2) that logical values can be implicitly converted to numerical ones. and here is my answer : Guys, never shy from learning something new. In fact this is all Stack Overflow is about, isn't it? :)
