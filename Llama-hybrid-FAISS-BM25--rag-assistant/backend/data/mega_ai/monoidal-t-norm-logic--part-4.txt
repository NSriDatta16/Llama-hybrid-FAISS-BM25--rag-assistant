f precedence: Unary connectives (bind most closely) Binary connectives other than implication and equivalence Implication and equivalence (bind most loosely) Axioms A Hilbert-style deduction system for MTL has been introduced by Esteva and Godo (2001). Its single derivation rule is modus ponens: from A {\displaystyle A} and A → B {\displaystyle A\rightarrow B} derive B . {\displaystyle B.} The following are its axiom schemata: ( M T L 1 ) : ( A → B ) → ( ( B → C ) → ( A → C ) ) ( M T L 2 ) : A ⊗ B → A ( M T L 3 ) : A ⊗ B → B ⊗ A ( M T L 4 a ) : A ∧ B → A ( M T L 4 b ) : A ∧ B → B ∧ A ( M T L 4 c ) : A ⊗ ( A → B ) → A ∧ B ( M T L 5 a ) : ( A → ( B → C ) ) → ( A ⊗ B → C ) ( M T L 5 b ) : ( A ⊗ B → C ) → ( A → ( B → C ) ) ( M T L 6 ) : ( ( A → B ) → C ) → ( ( ( B → A ) → C ) → C ) ( M T L 7 ) : ⊥ → A {\displaystyle {\begin{array}{ll}{\rm {(MTL1)}}\colon &(A\rightarrow B)\rightarrow ((B\rightarrow C)\rightarrow (A\rightarrow C))\\{\rm {(MTL2)}}\colon &A\otimes B\rightarrow A\\{\rm {(MTL3)}}\colon &A\otimes B\rightarrow B\otimes A\\{\rm {(MTL4a)}}\colon &A\wedge B\rightarrow A\\{\rm {(MTL4b)}}\colon &A\wedge B\rightarrow B\wedge A\\{\rm {(MTL4c)}}\colon &A\otimes (A\rightarrow B)\rightarrow A\wedge B\\{\rm {(MTL5a)}}\colon &(A\rightarrow (B\rightarrow C))\rightarrow (A\otimes B\rightarrow C)\\{\rm {(MTL5b)}}\colon &(A\otimes B\rightarrow C)\rightarrow (A\rightarrow (B\rightarrow C))\\{\rm {(MTL6)}}\colon &((A\rightarrow B)\rightarrow C)\rightarrow (((B\rightarrow A)\rightarrow C)\rightarrow C)\\{\rm {(MTL7)}}\colon &\bot \rightarrow A\end{array}}} The traditional numbering of axioms, given in the left column, is derived from the numbering of axioms of Hájek's basic fuzzy logic BL. The axioms (MTL4a)–(MTL4c) replace the axiom of divisibility (BL4) of BL. The axioms (MTL5a) and (MTL5b) express the law of residuation and the axiom (MTL6) corresponds to the condition of prelinearity. The axioms (MTL2) and (MTL3) of the original axiomatic system were shown to be redundant (Chvalovský, 2012) and (Cintula, 2005). All the other axioms were shown to be independent (Chvalovský, 2012). Semantics Like in other propositional t-norm fuzzy logics, algebraic semantics is predominantly used for MTL, with three main classes of algebras with respect to which the logic is complete: General semantics, formed of all MTL-algebras — that is, all algebras for which the logic is sound Linear semantics, formed of all linear MTL-algebras — that is, all MTL-algebras whose lattice order is linear Standard semantics, formed of all standard MTL-algebras — that is, all MTL-algebras whose lattice reduct is the real unit interval [0, 1] with the usual order; they are uniquely determined by the function that interprets strong conjunction, which can be any left-continuous t-norm General semantics MTL-algebras Algebras for which the logic MTL is sound are called MTL-algebras. They can be characterized as prelinear commutative bounded integral residuated lattices. In more detail, an algebraic structure ( L , ∧ , ∨ , ∗ , ⇒ , 0 , 1 ) {\displaystyle (L,\wedge ,\vee ,\ast ,\Rightarrow ,0,1)} is an MTL-algebra if ( L , ∧ , ∨ , 0 , 1 ) {\displaystyle (L,\wedge ,\vee ,0,1)} is a bounded lattice with the top element 0 and bottom element 1 ( L , ∗ , 1 ) {\displaystyle (L,\ast ,1)} is a commutative monoid ∗ {\displaystyle \ast } and ⇒ {\displaystyle \Rightarrow } form an adjoint pair, that is, z ∗ x ≤ y {\displaystyle z*x\leq y} if and only if z ≤ x ⇒ y , {\displaystyle z\leq x\Rightarrow y,} where ≤ {\displaystyle \leq } is the lattice order of ( L , ∧ , ∨ ) , {\displaystyle (L,\wedge ,\vee ),} for all x, y, and z in L {\displaystyle L} , (the residuation condition) ( x ⇒ y ) ∨ ( y ⇒ x ) = 1 {\displaystyle (x\Rightarrow y)\vee (y\Rightarrow x)=1} holds for all x and y in L (the prelinearity condition) Important examples of MTL algebras are standard MTL-algebras on the real unit interval [0, 1]. Further examples include all Boolean algebras, all linear Heyting algebras (both with
