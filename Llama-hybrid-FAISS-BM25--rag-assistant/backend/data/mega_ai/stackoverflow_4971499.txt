That exact code, with just the ellipsis removed, is not valid C++. You can't use the static storage class specifier in an enum declaration; it doesn't make any sense there (only objects, functions, and anonymous unions can be declared static ). You can, however, declare an enum and a variable all in one declaration: static enum Response { NO_ERROR = 0, MISSING_DESCRIPTOR } x; The static here applies to x and it is effectively the same as if you said: enum Response { NO_ERROR = 0, MISSING_DESCRIPTOR }; static Response x;
