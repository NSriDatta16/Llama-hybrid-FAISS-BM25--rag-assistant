jQuery UI Datepicker Slow During Typing

I've heard all these great experiences of how great and elegant jQuery is, but I'm 0 for 2 trying to implement jQuery controls in real world projects due to poor performance. I am running into a similar problem as Richard this time. The jQuery UI DatePicker failed User Acceptance Testing in an ASP.NET application I'm working on because while typing in the textbox, there is some lag specifically when entering in the last two numbers. (e.g. '1/1/20 10 '). Does anyone know of an option/approach that would stop jQuery UI from interfering with the user's typing in the textbox that it's tied to?
