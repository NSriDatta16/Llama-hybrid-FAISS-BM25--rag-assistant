What patterns do you want to capture? High and low activity hours? Operators' efficiency in solving issues? In all cases, you can apply time-series algorithms like LSTM to predict values. https://www.kaggle.com/code/amirrezaeian/time-series-data-analysis-using-lstm-tutorial https://pub.towardsai.net/google-stock-predictions-using-an-lstm-neural-network-dbe785949a96 But, it might be interesting to use data viz together with machine learning to have many interesting views + easy filtering of any feature. https://demos.qlik.com/qliksense/HelpdeskManagement?function=IT https://data-science-at-swast-handover-poc-handover-yfa2kz.streamlitapp.com/
