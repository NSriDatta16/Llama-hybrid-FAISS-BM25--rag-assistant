If you assume the underlying time series $x_t$ is not autocorrelated (which is a reasonable assumption for daily financial returns), then $$ \text{Var}( x_{t+1} + \dotsc + x_{t+K} ) = \text{Var}(x_{t+1}) + \dotsc + \text{Var}(x_{t+K}) $$ and you can substitute forecasts for the theoretical quantities: $$ \widehat{\text{Var}}( x_{t+1} + \dotsc + x_{t+K} ) = \widehat{\text{Var}}(x_{t+1}) + \dotsc + \widehat{\text{Var}}(x_{t+K}). $$ You have your daily foreasts $\widehat{\text{Var}}(x_{t+1}), \dotsc, \widehat{\text{Var}}(x_{t+K})$ with $K$ around 22 for working days or 30 for calender days; this allows you to obtain the monthly forecast $\widehat{\text{Var}}( x_{t+1} + \dotsc + x_{t+K} )$. Meanwhile, in presence of autocorrelation you would have $$ \text{Var}( x_{t+1} + \dotsc + x_{t+K} ) = \text{Var}(x_{t+1}) + \dotsc + \text{Var}(x_{t+K}) + \sum_{i=1}^K \sum_{j=1}^K \text{Cov}(x_{t+i},x_{t+j}) $$ and a corresponding expression for forecasts in places of theoretical quantities.
