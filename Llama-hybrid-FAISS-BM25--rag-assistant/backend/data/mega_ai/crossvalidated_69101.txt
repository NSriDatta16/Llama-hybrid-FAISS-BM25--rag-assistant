Concerns related to neural network matlab toolbox

I have some concerns related to the use of nntool in MATLAB toolbox. Following links like this , I have found that nntool by default normalizes the inputs to the range [-1 1] . So I am a bit concerned, I created a neural network with tansig activation in the first layer and logsig activation in the output layer. I manually normalized the outputs to the range of [0 1] in the data and fed it to nntool . Now my question is does nntool further normalizes it to the range [-1 1] . If it does then it is not correct, the output of logsig cannot be in the range of [-1 1] . I am using the newfit function like this load house_dataset; net = newfit(houseInputs,houseTargets,20); Any suggestions?
