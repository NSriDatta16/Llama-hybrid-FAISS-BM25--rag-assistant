Object creation in C# question

I'm going over some c# tutorial that states the following: "After it finds the attribute class, the compiler will check whether the attribute is allowed on a class. Then it will check for a constructor that matches the parameters specified in the attribute use. If it finds one, it creates an instance of the object by calling the constructor with the specified values" The name of this paragraph is "compilation process", and it refers to the way the compiler handles attributes. I'm sorry for the ignorance, but shouldn't instances be created at run time? Thanks.
