What is "$(SourceDir)" in Microsoft Team Foundation Server?

I'm working with Microsoft Team Foundation Server and MSDN has been fantastic so far with providing all the information I've needed and so much more--except in one spot. I'm creating an automated build and under Workspace > Working Folders > Build Agent Folder, it has "$(SourceDir)" as default. I can't seem to figure out what that is actually referencing. Is it pointing toward the folder that the solution is in, or something else?
