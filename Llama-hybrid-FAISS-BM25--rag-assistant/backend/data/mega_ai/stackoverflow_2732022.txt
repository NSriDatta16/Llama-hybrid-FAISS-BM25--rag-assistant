Things goes like this: I've read a lot about the Paypal Standard integrate with Magento... the problem here is that I can't get the paypal standard button to show up when check out or in the Payment method form. I tried to disable everything and enable everything but the paypal payment didn't show up any thing. Even on the payment method page when check out... I'm running 1.4.0.1, Please helpme resolve this problem Thank you
