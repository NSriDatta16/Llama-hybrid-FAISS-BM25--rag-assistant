What are some algorithms that are immune to class imbalance, and what makes them so?

This question is closely similar, however, the answer only speaks about Logistic Regression being one example. I am interested in knowing if there are more algorithms that are not affected (at least lesser affected than other algorithms) by datasets that have class imbalance.
