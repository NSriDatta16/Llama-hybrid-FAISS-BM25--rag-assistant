loading the same page with a different Fragment ID does not cause page to reload?

Basically, I have a number of links on the page - index.html, they look something like this: test 0 test 1 test 2 test 3 I attached a function in window.onload event that will open up an alert box containing the fragment ID, so if I click on the first link, I should get an alert box with "0", etc. However, I only get an alert box when I access index.html from the URL bar and press enter. When I click on the links, no alert box showed up. I think it's because the window.onload event doesn't get called... Does anyone know how to solve this problem?
