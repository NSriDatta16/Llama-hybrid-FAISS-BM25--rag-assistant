Latent output of variational autoencoder

I know this question is quite weird. How can you control, for example, the output of latent space is indeed mean and log sigma? Is it because it's user defined quantity ? And how the latent space is ordered as mean and log standard deviation, not ordered as log standard deviation and mean?
