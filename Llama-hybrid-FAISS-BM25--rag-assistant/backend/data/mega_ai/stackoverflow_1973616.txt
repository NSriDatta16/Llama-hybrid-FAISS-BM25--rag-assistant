I contacted Microsoft Professional for this issue and found out that Microsoft now discourages embedding office applications. I was suggested to either stop embedding Excel into the application OR use only Excel 2007 that has a Ribbon UI. According to MS, the Ribbon UI does not have these issues. The problem with the CommandBars is that the negotiation only happens during the OnConnection and no changes can be made afterwards.
