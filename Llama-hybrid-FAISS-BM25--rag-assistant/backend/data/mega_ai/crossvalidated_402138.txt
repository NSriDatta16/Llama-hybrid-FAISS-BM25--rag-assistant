Why is my p-value correlated to difference between means in two sample tests?

A colleague has recently made the claim that a large p-value was not more support for the null hypothesis than a low one. Of course, this is also what I learned (uniform distribution under the null hypothesis, we can only reject the null hypothesis...). But when I simulate two random normal distributions (100 samples in each group) in R, my p-value is correlated to the difference (averaged over 30 repetitions) between the two means (with for example a T test or a Mann & Whitney test). Why is my p-value, above the threshold of 0.05, correlated to the difference between the means of my two groups? With 1000 repetitions for each x (difference between means/2) value. My R code in case this is just a silly mistake. pvaluetot
