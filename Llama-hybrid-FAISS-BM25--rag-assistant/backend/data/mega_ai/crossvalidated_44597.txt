So, first you need to find out that kind of data you have as input for your machine learning model and what kind of output you would like to get. If you are talking about "past years", you are most likely mean the time series , e.g. (multi-)variable data distributed over time. In the linked Wikipedia-article you already find enough information to start with your task. Just to mention some possible approaches here: If your process is stochastic , then you better stick to stochastic simulations or try regression analysis if you think you can derive a model for it. Approximation with an approriate domain function could provide results with predictive force, especially if your domain is specifica and well constrained. And generally it might be advisable to take some advanced course in statistics where such kind of "predictions" are often covered.
