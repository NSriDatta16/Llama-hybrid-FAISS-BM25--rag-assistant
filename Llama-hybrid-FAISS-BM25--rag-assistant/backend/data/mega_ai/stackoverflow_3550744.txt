This is usually done via CSS. You have the entire menu pre-created (note that nesting within is invalid HTML): menu1 sub1 sub2 and then you declare in CSS: ul.submenu { display: none; } Now you can remove or add the "submenu" CSS class from the through JavaScript, or you set the .style.display property. Or even more elegantly (but less cross-browser compatible, if you still care for old browsers), entirely without JavaScript through pure CSS: ul.menu > li:hover ul.submenu { display: block; } ul.submenu:hover { display: block; }
