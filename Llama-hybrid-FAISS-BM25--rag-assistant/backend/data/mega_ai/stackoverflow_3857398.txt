Converting various Seqs to CSV?

We have a number of Scala classes returning Map[String,String] (key,value) results for storage in a NoSQL database. Some of the results are actually Map[String, List] or Map[String, ArrayBuffer], so we are using .toString on those objects to convert. This gives us output that looks like: "ArrayBuffer(1,2,3,4)" or "List(1,2,4)" Rather than include the object type, we'd like to have these written out as straight CSV, quotes and escaped characters as necessary. Is there a good CSV library that works well with Scala?
