i would think the correct way to move an item in mootools is this: $("newparent").adopt($("movingThis")); otherwise, any events etc may not work. you can also use cloneEvents() if you have to save/reapply them, but should not have to. also, this is the only way that is guaranteed to keep all relations between the element and other javascript, as well as retain any element storage you may have had. regards, coda
