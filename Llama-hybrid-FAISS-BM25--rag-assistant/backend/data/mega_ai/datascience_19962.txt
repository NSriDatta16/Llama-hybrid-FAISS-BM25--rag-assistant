Explanation straight from Hinton's course on Neural Networks for Machine Learning .... " Dimension hopping occurs when one can take the information contained in the dimensions of some input, and move this between dimensions while not changing the target . The canonical example is taking an image of a handwritten digit and translating it within the image. The dimensions that contain "ink" are now different (they have been moved to other dimensions), however the label we assign to the digit has not changed. Note that this is not something that happens consistently across the dataset, that is we may have a dataset containing two handwritten digits where one is a translated version of the other, however this still does not change the corresponding label of the digits."
