C++ #include semantics

This is a multiple question for the same pre-processing instruction. 1 - <> or "" ? Apart from the info found in the MSDN: #include Directive (C-C++) 1.a: What are the differences between the two notations? 1.b: Do all compilers implement them the same way? 1.c: When would you use the <>, and when would you use the "" (i.e. what are the criteria you would use to use one or the other for a header include)? 2 - #include {TheProject/TheHeader.hpp} or {TheHeader.hpp} ? I've seen at least two ways of writing includes of one's project headers. Considering that you have at least 4 types of headers, that is: private headers of your project? headers of your project, but which are exporting symbols (and thus, "public") headers of another project your module links with headers of a compiler or standard library For each kind of headers: 2.a: Would you use <> or "" ? 2.b: Would you include with {TheProject/TheHeader.hpp}, or with {TheHeader.hpp} only? 3 - Bonus 3.a: Do you work on project with sources and/or headers within a tree-like organisation (i.e., directories inside directories, as opposed to "every file in one directory") and what are the pros/cons?
