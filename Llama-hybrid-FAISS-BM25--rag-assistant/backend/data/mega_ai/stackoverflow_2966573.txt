Debugging Actionmailer

I have actionmailer set up. Emails are not being sent, and no errors. Where can I start my search to debug this? class Notifier user.first_name + ' ' + user.last_name, :message => message end I do get a return in my log that the email was sent, just no actual email goes through. Also the reason, that this is not working is because I switched form a cluster to a solo box and some server settings were overwritten. I suspect that is probably the reason why this is not working. Anyone know what specific server settings I would have to look at ? UPDATE: ActionMailer::Base.delivery_method = :sendmail config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { :host => "75.101.153.93" } I found this in my production.rb . This code was originally here when it worked. Again, I believe that there must be something missing on my server..I did a 'which sendmail' and it returned /usr/bin/sendmail , so I added this : config.action_mailer.raise_delivery_errors = false config.action_mailer.perform_deliveries = true config.action_mailer.sendmail_settings = { :location => '/usr/bin/sendmail', :arguments => '-i -t' } Redeployed, restarted the server, and tested it. No emails were sent. The production.log said something was sent : Processing MediaController#create_a_video (for 173.161.167.41 at 2010-06-03 11:58:13) [GET] Parameters: {"action"=>"create_a_video", "controller"=>"media", "organization_id"=>"470", "_"=>"1275591493194"} Sent mail to info@hqchannel.com Rendering media/create_a_video Completed in 128ms (View: 51, DB: 1) | 200 OK [http://invent.hqchannel.com/organizations/470/media/create_a_video?_=1275591493194]
