Is it possible to combine covariates in a regression model?

I'm not a statistician, so my question might have a trivial answer. Let's say I want to calculate a logistic regression model, with 4-5 covariates. If I understand correctly, inclusion of covariates decrease the power of the model / require larger sample size. So I thought that a possible solution would be to combine all covariates to one variable, for example to calculate a Z score for each variable, and then calculate a variable that is the distance of each combined variable (i.e. sqrt(x1^2 + x2^2 + ...) ). Of course then I will lose any information regarding the influence of each covariate to the model, but let's say I'm not interested in this information ... Is it correct to use such method? Has it been previously used?
