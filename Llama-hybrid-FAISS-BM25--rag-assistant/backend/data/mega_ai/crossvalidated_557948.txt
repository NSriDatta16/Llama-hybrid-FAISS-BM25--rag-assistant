Is non-invertibility a problem for (AR)MA processes?

I'm reading Time Series Analysis: Forecasting and Control (3rd ed.) by Box, Jenkins and Reinsel. There are some arguments about invertibility that I can't wrap my head around. Considering a MA(1) model: Here it says: "the current deviation $z_t$ in (3.1.4) depends on $z_{t-1}$ , $z_{t-2}$ ,..., $z_{t-k}$ with weights that increase as $k$ increases." This seems in contrast with this answer which I agree with, it doesn't feel correct to state that $z_t$ depends more and more on past values, since there is actually statistical independence for lags greater that 1. The problem is that in (3.1.4) there are a lot of terms that cancel out (actual math in the cited answer). (1) I am missing something, why would the above statement be true? Moreover: Assuming the process is Gaussian, I get that invertibility assures the model is identifiable, but I don't understand why would it make a difference in how we associate past happenings with present. For almost each invertible Gaussian process there is a non-invertible one that defines the same distribution , so I would argue that the two processes associate the past with the present in the same manner , (2) where am I wrong? If we don't assume Gaussian distribution, (3) then why would we exclude the possibility of a process being non-invertible, effectively excluding some distributions that could be closer (and maybe predict better) the real process underlying the phenomenon being studied? Again, in chapter 6, about model identification: And Earlier it is stated: “ Identification methods are rough procedures applied to a set of data to indicate the kind of representational model worthy of further investigation. The specific aim here is to obtain some idea of the values of d, p, q ... and to obtain initial estimates for the parameters ”. So, to assure the identification procedure can logically be used to uniquely identify a model (why couldn’t more than one model be “identified” for further investigation?), they exclude non invertibile models, apparently making them “ not worthy of further investigation ”. To me this makes sense only if we assume normality. They seem to point that “expressing the current value $w_t$ exclusively in terms of previous history” is required for a model, (4) why would it be?
