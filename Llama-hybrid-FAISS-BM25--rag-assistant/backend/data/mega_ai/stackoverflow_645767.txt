If you feel comfortable with Java EE-based web development, you could probably just bundle your application with Tomcat or Jetty. If you do not want to run standalone servlet container just for one application, you can also embed Jetty into a runnable Java application (see documentation here ). Either way you can leverage existing Java EE frameworks (Spring JDBC, Hibernate, all those web frameworks) for abstracting away technical complexities, although with embedded Jetty, you'd probably need to write some kind of integration layer for the web application framework of your choice.
