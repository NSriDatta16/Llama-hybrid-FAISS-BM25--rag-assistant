There is no contradiction here. If $l > u$ then the confidence interval for this experiment is empty. This may seem disturbing, but there is nothing in the definition to prevent it. You can find more examples in the paper "Bayesian Intervals and Confidence Intervals" by Jaynes. Or even do this: after your experiment, take the empty interval with probability 0.01 and [0,1] with probability 0.99.
