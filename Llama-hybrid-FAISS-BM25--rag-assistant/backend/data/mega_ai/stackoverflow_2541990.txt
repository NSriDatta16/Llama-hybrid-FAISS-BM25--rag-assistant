Use this method around (a) header(s) that you cannot or don't want to change, but which you need to include. You can selectively, and temporarily disable all warnings like this: #pragma warning(push, 0) // Some include(s) with unfixable warnings #pragma warning(pop) Instead of 0 you can optionally pass in the warning number to disable, so something like: #pragma warning(push) #pragma warning(disable : 4081) #pragma warning(disable : 4706) // Some code #pragma warning(pop)
