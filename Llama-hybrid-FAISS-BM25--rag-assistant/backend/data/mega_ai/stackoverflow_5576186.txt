One option is to fix the number of clusters (say, you have K clusters). Whenever you add a new point, you add it to the cluster whose center of gravity (average of the coordinates of the points in the cluster) is nearest to the point you added. If you recluster completely whenever the number of points in your space becomes a power of two (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 ...), the amortized cost of reclustering is still O(n).
