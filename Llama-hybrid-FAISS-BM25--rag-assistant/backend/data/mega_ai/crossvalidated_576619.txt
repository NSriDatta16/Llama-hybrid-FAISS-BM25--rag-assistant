what if range of normalized of data in machine learning goes beyond?

Normalization in machine learning is the process of translating data into the range 0 -> 1 or -1 -> 1. What if the values goes above 1 or below -1. What does that mean? Is it again an outlier? If this scenario happens when normalizing the labels, will it help to improve the accuracy of the prediction?
