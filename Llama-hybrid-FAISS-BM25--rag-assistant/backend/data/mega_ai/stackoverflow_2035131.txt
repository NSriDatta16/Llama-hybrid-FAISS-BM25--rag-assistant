You can use a provider model and just switch out which provider your using at run time. Of course, the biggest issue will be in the differing SQL code support. So you will have to take care that all of your SQL is located inside of each provider and stay away from any sort of embedding it in your application logic.. which you should be doing anyway. Another way is to simply change the ODBC data source at deployment time, but again, you will have to make sure the SQL code actually works in both environments; which is tough. Typically supporting multiple database back ends is a art form in itself. Simple things like SELECT TOP 100 for SQL Server 2k versus MySql's LIMIT command are enough to keep people from doing this. There's no real way of "faking" it because the database servers are fundamentally different. You would end up writing a fair amount of code just to translate a sql call from one to the other... Which is a waste of time. I'd suggest you just bite the bullet and learn MS SQL Server. This site shows a very simple example of how SQL Server, Oracle, and MySql differ on just one implementation of a select statement.
