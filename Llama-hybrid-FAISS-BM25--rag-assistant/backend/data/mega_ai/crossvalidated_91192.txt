What you're describing is an interaction. If Focal:Grazing is significant that is the effect you want. It's in your model output and easily found using summary(model1) . In a 2 x 2 x 2 ANOVA there is never any need to run a post hoc test. As for what you're planning to do, how would looking at the individual levels of Focal across Grazing tell you anything other than what your ANOVA does? I'm guessing that what you were planning to do falls under the disparaged practices in Gelman and Stern (2006) .
