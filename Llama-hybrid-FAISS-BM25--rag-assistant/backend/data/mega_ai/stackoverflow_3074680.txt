SSIS package to run under windows authentication

I have some SSIS packages deployed on server with windows authentication (my user account) using protection level as ServerStorage. Also SQL admin has created jobs to run these packages, admin account is the owner of all the jobs. The jobs are running fine till date but now since my work is over my account will be deleted from AD and I am not sure whether the packages will work or not thru jobs. It would be great if you can help me understanding the impact.
