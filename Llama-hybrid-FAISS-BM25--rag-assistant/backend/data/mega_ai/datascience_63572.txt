for feature engineering there are different methods. Pearson Correlation comes under Filter methods. Filter methods gives intuition on the high level. This can be the first step for feature engineering. In this process the features having high correlation with target should be considered. the features having high correlation among themselves should also be removed as, "they are acting two independent variables doing same work" then why keep both. After considering the correlation approaches you can also dig in to the Wrapper based methods which are more robust for feature selection but that includes the burden of training process. Refer this for introduction to the different approaches.
