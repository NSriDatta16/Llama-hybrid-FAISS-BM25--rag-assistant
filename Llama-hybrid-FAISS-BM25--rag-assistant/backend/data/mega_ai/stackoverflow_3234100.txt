Are you sure it doesn't take 30 seconds for you to run the script and then check the time on the server? NOW() returns a constant time that indicates the time at which the statement began to execute. You need to base your comparison on the query initialisation not completion. If you need the time at call use SYSDATE() instead. If all of this is fine and you still have an issue, are you definitely just using SELECT NOW() ? If you have an addition to a field in your query somewhere it might be actually adding to the NOW() column instead of the one you think it is. If all of this is still checking out, I think it could pay to skim the Server Timezone Support MySQL article. Maybe leap seconds are being ignored or something.. Have you restarted the MySQL server just in case the server time was adjusted since the server started?
