For anyone else who was interested in this, there is a paper by Xu et al (2006) that is good. I hope it might help someone in the future. In case the DOI link above breaks, the paper is called J. Xu et al, "An explicit construction of A reproducing gaussian kernel hilbert space," in 2006, . DOI: 10.1109/ICASSP.2006.1661340.
