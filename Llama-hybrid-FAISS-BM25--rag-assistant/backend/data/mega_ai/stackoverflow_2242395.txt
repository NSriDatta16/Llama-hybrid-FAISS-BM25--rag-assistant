You'd be in violation of your agreement which licenses you to use the facebook API. Part of that agreement is that you keep your key secret. If you don't, they will disable your access until you agree to abide by the rules. Policy III.7 is very clear: You must not give your secret key to another party, unless that party is an agent acting on your behalf as an operator of your application, but you must never give your secret key to an ad network. You are responsible for all activities that occur under your account identifiers. http://developers.facebook.com/policy/ Make your users each get an API key, or rethink your architecture. You don't want facebook to terminate your access, and signing up for an API key is honestly not THAT much work.
