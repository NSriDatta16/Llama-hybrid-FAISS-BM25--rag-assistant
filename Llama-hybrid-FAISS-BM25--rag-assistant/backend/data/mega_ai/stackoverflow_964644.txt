Once you learn "the WPF way" building a fully functional complex UI in XAML is faster than WinForms (because of the great data binding support, the ability to compose controls the automatic layout and more). With WinForms it's difficult to separate logic from presentation, with WPF it's much easier - this gives you cleaner code, testability and the option of using the same logic with different UI technology in the future. It's obvious WPF is getting more attention from MS and is progressing faster than WinForms (see VS2010 for example). But on the other side If I'm starting a new project I'm going with WPF, but if you do have a lot of existing working code rewriting it all is probably not the best use of your time. WPF only works on Windows XP SP2 or later, this is not a limitation for commercial application since anyone who buys software has upgraded to XP years ago - but might be a problem in a cooperate environment if you still have Win2K machines.
