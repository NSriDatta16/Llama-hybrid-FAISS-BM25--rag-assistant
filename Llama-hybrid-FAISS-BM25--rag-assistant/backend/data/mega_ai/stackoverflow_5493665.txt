I honestly still have no idea what you mean by "use reflog to bring those changes with me to the current, local project state". The reflog just displays past positions of a given ref. You still have to merge/rebase/cherry-pick to actually "bring" those changes anywhere else. Generally merging is the most elegant way. For example: git clone template local-project cd local-project git remote rename origin template-origin # make changes and commit them git add ...; git commit # suppose changes have been made in the template (work as normal there) # back in local-project, merge the template's master branch: git pull template master Nothing complicated at all. Just merge the branch with the changes you want. This is probably obvious, but make sure you never pull the other way - from the local project into the template. And of course, mess with your remotes as appropriate. You'll probably want to create a new "origin" for local-project , pointing to its central (e.g. github-hosted) repository, and the same for template . You could also point the template remote in local-project to the central template repository instead of your local clone of it, if you like.
