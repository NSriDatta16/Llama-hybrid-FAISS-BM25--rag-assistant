I usually hate this sort of thing, because it smacks of Hungarian notation. I don't like the idea of embedding the type in the name of the variable, because if you change types it shouldn't mandate changing all the variable names. But in the case of Swing, I guess it's acceptable. A good IDE will generate variable names for you. Why not let it? I'd also just spell out the type if you insist (e.g. submitButton instead of btnSubmit ). Keystrokes are cheap.
