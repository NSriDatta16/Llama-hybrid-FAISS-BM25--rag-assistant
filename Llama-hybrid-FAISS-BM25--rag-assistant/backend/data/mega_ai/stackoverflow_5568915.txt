Have you though about running that Lisp file in a Lips interpreter for the Java VM ? As an example, Armed Bear Common Lisp , which is cimpatible with JSR-223 would hapily parse your file. And using JSR-233, you'll be able to access script-defined variables (like Adephi and other ones), like examples show. EDIT From comment request, some complementary explanations (although it seems quite straightforward to me). So, suppose you have Armed bear Common Lisp in your classpath, and file is the absolute file name of your script (this example is heavily inspired by/borrowed from JSR-223 example ). First, install script engine ScriptEngineManager scriptManager = new ScriptEngineManager(); scriptManager.registerEngineExtension("lisp", new AbclScriptEngineFactory()); ScriptEngine lispEngine = scriptManager.getEngineByExtension("lisp"); Then, load your script in script engine Object eval = lispEngine.eval(new FileReader(file)); Now, armed with one little debugger, go see what's in (I'm not courageous enought to install all the environment to do the job for you)
