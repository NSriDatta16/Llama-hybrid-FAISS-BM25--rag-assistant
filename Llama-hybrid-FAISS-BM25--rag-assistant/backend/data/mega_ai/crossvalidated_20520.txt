What is an "uninformative prior"? Can we ever have one with truly no information?

Inspired by a comment from this question : What do we consider "uninformative" in a prior - and what information is still contained in a supposedly uninformative prior? I generally see the prior in an analysis where it's either a frequentist-type analysis trying to borrow some nice parts from Bayesian analysis (be it some easier interpretation all the way to 'its the hot thing to do'), the specified prior is a uniform distribution across the bounds of the effect measure, centered on 0. But even that asserts a shape to the prior - it just happens to be flat. Is there a better uninformative prior to use?
