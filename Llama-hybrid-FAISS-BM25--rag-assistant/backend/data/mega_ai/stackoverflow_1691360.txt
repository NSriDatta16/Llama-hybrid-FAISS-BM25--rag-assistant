If you have an XSLT 2.0 processor you can specify XHTML for the output method, which should serialize the img element properly. http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt-xquery-serialization/#xhtml-output Given an XHTML element whose content model is EMPTY, the serializer MUST use the minimized tag syntax, for example , as the alternative syntax allowed by XML gives uncertain results in many existing user agents. The serializer MUST include a space before the trailing /> , e.g. , and src="karen.jpg" alt="Karen" />
