All compilers should require you to include those lines. If they don't, then they're just encouraging you to write non-portable code because you're relying on certain headers to be included automatically and you're relying on certain names to be in scope implicitly. I don't mean to say that those two lines should always be required, though. I only mean that if the rest of your code is written to use things declared in the cstdlib header and in the std namespace, then those two lines need to appear first, and the compiler shouldn't act as though they are there when they really aren't. Check whether your other compiler has some settings to disable this implicit code. If it doesn't, then it's probably a very, very old compiler, and you should consider not using it and not supporting it anymore.
