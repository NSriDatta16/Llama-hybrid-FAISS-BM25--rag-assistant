Bazar Repository - Concept of branches and

Hi all I am writing a repository adapter for Bzr. This is for a search engine where adapter lets me communicate to some bzr repo, check the connection, checkout or update the projects. (No commit, push or create repos) Now i dont have much experience with Bzr and such details of other scms too and get confused with its branches concept. I use --> bzr checkout branchlocation mylocallocation -- to checkout projects and --> bzr ls URlwithbranchname --to test repo. Is there any tutorial on internet with basic beginners information? about branches and structure of bzr organization. I have gone through canaonical website already. Any way to run checkout or list on repo name or project name, not on branch name? For checkout/list, do i need to take care of username/pass authentication on repo too? Also I am still not sure about bzr over ssh, sftp, ftp servers. Would it be extra functionality to allow checkout from these servers. like authentication? or any kind of handle. I know checkout works for plain http. Any kind of basic documentation would be very helpful for me being naive to bzr.
