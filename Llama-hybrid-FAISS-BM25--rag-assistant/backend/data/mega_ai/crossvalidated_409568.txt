Can Random Forests deal with variables that affect each other (and respect their temporal sequence)?

I'm studying temporal aspects of a decision-related brain process. For this study I want to see how much the information (absolute amount of contrast and/or amplitude) of a stimulus at different time points affects the final decision. In a Random Forest I made in MATLAB R2019a, the absolute value of the stimulus is a single variable for each time point (80*50ms, so 80 variables) as we want to see what time points are important for the decision. However, the absolute value of a stimulus at one time point can affect the role of the stimulus at the following time point. Imagine two situations where the stimulus at time point N has an (arbitrary) absolute value of 5: If the stimulus at time point N-1 has a value of 0, a value of 5 is relatively high and might play a bigger role in the decisionmaking If the stimulus at time point N-1 has a value of 10, a value of 5 is relatively low and might play a lesser role in the decisionmaking My question comes down to this: is it possible to design a Random Forest that takes the sequence of the variables into account, in a sort of hierarchical fashion with the first variable (time point) influencing the second variable (time point), but not the other way around? If so, what tools are available to ensure the Forest is 'aware' of this specific dependancy between variables? Any literature or alternative techniques for this problem are also highly appreciated.
