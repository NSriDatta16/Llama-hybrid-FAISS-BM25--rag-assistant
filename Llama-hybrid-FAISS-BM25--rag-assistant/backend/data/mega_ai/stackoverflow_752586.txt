There's nothing inherently wrong with using Session state in an ASP.NET web app, as long as you use it sparingly and pay attention to good design principles. For instance, it doesn't make sense to cache large objects in session state and then use SQL Server to manage session state; you will be reading/writing large amounts of data from a database which defeats the objective of caching it in the first place! However, using session state to store some primitives between pages seems OK to me.
