Let $\mu_1$ denote the mean of the first population and $\mu_2$ denote the mean of the second population. It seems that you've used a two-sample $t$-test to test whether $\mu_1=\mu_2$. The significant result implies that $\mu_1\neq\mu_2$, but the difference seems to be to small to matter for your application. What've you encountered is the fact that statistically significant often can be something else than significant for the application . While the difference may be statistically significant it may still not be meaningful . Bayesian testing won't solve that problem - you'll still just conclude that a difference exists. There might however be a way out. For instance, for a one-sided hypothesis you could decide that if $\mu_1$ is $\Delta$ units greater than $\mu_2$ then that would be a meaningful difference that is large enough to matter for your application. In that case you would test whether $\mu_1-\mu_2\leq \Delta$ instead of whether $\mu_1-\mu_2=0$. The $t$-statistic (assuming equal variances) would in that case be $$ T=\frac{\bar{x}_1-\bar{x}_2-\Delta}{s_p\sqrt{1/n_1+1/n_2}}$$ where $s_p$ is the pooled standard deviation estimate. Under the null hypothesis, this statistic is $t$-distributed with $n_1+n_2-2$ degrees of freedom. An easy way of carrying out this test is to subtract $\Delta$ from your observations from the first population and then carry out a regular one-sided two-sample $t$-test.
