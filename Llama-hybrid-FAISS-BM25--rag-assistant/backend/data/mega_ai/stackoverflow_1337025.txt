Here's an example to show you how to animate something. This is exactly what that Star Wars animation is. It's a gigantic text file split up into individual frames. Read the FAQ at the Star Wars ASCIImation page to find out more about it. The general idea is that you have a set of frames. Each frame contains one image in the animation. You clear the screen, show a frame, and then wait for some time period. Do that over and over, and you have a text animation. So first you create a file with your frames. Call it frames.txt. To allow variable-length frames, we follow each frame by a line that begins with @! followed by the number of animation ticks that frame should stay on the screen. For example, if you're drawing at 15 frames per second and the line is @! 15 , then the frame will be on screen for 1 second (15 ticks). +---------+ | frame 1 | +---------+ @! 15 .-----------. | frame 2 | | | `-----------' @! 15 +-------------+ | frame 3 | | | | | | | +-------------+ @! 15 .-----------. | frame 4 | | | .-----------. @! 15 +---------+ | frame 5 | +---------+ @! 3 +---------+ | rame 5 | +---------+ @! 3 +---------+ | ame 5 | +---------+ @! 3 +---------+ | me 5 | +---------+ @! 3 +---------+ | e 5 | +---------+ @! 3 +---------+ | 5 | +---------+ @! 3 +---------+ | | +---------+ @! 3 Then compile and run this program. On Linux or OSX, I just save it as text_animate.cpp and run make text_animate . On Windows maybe the only thing you'll have to do is change the line that says system("clear") to system("cls"), but I don't know for sure. #include #include #include #include const char *FRAME_DELIM = "@!"; unsigned int FRAME_DELIM_LEN = strlen(FRAME_DELIM); int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { if( argc != 2 ) { std::cout \n"; exit(1); } std::string frames_fn = argv[1]; struct timespec sleep_time = {0, 1000000000 / 15}; // 15 fps std::ifstream file_stream; file_stream.open(frames_fn.c_str(), std::ios::in); if( !file_stream.is_open() ) { std::cout 0 ) { nanosleep(&sleep_time, NULL); } } file_stream.close(); return 0; } Then just run ./text_animate frames.txt . Press CTRL-C to exit since it loops forever.
