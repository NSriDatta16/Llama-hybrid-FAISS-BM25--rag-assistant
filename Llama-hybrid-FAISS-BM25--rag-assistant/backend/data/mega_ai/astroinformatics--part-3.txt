l classification, Photometric classification, Morphological classification, and classification of solar activity. The approaches of classification techniques are listed below: Artificial neural network (ANN) Support vector machine (SVM) Learning vector quantization (LVQ) Decision tree Random forest k-nearest neighbors Na√Øve Bayesian networks Radial basis function network Gaussian process Decision table Alternating decision tree (ADTree) Regression Regression is used to make predictions based on the retrieved data through statistical trends and statistical modeling. Different uses of this technique are used for fetching Photometric redshifts and measurements of physical parameters of stars. The approaches are listed below: Artificial neural network (ANN) Support vector regression (SVR) Decision tree Random forest k-nearest neighbors regression Kernel regression Principal component regression (PCR) Gaussian process Least squared regression (LSR) Partial least squares regression Clustering Clustering is classifying objects based on a similarity measure metric. It is used in Astronomy for Classification as well as Special/rare object detection. The approaches are listed below: Principal component analysis (PCA) DBSCAN k-means clustering OPTICS Cobweb model Self-organizing map (SOM) Expectation Maximization Hierarchical Clustering AutoClass Gaussian Mixture Modeling (GMM) Anomaly detection Anomaly detection is used for detecting irregularities in the dataset. However, this technique is used here to detect rare/special objects. The following approaches are used: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) k-means clustering Expectation Maximization Hierarchical clustering One-class SVM Time-series analysis Time-Series analysis helps in analyzing trends and predicting outputs over time. It is used for trend prediction and novel detection (detection of unknown data). The approaches used here are: Artificial neural network (ANN) Support vector regression (SVR) Decision tree Conferences Additional conferences and conference lists: See also Astronomy and Computing Astrophysics Data System Astrophysics Source Code Library Astrostatistics Committee on Data for Science and Technology Data-driven astronomy Galaxy Zoo International Astrostatistics Association International Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA) MilkyWay@home Virtual Observatory WorldWide Telescope Zooniverse References External links International AstroInformatics Association (IAIA) Astronomical Data Analysis Software and Systems (ADASS) Astrostatistics and Astroinformatics Portal Cosmostatistics Initiative (COIN) Astroinformatics and Astrostatistics Commission of the International Astronomical Union
