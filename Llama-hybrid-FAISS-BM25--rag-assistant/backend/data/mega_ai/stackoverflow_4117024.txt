Errors are Throwable s that you're not supposed to / expected to catch, such as OutOfMemoryError or StackOverflowError . From the Java documentation on Error : An Error is a subclass of Throwable that indicates serious problems that a reasonable application should not try to catch . Most such errors are abnormal conditions. The ThreadDeath error, though a "normal" condition, is also a subclass of Error because most applications should not try to catch it. Here are some of the more common errors: OutOfMemoryError StackOverflowError AssertionError NoClassDefFoundError Here are the remaining errors in the standard API: AnnotationFormatError AWTError CoderMalfunctionError IOError FactoryConfigurationError FactoryConfigurationError LinkageError ServiceConfigurationError ThreadDeath TransformerFactoryConfigurationError VirtualMachineError InternalError UnknownError ClassCircularityError ClassFormatError ExceptionInInitializerError IncompatibleClassChangeError UnsatisfiedLinkError VerifyError
