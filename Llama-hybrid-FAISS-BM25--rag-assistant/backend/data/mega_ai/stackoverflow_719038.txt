If the storage types aren't to supposed to be extended, I would recommend using an enum, like this public enum StorageLocation { None, File, Database, Email } public class ExceptionLogger { private StorageLocation m_Storage; public StorageLocation Storage { get { return m_Storage; } set { m_Storage = value; } } // ... } If you think that storage locations need to be extended in the future then I would create an interface IStorageLocation and use this to get/set the Storage property in ExceptionLogger. Will be a bit more effort but you will gain far more flexibility.
