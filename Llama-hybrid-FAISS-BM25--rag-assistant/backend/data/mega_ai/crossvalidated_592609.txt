It is not in general the case that centering $y$ produces an intercept of zero. Centering $y$ means that the average value of the centered variable is zero, but the intercept is the predicted value for $y$ when $x=0$ . To illustrate, try plotting bodyfat$y against bodyfat$x , and then plotting bodyfat$y - mean(bodyfat$y) against bodyfat$x , and think about what the axes mean. For example, does it even make sense for $x$ to be zero? If $x$ is height and $y$ is weight, then the intercept is the predicted weight (or difference from the mean in weight) at a height of zero.
