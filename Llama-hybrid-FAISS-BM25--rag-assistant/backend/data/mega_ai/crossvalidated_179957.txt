Unless I am mistaken, at the moment you are using the 5 fold cross-validation and the gridsearch for your parameters on your initial training set, so the 80% that was randomly sampled in the beginning, but you are not using the test set at all. At every iteration of the grid search, you are using 4/5 of those 80% of your data (i.e. 64%) to train your SVM and 1/5 of those 80% of your data (i.e. 16%) to test it. As a last step you should probably use the remaining 20% to evaluate the parameters that you found with the GridSearch.
