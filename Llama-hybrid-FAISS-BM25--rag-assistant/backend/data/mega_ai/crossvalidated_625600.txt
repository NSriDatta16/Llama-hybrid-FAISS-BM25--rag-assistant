I have recently found an excellent paper titled "Confidence Distribution, the Frequentist Distribution Estimator of a Parameter: A Review" by Xie and Singh: https://statweb.rutgers.edu/mxie/RCPapers/insr.12000.pdf which explains clearly the notion of a confidence distribution , which is the term that describes the probability distribution in CASE 2. The key insight of the paper is that the confidence distribution is viewed as an estimator for the parameter of interest, instead of an inherent distribution of the parameter. The authors make it clear there is no need to describe $\mu$ as a random variable (Bayesian paradigm), and instead we can talk about $\widetilde{\mathbf{X}}$ entirely within the frequentist paradigm. Just like a point estimate, or a confidence interval, the confidence distribution is a frequentist estimator for the unknown population mean.
