One option would be to take a Bayesian approach by estimating the confidence in the class prediction. If all of the confidences are below a threshold, predict "new class". Another option is zero-shot learning (ZSL) which goes one step further and attempts to predict a specific class for the unobserved classes. ZSL often requires auxiliary information, which includes distinguishing properties of the items.
