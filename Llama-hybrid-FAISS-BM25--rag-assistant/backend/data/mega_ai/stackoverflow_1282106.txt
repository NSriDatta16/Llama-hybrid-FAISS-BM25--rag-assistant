Image upload works sporadically

This is a very open question about a problem that we have. Basically, we have an image upload function on our site, built on Zend PHP that works great and smoothly almost all the time. Yet the logs show continuously that the entire framework crashes pretty much all the time and the image upload fails and I don't have the slightest idea of what the hell is going on. The code is working and quite efficient. Server speed is decent. User load is quite average. We have some foreign loaded javascripts that could stall things. I need some pointers from your vast long history in the field of what it could be.
