Most of the following answer is for the particular case of google translate. In most cases, you'll just need to parse the and pull out whichever frame you're looking for, though it might not be immediately obvious which is the main one from the HTML (perhaps look at the relative sizing of the frames). It looks like you're going to have to follow a few refreshes to get the actual content. In particular, when you grab the URL you just mentioned, you'll see something like *snip* Translate *snip* If you follow the link here (remember to unescape '&' first), it'll give you another small HTML fragment which includes Again, unescaping the '&' and then following the refresh, you'll have the translated page that you're looking for. Play with this in wget or curl and it should become more clear what you're going to need to do.
