Confused about random variables and time series

I have this two practical (with R) exercises for my exam: Using $\chi^{2}$ to test (goodness-of-fit) if fluctuations in wind speed are Gaussian. Calculating Lagrangian time scale for wind speed. In particular to do this I must use Lagrangian autocorrelation function that is sample autocorrelation function for wide-sense stationary (WSS) stochastic process (or in R acf(x, type = "correlation") ). To do these exercises I have 30 datasets one for every day in September 2018. Every dataset contains 1440 measures of wind speed from a sensor: one for each minute in that day. Question: How do I have to take into consideration wind speed? In the first exercise I considered them as measure from a continuous random variable while in the second I considered them as time series. Is correct and possible? Edit To be more exact I already solved these exercises but I reported them for further information. However I don't understand if it is possible consider a sample of 1440 measures as a continuous random variable and a time series at the same time . This is my doubt.
