Empirical posterior probability in Bayesian statistics

I fitted a Bayesian model and the histogram below is from a posterior estimation. I calculated the empirical probability that $\beta_3$ is bigger than $0$. This probability is $P(\beta_3>0)\approx 0.94$ is wrong if I say that this parameter is non-zero?
