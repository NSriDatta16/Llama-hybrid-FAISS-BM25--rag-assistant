…there are at least five application names floating around, at least in concept: (1) the file name the Finder sees, which in the case of an application package is the package (bundle) name; (2) the name of the executable inside the package, (3) the long name used in many places for display purposes only; (4) the short name used as the application menu title and in a few other places where a long name won’t fit for display purposes; and (5) the process name of a running application. They aren’t always the same, especially in Microsoft and Adobe products. — Bill Cheeseman From what I can tell, the name in the dock is the name of the application bundle (sans ".app") on the filesystem . The value under the CFBundleName key in info.plist is what shows up in the menubar . As far as I know, changing either these at runtime isn't going to work… but what you can do is have two versions of your app, a root and non-root version, inside your user-facing .app bundle. When the user-facing app is launched, it checks if it's running as root or not, and launches the appropriate copy of the real app, which has the CFBundleName and file-name you want. I wish I knew of a more elegant solution.
