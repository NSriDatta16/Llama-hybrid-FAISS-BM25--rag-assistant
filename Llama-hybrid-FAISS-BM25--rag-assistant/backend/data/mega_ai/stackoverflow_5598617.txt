How to get the content of a non-javascript 'script'?

I'm including a tag in my HTML page which contains a fragment of HTML. I want to get this fragment and insert it into the page. The location of the fragment is on the same server as the page itself, so there are no cross-site issues. (btw, I've specified the type of the script as text/x-jquery-tmpl as I've been trying to use jQuery templates to access the script content, even though it's just an HTML literal). I believe the value of 'type' is not a big deal. Some things I've tried: // Try inserting frag.html into div hdr // this attempt, using jQuery templates, doesn't work $('#frag').tmpl().appendTo('#hdr'); // This is an empty string var contents = $('#frag').text(); Sorry for all the jQuery, I have even less idea of how to attempt this without it. I'm a javascript ignoramus and need the fluffy protection of jQuery at all times.
