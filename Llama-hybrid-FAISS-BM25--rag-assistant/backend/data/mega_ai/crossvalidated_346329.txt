In LDA, after collapsed Gibbs sampling, how to estimate values of other latent variables?

I watched a video on coursera , everything went well until the following slide around 12'50''. I read it in other papers that to estimate latent variables say $\Phi$ we can draw a sample $Z'$ of the full collection by collapsed Gibbs sampling and take $p(\Phi|W,Z')$ as an approximation. This video says we can use $p(\Phi|W,\hat{Z})$ where $\hat{Z}$ is an average of a few samples. My question is, does it make sense to average the samples of $Z$? If I understood correctly $z_{dn}$ represent the topic index that is responsible for the $n$th word in the $d$th document. But for two independent samples, the indices of the topics are not guaranteed to be the same.
