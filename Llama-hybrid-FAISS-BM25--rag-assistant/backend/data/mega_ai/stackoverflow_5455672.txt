jQuery just leverages browser functionality. On older browsers(IE getElementsByClassName function, but virtually every browser supports getElementById . On these browsers, jQuery has to traverse the whole tree and look for all elements with the given classname. Therefore, using IDs will be faster. However, bear in mind that id's must be unique, i.e. you can't have two elements with the same ID. This is often not advisable, since components may be used in different contexts on the same page. Using IDs exclusively would prevent that.
