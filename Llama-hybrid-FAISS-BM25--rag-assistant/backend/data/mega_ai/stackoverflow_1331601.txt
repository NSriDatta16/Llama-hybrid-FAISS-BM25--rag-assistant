Every system has its pros and cons. You need to decide which one fits your needs best before committing to one. Using a CMS (e.g. Joomla / Drupal) can save you a lot of time on development that has already been incorporated into these systems. Why re-invent the wheel when you can use and leverage off existing code? However, these CMS are designed for the most common purposes. If your website has a unique function, this may not be able to be achieved out of the box with either of these systems. You will need to develop / use third party extensions and modules to achieve any extra functionality that is not addressed by these systems. Thankfully, these are both developed using PHP so its fairly easy to extend the core functionality as needed. If you decide to use kohona / cakephp / codeigniter (which are all php frameworks), you can achieve very fine grained control over your websites behavior and control every aspect as needed, but it will take you much longer to deploy a fully fledged "standard" site than using a standard CMS. Both Joomla and Drupal have are used on many heavy weight websites: Joomla http://www.olympus.com.au/ - olympus, camera manufacturer's Australian website uses joomla http://www.li.lv/ - official website of the republic of Latvia uses joomla Drupal http://www.recovery.gov/ - Recovery.org tracking US economic recovery spending http://www.mtv.co.uk/ - MTV UK website
