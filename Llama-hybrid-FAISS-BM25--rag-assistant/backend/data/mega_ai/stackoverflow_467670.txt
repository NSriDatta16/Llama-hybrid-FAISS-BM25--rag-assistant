Um...Yea, those ARE "100% independent" of the OS. At least to the point that all JVMs must support them. I guess I don't understand what you mean by 100% independent. At it's core, Swing needs little more than access to the core window manager and a blitter, though it obviously can (and does) use much more than that. Simply stated, part of porting the JVM includes porting the core graphics capabilities required by Swing. Some ports leverage the OS better than other, but at the high level Swing level, you generally aren't concerned about that.
