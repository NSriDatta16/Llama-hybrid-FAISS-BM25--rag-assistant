Other answers suggest to put an additional channel, I disagree. I think it's a very computationally intensive, time consuming process. Moreover, it forces non-pixel data to be processed by Conv filters, which doesn't make much sense IMHO. I suggest you to establish a multi-input model . It would be composed by three parts: A Convolutional part, to process pixel data, A Feed-forward part to process non-image data, Another Feed-forward part that elaborates the prediction based on the concatenation of the two outputs above. You will need to instantiate them separately, then combine together in a Keras Model() . You will also need Concatenate() layers to combine the two different sources of data. You can read more about the implementation of multi-input Neural Networks here .
