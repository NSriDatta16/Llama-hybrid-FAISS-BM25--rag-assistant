Example code for embedding SVG canvas in SWT project?

Is there a good example of how to include an SVG canvas into a Java SWT project (particularly Holongate , though I would be interested in any other options)? Additionally, I would need to support this SVG canvas on Mac OS X, Windows and Linux clients, in case an implementation relies on native libraries. Thanks for any pointers.
