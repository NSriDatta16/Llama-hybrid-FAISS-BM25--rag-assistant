Zero inflated dependent variable and tree ml regression models

I wonder, if tree based ml models (e.g. xgb or random forests) are actually susceptible to zero inflated dependent variables (DVs) in the case of regression (in a sense the DV is at least bi-modal)? IMHO one could just use them as is. Some people train the trees on data where the DVs > 0 and use a model that predicts whether the DVs are 0 or greater (e.g. multiplying the unadjusted values with a probability - see here ).
