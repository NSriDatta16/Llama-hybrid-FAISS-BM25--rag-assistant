LSTM Time series prediction for multiple multivariate series

I have to predict next min traffic for multiple cities (100+). I am thinking of using LSTM. My main concern is how do I scale the number of cities. How does LSTM learn different amount of traffic and other related features of all cities to predict the next state. What should be the network architecture for such cases. I was thinking of the following process: Normalisation of the data with city specific Min,Max scalar Feed sliding window data(t_1 to t_60) to LSTM and predict (t+1) value Take the output value and get the actuals values from step 1. I have read multiple papers and blogs online but mostly the deal with one multivariate time-series. But, in my case its multiple multivariate time series but one generalised model. Can someone suggest what are common industry practises for these and related papers/blogs. Do I need to model for each city (Its not possible in my case because of scalability issues?
