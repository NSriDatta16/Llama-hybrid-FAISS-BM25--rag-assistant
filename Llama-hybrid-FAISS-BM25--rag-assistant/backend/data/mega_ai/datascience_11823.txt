If you go for an automatic solution, you may as well just decide that 80% of your points should be core points, and choose the 80% quantile of the 4-NN distances . Looking at the derivative etc. to formally define a "knee" is fragile, this will not work in my opinion. Because you cannot compare distances to ranks. But: Several heuristics for DBSCAN parameterization have been proposed over the last 20 years. Several enhancements of DBSCAN such as OPTICS and HDBSCAN* have been published, that get rid of the epsilon parameter (in favor of a graphical approach, e.g. OPTICS plots). In the end, having parameters is a feature, not a limitation . Cluster analysis is not something to fully automate. It is an explorative method. You try it, change parameters, try it again, change parameters again, ... until you have learned something about your data. Any method that does not allow you to reiterate is badly designed.
