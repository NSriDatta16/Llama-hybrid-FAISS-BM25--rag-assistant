Disclaimer: my answer will be off topic (not using regular expressions). If it's not too heavyweight, try using Apache OpenNLP . NLP means "natural language processing". Check documentation on detecting sentences . The relevant bit of code is: String sentences[] = sentenceDetector.sentDetect(" First sentence. Second sentence. "); You'll get an array of two Strings . First one will be "First sentence.", second one will be "Second sentence.". There's more code to be written before using aforementioned line of code, but you get the general idea.
