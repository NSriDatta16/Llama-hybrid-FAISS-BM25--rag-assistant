The time-complexity of a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm depends on the complexity of the target distribution. In Bayesian statistics where the target is a function of a sample of $n$ observations, computing the target distribution at a new value [proposed state] is generally of order $\text{O}(n)$ if there is no sufficient statistic (i.e., outside exponential families). The dimension $d$ of the state space also impacts the computation time at each step. Dimension also matters in the number of steps needed to achieve stationarity , whose order $\text{O}(d^\alpha)$ will increase with $d$ .
