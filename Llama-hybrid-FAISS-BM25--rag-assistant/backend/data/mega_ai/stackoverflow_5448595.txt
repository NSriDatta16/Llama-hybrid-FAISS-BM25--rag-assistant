With the window.location object. This code gives you GET without the question mark. window.location.search.substr(1) From your example it will return returnurl=%2Fadmin EDIT : I took the liberty of changing Qwerty's answer , which is really good , and as he pointed I followed exactly what the OP asked: function findGetParameter(parameterName) { var result = null, tmp = []; location.search .substr(1) .split("&") .forEach(function (item) { tmp = item.split("="); if (tmp[0] === parameterName) result = decodeURIComponent(tmp[1]); }); return result; } I removed the duplicated function execution from his code, replacing it a variable ( tmp ) and also I've added decodeURIComponent , exactly as OP asked. I'm not sure if this may or may not be a security issue. Or otherwise with plain for loop, which will work even in IE8: function findGetParameter(parameterName) { var result = null, tmp = []; var items = location.search.substr(1).split("&"); for (var index = 0; index
