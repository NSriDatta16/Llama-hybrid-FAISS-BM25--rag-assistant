Risks of programming sites with jQuery Mobile?

The jQuery team recently launched http://jquerymobile.com/ with the intent of creating a user-interface library for mobile devices. Our aim is to provide tools to build dynamic touch interfaces that will adapt gracefully to a range of device form factors. The system will include both layouts (lists, detail panes, overlays) and a rich set of form controls and UI widgets (toggles, sliders, tabs). Overall, it seems support for the framework is really low because most phones ship with crappy browsers. My question, is in two parts. Is it better to support a few browsers with a richer experience or give as many users as possible a merely average experience? This is similar to the question of supporting IE because the question is how much do we care about users with worse browsers? More importantly, how much developer time is it really worth to build a mobile version of a site that isn't primarily for mobile user?
