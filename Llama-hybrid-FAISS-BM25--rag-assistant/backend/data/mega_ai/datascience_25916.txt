Evaluating machine learning model with missing features

I am working on a credit risk binary classification problem. The classes are GoodPayers and BadPayers. The training set has variables/features that contains: DemoGraphics Data such as - Age, Education, Loan Amount, Interest Rate Behavioral Data such as - Payment in Month1, Payment in Month2, Payment in Month3, Payment delay in Month1, Payment delay in Month2. The 10-fold cross-validation has 0.82 AUC on this set. However, the unseen data just contains the 'Demographics Data' and does not have 'Behavioral Data' of Payment. How do we deploy/test the model based on DemoGraphics Dataset only?
