REST API Design - is the Plancake end_timestamp for synchronization a good practise?

I need to design a REST API for my project. It is needed for a two-way synchronization of a mobile application with a web application. Obviously, before starting, I have studied how other projects have implemented a similar scenario. Commonly when the mobile app wants to get all the new items from the web application, it sends a 'start_timestamp' in the request as a time reference. I have found out that Plancake requires also an 'end_timestamp', in order to define a clear time window. You can read that in the last point of 'About the request:' in this paragraph: http://www.plancake.com/apiDocumentation#api_doc_overview Do you think I should consider using an 'end_timestamp' or it is a complication that brings very small benefit? Thanks, Dan
