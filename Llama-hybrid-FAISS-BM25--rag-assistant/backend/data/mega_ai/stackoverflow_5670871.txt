There are three things you can try: for temporary files - that don't need to be shared across web servers (which is rare!) - then you can use Local Storage - http://vkreynin.wordpress.com/2010/01/10/learning-azure-local-storage-with-me/ for a disk shared between web servers (but only one of these will have write access) you could use an Azure Drive - http://blog.maartenballiauw.be/post/2010/02/02/Using-Windows-Azure-Drive-(aka-X-Drive).aspx for general flexible shared file storage, try using Azure Blob Storage - http://blogs.msdn.com/b/jnak/archive/2008/10/29/walkthrough-simple-blob-storage-sample.aspx Definitely the last of these is the one I'd recommend - it's fast, flexible and scalable.
