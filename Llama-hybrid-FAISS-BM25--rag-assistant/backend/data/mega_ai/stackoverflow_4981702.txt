The best option here is to register the items using both the key and the regular 'typed' service: builder.Register () .As () .Keyed ("someKey"); You can then just resolve IEnumerable to get the result you're after, while resolving them by key (or name) is also supported. If you're concerned about maintaining a particular default registration for IBeverage just use PreseveExistingDefaults() on the others (or make sure your intended default is registered last). HTH!
