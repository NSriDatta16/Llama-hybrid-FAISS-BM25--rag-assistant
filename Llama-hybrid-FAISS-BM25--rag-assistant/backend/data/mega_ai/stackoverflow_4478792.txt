This actually sounds like a service or repository to me... TextService or TextRepository? TextModel? But let me back up a bit... the Singleton pattern is a pretty bad way of accessing something like this. Just google "Singleton pattern problems" if you want to see what I am talking about. Plus, in AS3, you don't have private constructors so you can't implement the Singleton pattern in a pure way. Instead, I really prefer composition via "Inversion of Control" (IoC) containers. There are plenty of them out there for ActionScript. They can be really lightweight but they decouple your components in a really elegant way. Sorry to inject my thoughts here... ymmv :) EDIT -- More on eliminating Singleton pattern I have written about several strategies on eliminating singletons in your code. This article was written for C#, but all the same principles apply. In that article, I DON't talk explicitly about IoC containers. Here is a pretty good article about IoC in Flex . In addition, several frameworks give you IoC capabilities: Swiz Robot Legs fling Cairngorm flex-ioc
