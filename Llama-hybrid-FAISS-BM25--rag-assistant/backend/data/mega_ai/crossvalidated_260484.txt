How to find similiarity between two row data

I try to remove one of almost duplicated data from data set programmatically. My data set is logically like the table below.As you see there is two rows in data set and a human can understand easily that this two data is related and probably added by same person. My solution to this problem is using Levenshtein two compare fields(name,address,telephone number) separately and find their similarity ratio. Then I calculate average ratio as 0.77873. This similarity results seems to low. My python code is like from Levenshtein import ratio name = ratio("Game of ThOnes Books for selling","Selling Game of Thrones books") address = ratio("George Washington street","George Washington st.") phone = ratio("555-55-55","0(555)-55-55") total_ratio = name+address+phone print total_ratio/3 #Average ratio My question is what is the best way two compare row data? Which algorithms or methodologies is require for doing this?
