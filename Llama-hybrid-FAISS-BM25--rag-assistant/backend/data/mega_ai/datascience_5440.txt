Though it is not specifically a term, focused on machine learning , but I would refer to such behavior of a statistical model, using a general term side effect (while adding some clarifying adjectives , such as expected or unexpected, desired or undesired, and similar). Modeling outcome or transitive feedback loop outcome might be some of the alternative terms.
