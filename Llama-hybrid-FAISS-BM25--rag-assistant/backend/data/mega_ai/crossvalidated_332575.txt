If this data come from the social sciences, I will try to figure out what made the trend change its direction at 19. Fitting a linear trend to the entire data seems to produce a misleading interpretation of the time dependent behavior. You may try interrupted time series analysis. Alternatively, you may divide the data into two parts, and estimate linear upward and downward trends, although the small number of cases is a problem then.
