Magento backend customer account DOB update issue

I am trying to update the DOB of a customer from the backend of magneto. The year of DOB I am going to set is 1967. Ok, Well, The record is updated successfully but when I go inside the database table and see the DOB it contains the year 2067. I am surprised how this happened. I again go in to the backend and set it to 1971 and update the customer record. But this time DOB is ok in the database table. It is 1971. I reached at the conclusion that the DOB less than 1970 is stored wrongly in the database. Is it magento bug or something wrong with my magento copy. Thanks
