Mono C to a running C# program

I'm looking at communicating between a C++ program and a C# program using Mono. On the Mono website they have some good examples of embedding Mono in a C program, starting the C# program, and then communicating between the two. mono_domain_assembly_open is used to open a C# assembly and mono_jit_exec is used to run it. My question is, is it possible to "connect" to an already running assembly? The mono_jit_exec call would seem to me to be not needed since the C# assembly is already running. Instead would there be an alternate call to "link" the C and C# programs? Thanks, mj
