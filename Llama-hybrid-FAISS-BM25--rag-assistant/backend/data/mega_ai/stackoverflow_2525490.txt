That depends on what level of access the application needs. If you want something that is always running and can be leveraged by other applications then there's no way - there are no background processes and no kernel extensions. If you need raw access to the networking devices in /dev then no - that's sandboxed off. If you can use CFNetwork then you'll be fine - that lets you create an arbitrary application-layer protocol on top of BSD sockets and TCP/IP at the transport layer.
