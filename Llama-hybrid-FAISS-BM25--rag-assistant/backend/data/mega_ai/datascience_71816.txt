Please review my sketch of the Machine Learning process

It's amazingly difficult to find an outline of the end-to-end machine learning process. As a total beginner, this lack of information is frustrating, so I decided to try scraping together my own process by looking at a lot of tutorials that all do it a slightly different way. I would like to have a standard process to go by, and once I am comfortable with it, I can choose to deviate. I'd like some input from you pillars of the industry. Is this a good routine for a beginner to follow? Get Data Clean Data Split data into Training and Test Data ~(80/20) Separately, for training and test sets: Normalize Data (continuous features): standardize (divide by std. deviation) center (subtract mean) Impute missing values Feature Engineering Encode Categorical Variables: Integer Encoding One Hot Encoding Target Encoding Weight of Evidence Separate labels from Test set if classification problem. Keep aside. Choose a few models. for each model, using k-fold cross-validaton: Train base model on "training set". Tune and test hyper parameters on "validation set" Save best scores and parameters Compare each model's final scores on the never touched test data Choose the model with highest scores. Edit : Thank you for the overwhelming number of responses. Lots of times my questions get a single answer or none at all. I appreciate the time taken to help out a beginner. I have edited the steps above to reflect the wonderful answers below. I hope that this helps another beginner somewhere else.
