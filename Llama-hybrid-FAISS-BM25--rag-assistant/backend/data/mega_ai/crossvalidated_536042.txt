Consider that you have a linear regression where $Y$ is your output $X$ is your input and $\theta$ is your coefficients. Then the posterior distribution of $\theta$ can be expressed as $$p(\theta|X,y)=\frac{p(\theta,X,Y)}{p(X,Y)} = \frac{p(Y|X,\theta)p(X,\theta)}{p(X,Y)}$$ however, if you see a directed acyclic graph of Bayesian linear regression you will see that $\theta$ affects directly $Y$ and is independent of $X$ , so $p(X,\theta)=P(X)p(\theta)$ . $$p(\theta|X,Y)= \frac{p(Y|X,\theta)p(X)p(\theta)}{p(X,Y)}$$ and divide the denominator and numerator with $p(X)$ and you take $$p(\theta|X,Y) =\frac{p(Y|X,\theta)p(\theta)}{p(Y|X)}$$
