Classification models with multi-class allowed for each record

I am training a multi-class classification model. Each record can belong to one or more classes. (actually can I still call it a classification model? or should it be a topic model or something else?) The training data looks like this ( format_A ) record_id, f_1 , f_2, f_3, ... , f_n, output_A, output_B, output_C 1, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ... , 1.2, 1, 0, 1 2, 0.3, 1.2, 0.5, ... , 2.1, 1, 0, 0 3, 0.2, 3.2, 1.3, ... , 0.4, 1, 1, 0 4, 1.1, 0.1, 0.7, ... , 0.5, 0, 0, 1 5, 2.1, 0.5, 0.8, ... , 1.9, 0, 1, 1 6, 0.5, 0.4, 0.2, ... , 0.8, 1, 1, 1 : : Right now, I am using the sklearn logistic regression with multi-class . I preprocess the above training data such that there is only one target per record. For record with more than 1 output, I duplicated the records. That is, the above training data becomes below ( format_B ): record_id, f_1 , f_2, f_3, ... , f_n, target 1, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ... , 1.2, output_A 1, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ... , 1.2, output_C 2, 0.3, 1.2, 0.5, ... , 2.1, output_A 3, 0.2, 3.2, 1.3, ... , 0.4, output_A 3, 0.2, 3.2, 1.3, ... , 0.4, output_B 4, 1.1, 0.1, 0.7, ... , 0.5, output_C 5, 2.1, 0.5, 0.8, ... , 1.9, output_B 5, 2.1, 0.5, 0.8, ... , 1.9, output_C 6, 0.5, 0.4, 0.2, ... , 0.8, output_A 6, 0.5, 0.4, 0.2, ... , 0.8, output_B 6, 0.5, 0.4, 0.2, ... , 0.8, output_C : : I use format_B to train a multi-class logistic regression model. The model then predicts the probability of each category, and I set my own threshold to decide the final outputs. While I have done the above, I am wondering would it possible to use format_A as the input of sklearn logistic regression with multi-class directly? Or is there any package/library actually takes format_A as input? Or any other kind of models actually more suitable for this type of problem? Thank you!
