Use single Convolution layer for the classification of two kinds of matrix?

I have two kinds of matrix with 10*10 size, and each number of matrix is 24000, all matrix forms like this: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 and I must classify them with a single convolution layer. the convolution kernel size is 5*5, the strides are 5*6, the final output is 2*1,the Neural network structure below: X_input = Input(shape=input_shape) X=Conv2D(1,kernel_size=(5,5),strides=(5,6),use_bias=None)(X_input) X=Activation('relu')(X) X=Flatten()(X) Y=Activation('softmax')(X) model=Model(inputs=X_input,outputs=Y,name="JSmodel") return model and the final accuarcy is 85.6%. However, I'm confused whether I design the neural network is accurate?
