There are a number of options out there, each with their own features and drawbacks. If you want to discuss your needs in more detail, I can touch on the specific attributes of each library as it relates to your project: ImageJ - http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/index.html -- Note that ImageJ is primarily a self-contained application. However, the underlying API is very easy to use in your own applications without having to invoke the GUI. Fiji - http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de/wiki/index.php/Main_Page -- This is ImageJ with a number of additional features. I have no personal experience with this library, but it looks promising. JAI - http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/javaee/jai-142803.html -- This is Sun's image processing Java offering. Limited in functionality, but it can be used as a basis for more powerful libraries. jMagick - http://www.jmagick.org/index.html -- This is just a Java wrapper around ImageMagick and uses JNI to interface with the ImageMagick API Apache Sanselan - http://commons.apache.org/imaging/ -- This library mostly does image IO, but it has a handful of features that can facilitate image analysis. JIU (Java Imaging Utilities) - http://sourceforge.net/projects/jiu/ -- A Java library for loading, editing, analyzing and saving pixel image files. Endrov - http://www.endrov.net/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page -- Endrov is a multi-purpose image analysis program. I get the impression that the underlying API is usable outside of the application, but it also seems that not everything is implemented in Java. I have no personal experience with this library and am only throwing it in because it seems to have a number of useful features.
