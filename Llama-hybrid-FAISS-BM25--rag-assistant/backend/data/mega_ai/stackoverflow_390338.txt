I'd recommend looking at Grails, it lets you become comfortable with all the java libraries and frameworks like Spring, SpringMVC, Hibernate, SiteMesh, and so on but gives you a much better DSL for web applications and much more concise code with the Groovy language (think of it as Java with dynamic typing, blocks, closures, and so on). If you'd rather stick to pure Java I'd recommend looking at the Stripes framework and the following book: http://pragprog.com/titles/fdstr/stripes
