How do you calculate a Poisson distribution for matched data?

I am trying to find the rate of infections with 2 different treatments and to see if there is any difference between them. I want to work out whether the rate of 'no infections' is different between the 2 treatments. Initially I checked the odds ratios and looked at conditional logistic regression to get the confidence intervals. The odds ratio of treatment A no infection is 0.70, and treatment B is 0.69 The confidence intervals on conditional logistic regression is 0.61 and 2.2 so they both lie within the confidence intervals - i.e. treatments are equivalent. I am told that I can use the Poisson distribution and see if there is a difference between them. $\hat{\lambda}$ for number of infections per person for treatment A is 0.39, and for treatment B is 0.34 This gives the Poisson distribution for less than 1 infection as 0.71 (confidence interval 0.68-0.74 calculated by $\hat\lambda \pm 1.96\sqrt{\hat\lambda}$ for treatment A and 0.67 (0.64-0.70) for treatment B. Is this a valid method for calculating rate ratios or do I have to take something else into account for matched pairs?
