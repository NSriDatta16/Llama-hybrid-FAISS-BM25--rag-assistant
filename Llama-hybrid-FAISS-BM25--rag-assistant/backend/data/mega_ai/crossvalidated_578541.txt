Perform Rose Method, then Logistic Regression and do k -fold cross validation

I have unbalanced data so I want to oversample obs from the minority class and then apply Logistic regression to the training set. After that, I would like to perform cross-validation. My question is: When should I separate the data into training and test? After oversampling? Any help will be appreciated.
