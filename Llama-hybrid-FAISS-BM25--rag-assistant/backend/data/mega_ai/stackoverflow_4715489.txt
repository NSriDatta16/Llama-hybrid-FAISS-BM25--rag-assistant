How to convert a ruby integer into a symbol

I have a Ruby array like this q_id = [1,2,3,4,5,...,100] I want to iterate through the array and convert into a hash like this { :1 => { #some hash} , :2 => { #another hash}, ... :100 => {#yet another hash} } What is the shortest and most elegant way to accomplish this? [EDIT : the to_s.to_sym while being handy is not how I want it. Apologies for not mentioning it earlier.]
