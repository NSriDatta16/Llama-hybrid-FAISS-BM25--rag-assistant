Django: Overriding the clean() method in forms - question about raising errors

I've been doing things like this in the clean method: if self.cleaned_data['type'].organized_by != self.cleaned_data['organized_by']: raise forms.ValidationError('The type and organization do not match.') if self.cleaned_data['start'] > self.cleaned_data['end']: raise forms.ValidationError('The start date cannot be later than the end date.') But then that means that the form can only raise one of these errors at a time. Is there a way for the form to raise both of these errors? EDIT #1 : Any solutions for the above are great, but would love something that would also work in a scenario like: if self.cleaned_data['type'].organized_by != self.cleaned_data['organized_by']: raise forms.ValidationError('The type and organization do not match.') if self.cleaned_data['start'] > self.cleaned_data['end']: raise forms.ValidationError('The start date cannot be later than the end date.') super(FooAddForm, self).clean() Where FooAddForm is a ModelForm and has unique constraints that might also cause errors. If anyone knows of something like that, that would be great...
