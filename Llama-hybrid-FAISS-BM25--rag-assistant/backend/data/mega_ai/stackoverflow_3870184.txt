because "CCT" is not valid as abbreviation. You could have checked that like this: NSTimeZone* destinationTimeZone = [NSTimeZone timeZoneWithName:@"Asia/Rangoon"]; NSLog(@"%@", [destinationTimeZone name]); NSLog(@"%@", [destinationTimeZone abbreviation]); this prints out: 2010-10-06 09:10:59.846 MyTest[39159:207] Asia/Rangoon 2010-10-06 09:10:59.892 MyTest[39159:207] GMT+06:30 see the discussion in the documentation for timeZoneWithAbbreviation: In general, you are discouraged from using abbreviations except for unique instances such as “UTC” or “GMT”. Time Zone abbreviations are not standardized and so a given abbreviation may have multiple meanings—for example, “EST” refers to Eastern Time in both the United States and Australia btw, you can get a NSDictionary with valid abbreviations with [NSTimeZone abbreviationDictionary]
