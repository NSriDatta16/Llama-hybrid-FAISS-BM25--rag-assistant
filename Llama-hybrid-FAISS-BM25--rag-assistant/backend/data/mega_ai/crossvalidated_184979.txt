You should treat values of same parameters as vectors. E. g. $values_1 = (3, 4, 5)$ and $values_2 = (8, 9, 2)$. The distance between dots that are represented by that vectors is the following: $$distance(values_1, values_2) = \sqrt{(3-8)^2 + (4-9)^2 + (5-2)^2} $$ And general formula: $$distance(u, v) = \sqrt{\sum_{i=0}^{dimensionsCount} (u_i - v_i)^2}$$ That works for any number of dimensions. As for timeseries, you could measure average distance between corresponding points, squaring is not required as long as you do not intend to penalize one big difference more than several smaller ones.
