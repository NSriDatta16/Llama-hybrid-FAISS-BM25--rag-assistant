How to set ReceiveBufferSize for UDPClient? or Does it make sense to set? C#

I am implementing a UDP data transfer thing. I have several questions about UDP buffer. I am using UDPClient to do the UDP send / receive. and my broadband bandwidth is 150KB/s (bytes/s, not bps ). I send out a 500B datagram out to 27 hosts 27 hosts send back 10KB datagram back if they receive. So, I should receive 27 responses, right? however, I only get averagely 8 - 12 instead. I then tried to reduce the size of the response down to 500B, yes, I receive all. A thought of mine is that if all 27 hosts send back 10KB response at almost same time, the incoming traffic will be 270KB/s (likely), that exceeds my incoming bandwidth so loss happens. Am I right? But I think even if the incoming traffic exceeds the bandwidth, is the Windows supposed to put the datagram in the buffer and wait for receive? I then suspect that maybe the ReceiveBufferSize of my UdpClient is too small? by default, it is 8092B?? I don't know whether I am all right at these points. Please give me some help.
