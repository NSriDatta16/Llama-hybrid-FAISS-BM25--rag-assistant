Showing that an autoregressive time series depends only on the most recent and future values

Suppose that I have an autoregressive time series model $x_1, x_2, ...$ where the mean is 0, autocorrelation 0.8, residual standard deviation of 1, and errors that are normal which are for all t: $$ x_t |x_{t-1}, x_{t-2}, ... \sim N(0.8 x_{t-1}, 1) $$ I would like to show that the distribution of $x_t$, given all other time points $t$, should depend only on $x_{t-1}$ and $x_{t+1}$. I have tried to condition backwards, but am unable to obtain the $x_{t+1}$. Does anyone have any hints for what approach I can take? Thanks!
