I'm not really competent to answer your specific questions about NNs and reinforcement learning, but I suspect that you're a bit optimistic about how these methods can solve all the problems by themselves. I can think of two options: As a binary classification problem The goal would be to predict whether $y$ is a correct arrangement of the furniture for $x$ (note that both $x$ and $y$ are provided as input features). The model has to be trained from a large training set which: is representative of the diverse possible options as input and output contains both positive and negative instances I would imagine that the main problem here is to build the training set. As an optimization problem The idea here would be to score how good an arrangement $y$ is for an input $x$ . An exhaustive or genetic search could be used to find the best $y$ for a particular $x$ by trying many possibilities. This requires: Formalizing the problem and the applicable constraints Designing an objective function which can reliably compare two arrangements $y_1$ and $y_2$ . Note that the last solution is the closest to your proposed solution: one way or another, you need to tell the system how to distinguish a good solution from a bad one.
