Where can I find a Javascript drawing canvas?

I want to build a drawing program in JS. (jQuery preferred but not mandatory). Anyway, my vision is a big, blank, white canvas with a simple grid. The user could drag "layers" to the grid (such as icons, pictures, etc). Also, it would support drawing curves, lines, boxes, etc. Think of Adobe Illustrator but much simpler. Honestly, it will be used to do database diagrams more than art (unless database diagrams are art to you...lol) Is there anything out there like that? Thanks
