Sorry, I don't know if this really answers your questions, but I find it very hard to understand your question. Normaly you would have a own test directory in your build process. If you use Eclipse or Netbeans as your IDE, you would have one folder for source (src) and one folder for the tests. We normaly create the same package names in both the test and the src folder. Most tool-chains pretty much force you to use this way of organizing your tests this way.
