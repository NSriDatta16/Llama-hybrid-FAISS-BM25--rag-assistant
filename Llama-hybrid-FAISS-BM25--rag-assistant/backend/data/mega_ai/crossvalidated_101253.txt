Starting Steps for building logistic regression model?

I have a categorical response variable. It is binary and represents the win or loss of a deal. Some of the independent variables used to predict the response are also categorical (like Geo, Region, and others...). These categorical variables have more than 3 categories. The rest of the variable are counts (like #face2face activities, #of CXO/VP meet, Business development activities). Should I use logistic regression to predict the response variable? If yes, please specify the steps needed to come up with the best model for prediction. How should I check the quality of the model, so as to decide which one is the best?
