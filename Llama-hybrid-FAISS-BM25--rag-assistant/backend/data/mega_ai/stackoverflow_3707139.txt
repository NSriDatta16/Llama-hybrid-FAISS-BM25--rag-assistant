Just realised I hadn't updated this. The cause of the whole issue was not related to jQuery at all, as an error was happening in the server code that was being "swallowed" by the AJAX response. I finally detected the error by opening the page in FireFox and using FireBug to see if any errors happened. This may seem obvious to some, but I was new to AJAX. But then I downloaded FireBug and saw that it was good... The jQuery was actually just (correctly) telling me that no results had been returned by the call. It didn't cross my mind that this might be because an error had been returned instead. The error in question was that I was using an HttpGet in an app upgraded to MVC 2, so got snagged by the new JsonRequestBehavior parameter , as in: return Json(IllnessDetailRepository.CascadedInfectiousAgent(Id), JsonRequestBehavior.AllowGet); This parameter didn't exist in MVC 1, and I was unaware of its adition to MVC 2. RTFM, as they say.
