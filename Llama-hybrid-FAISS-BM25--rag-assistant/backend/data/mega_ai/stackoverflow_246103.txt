If there is time, a tester should definitely go through a developers code. This way, you can improve your tests to get better coverage. So, maybe if you write your black box tests looking at the spec and think you have the time to execute all of those and will still be left with time, going through code cannot be a bad idea. Basically it all depends on how much time you have.. Another thing you can do to improve coverage is look at the developers design documents. Those should give you a good idea of what the code is going to look like... Testers have the advantage of being familiar with both the dev code and the test code!
