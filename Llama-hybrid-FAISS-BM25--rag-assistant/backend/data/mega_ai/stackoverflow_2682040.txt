Jquery - Move Div around

I am using Jquery Drag and drop to move divs across a page and this works perfectly. however what i would like is on each one of the div containers is to have a close button which when clicks removes the div from where it is and places it in a pre-defined div at the bottom like a widget gallery. How would this be accomplished? - below is my html.. thanks Chris Close Content In here
