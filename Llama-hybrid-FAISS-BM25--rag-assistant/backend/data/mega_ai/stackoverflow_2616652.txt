As Matti says you need the order by clause explicity to guarantee the ordering is returned correctly. When you have pending changes (ie uncommitted ones) you are the only one able to see them (generally...) this because they haven't been added to the data store where the other data is. Oracle maintains a separate list of pending changes which it uses to alter the results it it gets from the main data store. In your example the changing from this list happens to be returning in order, as there is very little data in the example Oracle presumably isn't needing to split the pending data in any way for optimise its storage. Once the data is committed it will go into the main database storage and be ordered in any number of possible ways depending on how the table and partition is set up. So in short, the data is coming from two different places before and after the commit, it just so happens they are returning in different orderings, but don't rely on them not always behaving like that.
