Exposing C# objects to Lua scripting

I'm looking into adding scripting to my C# application. I've been debating between Lua and C# (through CSharpCodeProvider). Regardless of which language I use, I need the script to be able to access/manipulate objects/arrays in my main application. With C# I should be able to expose my objects and interface functions without too many issues. However, with Lua it seems like I'll only be able to access the application objects through exposed functions. I can't see how I could have a non-chunky interface to, for example, arrays. I'd either need Array1Set(index, value)/Array1Get(index) functions or ArraySet(array_no, index, value)/.... Is there an elegant way to implement this? I don't want to copy the arrays to the Lua machine, manipulate it, then pull it back into my application. Thanks
