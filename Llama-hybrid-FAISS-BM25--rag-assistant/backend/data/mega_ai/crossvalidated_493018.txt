From the side of computational complexity Your sentence: Someone here said logarithms are too complicated to calculate, but I don't see how hard could it be, given that it is just a button on a calculator . And as said, log probabilities are more stable than multiplied/squared probabilities. is not accurate in terms of implementation and pragmatism of obtained methods to compute the final results in algorithms on the computer. You can find the complexity of computing logarithm and multiplication in this source . As you can see, the complexity of computing logarithm for an $n$ -digit number is $O(M(n) \log{n})$ (if using the arithmetic-geometric mean iteration method), which $M(n)$ is the complexity of multiplication method that has been used in the computing of the logarithm method. Hence, at least the logarithm method is slower than the multiplication method by a factor $\log{n}$ . Notice that it can be exacerbated when using multiple times in a computation like as you have mentioned.
