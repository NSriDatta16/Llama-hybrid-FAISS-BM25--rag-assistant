If I understand correctly, your overall aim is summarised in this paragraph: I do require such operations for creating const arrays of addresses of bits in bitband region of Cortex-M3. Is this a bug, or maybe that is some strange limitation of the C++ compiler? I use the Keil compiler for STM32, and one of the examples that comes with it contains macros for setting and clearing bit-banded bits: #define RAM_BASE 0x20000000 #define RAM_BB_BASE 0x22000000 #define Var_ResetBit_BB(VarAddr, BitNumber) \ (*(vu32 *) (RAM_BB_BASE | ((VarAddr - RAM_BASE) If these exactly aren't what you're looking for, I imagine they can be modified to suit your needs.
