Load HTML file to WebView with custom CSS

I have a WebView on my Android application which loads ( WebView.loadUrl() ) different local HTML files from phone's internal storage. I would like to include some custom css styles for them. Now, I could have my app edit every HTML file and add linking reference for the CSS file. I could also read the file contents, add the CSS linking and use WebView.loadData() to load it. But is it possible to do this a lot simpler and efficiently? Note: The HTML files are downloaded from a website. So editing them manually is not possible in this case, but once downloaded they can be edited via the app if necessary.
