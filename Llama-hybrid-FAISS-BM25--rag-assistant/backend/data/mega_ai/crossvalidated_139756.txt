Random Forest partial plot for a binary predictor

I'm not sure how to interpret a partial dependence plot for a categorical variable. For instance, the partial dependence (command partialPlot from the randomForest package) for a binary predictor would give two values, one for each category. How exactly do you interpret those values? The documentation of partialPlot is quite cryptic in this respect. My confusion arises, I guess because I'm thinking in terms of a logistic regression, where with a dummy coding system you in general obtain the log-odds of the variable of interest against the baseline category.
