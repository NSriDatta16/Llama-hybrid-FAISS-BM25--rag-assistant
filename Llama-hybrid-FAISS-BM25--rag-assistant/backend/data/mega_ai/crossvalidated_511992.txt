Is there some other method which can be used in my case? I am thinking of dealing with individual product's data seperately and convert it to a TS based on its start date. But I am not sure how to do that. It may be an old question, but you could still individually forecast each time series with the forecast package of rob hyndman, you already use. But you should encode the NAs with 0 and treat the time series as an intermittent demand time series. A Time series that is allowed to have zero values inbetween. For this you need only the MASE instead of MAPE, as the MASE can deal with 0 values https://robjhyndman.com/papers/mase.pdf In addition you could try a multiple equation approach for all sales data in your time series and treat it as VAR or VECM. The best packages for this are the vars package from Bernhard Pfaff: https://www.pfaffikus.de/rpacks/vars/ and the tsdyn package from Stigler for VECM Perhaps this answer also helps other people. Feel free to contact me, if you have any questions.
