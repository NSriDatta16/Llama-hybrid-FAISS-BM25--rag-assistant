UIScrollView freezes after using SetContentOffset or scrollRectToVisible

I have a UIScrollView with paging enabled and I want to be able to jump to pages further down the line rather then swiping through each one. I attempted to use both setContentOffset and scrollRectToVisible. They both scroll the view to the correct point but after scrolling animated or not the scrollview becomes frozen and unresponsive to any touches. I tried setting it to the first responder but it changed nothing. I have a button outside of the scroll view and it still functions fine after the setContentOffset. There are also buttons inside the scrollview and not only will the scrollview not respond to touch for dragging but the buttons will not recognize the touches either. [mainScroll setContentOffset:CGPointMake(mainScroll.frame.size.width*4, 0.0) animated:YES]; tldr; I can scroll through the view fine, through all the pages but when I try and call a setContentOffset or a scrollRectToVisible I get 'frozen' after the move.
