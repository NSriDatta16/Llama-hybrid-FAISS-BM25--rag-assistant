OpenBugs vs. JAGS

I am about to try out a BUGS style environment for estimating Bayesian models. Are there any important advantages to consider in choosing between OpenBugs or JAGS? Is one likely to replace the other in the foreseeable future? I will be using the chosen Gibbs Sampler with R. I don't have a specific application yet, but rather I am deciding which to intall and learn.
