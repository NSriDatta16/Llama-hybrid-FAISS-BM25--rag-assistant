The simplest thing you can do is: SELECT COUNT(LaunchDate) FROM MarketPlan WHERE LaunchDate > @date This will guarantee you index-only retrieval for any LaunchDate index. Also (this depends on your execution plan), I have seen instances (but not specific to SQL Server) in which > did a table scan and BETWEEN used an index. If you know the top date you might try WHERE LaunchDate BETWEEN @date AND > .
