Make IIS not render pages as WML. Ever!

Some background I'm currently working on a mobile site so I keep switching user agent all the time in Firefox with User Agent switcher (lovely addon). But when I go to the admin site it renders as WML , which makes Firefox all confused, so it tries to download it rather then showing the content. And this makes me frustrated (not falling down frustrated, but enough!). What I want! How can I make our admin site to ALWAYS send content as text/html instead of WML, regardless of request user-agent? I have full control of the box. It's IIS 6.0.
