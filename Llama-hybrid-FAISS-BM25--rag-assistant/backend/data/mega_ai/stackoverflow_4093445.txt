Getting WPF ETW events using XPerf.exe

I cannot figure out the correct combination of command line switches and parameters to feed to XPerf.exe to get it to load the WPF ETW provider ( Microsoft-Windows-WPF? a42c77db-874f-422e-9b44-6d89fe2bd3e5? E13B77A8-14B6-11DE-8069-001B212B5009}? ) and listen for a specific event (WClientInputMessage). Can anyone give any insight on how this should look? The scattered fragments of documentation (including http://windowsclient.net/wpf/white-papers/event-tracing-wpf.aspx ) and cryptic "xperf -help start" text appear to be a wasteland of any knowledge.
