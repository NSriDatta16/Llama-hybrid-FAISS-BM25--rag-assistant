Indeed, Cronbach alpha is equivalent to the average of all possible split-half estimates, hence it's not really necessary to report both indices, unless odd items and even items (or any other item splits) play a specific role. For instance, sometimes we assess the same item content but using two different wording, or a reverse scoring scheme, to check that subjects are not answering at random, or the polarity of the response options (e.g., 1 = strongly disagree ... 5 = strongly agree versus 1 = strongly agree ... 5 = strongly disagree) does not affect the average responses. Such scenario are really parallel form of the same questionnaire, for which split-half reliability makes sense.
