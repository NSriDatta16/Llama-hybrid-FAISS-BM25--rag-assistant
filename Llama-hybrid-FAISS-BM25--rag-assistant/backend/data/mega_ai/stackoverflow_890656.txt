Being RESTful is more than just having clean URLs. At an architectural level, REST is about organizing your application functionality in terms of resources , and exposing a fixed and uniform set of CRUD operations on them (e.g. HTTP POST/GET/PUT/DELETE methods). This is known as Resource Oriented Architecture . In contrast, with Service Oriented Architecture you typically organize application functionality in terms of processes or components, and expose non-uniform, application specific methods on them (e.g. via SOAP). Note, you can have clean URLs but still end up following non-RESTful SOA design principles. UPDATE: Sorry, didn't really answer the question, got hung up on use of "RESTful" terminology. If you're just talking about the benefits of clean URLs (REST/SOA argument aside), the typical argument is better SEO optimization and user-friendliness (user can better make sense of and modify URLs).
