How to safely store passwords with greasemonkey?

I wrote a Greasemonkey script, it prompts users to store login and password to avoid the need of re-enter it again and again. I know localStorage.setItem(); to store a key and a value, but the password will be stored as clear text. So, what is the best practice to store a password? Is there any API to store it in the browser ? I need to be able to revert the hash (if I need to hash) because the script implement autologin on a website, and I need the clear password to do so. Thanks by advance.
