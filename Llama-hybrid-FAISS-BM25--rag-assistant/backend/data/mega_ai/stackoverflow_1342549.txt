I think some "refactoring" is available. How about this? Sub pvaSetWeek(Optional weekOffset As Long = 0) Dim TheDateToday as byte, lngRangeBase as Long, lngRangeStart As Long, lngRangeEnd As Long TheDateToday = Weekday(Now, vbMonday) lngRangeBase = (weekOffset * 7) lngRangeStart = - ((theDayToday - 1) - lngRangeBase ) lngRangeEnd = (7 - theDayToday) - lngRangeBase 'Set start to Monday Range("pvaStartDate") = Int(Now) + lngRangeStart 'Set end to Sunday Range("pvaEndDate") = Int(Now) + lngRangeEnd End Sub
