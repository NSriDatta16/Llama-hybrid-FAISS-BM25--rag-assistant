Ok, I figured it out. First things first, I changed the relation between Film and HeaderItem to a OneToMany. Then I used Film.OrderedList("$ISNULL(HeaderItem.ShowOnTopInCategory, 0)-, Top10, MovieTitle"); to get a list of films order by headerItems first and then the rest. Works great. Btw, the $-sign in front of the ISNULL avoids the ISNULL from being replaced by the CoolStorage SQL parser.
