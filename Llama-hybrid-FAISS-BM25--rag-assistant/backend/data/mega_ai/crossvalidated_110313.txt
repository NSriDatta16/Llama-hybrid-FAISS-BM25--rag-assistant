This warning means that the data are separated, i.e. that these features are able to perfectly classify the response. This isn't intrinsically a bad thing, and many classification techniques have no problem with it, but logistic regression does not like it. This is because logistic regression uses the log odds which are defined as $$log\left(\frac{p(y = 1 | X = x)}{1-p(y = 1 | X = x)}\right).$$ Note how if either $p(y = 1 | X = x) = 1$ or $p(y = 1 | X = x) = 0$ then the log odds will be undefined. This is why that warning appears.
