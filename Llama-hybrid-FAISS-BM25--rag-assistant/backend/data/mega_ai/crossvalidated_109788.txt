They are not commonly used together, and care should be taken before combining them. Random forests are typically used as classifiers. The reason that you would use a random forest instead of another method (e.g. K-means clustering) is that you may have a large number of dimensions that you want to classify by. The issue with having the large number of dimensions is that if you wanted to test all combinations of dimension orders, you would have a large number of choices (it grows faster than the number of dimensions factorial). Random effects are typically used in regression with repeated measures of the same thing. They are commonly used in mixed effects models where the term mixed refers to both fixed and random effects. The fixed effects are thought to represent the parameters that you will see again (e.g. a drug or a person's age). The random effects are thought to represent an instance of variability around a parameter that you will not see again (e.g. a specific person). There are examples using them together when there is clustered data http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00949655.2012.741599 and http://www2.ims.nus.edu.sg/Programs/014swclass/files/denis.pdf . I'm unaware of any R packages that can do this analysis.
