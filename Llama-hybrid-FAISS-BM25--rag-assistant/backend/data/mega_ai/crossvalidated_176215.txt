It seems like you have so many outliers that only looking at the residuals after fitting with, say, ordinary least squares might be misleading---some sample points could have so high influence (or "leverage") that the fit is changed, maybe misleading, just to make the residuals corresponding to those high leverage points small. So you probably needs robust fitting methods! You can start by looking at the answers to How to optimize a regression by removing 10% "worst" data points? and maybe search this site for the robust tag: https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/robust
