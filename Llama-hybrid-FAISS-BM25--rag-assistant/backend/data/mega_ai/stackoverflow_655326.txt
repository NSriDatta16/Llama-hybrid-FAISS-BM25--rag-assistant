Clean way to reduce many TimeSpans into fewer, average TimeSpans?

I have a C# Queue containing 500 elements. I need to reduce those into 50 elements by taking groups of 10 TimeSpans and selecting their average. Is there a clean way to do this? I'm thinking LINQ will help, but I can't figure out a clean way. Any ideas?
