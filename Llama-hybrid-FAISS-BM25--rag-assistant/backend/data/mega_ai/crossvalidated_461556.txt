Alas, that is what statistics is all about. You need to do the formal hypothesis testing, as you could receive curve-balls when it comes to interpreting the median, mean - or mode - by eye. This looks like a great pattern for regression or ANOVA. I am reminded of the old statistics joke (one of the few): 9 bankrupt people are in a bar drowning their sorrows. A billionaire drops in and, presto! the average wealth is now $100 million each! Here the mean tells you nothing....
