In MA(q) the errors are treated like any other time series. Once you have fit your AR(1) model you have a time series of errors $\epsilon_{t}$, $\epsilon_{t-1}$, $\epsilon_{t-2}$...$\epsilon_{t-i}$. Parameters are selected for $\theta$ that best fit this time series of errors. Your MA(q) equation is: $\epsilon_{t+j}$ = β$_{0}$ +$\theta_{1}$ε$_{t+j-1}$+ ...+ $\theta_{q}$ε$_{t+j-q}$ Once $\theta$ is know then you can use the above equation to estimate future values of $\epsilon$. Each predicted value of $\epsilon$ for example the predicted value $\epsilon_{t+1}$ becomes the input for the next estimate $\epsilon_{t+2}$. It's similar to estimating future values of $Y$ using AR, the estimated value of $Y_{t+i}$ then becomes the input for estimating $Y_{t+i+1}$.
