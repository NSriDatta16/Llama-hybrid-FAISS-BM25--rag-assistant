In line with what Macro suggested I think the term you are looking for is a performance measure. Though it is not a safe way to asses predictive power, it is a very usefull way to compare the fitting quality of various models. An example measure would be the Mean Average Percentage Error, but more of them can easily be found. Suppose you use SetA with modelA to describe the number of holes in a road, and you use SetB and modelB to describe the number of people in a country, then of course you cannot say that one model is better than the other, but you can at least see which model provides a more accurate description.
