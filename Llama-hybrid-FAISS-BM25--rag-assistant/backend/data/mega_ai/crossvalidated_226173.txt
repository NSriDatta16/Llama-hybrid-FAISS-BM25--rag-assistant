Edited after comments In order to calculate corrected standard errors for the regression coefficients, I intend to use generalized least squares with correction for the autocorrelation in the residuals. Note that generalized least squares (GLS) would affect not only the standard errors but also the point estimates. Anyhow, you could gain power by estimating regression with an explicitly specified error structure, e.g. regression with ARMA errors as can be done using functions stats::arima or forecast::auto.arima in R. There you use maximum likelihood estimation instead of GLS. See related blog posts by Francis X. Diebold "The HAC Emperor has no Clothes" and "The HAC Emperor has no Clothes: Part 2" where he encourages explicit error specification as a way to get better coefficient estimates and gain predictive power. Although he discusses the case of HAC there, I believe similar conclusions apply here, too. But for the seasonality, I am not sure for which time series I should perform the differencing: If for raw original data (observations), or for the regression residuals. Since the problem arises due to a cyclic regressor, you could remove the deterministic component of the cyclic variable before including it in the model, or alternatively you could include some seasonal terms (dummies or Fourier terms) in the model. For the data, I could superimpose each cycle and take the mean, thus removing season effects, but this would alter the data, and also would generalize bad for other kinds of data. I am a little confused here, but I will try addressing this nevertheless. With regards to the regressor, you can adjust using a model, and so altering data is not really a problem because you keep track of how you did it and you can recreate the original variable if you need to. Regarding generalization, if the cyclic behaviour is unique for this instance, keeping it untreated would not help. If, on the other hand, it is similar across this instance and the ones you want to generalize to, you would not lose by removing the deterministic component before running the regression but then using it to adjust the other cases similarly. A technical note: If you are doing a regression with ARMA errors, then it is the error that gets differenced. If the errors is some SARIMA process, regular treatment of SARIMA models applies (roughly speaking, you do not have to worry that it is a regression error rather than raw data).
