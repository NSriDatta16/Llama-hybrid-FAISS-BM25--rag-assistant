I look at it pragmatically - I wouldn't bother unless you feel like you have jobs where performance is more important than programmer productivity. After 12 years of programming, I've never come across a job that should have been written in C, instead of a garbage collected language. But, your situation may vary. If all you knew was Java, then I would say yeah, it would be great.
