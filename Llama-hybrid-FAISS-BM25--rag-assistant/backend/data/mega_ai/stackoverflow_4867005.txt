Extracting only the css used in a specific page

Say you had a dynamically generated site that has been worked on by too many people, past and present, and you now have a collection of shared stylesheets that contain over 20,000 lines of CSS. It isn't organized at all, there are some class and id-based selectors but also way too many tag-based selectors. And then say you have 100 templates that use these styles, via some controller. Is there a tool, something that works like Firebug perhaps, that you can point at a url and it would determine all of the applicable CSS selectors for that page and dump them to a file? Basically some way to rip apart the shared stylesheets on a page by page basis.
