The correlation coefficient between time series is useless. See CORRELATION COEFFICIENT - Critical values for Testing Significance . This was first pointed out by U. Yule in 1926 Yule, G.U, 1926, "Why do we sometimes get nonsense correlations between time series? A study in sampling and the nature of time series", Journal of the Royal Statistical Society 89, 1â€“64 . You might want to google "why do we get nonsense correlation" for more. The reason for this is tests for correlation requite joint normality. Joint normality requires each series to be normal. Normality requires independence. To examine the relationship between time series please review Transfer Function Identification in any good time series book like Time Series Analysis: Univariate and Multivariate Methods, by William W.S. Wei, David P. Reilly . Challenge Answer In terms of an answer to your challenge. It is well known, by a few ( Yule, G.U, 1926 ) that correlating two time series can be flawed particularly if either series is affected by pulses/level shifts/seasonal pulses and/or local time trends. That being the case I would take each of the series SEPARATELY and identify the ARIMA structure and any pulses/level shifts/seasonal pulses and/or local time trends that might apply and create an error process. With two clean error processes, one for each of the two original series, I would compute the cross correlation which could then be used to measure the degree of association above and beyond the auto-correlative structure within each series. This solution is appropriately called the double pre-whitening approach.
