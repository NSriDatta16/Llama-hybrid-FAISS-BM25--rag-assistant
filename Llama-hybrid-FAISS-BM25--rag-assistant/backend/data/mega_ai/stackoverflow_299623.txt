"interface" a should not be a keyword in C nor ISO C++. It is a keyword in the Managed Extensions for C++, so, I guess, somewhere in your configuration you are still telling it to create code for .NET. Make sure everywhere is set to "Native Code" However, it's quite possible that you CANNOT set it to Native Code in the Express edition --- That's just a guess, but it reasonable considering MS positioning of the Express/Standard/Pro editions. UPDATE: Disregard that last paragraph. MSFT insists that you can create native Win32 apps with VisualC++ Express: http://www.microsoft.com/express/vc/
