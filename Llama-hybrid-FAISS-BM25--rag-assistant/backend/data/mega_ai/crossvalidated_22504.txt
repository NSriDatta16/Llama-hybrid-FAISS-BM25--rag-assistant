What can one tell a school kid about statistics and machine learning?

Next week we have an intern from a local school in the house. The concept behind his short internship is to get an idea how the real world works and what certain jobs deal with, how the daily work looks like etc. Now I wondered, what one can tell/show/demonstrate such a young kid about Statistics and Machine Learning so that he/she gets the basic idea of this areas is getting enthusiastic (assuming that the kid's prior is not too heavily weighted in favor of other interests) wont forget about it the next day I am primarily looking for sticking images, examples for demonstration etc.. The kid's background: 15-16 years old basic math concepts are known (what is a graph, rule of three, what is a variable (mathematically, not statistically speaking)) Since the hard part of this question is to explain your area to one without any background knowledge, this question might as well serve as reference for chats with relatives and friends. Sidenote: I skipped the description of my job intentionally, so that this question is not too specific, this question is about the topic of this site in general.
