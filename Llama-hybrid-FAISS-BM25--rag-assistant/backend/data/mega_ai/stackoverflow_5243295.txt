I think the issue is that there are two draggables right on top of each other (the outer ul and the inner li ). If you add a handle to the outer ul such that it only can drag when on the p.test-category it seems to fix the problem. I added some CSS so that it is easier to see the tree but it works without it as well. http://jsfiddle.net/GDUpa/7/
