Reading specific content from a web page?

I am trying to make an app (in C#) in which I have to get some meanings from a website like wiktionary.com or dictionary.com. But I have never used Xml or worked with web pages at all. I managed to get the response from the webpage (e.g from dictionary.com for a specific word) (which I hope is the xml format). This is what I got for the word 'Hello'.: Hello | Define Hello at Dictionary.com Now I want to parse the following string out of the response. used to express a greeting, answer a telephone, or attract attention. I tried using XmlReader but got stuck. Can somebody please help me read this content?
