Raising average: organic approach vs outlier

I'm having trouble articulating a statistics concept concerning averages. As far as I know, there are two ways to raise the average: observation by observation (imagine adding +1 to all observations) outlier I'm not so interested in the latter; a freak occurrence, or outlier that raises the average. So I want to say that I'm only interested in the former: observation by observation. For better or worse, I have coined my own word for this: "organic." My rationale coming from the dictionary definition: as elements of a an organized whole Question: Is there an existing term for what I'm trying to articulate? If not, is there a more conventional phrase than "organically"? In other words, I don't want to increase the average from a sparse, infrequent occurrence (a big outlier), but rather from nearly all observations increase to make the average higher. Numerical Example Suppose we start with a sample that has an average of 5. [5,5,5] Then I say to someone, please increase the average of the sample such that it reaches 100. He/she could show me either of the following: [97, 100, 103] [5, 5, 270] These samples have the same average, but have very different ranges. What can I say to imply I only want to raise all values somewhat equally, as in the [97,100,103] example. The best I can do is: Please increase the sample average without using an outlier. Please increase the sample average while keeping the range within 3 (or some value) Neither of which sound particularly refined. I'm hoping there is a better term out there. Context Example 1 The situation is business intelligence. After examining the data, I want to give advice to someone -- I want to tell them to increase the average of a certain metric. Here is a simple example: Imagine a principal says to the teachers of a school: "Increase the average test scores of the students" but he also wants to be more specific so that the teachers don't do something crazy like give one student a 4000% on a test and everyone else 2% or something. Example 2 I think the first example is fairly clear, but there is still the issue of whether A) the teachers are being told to mark more or less generously or B) if it's the teaching methods the teachers enact to help students perform better. That brings me to example 2. I tried to find a more poignant example: Let's say there is a fictional policy that requires the mayor or a real estate mogul to increase the average household income of a neighborhood or it will be demolished. Ethics aside, there are two ways of dealing with this, just like in my earlier examples: We could offer subsidies to everyone in the neighborhood, UBI style or help them get better jobs in the market We could entice a certain Bill Gates to move in to the neighborhood. Both comply with the fictional policy, but in starkly different ways. Conclusion I did not intend to labor the point so much, but please bear with me. It is very difficult for me to articulate this point, but I hope after these examples you will see why it's important for me to find the correct statistical terminology to bring to light the distinction in how an averages metric is addressed.
