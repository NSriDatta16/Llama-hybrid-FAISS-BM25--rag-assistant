The actor network should be used for the test/validation phase since the the actor weights get optimized both in the critic and the actor loss (see of course [1]). It is also true that at the end of the training there is no a huge difference between the actor and target actor because of the slow update. [1] Lillicrap, Timothy P., et al.
