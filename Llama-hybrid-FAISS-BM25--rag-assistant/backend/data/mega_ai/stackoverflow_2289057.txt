It looks like Uwe managed to solve your problem. I should just state for the record that it is possible to add new class types at runtime. Classes are defined by their class reference, which is a pointer to a VMT (Virtual Method Table), and if you know how VMTs are laid out you can create one of your own. I did a session on it at CodeRage last year. Unfortunately, the audio quality sucked. :( Of course, this isn't much use to you unless you have to create classes whose definition is not available at compile time, for example if you're using a scripting engine. When all the information you need is available at compile time, go with something like what Uwe described.
