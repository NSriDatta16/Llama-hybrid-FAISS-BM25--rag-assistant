The pyimagesearch face recognition implementation used knn classifier to recognise the faces. I have worked with both svm and knn classifiers, from my experience you can do a couple of thinks to improve the face recognition performance. 1. use svm with higher C value (1 to 10) over knn classifier. 2. Maintain relatively equal number of images in all classes
