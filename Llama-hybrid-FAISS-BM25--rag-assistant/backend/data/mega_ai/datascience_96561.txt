I can think of a couple options to collect a sample of medical institutions: Wikipedia has a list of hospitals by country (isn't Wikipedia amazing?) Many countries have some kind of national directory of medical institutions, but that would probably be difficult to scrap and specific to each country. UMLS has a category ("semantic group") for "Health Care Related Organization" (T093, see here ), which means that a list of such organizations can be directly collected from the UMLS data. I thought this would be a good option, but I did a quick test and it appears to contain only names of departments, no proper nouns, for example: Community occupational therapy clinic Abortion Center Area Health Education Center Given that UMLS is closely related to PubMed, my guess is that it's not a very good direction, but maybe I didn't dig deep enough. Fair warning: Processing the whole PubMed/PMC is quite a lot of work in my experience.
