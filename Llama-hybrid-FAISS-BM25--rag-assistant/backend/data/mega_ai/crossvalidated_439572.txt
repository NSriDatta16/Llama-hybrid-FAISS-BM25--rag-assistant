How do you forecast a time series that is inherently uncertain?

Most time series forecasting models take in fixed (so presumably deterministic) historical values, and then output either: A point (usually mean) forecast + forecast intervals, so $\hat{Y}_{t+1} = f_m(Y_t,...Y_{t_n})$ and and upper and lower intervals $\sigma^{U/L}_{t+1} = f_{\sigma^{U/L}}(Y_t,...Y_{t-n})$ . A quantile forecast: $\hat{Q}^{p}_{t+1} = f_p(Y_t,...Y_{t-n})$ with $p \in [0,0.99] $ . Or a full probability density forecast: $P(\hat{Y}_{t+1}) = f_\theta(Y_t,...Y_{t-n})$ . (the density could be parametric or non parametric) I have a situation where the input time series itself is uncertain, due to complications in the measurement process for the metric involved. My questions: Are there any time series models that allow for uncertain or probabilistic inputs? Presumably one could put together a monstrous LSTM that takes densities as inputs and densities as outputs, or represent the inputs as vectors of quantiles and then do something like VAR - but that seems like overkill, I'm hoping for something more elegant, but if not, are these approaches valid?
