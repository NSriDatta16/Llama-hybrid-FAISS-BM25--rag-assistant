In general, I think you'll see everyone's slogan as an image rather than text (with the text as the alt attribute). And href="#" means "go to the top of this page." It should probably be a link to the home page instead. ...As long as you use alt, search engines will index it properly. If this is the home page, that might justify having the name and slogan in h1 and h2 elements, but elsewhere it's probably not necessary. It's probably better to drive traffic based on the actual content of the page and not try to make every page the same in the eyes of search engine spiders. The company name is probably already in the url, which is plenty.
