Modelling and finding the relationship in nonlinear dataset

I have two datasets: 1. First one is daily data about phone calls to customers. 2. Second one is daily data about customer logins on our website. So I would like to see how do phone calls to customers affect number of times they login on our website and view products. Realistically once a call is made the customer will often not login straight away, but there could be a lag. How should I approach this to try and find out the relationship between the two variables? Regression and such linear tools do not seem to work in this case, considering a lag exists. Would perhaps machine learning be any useful here?
