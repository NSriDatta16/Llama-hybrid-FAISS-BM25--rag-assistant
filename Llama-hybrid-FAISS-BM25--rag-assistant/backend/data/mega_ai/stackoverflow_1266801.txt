You can't "put" a socket servlet on a webserver, unless they have Java Server installed. Since this is hard to organize with most external webhosts, you'd have to instead configure your webserver to open a socket connection on a specified port number, I believe. So later you should be able to contact the sever on a specified port, using its IP address or domain name. Like: 100.200.300.400:965 or mysubdomain.mydomain.com:965
