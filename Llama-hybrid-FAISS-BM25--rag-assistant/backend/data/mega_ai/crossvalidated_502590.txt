Expected Improvement formula for Bayesian Optimisation

The expected improvement on how to choose a next point $x$ for evaluation is to choose the point such that $$arg\,max_{x}E[f(x) - f^{max}]$$ where $f(x)$ denotes the gaussian process posterior distribution at location $x$ and $f^{max}$ denotes the current maximal point from the gaussian process. Since $f(x)$ is random and $f^{max}$ is fixed, the above equation can be reduced to $$ \begin{aligned} EI(x) &= arg\,max_xE[f(x)] - f^{max}\\ &= arg\,max_x \mu(x) - f^{max} \end{aligned}$$ $\mu(x)$ is the posterior mean of the gausisan process which can be analytically derived. However, in this other stack exchange post , the EI is developed somewhat more complexly and I do not really understand the derivation behind it. Is my understanding of EI that I have mentioned above wrong ? or Am i missing something
