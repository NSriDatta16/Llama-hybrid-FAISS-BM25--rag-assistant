Triggering jquery event function at page load

Here's a little jQuery function that does what I want when a checkbox is clicked, but I have a basic gap in my knowledge: How to register this so that it deals with checkboxes that are already clicked when the page loads? ( Edit: Sorry, to those who already answered the question, but i've edited this to make it more clear) $(document).ready(function() { $('fieldset input:checkbox').click(function() { if ($(this).attr('name') == 'foo') { if ($(this).attr('checked')) { // hide checkbox 'bar' } else { // show checkbox 'bar' } } } }); If I use .trigger('click'), it clicks (or unclicks) all the boxes on page load. I can think of a few ways to do this that would involve repeating portions of the code, but I just know that jQuery already has an elegant answer for this...
