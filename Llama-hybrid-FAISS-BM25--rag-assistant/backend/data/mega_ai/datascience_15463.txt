What are the practical differences between pooling types at convolution?

I could find max-pooling in most -- actually, exactly all -- concrete CNN implementations I've seen. However, I see that there are several other kinds (min, average, global average pooling, etc.) but I cannot see what they differ on and what would be the best criteria to select them at application. Has anyone a clue? I have learned that pooling is a sort of downsampling where we can preserve the locations of the original image that showed the strongest correlation to the specific features we searching for. So far, so reasonable. But what is the point of finding the weakest correlations with min pooling, for example?
