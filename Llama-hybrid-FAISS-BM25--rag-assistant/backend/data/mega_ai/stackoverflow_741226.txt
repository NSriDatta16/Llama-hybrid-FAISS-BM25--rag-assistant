jQuery: draggable connect to sortable. draggable item has a different DOM from sortable list

I am now able to drag an item to a sortable. But the sortable list has a different DOM. DRAG THIS A DRAG THIS B This is a new DOM dragged from "DRAG THIS A" This is a new DOM dragged from "DRAG THIS B" $(document).ready(function() { $('.draggable_text > li').draggable({ //helper:'clone', helper: function(event, ui) { return ' xxx '; }, connectToSortable:'#stagerows' }); $('#stagerows').sortable({ handle: '.drag_handle' }); }); The Helper has this: xxx This should be dropped into the sortable... The "helper" works. But when I "dropped" the item into the sortable, it just reverts back to the "original" DOM. I would want the "newly created DOM" (the one created in helper) to be dropped into the sortable. I hope I am making sense. Thank you! Another way of saying it: when I drag an apple, it now turns into an orange. but when i drop it, it turns back into an apple..
