How can I visualize the likelihood in Bayesian model averaging?

I have a question regarding Bayesian model averaging (BMA). Let M be a set of models 1...K. D are the data. Then the posterior probability of the Kth model has a following form: $$ P(M_{K}|D) = \frac{P(D|M_{K}) \cdot P(M_{K})}{P(D)} $$ I dont understand, how can I imagine the likelihood $P(D|M_{K})$ . I know that the likelihood can be expressed as $$ P(D|M_{K}) = \int P(D| \theta_{K} ; M_{K}) \cdot P( \theta_{K} | M_{K}) d \theta_{K} $$ where $\theta$ is the set of models parameters. I understand this as an intersect of the likelihood of the data and the K-th model. Like this: Whre X-axis stands for data points from D and Y-axis is the likelihood. Am I correct? Thanks a lot for explaining.
