Predicting Ingredients amount for getting color

I have a dataset of different colors and the ingredients (with amount in grams) that was used to make that color My intention is to build an ML model that would take the color values (eg. RGB/LAB) as input and gives me the amount of each ingredients that would be needed to mix and get that color. Some of the ingredients can have 0 values indicating that they were not used to make that color. My input (L, A and B) are the only features I have for now and there are about 2,000 observations. Example dataset is below: I am a beginner and finding my way into machine learning. Please suggest what algorithm would best fit my purpose.
