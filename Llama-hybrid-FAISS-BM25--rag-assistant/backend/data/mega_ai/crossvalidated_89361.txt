Modeling binary outcomes - inaccurate model when using logistic regression?

I am trying to model the probability of a binary outcome with the independent variable being an hour variable. I understand that linear regression is not the correct method for this type of task (I wont go into my simplified understanding of why, if someone wants to add a succinct explanation I'm all for it). The problem I am running into is that logistic regression does not seem to accurately capture the trend in my data, which is inverse parabolic (low probability early, increasing to a peak at the middle of day and decreasing at the end). My test data is as follows, I just supplied the ggplot and stat_smooth() curve I am looking at vs. the model itself: testset Notice that is I allow the stat_smooth function to default to a fitting/smoothing method (loess in this case), the representation is closer to the actual data. I know I am missing something terribly simple, or misunderstanding something in a silly way, but that is why I am asking the question, search didn't help. ggplot(data=testset,aes(hour,data))+stat_smooth()
