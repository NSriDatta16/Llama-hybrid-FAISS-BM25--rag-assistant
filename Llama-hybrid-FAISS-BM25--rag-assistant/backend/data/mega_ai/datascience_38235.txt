Meta variables are meta data , data about data, not used for statistical inference. Features or variables or attributes are the measured inputs of the problem domain, the independent variables . The target variable is the dependent variable or the measure we're trying to model or forecast. Not all problems can be or need to be formulated in such a way. Orange was traditionally designed to accommodate machine learning workflows, hence the naming.
