Firing a click event with Prototype

currently working on magento and managed to remove certain sections from the check out process that are not needed. Anyway the last section I want to remove is the order review so essentaly instead of Billing Address > Review > Comfirmation. I just want Billing > Comfirmation. Anyway with in JS I can do this? My current idea is to assign a id to the finaly submit button. select element and click it once on the review stage atomatically by js. at moment i modifyed the gotosection code and added. if(orig == 'review'){ $('reviewButton').click(); } In prototype how do i select a element and use .click() method on it please.
