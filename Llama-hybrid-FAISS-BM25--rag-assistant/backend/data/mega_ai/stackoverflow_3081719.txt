in C# is there a way, in the debugger, to suppress a exception from breaking into the debugger?

I'm using VS2010 in C# there is a place in my code where an exception is thrown and properly handled. the problem is that I'd like to configure the debugger to break on all exceptions, handled or not - all exceptions but this one. My goal is to see all the thrown exceptions in the debugger, but this one exception is driving me bonkers as it hits somewhat often I'd love some kind of #pragma trick?
