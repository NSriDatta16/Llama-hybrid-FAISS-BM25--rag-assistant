Confidence Intervals with Propagation of Uncertainty

Lets say I'm trying to make a measurement of the area, $A$ of an object imaged in a large number of noisy gray-scale image, and I want to include uncertainty quantification to some confidence interval,$X$, $\delta_{CI:\ X}A$. I'm choosing to measure the area using the formula $A = \mu_L\times \mu_H$ where $L$ is the length and $H$ is the height. The uncertainty in the height and length are $\delta_{CI:\ 0.95}L$ and $\delta_{CI:\ 0.95}H$ assuming they are each normally distributed and independent. I can calculate the propagation of uncertainty and write it as the equation: $$ \delta_{CI:\ X}A =\sqrt{ \mu_H^2\delta_{CI:\ 0.95}L^2 + \mu_L^2\delta_{CI:\ 0.95}H^2}$$ so now I have the uncertainty of $A$ in terms of $H$, $L$, $\delta_{CI:\ 0.95}L$, and $\delta_{CI:\ 0.95}H$. It is my understanding that $\delta_{CI:\ 0.95}H$ means that I am 95% confident the average lies within $\pm \delta_{CI:\ 0.95}H$ of $\mu_H$ and the same is true for $L$. So if I am 95% certain in $\mu_L$, and 95% certain in $\mu_H$ am I 95% certain in $A$? or if I'm 95% confident in each am I instead 90.25% confident (95%^2 = 90.25%) or should I be 99.75% confident (100 - (100-95%)^2 = 99.75%)? These other options make sense because I've heard the 95% confidence interval described as the expect range of variation in the mean 95% of the time with more sampling. I'm trying to find out if the confidence level propagates and if it does, how does it change?
