I agree with robbisg, distance to the margin is a poor predictor of probability. Scikit-Learn implements probability estimates for SVM by averaging 5-fold CV. This is a nice general strategy. With all probability estimators of classification you should study the receiver operating characteristic. Scalar classification metrics are notorious for masking how the algorithm is actually performing. This may lead you to consider weighting unbalanced data or calibrating probability estimates with logit.
