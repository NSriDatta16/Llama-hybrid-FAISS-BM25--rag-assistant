A long time ago, I built a mini-SharePoint, which would compress incoming files using a zip library, and store the bytes in a varbinary(max) column. Since the spec called for metadata as opposed to actual file contents, I didn't have to worry about Full Text Search. You could achieve the same thing with CLR now. Pitfalls would be the CPU load during decompression of data for indexing during the search, but CPUs are fast now. Option two? Buy more storage.
