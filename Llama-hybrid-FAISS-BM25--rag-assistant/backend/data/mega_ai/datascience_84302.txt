Data should be standardized for calculating principal components. If data is standardized before aggregating by country, the resultant data after aggregation will no longer will have mean 0 and standard deviation 1, hence, the results of PCA will be erroneous. Therefore, data should be aggregated and then standardized in order to obtain correct principal components of the data.
