How to convince an organization to use NHibernate?

I know it's not a "programming" question per-se, but come on guys - give me a break here... I'm working at a large scaled, really slow organization. We recently started a process to decide on a new ORM technology. After looking in various forums, and test-programming with NHibernate, I think it's awesome. Only problem is, I know that when I'll say that Entity-Framework is from Microsoft, it will be really hard to convince my management to go in a different direction. Any suggestions?
