identify data type of column from table using NER models

I have structure data with csv or parquet format, I would like to extract the data type of the column by analyzing the data. when I looked at the NER from Hugging phase transformers, it actually dealing with context, but here my data is tabular format. is there any way to extract data type of the each column by analyzing the data, actually volume of the data is so big (GB's), please suggest best solution for this.
