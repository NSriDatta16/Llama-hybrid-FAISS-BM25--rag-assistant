When should I use Oracle's Index Organized Table? Or, when shouldn't I?

Index Organized Tables (IOTs) are tables stored in an index structure. Whereas a table stored in a heap is unorganized, data in an IOT is stored and sorted by primary key (the data is the index). IOTs behave just like “regular” tables, and you use the same SQL to access them. Every table in a proper relational database is supposed to have a primary key... If every table in my database has a primary key, should I always use an index organized table? I'm guessing the answer is no, so when is an index organized table not the best choice?
