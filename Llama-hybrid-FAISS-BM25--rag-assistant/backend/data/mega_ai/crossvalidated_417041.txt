Multilevel TimeSeries modelling in Python

At work I have been asked to model using Time Series data and I am not very familiar with time series(haven't done end to end project). Now the problem at hand is to understand company's price position with respect to the market and other economic variables. We had a simple model log(Applications) ~ log(Price Relative to Market) , this gave us a coefficient value which was used previously in an optimisation tool. We now want to bring a more sophisticated approach to this, as we know that its not only Relative market price but many other variables that will effect this relationship. i.e. log(Applications) ~ log(Price Relative to Market)+ Others... Also we want to segment this at various levels. for e.g. we might differentiate our price by some features of a customer's profile. This could mean having to model various models but the problem then is how do you manage and explain so many of them? This could be a potential solution I thought ( https://otexts.com/fpp2/hts.html ) However, I am looking for something in Python i.e. not only solves the problem but also helps to code within a language and an environment at work. Any help or guidance will be highly appreciated.
