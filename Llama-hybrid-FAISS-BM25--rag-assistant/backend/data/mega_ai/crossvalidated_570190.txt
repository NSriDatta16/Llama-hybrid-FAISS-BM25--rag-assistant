For option 2, here are a couple of methods you could try, based on time series distance measurements, to find the best index position ( $i$ ) in Series_1 $S1$ to match to Series_2[0] ( $S2$ ). The idea behind them is that if we can find the best alignment between the two series, then the offset between the start of $S1$ and $S2$ is your appropriate index value. For ease of explanation, I'll assume your time series are the same length ( $N$ ), but it shouldn't be too difficult to adapt these methods if they are different lengths. I'll also assume that $S1$ starts at a higher voltage than $S2$ (as in your example). I'll use the notation $S_{(j,k)}$ to indicate the sub-series of $S$ $S_{(j,k)}=[S[j], S[j+1], ..., S[k]]$ : For each $j , calculate $D_j=E(S1_{(j,N-1)},S2_{(0,N-j-1)})/(N-j)$ , where $E$ is the Euclidean distance between $S1_{(j,N-1)}$ and $S2_{(0,N-j)}$ , then set $i$ to the $j$ with the minimum value for $D_j$ . Use dynamic time warping (DTW) to find the best alignment between $S1$ and $S2$ ), then set $i$ to be the maximum $j\backepsilon S2[0]\rightarrow S1[j]$ (in other words, the index $i$ is the index of the last point in $S1$ that maps to $S2[0]$ ). If you are not familiar with DTW, it's a way of calculating the distance between two time series by "warping" one or both time series to find the best alignment - it allows a many:many mapping between the time points in the two series (while preserving the ordering), and is often a better way of calculating the distance between two time series than the Euclidean distance if the time series are misaligned. A couple of references for DTW are: Berndt and Clifford, 1994,Using dynamic time warping to find patterns in time series Keogh and Ratanamahatana, 2005, Exact indexing of dynamic time warping . Section 2.1 provides a nice description of DTW.
