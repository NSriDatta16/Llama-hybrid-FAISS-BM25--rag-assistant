R Cook's distance vs leverage/(1-leverage) plot

One of the R plots for a diagnostic of linear model lm() is a plot Cook's distance vs. $\dfrac{h_{ii}}{1 - h_{ii}}$ . My question is: why don't we plot Cook distance against $h_{ii}$ ? What's the gain from $\dfrac{h_{ii}}{1 - h_{ii}}$ ? Obviously it is a monotonic transformation $[0,1) \mapsto [0, +\infty)$ .
