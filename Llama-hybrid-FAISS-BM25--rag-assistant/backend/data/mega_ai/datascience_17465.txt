Variable length unordered inputs for a deep neural network

I have a function $f(x_1, x_2) = Y$ and the goal would be a user gives me a variable list of Y's where each Y was generated from the same constant $x_2$ parameter but $x_1$ varies. I want my program to give my best guess of $x_2$. I'd like to try and train a deep neural network to do this. A few problems is that the order of Y that the user can give me will be random and the number of Y's will vary as well. I'd hope the more Y's they gave me the more accurate my prediction of what $x_2$ would be is. I'm not quite sure how to setup a model where it's unordered with variable length inputs. Example $f(x_1, x_2) = x_1 \cdot x_2 + noise$ where $x_1$ and $x_2$ are $\in \mathbb{R}^3$ $x_2$ is unknown and I'm giving lots of examples where $x_2$ is fixed but $x_1$ varies I don't know what $x_1$ is but I observe the output $f(x_1, x_2)$ I can train the neural network with synthesized data I'd imagine if the user gave more observations I'd get a more accurate response
