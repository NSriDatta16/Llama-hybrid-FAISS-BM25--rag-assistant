A workflow management system pushes users through a process that hops across more than one function within a system and potentially more than one participant in the workflow. The workflow engine knows about the state of the process, and stashes this in its own storage, which may or may not be a part of the main application database. Workflows can be modelled using state machines , petri nets or various other constructs , including plain old scripting languages. An independent orchestration system can be used to manage workflows across multiple applications. Many (but not all) support BPEL (Business Process Execution Language) as a standard description language for workflows. If your applications are set up as a service-oriented architecture the workflow system can control the application functionality to do this. The other feature of a workflow engine is that it should be possible to abort the workflow and undo any state changes while maintaining database consistency . www.workflowpatterns.com has a collection of documents about workflow systems, along with a library of patterns. Examples of applications for workflow systems: Insurance Claims Administration. Essentially the grand-daddy of them all. Typically this process will have rules covering who can authorise how much, who can process claims on different classes of business, what documents need to be present and linked to provide an audit trail, issuing and tracking the issue of payments and authorising loss-adjustment work. A typical claims workflow would track a claim from notification to authorisation of reserves and payments, through to issuing the payment, with side-processes for arranging loss-adjustment work (possibly through third parties), holding payment authority until this is finished and issuing and paying loss-adjusting expenses. In practice, these processes can get quite complicated. Ordering, quoting and configuration management of a complex product such as a computer system. One unusual example was a system developed by a pharmaceutical manufacturer that tracked the approval process for a new pharmaceutical product. This also incorporated an expert system that had the regulatory framework coded in it and could pick a shortest path through the regulatory hoops. This dropped their average R&D life-cycle time to market from 9 years to 5.5 years.
