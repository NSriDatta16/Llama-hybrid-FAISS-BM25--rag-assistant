A model for recognizing suspicious user activity on a forum

I have a log of user actions on my website. Some users were blocked for spamming manually. This is also shown in the log. Here is an example of the dataset: 11a|mike|comment 1pm|josh|comment 1pm|andy|comment 1pm|andy|comment 1pm|josh|comment 1pm|andy|comment 1pm|mike|comment 2pm|andy|comment 2pm|andy|comment 2pm|andy|comment 2pm|andy|comment 2pm|andy|comment 2pm|andy|comment 2pm|andy|get_block I need to automate the process based on the data I already have. What method can I use to solve this problem (time series, survival analysis, etc.)? Which Python framework is designed to solve such problems? Thanks
