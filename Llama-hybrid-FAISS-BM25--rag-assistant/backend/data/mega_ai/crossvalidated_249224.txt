My question is about the possibility of showing equivalence between the hazard rate, the conditional probability (of failure) and a likelihood function. TLDR; There is no such equivalence. Likelihood is defined as $$ \mathcal{L}(\theta \mid x_1,\dots,x_n) = \prod_{i=1}^n f_\theta(x_i) $$ so it is a product of probability density functions evaluated at $x_i$ points, given some fixed value of parameter $\theta$. So it has nothing to do with hazard rate, since hazard rate is probability density function evaluated at $x_i$ point parametrized by $\theta$, divided by survival function evaluated at $x_i$ parametrized by $\theta$ $$ h(x_i) = \frac{f_\theta(x_i)}{1-F_\theta(x_i)} $$ Moreover, likelihood is not a probability and it is not a conditional probability . It is a conditional probability only in Bayesian understanding of likelihood, i.e. if you assume that $\theta$ is a random variable. Your understanding of conditional probability also seems to be wrong: Intuitively, all conditional probabilities are purely multiplicative processes. [...] Is it generally true, that if all conditional probablities are purely multiplicative processes of numbers between one and zero, they all decrease with some exponential rate $\lambda$? The answer is no. Conditional probability is a relation between joint and individual probabilities $$ P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} $$ So it is not a process, and it is not multiplicative. Moreover, multiplicative relation is a definition of independence $$ P(A \cap B) = P(A)\,P(B) $$ or equivalently $$ P(A \mid B) = P(A) $$ Even if you are talking about a random process, then this is not true. To give an example, imagine a series of coin tosses, if they are independent, then probability of tossing head given that previous toss resulted in tails is simply a (unconditional) probability of tossing head.
