Actionscript folder system

Getting a bit stuck here on the idea... I'm trying to create a flash card game / study material program where users are able to load lists of questions/answers. I want to organize the lists in a folder-like system. I imagine folders as arrays and the lists of questions and answers as text files. My problem is that I know that with a single array, I can dynamically create an infinite amount of arrays... but how do I write data to the last array in the line? The idea is that the USER creates their own organization (dynamic, for different classes, subjects, etc) I thought about something like myArray[i][j][k][l] but I don't know how to make it dynamic, such as if it was like myArray[3][4] has no subclasses or child arrays, or if [l] had 20 more subclasses/child arrays. I was thinking about writing a function that has a loop that calls itself if there are children, but, I don't know how to make said unique for [i], [j], [k], etc. Sorry if the information is a bit underwhelming, but I'm not sure how to express any more information.
