As one request is used to get one web page, could we call to these controllers "page controllers"? Why would you? They're named controllers. After all, an action on a controller doesn't neccessarily serve a "web page", it might respond using JSON data, XML, RSS or only a part of a web page (a 'control' if you want). If a widget represent a classic asp.net webcontrol or usercontrol, and i want to render this widget in a lot of pages, how could avoid repeat the logic of the widget if this logic is in the "page controller"? Make sure your (business) logic is not in the controller: it doesn't belong there. The controller's job is to map input/output, not to handle logic. The views that contain your widget should have a ViewModel which contains the ViewModels needed in the widgets, e.g. - MainViewModel { UserWidgetViewModel UserViewModel; List Bar; // ... } UserWidgetViewModel { string UserName; int Reputation; //... } I felt this unelegant first, but I've been using this for some time now and I believe it nicely encapsulates the necessary data. Hope that helps
