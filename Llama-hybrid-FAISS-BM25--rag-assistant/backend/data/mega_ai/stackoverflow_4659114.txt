Well - I've not managed to find a way that works. None of the packaged tools in windows will copy the file. Drag and drop, COPY, XCOPY, java - all fail to copy the file. The reason I wanted to copy the file was for a backup before doing an OS upgrade. In the end i booted into knoppix and copied it.
