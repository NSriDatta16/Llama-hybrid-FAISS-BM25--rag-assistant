What is "non-blocking" concurrency and how is it different than normal concurrency?

What is "non-blocking" concurrency and how is it different than normal concurrency using threads? Why don't we use non-blocking concurrency in all the scenarios where concurrency is required? Is there overhead for using non-blocking concurrency? I have heard that non-blocking concurrency is available in Java. Are there any particular scenarios where we should use this feature? Is there a difference or advantage to using one of these methods with a collection? What are the trade-offs? Example for Q3: class List { private final ArrayList list = new ArrayList (); void add(String newValue) { synchronized (list) { list.add(newValue); } } } vs. private final ArrayList list = Collections.synchronizedList(); The questions are more from a learning/understanding point of view. Thanks for attention.
