What is the difference when importing tf.keras between Tensorflow 1.14 and Tensorflow 2.0?

I have trained a Deep Learning model with tf.keras . In particular, based on an open-source, I have customized my training data and tried to solve a Semantic Segmentation problem using UNET architecture with EffecientNet as a backbone. The problem is when I trained with Tensorflow 1.14 , some classes (randomly for each training cycle) were missing at the inference step. However, when I switched to Tensorflow 2.0 (noticed that all codes, hyperparameters, configs, etc... had remained the same as the previous one), everything worked fine. (The latter I had merged some classes). I had compiled the codes without any errors in both Tensorflow versions. So, what is the actual difference between tf.keras version that led to the different inference results?
