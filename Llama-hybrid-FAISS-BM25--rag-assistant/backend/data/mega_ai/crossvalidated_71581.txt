You have made two (three?) mistakes in trying to reproduce those results. First, as @whuber pointed out, you are using logistic regression directly on the binomial outcome instead of linear regression for the observed log-odds. While the former is the appropriate approach by today's standards, that's not what Finney's method, which was proposed before the advent of logistic regression, is doing. Second, you are fitting a logistic model with $dosis$ as the predictor instead of $\log(dosis)$ as Finney does. Third, you are using weights for the logistic model which are not needed, because the whole point of the logistic model is that it incorporates the variance structure appropriately. Doing the analysis with the correct logistic regression gives almost the same results as Finney's method library(MASS) dosis Output: p = 0.5: 4.828918 And here is Finney's method: w Output: (Intercept) 4.845005
