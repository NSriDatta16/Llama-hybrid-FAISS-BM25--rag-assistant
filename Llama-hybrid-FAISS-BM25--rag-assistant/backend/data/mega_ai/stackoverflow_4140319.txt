I believe that the agreement governing those retail card machines is very specific about how the data may be stored. I'm pretty sure that your customer would be violating their agreement for that machine use if they did what you describe. If you're not actually processing transactions yourself, I don't know that YOU need to be PCI complaint. It's a voluntary industry standard, not the law. Of course, if you don't follow it, you're not allowed to be involved in the long-term storage of customer details if you want to do business with the payment card industry... Ask for a copy of your customer's terminal agreement. I am sure it says very specific things about the electronic storage of customer information. This is really a bad idea. The liabilities involved are enormous (millions of dollars when you have a small scale breach, typically). PCI compliance is going to cost you a minimum of $50k, probably a lot more, especially if you don't already have a team which has built compliant systems before. You need to find an existing processor that provides the remote datastore for your customer. The providers I've worked with in the past have included MyBillingTree.com and Profitstars . The latter is a larger scale, more professional outfit, but they're still reselling someone else's api. Any major enterprise payment solutions player should have this capability. Don't go with PayPal, they are generally overpriced and of limited flexibility. Unless your volumes are ludicrously low, either of these companies will quote you a competitive rate, probably significantly better than the swipe-terminal your client already has. You don't necessarily have to do an authorization and delayed capture. With the profitstars API, you can run a pre-auth, get back a stored token representing the customer information set, and (provided you have proper customer authorization), use that to run transactions for arbitrary amounts at a later date.
