I use Maven with the Surefire and Cobertura plugins for all my builds. The actual test cases are created with JUnit , DbUnit and EasyMock . Identifying Unit Tests I try to follow Test Driven Development but to be honest I usually just do that for the handful of the test cases and then come back and create tests for the edge and exception cases later. Identifying Test Data DbUnit is great for loading test data for your unit tests. Writing Test Cases I use JUnit to create the test cases. I try to write self documenting test cases but will use Javadocs to comment something that is not obvious. Tracking & Making The Results Available I integrate the unit testing into my Maven build cycle using the Surefire plugin and I use the Corbertura plugin to measure the coverage achieved by those tests. I always generate and publish a web-site including the Surefire and Cobertura reports as part of my daily build so I can see what tests failed/passed.
