PCA/SVD with datetime fields

I have a dataset or flight data with several columns including delay time, and date of departure. There are several other parameters, and I would like to run some sort of PCA with SVD to see how those parameters are correlated with each other (more particularly the delay time). The goal I have in mind, is to use this svd to highlight specific times of the year when there are more delayed flights (eg. around christmas, etc.) So the problem is that I have a "datetime" field which I cannot use as is for a SVD. I was suggested that maybe I could transform this datetime field into 365 binary vectors, one for each day of the year, and do the SVD with this. Same problem with hours. I could cut it into 24 binary vectors, or maybe time groups. Is this decomposition going to be useful ? Are there better ways to analyse data with datetime fields ? My matrix A is going to be decomposed into UDV^T and looking at the matrix V^T I can see which dayOfYear often see delays Number of records : ~500k per month, data available for the last 10 years (so I can have up to 160k for each DayOfYear)
