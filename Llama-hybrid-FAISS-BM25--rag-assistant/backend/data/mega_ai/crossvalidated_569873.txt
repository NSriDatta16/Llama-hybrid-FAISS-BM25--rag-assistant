distribution of normalized random weights

TL;DR: Given a finite series of positive and iid random variates/weights $w_i$ of known distribution, $(w_1, ... w_n)$ , what is the distribution (or at least the exp.val. and variance) of the normalized random variates, defined by $$ \lambda_i := \frac{w_i}{\sum_{j=1}^n w_j} $$ One may assume any reasonable distribution for $w_i$ , if this simplifies anything. For example $w_i\sim\mathcal{U}([0.9,1.1])$ . Intuitivley it is clear, that $\text{Exp}[\lambda_i]=1/n$ , but I wasn't even able to show this. Problem: This problem arises in the estimation of weighted averages $$ \bar{x} = \frac{\sum_{j=1}^n w_i x_i}{\sum_{j=1}^n w_i} = \sum_{j=1}^n \lambda_i x_i $$ when the weights are themselves random variates. There's much literature for fixed weights, but I found nothing to solve the above for the case of random weights. When the distribution is not an accessable quantity, I am also intereested in the moments or other information about the $\lambda_i$ . My attempt : The main problem I encountered is the treatment of the inverse of the sum of the weights. Assuming a sufficiently large $n$ , setting $\mu:=\text{Exp}[w_i]$ and $\sigma^2:=\text{Var}[w_i]$ and defining $$ W := \sum_{j=1}^n w_j $$ the central limit theorem yields $W \sim \mathcal{N}(n\mu, \sqrt{n}\sigma)$ . Now the variate $1/W$ has a shifted reciprocal normal distribution . From this fact I was able to derive the exp.val. of $1/W$ (with the formula given in the wikipedia) $$ \text{Exp}\left[\frac{1}{W}\right] = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sigma\sqrt{n}} F\left(\frac{n\mu}{\sqrt{2n}\sigma}\right) $$ where $F$ is the Dawson function . But to further calculate the exp.val. of the $\lambda_i$ one also needs the covariance of $W$ and $w_i$ , which I dont know how to derive. $$ \text{Exp}\left[\lambda_i\right] = \text{Exp}\left[\frac{1}{W}\cdot w_i\right] = \text{Exp}\left[\frac{1}{W}\right]\text{Exp}\left[w_i\right] + \text{Cov}\left[w_i,\frac{1}{W}\right] $$ Any ideas or hints where to go from here, or is there another and easier approach?
