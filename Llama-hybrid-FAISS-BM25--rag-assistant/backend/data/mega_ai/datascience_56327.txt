How to get rid off differences between prediction and actuals while predicting or forecasting time series data

I have performed Boxcox transformation on my time series data and processed it through ARIMA modeling. Converted prediction values to the actual. I see significant differences between actual and predictions(In sample), would like to get optimal prediction values which are close to actual values. Have tried Machine learning models such as Linear Regression, tree-based(Random Forest, XGboost) as well. Before processing data through these models, it(sales) was aggregated by day wise and extracted, sale day, month, sale dow..etc. For the same data, lagged features and rolling statistics were also generated, trained and tested. However, did not get optimal sale predictions and found differences between actual sale values and predictions. I have ensure no white noise in my data and made stationary before processing data thru models. Can someone suggest techniques such as feature engineering or any other modeling to overcome the problem of differences between actual and predictions and future forecasting?
