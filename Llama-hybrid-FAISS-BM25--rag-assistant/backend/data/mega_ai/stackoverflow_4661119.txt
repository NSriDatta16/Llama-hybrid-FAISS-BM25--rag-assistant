Generate RTT values

I'm writing a Java applet where I should be able to simulate a connection between two hosts. Hence I have to generate packet round-trip times at random. These RTTs can go from ~0 to infinity, but are typically oscillating around some average value (i.e. an extremely large or small value is very improbable but possible). I was wondering if anyone had an idea of how I could do this? Thanks in advance
