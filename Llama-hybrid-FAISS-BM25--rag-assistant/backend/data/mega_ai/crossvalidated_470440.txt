Differential Equation Prediction Model for Future Revenue

I'm trying to predict time series with the physical model of the process. Simple heuristic model for the predicting the company's future revenue. The hypothesis for the model are: The company's revenue growth is exponential. Future growth depends on the past growth. Global market condition can impact company's growth. I'm trying to encode it in form of differential equation: $$ \begin{array}{c} r_{t+1}=v_{t+1}r_{t} \\ v_{t+1}=v_{t}a_{t+1} \\ v_{t0} = someconstant \\ a_{t} = knownforanyt \end{array} $$ Where $r$ - revenue, $v$ - velocity, $a$ - acceleration (known for any t even in the future), $t$ - discrete time interval, month by month. 1) Where can I learn more about such approach? How it's called, especially in finance? 2) And, one issue I'm currently have - how to deal with the negative revenue ? I'm currently calculating $v_{t0}$ as an average monthly growth for last 4 years. The problem is - when company revenue changes from positive to negative (net revenue could be negative even if gross revenue is positive) - there's no way to calculate the average monthly growth . In 2000-12 revenue 1mUSD , in 2001-12 revenue -1mUSD , no way to calculate average monthly growth, the equation $({-1 / 1})^{1/12}$ doesn't make sense. How to deal with that? Is the underlying differential equation model wrong? Or maybe I'm using it wrongly - I'm currently fitting it by hands - by calculating the average monthly growth myself and putting it in the equation as $v_{t0}$ , maybe proper fitting would handle that?
