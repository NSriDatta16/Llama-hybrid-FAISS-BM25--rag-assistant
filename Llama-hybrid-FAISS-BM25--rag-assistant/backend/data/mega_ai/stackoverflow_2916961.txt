Javadoc seems to indicate that parameter isn't meaningful at all for Integer. http://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/api/javax/persistence/Column.html#precision%28%29 So it would appear hibernate is right to ignore it, as your column type isn't a BigDecimal etc, and just make a column that holds a 32-bit integer.
