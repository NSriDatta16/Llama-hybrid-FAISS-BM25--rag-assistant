Regress Y on X and find Rsquared and Dubin-Watson statistic . If former is greater than later, then it indicates spurious correlation. If this is the case, you can proceed as follows: Check whether each variable has an unit root. If both variables have the unit root, then the correlation that you are saying may be spurious. If both don't have unit root, you can proceed with the usual OLS model. If both are unit root, you need to proceed for estimating whether two variables are cointegrated (move together in the long run). If both have unit root and there is no cointegration, then use VAR model. Use standard text books on time series for details. For example, applied time series econometrics by Walter Enders . I am not the user of Python but looking at this post, it seems that python lags R in terms of time series analysis.
