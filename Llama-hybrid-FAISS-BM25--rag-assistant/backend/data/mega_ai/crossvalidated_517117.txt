Nonparametric confidence interval for the mean: Failure to reproduce formula from Zhou & Dinh (2005)

Zhou & Dinh (2005) propose the following formula for a $(1 - \alpha)100\%$ confidence interval for the mean of one sample. The confidence interval is based on a transformation of the $t$ -statistic: where $n$ is the sample size, $\bar{X}$ is the sample mean, $S$ is the standard deviation and $\hat{\gamma}$ is an estimate of the population skewness. Here is a numerical example: I drew 20 samples from an $\mathrm{N}(100, 225)$ distribution with $\bar{x} = 101.06, s = 17.08, \bar{\gamma} = 0.955$ . Further, setting $\alpha = 0.05$ we have: $\zeta_{0.975}=\Phi(0.975) = 0.8352$ and $\zeta_{0.025} = \Phi(0.025) = 0.51$ . The $95\%$ confidence interval evaluates to $(0.984;\;99.416)$ . I tried to implement these formulas but stumbled upon a problem: The coverage of these confidence intervals is nowhere near the nominal value. Where is the mistake? I find the usage of the standard normal CDF instead of the respective quantile function a bit suspect. When I changed $\zeta_{\alpha} = \Phi^{-1}(\alpha)$ , the coverage is near the nominal value. The disadvantage is that the formulas potentially break down with small sample sizes because the argument in $T_{3}^{-1}$ below the cube root gets negative. Using the numbers from the example above, we have: $\zeta_{0.975}=\Phi^{-1}(0.975) = 1.96$ and $\zeta_{0.025} = \Phi^{-1}(0.025) = -1.96$ . Thus, $T_{3}^{-1}(20^{-1/2}\times -1.96 = -0.438)=\left\{1+3\left(-0.438 - 20^{-1}\frac{1}{6}0.955\right)\right\}^{1/3} - 1=(-0.3387)^{1/3} - 1$ I conducted a small simulation study to check the coverage. At the normal, it's only around 9% instead of the nominal 95%. Here is the R code: # The functions skew = 100), 1, 0) }) mean(res) [1] 0.0869
