“Parametrized by” means that the function $f$ of $x$ has additional parameters $\Theta$ , so we can write it as $f(x;\Theta)$ . In such a case, we call the function by $x$ given a fixed value of $\Theta$ . Likelihood has two meanings, the traditional on, and Bayesian. Traditionally, likelihood is written as $$ L(\theta|x) \propto P(x|\theta) $$ The vertical bar $|$ is used on the right-hand side to denote conditional probability and is a slight abuse of notation on the left-hand side. People write it as $L(\theta|x)$ to show that we keep the data $x$ fixed, but we evaluate the function for different parameters $\theta$ . In a Bayesian setting, you usually would not see the left-hand side notation, just the right-hand side will be called the likelihood (here you might have seen $L$ used instead of $P$ ). See Wikipedia entry on likelihood seems ambiguous for more discussion.
