An email itself has no concept of incoming or outgoing. We need to apply a frame of reference to it. Does incoming messages mean into your organization or into a mailbox? Most systems that calculate the "direction" of an email have 3 categories: inbound, outbound, and internal. If you can't use the messages recipient's to determine the flow of the message, then you might need to better explain the situation because that would be the best method.
