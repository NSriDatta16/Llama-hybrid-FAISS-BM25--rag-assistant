The real world problems aren't linearly separable usually, thus you can't use hard margin. However if you find a mapping corresponding to a kernel that make transformed data linearly separable in the Hilbert space you can use hard margin. This is equal to extract features from training set according to mentioned mapping and using feature data as new training set. If the mapping make feature data linearly separable you can use hard margin
