Modernizr checks that exclude IE6, IE7, IE8 or IE at all, that identify iOS devices

Are there any checks (or combinations of checks) I can run with Modernizr where: IE6 fails, but higher versions do not fail? IE7 fails, but higher versions do not fail? IE8 fails, but higher versions do not fail? all IEs fail? all browsers fail, but iOS devices do not fail? all browsers fail, but Android devices do not fail? I want to use Modernizr to check browsers, devices based on feature detection instead of User Agent sniff? CLOSED - thx, got the message thx, ez
