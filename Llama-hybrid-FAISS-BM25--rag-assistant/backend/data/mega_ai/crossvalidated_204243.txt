A number that shows trend, especially regression

I apologize for the vague title, I am not quite able to form my question except by giving an example. I am trying to quantify the regression in some aspects of software development process. Take for example code coverage. Our software consists of a large number of units of different sizes, and the build process includes tests which also measure code coverage. Now consider that we want to monitor the change in code coverage from week to week, and quickly identify units that are whose coverage is dropping, with additional weight to larger units. So suppose the following data is available: Unit Loc Curr -1 -2 -3 -4 Notes unit1 1200 90 88 86 88 85 improving, good unit2 1500 85 82 80 75 95 improving but far below best, needs attention unit3 8000 80 82 83 83 84 slowly regressing, needs attention unit4 5000 85 88 85 88 84 goes up and down, its ok So instead of these hand-written notes I am looking for a number that can be calculated which can give similar information.
