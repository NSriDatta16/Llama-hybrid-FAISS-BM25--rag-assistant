Did you try normalizing your variables to have unit standard deviation before applying PCA? Like (data_mat[, 1] - mean(x)) / sd(x) I don't know if your data is random because I don't see any code for generating data_mat . If they already have unit sd and mean zero, don't worry about it. But from your left image, it appears that the x variable is not centered. The cov function in R already centers your data (otherwise it would be second moment matrix), but it doesn't normalize by SD. Try performing pca on the correlation matrix.
