Comparing population proportions vs hypothesis testing

The author of a famous online course takes a problem where 642 of 1000 polled men and 591 of 1000 polled women responded yes . The question is if men are more likely to agree or not, using 95% confidence interval. He starts by computing the difference of the means, $\bar p_1 - \bar p_2 = .642 -. 591 = 0.051$ and its standard deviation (i.e. the standard error of the .051), which is a sum of variances $\sigma = \sigma(\bar p_1) + \sigma(\bar p_2) = \sqrt{1/1000 (p_1(1-p_1) + p_2(1-p_2))} = 0.021715$. This difference of means is normally distributed and, according to z-table, 1.96 standard deviations contain 95% of such mean differences. We thus can say that the difference is 0.051 ± 1.96 * 0.021715 = 0.051 ± .042562 or there is 95% confidence that $p_1-p_2$ lies between .008 and .094. Since zero is excluded from the region, the 95% confidence interval is purely positive and we are sure that men are more likely to say yes than women. The problem is that after this conclusion, author conducts something similar yet different: he tests the hypothesis that $\bar p_1 = \bar p_2$ ! That is, he takes the population average, $p = (\bar p_1 + \bar p_2)/2$, computes its error by summing variances for men and women. BTW, I wonder why claiming that there are 2000 individuals averaged he uses formula $\sqrt{2p(1-p) \over 1000} = 0.0217$ instead of $\sqrt{p(1-p) \over 2000}$ ? The difference is 2x. Anyway, he takes the z-score = $0.051/0.0217=2.35$ deviations afterwards, which is outside the 95% confidence interval (of 1.96 deviations) and, therefore, it is unlikely that means, $\bar p_1$ and $\bar p_2$, are equal. I do not understand: what is the difference between the methods and which of the tests should I use?
