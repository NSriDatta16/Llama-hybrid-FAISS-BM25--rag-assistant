Definition of Time Series

Time series model is defined as : A time series model specifies the joint distribution of the sequence ${\{X_t}\}$ of random variables. For example:$$P[X_1\le x_1,\ldots,X_t\le x_t]$$ for all $t$ and $x_1,\ldots,x_t$. I have not understood the definition. First , why have they mentioned joint distribution ? Second , What is ${\{X_t}\}$ ? Is that, say, at $t$ time point the sale of a shop ? Third, Why is this the form of a cdf , i.e., $$P[X_1\le x_1,\ldots,X_t\le x_t]$$ for all $t$ and $x_1,\ldots,x_t$ instead of $$P[X_1= x_1,\ldots,X_t= x_t]$$ for all $t$ and $x_1,\ldots,x_t$.
