It's an issue with IE 6 & 7: http://blogs.msdn.com/askie/archive/2009/03/23/right-floated-element-in-internet-explorer-8-is-positioned-differently-than-internet-explorer-7.aspx The only solution I can come up with is something like: #windowExitImage{margin-top:-27px} Because it's technically a comment, only IE 7 on back will pay attention to that. So IE 8 and other browsers will display it the way they already do, which does in fact look right. http://css-tricks.com/how-to-create-an-ie-only-stylesheet/
