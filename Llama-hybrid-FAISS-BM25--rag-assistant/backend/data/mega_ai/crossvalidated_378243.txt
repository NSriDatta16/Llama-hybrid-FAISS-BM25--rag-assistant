Normalize dataset considering future possible values

My question is regarding the normalization or standarization of a dataset that currently has a specific Min and Max value but it is previously known that it might vary and have a lower Min and/or a higher Max. I am not sure what is the best practising here. More precisely: I have a dataset which contains values (features that come from a time series problem rephrased as a supervised problem) that currently vary from 18-22 more or less. I normalize the values with a standard MinMaxScaler BUT to the min and max values I say they are 0 and 100, because I know that for future trainings of the model, these values might appear. Now, here is the thing, I am not sure if the predictions of my model are corrent regarding this normalization. Should I perform the normalization on the current values or should I keep training with a normalization for future values? Thanks and regards!
