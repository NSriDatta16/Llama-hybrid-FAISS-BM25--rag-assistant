We had a similar problem and it turns out that IIS7 does some dynamic CPU based throttling here.. http://www.iis.net/ConfigReference/system.webServer/httpCompression dynamicCompressionDisableCpuUsage Optional uint attribute. Specifies the percentage of CPU utilization at which dynamic compression will be disabled. Note: This attribute acts as an upper CPU limit at which dynamic compression is turned off. When CPU utilization falls below the value specified in the dynamicCompressionEnableCpuUsage attribute, dynamic compression will be reenabled. The default value is 90. dynamicCompressionEnableCpuUsage Optional uint attribute. Specifies the percentage of CPU utilization below which dynamic compression will be enabled. The value must be between 0 and 100. Average CPU utilization is calculated every 30 seconds. Note: This attribute acts as a lower CPU limit below which dynamic compression is turned on. When CPU utilization rises above the value specified in the dynamicCompressionDisableCpuUsage attribute, dynamic compression will be disabled. The default value is 50. Note the defaults -- if your IIS7 hits 90% CPU usage, it will disable all dynamic gzipped content until CPU usage dips back below 50%! Also, some great recommendations and benchmarks here on the real CPU cost of GZIP. http://weblogs.asp.net/owscott/archive/2009/02/22/iis-7-compression-good-bad-how-much.aspx Long story short, unless you regularly have dynamic pages well in excess of 200kb, it's a non-issue.
