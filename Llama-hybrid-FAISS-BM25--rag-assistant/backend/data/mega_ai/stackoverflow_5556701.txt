It's been a while since I used fullcalendar, but if I remember correct ui gives you access to the actual element that is being dragged, correct? If that's the case then you can get the coords of the dragged element and the coords of the delete div and check if they're within each other. jQuery grants access to coordinates relative to the page through .offset() . The coords only give top and left , however right and bottom can be calculated using the element's height and width. (untested but the general idea) var isElemOverDiv = function(draggedItem, dropArea) { // Prep coords for our two elements var a = $(draggedItem).offset(); a.right = $(draggedItem).outerWidth() + a.left; a.bottom = $(draggedItem).outerHeight() + a.top; var b = $(dropArea).offset(); a.right = $(dropArea).outerWidth() + b.left; a.bottom = $(dropArea).outerHeight() + b.top; // Compare if (a.left >= b.left && a.top >= b.top && a.right The one tricky part here is isElemOverDiv(ui, ... . I don't recall what the value of ui is. You may need to change that to something like ui.element to get the actual reference to the element.
