How are ergodicity and "weak dependence" related?

I understand that weak dependence is a broad concept, the definition I am referring to is the one Wooldridge (2013) uses as an assumption that has to be fulfilled (amongst other assumptions) so that the estimators in a time series linear regression model are asymptotically consistent. That is: A process $\{X_t\}$ is weakly dependent if the correlation between $\{X_t\}$ and $\{X_{t+h}\}$ goes to zero relatively quickly as $h\to \infty$. Instead of saying that stochastic processes have to be covariance stationary and weakly dependent, other authors say they have to be covariance stationary and ergodic . How are ergodicity and weak dependence related? Are they interchangable in the context of time series OLS assumptions? Thank you.
