ok so I mucked around some more... and I got it... var query = from catalogItem in cardigan.Descendants("catalog_item") where catalogItem.Attribute("gender").Value == "Men's" from size in catalogItem.Descendants("size") where size.Attribute("description").Value == "Large" select size.Elements("color_swatch"); spend about 8 hours on this, but i got it!! I went and basically got a couple of complex xml samples to mess around with. I guess that's how you learn. :) thanks guys :)
