You seem to be on the right track. You might want to think a bit more about how you want to handle the random effects, based on your knowledge of the subject matter. Logistic regression for a dichotomous outcome is a standard choice. Your structuring of outcome data for logistic regression in R is one of 3 that is allowed. From the manual page for family() in the stats package, one choice for outcome data in logistic regression is the one you made: As a two-column integer matrix: the first column gives the number of successes and the second the number of failures. So in your case "collapsed" would be counted as "success." Your formula only includes random intercepts (deviations of log-odds from the global log-odds of "collapsed" ) for the plants. It would not account for random effects related to the influence of genotype among plants (slopes). If that's what you intend based on your understanding of the subject matter, then your formula is fine. Otherwise, look at this site's lmer cheat sheet for how to specify mixed-effects models with random intercepts and random slopes.
