Windows desktop gadget RSS Feed colour coding items

I have a desktop gadget that pulls RSS Feeds from a website. The Feed contains information about issues - ie. Priority, Time, Description. The Feed items are displayed on the desktop - however I need to colour code them according to their priority ie 1 = red etc. using the substr function - is there a better way to do this using JavaScript / HTML? At the moment I've hacked together this - but is there a more elegant solution? if (feed.item.description.substr(10,1) == "1") { document.write " "; else if (feed.item.description.substr(10,1) == "2") { document.write " "; else { document.write " ";
