If two things are "orthogonal" it means they are independent. In this case, it means that a template can be inline, a template can be noninline, a nontemplate can be noninline, and a nontemplate can be inline. I think the question arises because there is some surface similarity between the two in that both should be present in the translation unit in which they are used, in other words, their definitions (bodies, implementatinos) should be provided in the .h file. However template and inline are indeed orthogonal as is seen from the first paragraph. HTH
