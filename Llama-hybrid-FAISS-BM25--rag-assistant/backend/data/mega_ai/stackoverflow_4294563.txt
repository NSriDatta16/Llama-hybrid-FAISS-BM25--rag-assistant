Install new XCode recover previous SDK ( deprecated )

For each new release of Xcode, you lose the previous SDK. On Xcode 3.2.5 , iOS SDK is 4.2 , but you lose the previous SDK 3.x I understand Apple want to reduce the fragmentation. I tried an old trick. Install the new Xcode in a new folder " Xcode " . From the former Xcode copy paste from /Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/SDKs all the SDK version to the new Xcode /Xcode/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/SDKs in the same directory. Then for the the simulators do the same with the path Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs then just restart XCode and you are ready to go. Now in Xcode, the 'missing' simulator appear. But when I run them I get the message "The simulated application quit. Click Relaunch to try again." I choose " Switch SDK " button to the correct one. But I get the same error. Any ideas ?
