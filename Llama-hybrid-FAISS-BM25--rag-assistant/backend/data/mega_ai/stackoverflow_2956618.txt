Make jQuery-ui draggable handle cover entire page

What would be the best way to make an element draggable when clicking anywhere in the window? Would I have to use a container that covers the whole window? I tried making the body draggable but that didn't work. The problem with using a container is that it moves and therefore doesn't cover the whole of the screen any more after it has been dragged. What about making a really vast container that spans a large number of pixels in every direction so you would never get to the edge of it. Is that a bad idea? The idea (simplified) is to have a page with a square in the middle that can be dragged by dragging any part of the window. Here's a wonderfully unnecessary mockup :) I'm trying with a full screen div, but when I reset it, the element within it moves back with it.. http://jsfiddle.net/LUFf6/
