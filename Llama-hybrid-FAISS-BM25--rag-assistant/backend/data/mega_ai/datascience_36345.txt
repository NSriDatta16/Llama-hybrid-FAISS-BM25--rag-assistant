Git for Deep Learning - what are the best tools for versioning/tracking machine learning experiments?

I'm looking for a tool to track the results of several experiments/iterations in machine learning. Training a model can take days/weeks, so it's essential to track its performance and be able to easily replicate results and roll back to previous versions. I'm looking for a tool that makes the process easy and streamlined like git did for version control. Useful features would be: open source with a license that allows commercial application self-hosted [all the information should reside on computers we own] python-friendly (ideally, tensorflow-friendly as well) can store both hyperparameter values as well as references to specific datasets (the latter would be useful to track the effect of hard negative mining, etc.) cluster-friendly include basic plotting (it's useful to visualize learning curves) automatic testing on multiple datasets user tracking [like "blame" in git]
