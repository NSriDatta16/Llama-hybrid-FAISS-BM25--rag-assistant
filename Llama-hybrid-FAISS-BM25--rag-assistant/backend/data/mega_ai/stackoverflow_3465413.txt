Short answer but was very useful to all developers that asked me that question: There is a book called Practices of an agile developer, http://www.pragprog.com/titles/pad/practices-of-an-agile-developer . This book will specifically answer to your question. I like it very much because it's not just about the process, but behaviors and psychology.
