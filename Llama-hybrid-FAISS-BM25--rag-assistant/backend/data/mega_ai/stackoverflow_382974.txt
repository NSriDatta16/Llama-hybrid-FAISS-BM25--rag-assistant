I would say that it depends on your goals/purpose for the course, the target audience, and the outcomes. On the face of it, you don't need ANY programming background to get a great deal out of such a course. After all, the methodologies and techniques are really about COMMUNICATION, not programming specifically. In fact, properly done, design can eliminate a whole lot of needless programming - even using Agile methodologies (that's why they are told to communicate with the client FIRST and FREQUENTLY). Besides, properly targeted, this course could be a cross-over for many other programs, faculties and certifications; such as the various business degrees, management courses, etc. Wouldn't it be nice to have someone in "management" who had taken such a course and actually understood the need for proper client communication, instead of just focusing on what marketing wanted this week combined with the ususal too-short deadlines? So I encourage you to think beyond "programmers" as the target audience for such a course. Think of this as a COMMUNICATION course first, and go from there. Best wishes. Cheers, -Richard
