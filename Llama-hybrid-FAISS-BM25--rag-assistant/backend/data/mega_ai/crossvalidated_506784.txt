Average sales of last three years using interpolation/extrapolation

I have average sales value for the last three years of a company, e.g. year avg. sales 2017 100 2018 150 2019 200 Is it possible to somehow come up with an estimate of total average sales value for the years 2014, 2015, and 2016 combined with a confidence interval assuming that sales follows a normal distribution. If not what other information is required to make such an interpolation/extrapolation?
