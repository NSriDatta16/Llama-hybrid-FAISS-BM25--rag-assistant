Plural Form Name for tables problem in Symfony

I use database that has been created by someone else and I can't change it. Database uses plural form for its tables' names. In my symfony application I use Propel as ORM. I wanted to change tables' names using phpName attribute in my schema.yml but it works for model only. Forms and filters have wrong (automatically generated) names. Here is my schema.yml: AgentServices: _attributes: { phpName: AgentService } ... In lib\model I have: AgentService.php and AgentServicePeer.php (this is correct) but in lib/form I have: AgentservicesForm.class.php Any suggestions what to do in this case? Thanks
