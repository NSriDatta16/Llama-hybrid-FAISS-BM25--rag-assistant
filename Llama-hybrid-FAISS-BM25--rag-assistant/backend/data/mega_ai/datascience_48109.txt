Building Image Dataset In a Studio

I'm currently working in a problem of Object Detection , more specifically we want to count and differentiate similar species of moths. We are already testing some detection algorithms: YOLOv3 RetinaNet Mask R-CNN For the datasets, first we'll scrape the web for those images to have a starting model. Then we'll get plenty of pictures from our devices that will look like this: Unfortunately it will take 6 months to get those pictures. Currently we have some samples of moths, and we have the resources to take pictures of them in a studio. We want to simulate the field conditions as well as taking close ups of the moths in different angles and lighting conditions. This experiment would also allow for us to get the accuracy of classification from an expert entomologist. Is the effort of taking studio photos worth it? Would these pictures significantly increase the models accuracy? Is there any opportunity for publication? Is there any paper that uses studio photos as well as field photos for object detection? Also, there's plenty of opportunities for publication here in the company, so they would go the extra mile if we publish something, or if these pictures would improve the final accuracy of the models.
