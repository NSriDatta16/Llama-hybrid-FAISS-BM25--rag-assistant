I don't see any mediation happening here. Mediation happens when one variable "get in the way" of another relationship. A classic example is that the more firefighters go to a fire, the more damage is done. Does this mean we should send fewer people to fight fires? No, the relationship between firefighters and damage is mediated by the size of the fire. Bigger fires get more firefighters and do more damage. You seem to have several linear regression: Higher outdoor temperature makes everything hotter. As to type of analysis, I'm guessing some kind of time series, but that is not my area of expertise.
