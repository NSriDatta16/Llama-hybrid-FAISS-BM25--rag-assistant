If the values from the 'expnsId' column are unique, I'll recommend you to use key:true parameter as a option of 'expnsId' coulmn. Then the value of the column will be used as the row id. To be able to help you with the dotted column names you should post the JSON data and not the screenshort with "Object" text on the place of the most important information. Probably your main problem can be easy solved with respect of localReader instead of dotted name. One more small remark. Beause you use label option for all columns you can remove colNames array which will be not used. The option editable: false is default, so you can remove it also. The parameter mtype you can also remove because it will not used for local data. UPDATED : Sorry the value of the first parameter of addRowData should be do the name of the column with the data like you as do. So I deleted the first paragraph from the first version of my answer.
