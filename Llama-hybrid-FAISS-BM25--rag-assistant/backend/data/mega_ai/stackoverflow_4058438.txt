After A LOT of hit and miss (probably since I don't know .htaccess) I've figured it out: RewriteEngine on RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} .*MSIE.* RedirectMatch ^/$ index.IE.htm DirectoryIndex index.xhtml The above snippet will have effect when someone visits "http://www.yoursite.com/optionalFolder/". It will redirect from there, to index.IE.htm if the visitor is any form of Internet Explorer over version 4, else (if you're not IE) go to index.xhtml. I have also found a neat trick to get Internet Explorer to actually read the same .xhtml as Text/HTML, so you won't have to maintain 2 separate versions of the same site: RewriteEngine on RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} .*MSIE.* RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} \.xhtml$ RewriteRule .* - [T=text/html] This snippet has effect when someone accesses "http://www.yoursite.com/ anyPageName.xhtml ". If it's Internet Explorer, then it will overwrite the document type to text/html instead of application/xhtml+xml . Else, any other browser will open the xhtml normally. Question: How can I get snippet #2 to work for a URL that has just the directory path? (it only works for "http://www.yoursite.com/ pageName.xhtml "; how can I get it to work for "http://www.yoursite.com/optionalFolder/"?) In other words, DirectoryIndex index.xhtml doesn't work in snippet #2 (it overpowers the RewriteRule for IE; if I add DirectoryIndex, IE will auto-download the xhml)
