Instancing an object and calling a method in one line?

php 5.3 Is there a way to do this (viable in java for example) (new MyClass())->myMethod(); i am receving: Parse error: syntax error, unexpected T_OBJECT_OPERATOR in D.. on line 7 Add I really need that RFC to be implemented in the next PHP version! http://wiki.php.net/rfc/instance-method-call Is there a way we can subscribe to it so it can get more attention?
