Drawing a Smooth Line from Tablet Input

As the user drags their stylus across the tablet, you receive a series of coordinates. You want to approximate the pen's path with a smooth line, trailing only a few sample points behind it. How would you do this? In other words, how would you render a nice smooth responsive line as a user draws it with their tablet? Simply connecting the dots with straight lines is not good enough. Real drawing programs do a much better job of curving the line, no matter how close or far the sample points are. Some even let you give them a number to indicate the amount of smoothing to be done, accounting for jittery pens and hands. Where can I learn to do this stuff?
