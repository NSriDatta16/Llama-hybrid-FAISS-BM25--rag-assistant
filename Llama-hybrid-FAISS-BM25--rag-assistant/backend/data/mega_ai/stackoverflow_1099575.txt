MySQL has a number of date and time functions , that you can use to parse a timestamp field, as well as to group by (ie. you want to count all records for a country in a specific month, so you'd group by country and year/month). For instance, if you grouped by the year and month of the when timestamp: SELECT `country`, COUNT(`ip`) AS `cViews`, YEAR(`when`) AS `year`, MONTH(`when`) AS `month` FROM `metrics` WHERE `projID` = 'projID' AND `country` != 'XX' AND `when` BETWEEN '$dateFrom' AND '$dateTo' GROUP BY country, YEAR(`when`), MONTH(`when`) Your result set will look something like country cViews year month UK 44 2009 7 UK 75 2009 6 ... And then you can use PHP to organize that data into the output format you desire.
