Sounds like you need a logistic regression, with distal neuropathy as a dummy coded event that is coded $0$ or $1$ , where $P(\text{neuropathy}) = 1$ You can enter age and time as predictors into the model, with the log odds of distal neuropathy predicted by the following predictors: $$ \text{log}\left[\frac{P(\text{neuropathy})}{1- P(\text{neuropathy}}\right] = \beta_0 \text{Time 1} + \beta_1 \text{Time 2} + \beta_2 \text{Age} + \beta_3 \text{Glucose} + \epsilon $$ where the intercept here is simply Time $1$ and the coefficient of Time $2$ is a contrast between Time $1$ and Time $2$ . There is also nothing stopping you from modeling the change every year if you feel it is important to document. If you are just interested in the baseline and $5$ year follow up, then you can just model that. Keep in mind that entering every year will give you a lot more coefficients ( $7$ if my calculation is correct), so make sure you have sufficient data to estimate that many unknowns.
