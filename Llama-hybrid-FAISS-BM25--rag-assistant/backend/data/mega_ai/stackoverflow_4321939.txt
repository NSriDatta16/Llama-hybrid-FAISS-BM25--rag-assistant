ClassNotFoundException with URLClassLoader in classes.jar (java.net package)

On Eclipse Galileo, got the following ClassNotFoundException when doing Debug As/Web Application. But works just fine when doing Run As/Web Application. I was given message that "The source attachment does not contain the source for the file URLClassLoader.class. You can change the source attachment by clicking the Change Attached Source below:" In the project window, it seems that the URLClassLoader class is from Java.net package, which is from /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/1.6.0/Classes/classes.jar. I found the jar on the machine, what else I am missing? why it's debug only issue? Could it be possible that the JRE system library that I have on my iMac 10.6.5 machine is outdated? Or somehow install/unstall of some jar/package caused the issue? This is what I have - JRE System Library [JVM 1.6.0 (MacOS X Default)] - would update it help fixing the issue? but how to get it updated?
