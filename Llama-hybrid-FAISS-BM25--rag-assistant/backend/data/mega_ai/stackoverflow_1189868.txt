4) I start with this one because this will answer many of your first questions: Pragmatic Version Control using Subversion is the bible for working with SVN in my respect. But unlike the bible, you can go through it in a couple of days with no haste at all. 1) Versioning projects usually take the form of committing only source files, as project files (of your VS, for example) usually contain irrelevant definitions of your current installation, and litter the repository. Everyday commits are for your personal use. For major versions use tags. 2) The .svn directory is a local cache repository completely managed by the SVN client. Don't touch it. 3) Merging, deleting and adding files is what version control is all about. Yes, SVN will handle this gracefully, and this is all explained easily in the referenced book. Each revision of your project is self-contained.
