Is there more to probability than Bayesianism?

As a student in physics, I have experienced the "Why I am a Bayesian" lecture perhaps half a dozen times. It is always the same -- the presenter smugly explains how the Bayesian interpretation is superior to the frequentist interpretation allegedly employed by the masses. They mention Bayes rule, marginalization, priors and posteriors. What is the real story? Is there a legitimate domain of applicability for frequentist statistics? (Surely in sampling or rolling a die many times it must apply?) Are there useful probabilistic philosophies beyond "bayesian" and "frequentist"?
