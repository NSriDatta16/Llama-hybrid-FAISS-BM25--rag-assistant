You should consider adding test cases that verify your exceptions are working fine using the @Expected annotation. Basically, write a case that you know should generate a exception and then see that the test passes. A good way to determine if you have missed any cases in complex methods is to run them through a code coverage tool. Run all your tests and then look at the code coverage result. If there are parts of your code that are not visited by your test cases, you are probably missing some. You can find a good guide here .
