Well, in order to say if there is a statistical significance you need to have some kind of distribution of the results, and this will depend on the "league". I.e. the distribution of results in the NBA is different from the one of the Youth League I used to play in :) If you don't have a theoretical distribution for the results, you can try to use available data. Let's assume you want to do so for NBA results. You can take the results of all NBA games (>4500) from 2014 and 2018 from Kaggle Looking at the data, we can see that games finish on average with an 11 points win, with a standard deviation of 8. If we do not make any assumption on the parametrical distribution of these results, but assume that the sample mean and variance represent well the population (which makes sense over 4500 samples), we can use Chebyshev's inequality: $P(|X-\mu|>\sigma k) \le \frac{1}{k^2}$ Which, for a probability of 0.05 (usual p-value) gives us $k=4.47$ . This equates to $\sigma k = 36$ , which means that in order for a game difference to be statistically significant at 5 percent, the game needs to end with more than 36 points over the mean game (which is 11). Summing up, the game would need to finish with at least 47 points difference! (at 10% p-value, the difference would be 36 points at least). Same calculations would apply to football or any other sport. Of course, you can also try to fit a parametric distribution to your game results, and you would have stricter limits, since Chebyshev is extremely general! EDIT : In order to take into account @D.W.'s comments, I tried only using games between more balanced teams. For example, I limited data to playoff games, to second round playoff games and after, or even to Conference Finals and after. However, the distribution does not change that much. Even, it gets slightly more skewed! On the other hand, I noticed that results - when computed in relative term - can be reasonably approximated with a gaussian (p-val Therefore, a the relative win margin of the winning team comes from a truncated (as we only check the winning side) $N(0,0.0297)$ In this scenario, I would say that one team is statistically better than the other if the results end up in the tail, which means that (for 5%) the margin must be bigger than $1.96\sigma$ . A significant victory, would be one that has a relative margin of 0.339 For example, the 101:96 victory would have a margin of 0.052, which would not be significant. A victory of 129:96, on the other hand, would have had a 0.347 margin, which would have been statistically significant at 5%. I am computing the margin as the score difference divided by the loser team's score.
