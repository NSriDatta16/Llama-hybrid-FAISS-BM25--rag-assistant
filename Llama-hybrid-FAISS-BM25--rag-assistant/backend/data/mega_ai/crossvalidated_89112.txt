Those are nice long and straight lines, so with the right pre-processing I'm confident the Hough transform will find them. I think the key is the pre-processing step - you'll want to enhance line-like structures at a local level. One option would be to use Gabor filters. At each location, apply a bank of filters at different orientations, and keep the strongest result (this will occur when the filter is aligned with the line). Next, apply a global threshold. The output should have good coverage for line pixels, and noise scattered pretty randomly everywhere else. Now you're ready to apply the Hough transform. Hope that helps.
