Keras LSTM model for binary classification with sequences

I'm currently working on a bigger project. The goal is to automatically find split points in time series which splits the series into elementary patterns. I have a lot of training data in form of time series with different lengths and split points manually recorded on useful positions. Basically, I have the x , y , z positions and the distances between those points over a centered window of the lengths 2, 25 and 50 ( dist2 , dist25 , dist50 ). I also divided the room into a 3D grid and figured out in which cell the position lies ( cell_x , cell_y , cell_z ). I think this could be useful because elementary operations will more likely be in one or two cells. cell_x, cell_y, cell_z based on size 50. The vertical red lines are the split points of the training data. Now I want to know at every point in the time series if it is a split point or not. In my opinion, these are enough features to start with but I think my Keras model isn't correct because the result is always and only 1 at the 0's time series index. It's basically, a binary classification problem based on past and future values. This was the reason I've tried to solve it with an LSTM . It looks like this: model = Sequential() model.add(LSTM(20, input_shape = (None, input_dim), return_sequences = True)) model.add(Dropout(0.5)) model.add(LSTM(20)) model.add(Dropout(0.5)) model.add(Dense(1, activation = 'sigmoid')) model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy']) Because I'm at the very beginning of the whole Machine Learning topic and the mass of materials is a bit overwhelming I'm here to ask for some help. I know that there are a lot of other things (bad training data, wrong features, wrong parameters, ...) which can cause to this results but I want to know how I can build a Keras model for this problem correctly. I already found a lot of Keras examples but I'm not sure if they fit the problem. Example of data: Features and label of one record: gist.github.com/chryb/2b3312b0ab640a1f28c8cb2d3dbbd86e | The column is_keyframe represents the labels for each index. Based on a Stackoverflow question I transformed the data with the following to the right LSTM input format: gist.github.com/chryb/3de34ba44488012bf79ff4c51a2a43ae
