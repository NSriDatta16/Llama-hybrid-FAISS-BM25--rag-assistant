How to choose the regularization parameter in ZCA whitening?

ZCA whitening can use regularization, as in $$ \tilde{X} = L\sqrt{(D + \epsilon)^{-1}}L^{-1}X, $$ where $LDL^\top$ is an eigendecomposition of the sample covariance matrix. What's a good choice for the regularization parameter $\epsilon$? I suppose that one could separately do unregularized ZCA whitening on the held-out data $X'$: $$ \tilde{X'} = L'\sqrt{D'^{-1}}L'^{-1}X' $$ and then choose $\epsilon$ that minimizes the difference between such held-out whitened data and the held-out data whitened using the regularized ZCA developed using the training data: $$ \tilde{Y}(\epsilon) = L\sqrt{(D + \epsilon)^{-1}}L^{-1}X' $$ $$ \epsilon^* = \mathrm{argmin} \|\tilde{Y}(\epsilon) - \tilde{X'}\| $$ I wonder though if there are easier or more principled approaches to choosing $\epsilon$ or regularizing PCA/ZCA in general.
