How to upgrade/downgrade an iOS auto-renewable subscription

Suppose that an iOS auto-renewable subscription provides access to a service that includes a storage allotment. There are several subscription tiers that vary in the amount of storage allowed. Subscribers may wish to upgrade or downgrade their subscription as their storage needs change. The StoreKit documentation shows me how to start a subscription, but I haven't found anything that addresses upgrades or downgrades. Is there a way to do this from the application?
