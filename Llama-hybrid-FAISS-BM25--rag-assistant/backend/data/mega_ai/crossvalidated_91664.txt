Improving a linear regression: Add predictors or change model?

I am trying to model a time series variable $Y_{t}$ with $4$ physical predictor variables. I used the following linear regression: $Y=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}f_{1}(X_{1})+\beta_{2}f_{2}(X_{2})+\beta_{3}f_{3}(X_{3})+\beta_{4}f_{4}(X_{4})+\epsilon$ where $f_{i} \in \{\log, \tan, \sin, \cos,1/.,Id\}$. My best model gives me an adjusted determination coefficient $R^2_\rm{adjusted}$ of $0.87$. But I know that this indicator is not completely reliable. So I would like to know if I can improve my model. If yes, how can I know if I have to: Change the model of regression: add some polynomials or other depedencies? Look for more predictors $X_{i}$ that I may have not discovered yet? Any ideas would be nice! Edit: My true purpose $Y$ is a value which is measured each day, not at the same hour. What I really want to do is studying the variation of $Y$ with time and "cleaned" from the other external variables $X_{i}$ which are "blurring" my data. So thanks to my regression I want to find the part of $Y$ which depends on this external varying factors, and then remove this part. At the end, if my estimation $\hat{Y}$ is correct, $Y-\hat{Y}$ will correspond to my data "unblurred", and I will be free to sudy a "normalized" or "cleaned" version of $Y$ with time. I tested my model for another set of data of $Y$ measured a year ago, and it also fits the data with a $R^2_{adjusted}$ around $0.8$. And I can see graphically that the model is not completely insane, but not perfect either.
