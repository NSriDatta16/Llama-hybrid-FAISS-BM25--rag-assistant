This approach just makes life difficult for you. It requires you to maintain two completely separate versions of the site and try to guess what version to serve to any given user. Search engines are not the only user agents that don't have JavaScript available and enabled. Follow the principles of unobtrusive JavaScript and build on things that work . This avoids the need to determine which version to give to a user since the JS can gracefully fail while leaving a working HTML version.
