With Bayesian methods, in general, you extract information from your data $D$ which, together with some prior belief, leads to a posterior for your parameters $w$ . That means this posterior $p(w|D)$ is your best guess for a distribution over $w$ . And if you would now generate new data $(x, y)$ by sampling a $w$ from $q_\phi(w)$ , and then sampling for a given $x$ a $y$ from $p(y|x, w)$ you would get pairs $(x, y)$ that, if all your prior belief is right, would belong to the same population as your previous data $D$ .
