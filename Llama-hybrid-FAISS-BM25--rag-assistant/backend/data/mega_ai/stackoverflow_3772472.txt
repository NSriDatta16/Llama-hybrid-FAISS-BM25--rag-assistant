Update December 2013: sschuberth comments git-what-branch (Perl script, see below) does not seem to be maintained anymore. git-when-merged is an alternative written in Python that's working very well for me. It is based on " Find merge commit which include a specific commit ". git when-merged [OPTIONS] COMMIT [BRANCH...] Find when a commit was merged into one or more branches. Find the merge commit that brought COMMIT into the specified BRANCH(es). Specifically, look for the oldest commit on the first-parent history of BRANCH that contains the COMMIT as an ancestor. Original answer September 2010: Sebastien Douche just twitted (16 minutes before this SO answer): git-what-branch : Discover what branch a commit is on, or how it got to a named branch This is a Perl script from Seth Robertson that seems very interesting: SYNOPSIS git-what-branch [--allref] [--all] [--topo-order | --date-order ] [--quiet] [--reference-branch=branchname] [--reference=reference] ... OVERVIEW Tell us (by default) the earliest causal path of commits and merges to cause the requested commit got onto a named branch. If a commit was made directly on a named branch, that obviously is the earliest path. By earliest causal path, we mean the path which merged into a named branch the earliest, by commit time (unless --topo-order is specified). PERFORMANCE If many branches (e.g. hundreds) contain the commit, the system may take a long time (for a particular commit in the Linux tree, it took 8 second to explore a branch, but there were over 200 candidate branches) to track down the path to each commit. Selection of a particular --reference-branch --reference tag to examine will be hundreds of times faster (if you have hundreds of candidate branches). EXAMPLES # git-what-branch --all 1f9c381fa3e0b9b9042e310c69df87eaf9b46ea4 1f9c381fa3e0b9b9042e310c69df87eaf9b46ea4 first merged onto master using the following minimal temporal path: v2.6.12-rc3-450-g1f9c381 merged up at v2.6.12-rc3-590-gbfd4bda (Thu May 5 08:59:37 2005) v2.6.12-rc3-590-gbfd4bda merged up at v2.6.12-rc3-461-g84e48b6 (Tue May 3 18:27:24 2005) v2.6.12-rc3-461-g84e48b6 is on master v2.6.12-rc3-461-g84e48b6 is on v2.6.12-n [...] This program does not take into account the effects of cherry-picking the commit of interest, only merge operations.
