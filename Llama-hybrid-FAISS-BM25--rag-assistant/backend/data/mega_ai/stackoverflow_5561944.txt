Feed features for the Neural Network

According to the last question , I was able to save features set using the method that has been provided. FeaturesTest.roundness = roundness; FeaturesTest.nWhite = nWhite; FeaturesTest.color = color; FeaturesTest.descriptors = descriptors; FeaturesTest.outputs = outputs; FeaturesTest = {roundness,nWhite, color, descriptors, outputs}; Now my first 4 features are input to neural network and the 5th one is the target. I wrote like this. load('features.mat','FeaturesTest'); A = FeaturesTest; P=A(:,1:4)'; T=A(:,5:5)'; rand('seed', 491218382); net = newff(minmax(P),T,20); Now the same error comes for input features... ??? Error using ==> horzcat CAT arguments dimensions are not consistent. Error in ==> minmax at 38 pr{i} = minmax([p{i,:}]); Does anyone have an idea of this please? @Itamar Katz Thanks for showing me the both usage of cell array and struct. I changed it now. There is a function like this which returns features for an one image. for roundness and nWhite only one value is coming. descriptors are the shift descriptors. 5 types of outputs are there. for the first image output should be 1, for the second, 2 and so on. color is display like this in .mat file [196,186,177]. output is something like [1,0,0,0,0]. function[FeaturesTest] = features(image) [siftImage, descriptors, locs] = sift(image); FeaturesTest = {roundness, nWhite, color, descriptors, outputs}; Now take one by one image from training set and call above function for each image. for i=1:size(list, 1); if (~(list(i).isdir)) [FeatureSet] = features(fullfile('F:\ProjectWork\Coin_Recognition\TrainingSet', list(i).name)); Features = [Features; FeatureSet]; end end save('features.mat','Features'); Now I want to train this features. What I did was load('features.mat','Features'); A = Features; P=A(:,1:4)'; T=A(:,5:5)'; rand('seed', 491218382); net = newff(minmax(P),T,20); Error comes here. Please help me. Thanks. features.mat file for 6 images is like this 0.776914651509411 1874 [196,186,177] [1,0,0,0,0] 0.839974548665116 1794 [219,213,202] [1,0,0,0,0] 0.841707612525928 1796 [192,182,171] [1,0,0,0,0] 0.861761793121658 1783 [202,199,192] [1,0,0,0,0] 0.411077484660635 3689 [97,88,72] [0,1,0,0,0] 0.844865287736163 3372 [166,139,89] [0,1,0,0,0]
