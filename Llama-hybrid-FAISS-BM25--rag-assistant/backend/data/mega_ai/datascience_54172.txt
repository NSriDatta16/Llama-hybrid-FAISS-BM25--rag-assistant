I had a tough time remembering the difference between precision and recall, until I came up with this mnemonic for myself: PREcision is to PREgnancy tests as reCALL is to CALL center. With a pregnancy test, the test manufacturer needs to be sure that a positive result means the woman is really pregnant. People might react to a positive test by suddenly getting married or buying a house (if many consumers got false positives and suffered huge costs for no reason, the test manufacturer would lack customers). I got a false negative pregnancy test once, and it just meant it took a few more weeks before I found out I was pregnant...the truth ultimately became apPARENT. (Pun intended.) Now picture a call center for insurance claims. Most fraudulent claims are phoned in on Mondays, after the fraudsters connect with collaborators and craft their made-up stories ("let's say the car was stolen") over the weekend. What's the best thing for an insurance company to do on Mondays? Maybe they should tune to favor recall over precision. It is far better to flag more claims as positive (likely fraud) for further investigation than to miss some of the fraud and pay out cash that should have never been paid. A false positive (flagged for additional scrutiny as possibly fraud, but the customer loss was real) can likely be cleared up by assigning an experienced adjustor, who can insist on a police report, request building security video, etc. A false negative (accepting a fraudster's false claim and paying out in cash) is pure loss to the insurance company, and encourages more fraud. F1 is great but understanding how the test/prediction will be used is really important, because there's always some risk of being wrong...you want to know how dire the consequences will be if wrong.
