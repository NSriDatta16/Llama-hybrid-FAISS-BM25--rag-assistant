Edit results inline

I am returning my views in the style draggableviews . At the bottom you have a save order. This obviously must set the CCK field I have for weight. Would it be possible to update over columns as well? Ideally you would be able to edit the columns returned either by free text or drop downs. By the sounds of it I think I may need to code something myself.
