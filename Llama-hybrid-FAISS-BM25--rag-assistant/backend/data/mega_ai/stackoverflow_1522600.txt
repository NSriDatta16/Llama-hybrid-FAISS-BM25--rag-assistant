Ordering by fields in addition to grouping in MYSQL- Can I use conditional statements in sql?

I have a database with a single table right now, which contains the following fields: name, Suite This is my first hacked together implementation of a database to track tests, and I realize that the way I am storing them is not efficient, but as I said, this is my first round of doing this. Some of the names belong to suites, and some do not. Assume the data looks like this: Name | Suite ggg | NULL aaa | NULL ddd | a_suite fff | a_suite ccc | some_suite eee | some_suite bbb | NULL ect.. If I issue the following command: select distinct name,suite from webpagetest order by name,suite Then I get results that look like this: Name | Suite aaa | NULL bbb | NULL ccc | some_suite ddd | a_suite eee | some_suite fff | a_suite ggg | NULL However, what I'm trying to do is first order the results by suite, then if the suite field is not null, use the suite field to alphabetize them. If suite is null, then alphabetize them by the name. So, the results should look like this: aaa | NULL ddd | a_suite fff | a_suite bbb | NULL ggg | NULL ccc | some_suite eee | some_suite In which case it is organizing by the name column if nothing is present in the suite column, and if suite is not null, then it will use the suite value instead. Hopefully this isn't too poorly written, and someone can understand what it is I'm asking here. Thanks! Matthew
