Business days in Pandas: EU, USA, or another?

To create a pandas date range I usually do the following: pd.date_range("1991-01-01","1998-01-01",freq="B") where pd is the pandas import, and freq="B" makes the frequency to be "Business Days". In the R Dataset Documentation , the EuStockMarkets is said to have been collected at between 1991 and 1998. pd.date_range("1991-01-01","1998-01-01",freq="B") results in 1828 dates, while the R dataset has 1860. Why is that? What are the differences? I find very strange that R Dataset has collected data from different EU countries, which have different holidays, in just 1 and only 1 date index... Pandas only returns one time series. Is this business days in the USA, the EU(whatever this may mean), or it depends on the system where I run the pandas command?
