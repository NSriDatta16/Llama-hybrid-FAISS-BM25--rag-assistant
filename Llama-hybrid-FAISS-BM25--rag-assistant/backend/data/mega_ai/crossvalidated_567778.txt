Suppose $\mathbb D = (d_{ij})$ is an $n\times n$ distance matrix: that is, it is the matrix representing all distances for some set of $n$ points $\mathbf x_i$ in some Euclidean space $E^N$ (of arbitrarily high dimension $N$ ) for which $d_{ij} = |\mathbf x_i - \mathbf x_j|$ for all $1 \le i \le j \le n.$ $n-1$ Suffices Setting $\mathbf y_j = \mathbf x_j - \mathbf x_n$ for $j=1,2,\ldots, n$ yields the zero vector $\mathbf y_n = \mathbf 0$ together with at most $n-1$ distinct $\mathbf y_i.$ The latter span a Euclidean subspace of $E^N$ of some dimension $d \le n-1,$ which we may identify with $E^d \subseteq E^{n-1} \subseteq E^N.$ This shows that Given an $n\times n$ distance matrix $\mathbb D = (d_{ij}),$ there always exists a sequence of $n$ points $\mathbf x_i\in E^{n-1}$ for which $|\mathbf x_i - \mathbf x_j| = d_{ij}$ for all $1\le i \le j \le n.$ $n-1$ Is Required The standard $n-1$ -simplex in $\mathbb{R}^n$ has $n$ vertices $\mathbf x_i = (0,\ldots,0,1,0,\ldots,0)$ for $i=1,2,\ldots, n.$ Their mutual squared distances therefore all equal $2,$ implying any three of them form an equilateral triangle. Thus (using elementary 2D geometry) the inner product of any two distinct $\mathbf y_i = \mathbf x_i - \mathbf x_n$ (for $i = 1,2, \ldots, n-1$ ) is $$Q(\mathbf y_i, \mathbf y_j) = \mathbf y_i \cdot \mathbf y_j = 1,\ i\ne j.$$ Now suppose that the only thing we know concerning $n$ points $\mathbf{x}_i$ in some Euclidean space $E^N$ is that all their mutual squared distances are $2.$ (Conceivably there are other configurations with this property besides the $n-1$ -simplex. The preceding paragraph establishes that such sets of points exist, but it does not demonstrate that $n-1$ dimensions are required to represent them.) Another way to describe this abstract situation is that the matrix representing the Euclidean inner product in terms of the $\mathbf y_i,$ $i=1,2,\ldots, n-1$ is $$\mathbb Q_{n-1} = \pmatrix{2 & 1 & 1 & \cdots &1 \\1 & 2 & 1 & \cdots &1\\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots &\cdots & \vdots\\1 & 1 & \cdots & 2 & 1\\1 & 1 & \cdots & 1 & 2} = \mathbb{I}_{n-1} + \mathbf{1}_{n-1}\mathbf{1}_{n-1}^\prime $$ In general, any such inner product matrix could be degenerate, meaning that fewer than $n-1$ dimensions are needed for the points it describes. However, the form of the right hand side makes it clear that $\mathbf Q_{n-1}$ has an eigenspace generated by $\mathbf{1}_{n-1} = (1,1,\ldots, 1)^\prime$ of eigenvalue $n,$ because $$\mathbb{Q}_{n-1} \mathbf{1}_{n-1} = \mathbf{1}_{n-1} + \mathbf{1}_{n-1}\mathbf{1}_{n-1}^\prime\mathbf{1}_{n-1} = n\mathbf{1}_{n-1},$$ together with a complementary eigenspace with eigenvalue $1$ . Since all eigenvalues are nonzero, $\mathbb{Q}_{n-1}$ is nondegenerate, proving the $\mathbf y_i$ span a vector space of dimension $n-1.$ This shows that at least $n-1$ dimensions are needed for an isometric embedding of the $n-1$ -simplex, and we have the example we need.
