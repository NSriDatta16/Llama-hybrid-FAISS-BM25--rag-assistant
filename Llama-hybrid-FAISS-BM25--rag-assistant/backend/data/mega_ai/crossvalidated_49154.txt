You could bin the data into evenly spaced intervals, then compute the unbiased sample variances of subsets $\{X_{n+1}:X_n=x_1,X_{n-k}=x_2\}$. By the law of total variance, $$\mathrm{Var}[E(X_{n+1}|X_n,X_{n-k})|X_n] = \mathrm{Var}[X_{n+1}|X_n]-E(\mathrm{Var}[X_{n+1}|X_n])$$ The LHS, if it is almost zero, provides evidence that the transition probabilities do not depend on $X_{n-k}$, though it is clearly a weaker statement: e.g., let $X_{n+1}\sim N(X_n,X_{n-1})$. Taking the expected value of both sides of the above equation, the RHS can be computed from the sample variances (i.e., replacing expected values with averages). If the expected value of the variance is zero then the variance is 0 almost always.
