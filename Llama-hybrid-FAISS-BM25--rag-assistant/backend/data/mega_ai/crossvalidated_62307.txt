Less significant findings using conditional logistic regression

I used regular logistic regression on my dataset and got a few significant hits. However, since the data is 1:1 case-control matched data I decided to try using conditional logistic regression ( clogit() in the survival package of R ). However, none of the results are significant any more. Is this normal? I was hoping to gain power by switching to conditional logistic regression. m This is a GWAS (genome wide association study). PHENO is either 1 (control) or 2 (case). x is number of copies of the minor allele (0, 1, or 2) in the SNP of interest, COVAR[, 1] is a race covariate and COVAR[, 2] is the matching covariate. This test is performed for each SNP (~300,000) and the resulting p-values are adjusted for FDR. Perhaps the matching of the cases and controls was not very good? Matching: case and control pairs had: same sex. BMI > threshold. same self-reported ethnicity. lived within 50 miles of procurement site. Perhaps I should use GLMM?
