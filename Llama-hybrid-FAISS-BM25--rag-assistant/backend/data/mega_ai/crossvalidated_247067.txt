Adding new classes to a logistic regression classifier without re-training

Many real world classification problems have a ever-changing set of possible classes. Let's say I have a training set where each training example belongs to one of three different classes A , B or C . Once I've trained a logistic regression classifier on such a set and I wish to add new examples with a new label D to it, is there a way to re-train the classifier without throwing away all of the information it's learned about classes A , B & C ? In other words, do I have to re-train from scratch, or is there a smarter way of dealing with this situation?
