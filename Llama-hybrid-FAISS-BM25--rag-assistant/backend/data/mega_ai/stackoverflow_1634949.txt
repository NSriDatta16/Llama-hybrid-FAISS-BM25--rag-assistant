Reset was a big mistake. I call shenanigans on Reset . In my opinion, the correct way to reflect the distinction you are making between "forward iterators" and "input iterators" in the .NET type system is with the distinction between IEnumerable and IEnumerator . See also this answer , where Microsoft's Eric Lippert (in an unofficial capactiy, no doubt, my point is only that he's someone with more credentials than I have to make the claim that this was a design mistake) makes a similar point in comments. Also see also his awesome blog .
