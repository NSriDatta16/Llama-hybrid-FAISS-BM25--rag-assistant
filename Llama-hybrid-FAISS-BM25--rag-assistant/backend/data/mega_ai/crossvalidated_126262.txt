As Cyan pointed out, this behaviour arises from the fact that the model does not put enough emphasis on the case $\mathbf{a}=0$. You say that you don't want to impose a 'tighter' prior on $\mathbf{a}$. I'm not sure what you mean by 'tighter', but increasing the prior probability of $\mathbf{a}=0$ is the only solution. This could be done by putting a point mass on $\mathbf{a}=0$, i.e. model averaging as suggested by Cyan, or using a prior with a sharp peak at 0 such as a T distribution with small $\nu$.
