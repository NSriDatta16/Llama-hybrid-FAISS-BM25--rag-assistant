Take a look at GPU Gems 3, "Relaxed Cone Stepping for Relief Mapping" (Chapter 18, p. 409). It's also available online here (PDF link). The main purpose of cone stepping is to reduce the artifacts you see, but that introduces other kinds of artifacts. Relaxed cone stepping solves both problems, well enough where you can pragmatically say there are no more artifacts.
