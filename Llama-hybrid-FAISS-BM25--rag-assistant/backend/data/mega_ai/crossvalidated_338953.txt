In-sample data, out-of-sample data vs training data, testing data and validation data

In statistics, we divide the data into two set: in-sample set and out-of-sample set . In machine learning, the data is divided into 3 sets: training set , testing set and validation set . From my understanding, in-sample set is equivalent to training set ; out-of-sample set is equivalent to testing set . Is my understanding correct? But what's about validation set ? What does it correspond to?
