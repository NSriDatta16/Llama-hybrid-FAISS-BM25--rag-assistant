Also note that MKPinAnnotationView does offer some additional functionality to a regular MKAnnotationView, such as animating while dragging and the 3d shadow effect. You won't get these if you use MKAnnotationView. If you want these built-in features, you can create a UIImageView and add it as a subview to your MKPinAnnotationView. This will give you an annotation that looks like whatever you want; but behaves like a pin. I use it to replace the head of the pin with my own images.
