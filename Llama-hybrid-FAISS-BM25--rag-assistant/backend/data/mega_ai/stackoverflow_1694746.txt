The fact that you're referencing a type explicitly in your generic method indicates that you've got trouble. There's no way for the compiler to know that a List can contain an object of some type unless that type is T . So create your list like this: result = new List (); foreach (EdmCmdData item in data) { object o = new EdmCmdPostAddInfo(item.mlObjectID1, item.mlObjectID2, item.mbsStrData1, item.mlLongData1) result.Add((T)s); } return result; This will throw an InvalidCastException at runtime if you invoke the method with the wrong type, but that's a problem you should already be expecting to have.
