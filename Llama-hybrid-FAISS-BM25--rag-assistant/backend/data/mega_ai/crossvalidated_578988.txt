Maybe you should concentrate more on the methods that are intended precisely for feature selection , rather than model selection. Model selection methods like cross-validation or AIC try to compare models independently of how they differ (this is only approximately true, but should suffice here). Feature selection methods concentrate on comparing models that differ only by feature selection. I have had good experience with e.g. random forest based feature selection , but there are many others, some of them more specialized like spike and slab . Having said that, the results of those methods often contradict, especially in the less simple cases. Use the ones that are top in multiple methods as suggestions and you then select the model that works best for you w.r.t. other cost criteria like complexity, runtime...
