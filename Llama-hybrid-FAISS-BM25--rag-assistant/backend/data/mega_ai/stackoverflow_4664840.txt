Spring security does support both basic authentication and form based authentication (embedding the username/password in the URL). A REST service is generally authenticated on each and every request, not normally by a session. The default spring security authentication (assuming you're on 3.x) should look for basic authentication parameters or form parameters (j_username and j_password) (in the form http://you.com/rest_service?j_username=xyz&j_password=abc ). Manually tacking the j_username/j_password onto the URL, adding them as post parameters (I believe), or setting the basic authentication username/password should all work to authenticate a REST service against the default Spring Security interceptors, right out of the box. I will admit that I haven't tried this on REST services, though I do clearly recall reading exactly this in the docs as I did the same for basic page logins on spring security recently. Disclaimer over.
