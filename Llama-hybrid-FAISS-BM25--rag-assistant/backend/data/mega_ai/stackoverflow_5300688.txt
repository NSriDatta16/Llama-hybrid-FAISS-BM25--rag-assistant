As [i] is a compile-time operation, it will simply not work for element sizes that are not known at compile-time. You must increment the pointer yourself with arithmetic. But that being said, most likely you actually know the size of the element at compile-time. You are probably writing specific code for 24-bit and 32-bit (et al) pixel depths, so you should still be able to use brackets to dereference. Just organize your code to use the right class ( Rgb32 , Rgb565 , Rgb24 , etc). Regarding your compiler error, iostream doesn't know how to convert a Rgb to a string , so you naturally get this error. I would suggest creating a Rgb::ToString() function.
