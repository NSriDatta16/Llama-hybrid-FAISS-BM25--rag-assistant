ARIMA modelling (by itself) is of little use with your kind of data . See my response to Time series analysis to quantify trend when seasonal amplitude is decreasing as a guide to what can be done. Note that when I answered the post I was unaware that it was an economic series. I specifically disabled the identification of the optimum lead and lag effects around each holiday . I also disabled the identification of particular days in the month and particular weeks in the month that might be of interest. I also disabled long-weekend effects, Monday after a Friday holiday effect, Friday before a Monday Holiday effect, month-end effects etc. as I had no idea that it was economic data. If I had enabled these economically oriented remedies , the results would have been even more amazing. If you wish you can post your data and I will demonstrate that for you. By the way my "eye" tells me that you have a level shift not a trend but only good exploratory analysis can confirm that.
