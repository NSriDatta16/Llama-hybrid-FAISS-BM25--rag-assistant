Modeling the assembly of an icosahedral virus?

The capsids ("shell") of some viruses exhibit T=1 icosahedral symmetry. In short, this means they are assembled from 60 copies of protein subunits which form an icosahedron (a shape with 20 faces). The icosahedron has 20 threefold axes of symmetry (points where exactly 3 subunits interact) and 12 fivefold axes of symmetry (points where 5 subunits interact), as shown at ExPASy ViralZone . See also https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deltoidal_hexecontahedron Image by Tomruen provided on Wikipedia with cc-by sa4 license. On this image you can see the icosahedral being constructed out of 20 triangles and each of the triangles out of 3 subunits. In a particular case, the viral particle can be assembled from a mixture (in excess) of two subunit proteins A and B. Suppose the virion assembles with a random selection of these subunits. If there are 10 copies of B for every copy of A (1:10 ratio A:B), then on average each virion should have, roughly, 5 copies of A and 55 copies of B. What I need to calculate is the distribution of A and B at the threefold axes. Common sense tells me that given a 1:10 ratio of A:B, most of these threefold axes will have 0 or 1 copies of A. Is there an appropriate way to model this so that I could estimate the proportion of threefold axes that have â‰¤1 copy of A? Is this an application of a Poisson distribution? I'm a virologist without much formal mathematics training. I hope this question is clear and meaningful to the stats experts out there. Thanks for your help!
