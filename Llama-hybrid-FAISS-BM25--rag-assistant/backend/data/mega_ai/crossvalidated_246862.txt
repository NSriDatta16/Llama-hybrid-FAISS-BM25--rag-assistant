Learning initial state in RNNs

I was reading Hinton's slides about recurrent networks ( link ), and he says that the initial state of the network should be learned just like the weights (slide 14). If that's the case, how would we handle the unknown initial state during test time? Additionally, in the "Learning Precise Timing with LSTM" paper by Gers, Schraudolph, and Schmidhuber ( link ), they say that "the initial state of the network should be learned as well." But I've never read such approach being used in most papers that work with RNNs. Has anybody learned initial state as parameters and got better results from it? If so, how did you deal with unknown states during test time?
