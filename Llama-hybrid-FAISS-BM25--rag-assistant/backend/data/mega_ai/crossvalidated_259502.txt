In using the cbind() function in R for a logistic regression on a $2 \times 2$ table, what is the explicit functional form of the regression equation?

Suppose I have a $2 \times 2$ table that looks like: Disease No Disease Treatment 55 67 Control 42 34 I would like to do a logistic regression in R on this table. I understand that the standard way is to use the glm function with a cbind function in the response. In other words, the code looks like: glm(formula = cbind(c(55,67),c(42,34)) ~ as.factor(c(1, 0)), family = binomial()) I am wondering why R requires us to use the cbind function and why simply using proportions is not sufficient. Is there a way to write this out explicitly as a formula? What would it look in the form of: $$ log\left(\frac{p}{1-p}\right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1X $$ where $X = 1$ if we have treatment and $X=0$ for control? Right now it seems like I am regressing on a matrix for the dependent value.
