The output of MD5 is 16 bytes (128 bits). I suppose that you are talking about an hexadecimal representation, hence as 32 characters . Thus, "16 characters" means "64 bits". You are considering MD5 with its output truncated to 64 bits. MD5 accepts inputs up to 2 64 bits in length; assuming that MD5 behaves as a random function, this means that the 2 18446744073709551616 possible input strings will map more or less uniformly among the 2 64 outputs, hence the average number of candidates for a given output is about 2 18446744073709551552 , which is close to 10 5553023288523357112.95 . However, if you consider that you can find at least one candidate, then this means that the space of possible passwords that you consider is much reduced. A rainbow table is a special kind of precomputed table which accepts a compact representation (at the expense of a relatively expensive lookup procedure), but if it covers N passwords, then this means that, at some point, someone could apply the hash function N times. In practice, this severely limits the size N . Assuming N=2 60 (which means that the table builder had about one hundred NVidia GTX 580 GPU and could run them for six months; also, the table will use quite a lot of hard disks), then, on average, only 1/16th of 64-bit outputs have a matching password in the table. For those passwords which are in the table, there is a 93.75% probability that there is no other password in the table which leads to the same output; if you prefer, if you find a matching password, then you will find, on average, 0.0625 other candidates (i.e. most of the time, no other candidate). In brief, the answer to your question depends on the size N of the space of possible passwords that you consider (those which were covered during rainbow table construction); but, in practice with Earth-based technology, if you can find one matching password for a 64-bit output, chances are that you will not be able to find another (although there are are really many others).
