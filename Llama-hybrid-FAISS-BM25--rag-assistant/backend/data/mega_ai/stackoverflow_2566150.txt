JSF command button attribute is transferred incorrectly

I have following code in jsf page, backed by jsf managed bean This code fragment is dedicated to editing come collection of items. Each row of the table contains "edit" button that submits changed values of the row to the server. It has the item itself as an attribute. Submit is performed by calling actionListener method in the backing managed bean. This code runs correctly on Glassfish v 2.1 But when the server was updated to Glassfish v 2.1.1, the attribute stopped to be passed correctly. Instead of passing edited item (when we change the values in table row, we are actually changing the underlying object fields), the source item is submitted to server, i.e. the item that was previously given to the page. All the changes that were made on the page are discarded. I tried to update jsf version from 1.2_02 to 1.2_14 (we are using jsf RI), but it had no effect. Perhaps anyone came across the same problem? Any help and suggestions will be appreciated.
