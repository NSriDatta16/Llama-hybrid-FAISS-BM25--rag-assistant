PDF of incomplete beta function

I have a (probably) biased coin. I want to make a Bayesian inference on $\lambda=p(coin=\text{heads})$ . I define my prior $p(\lambda)\sim Beta(\lambda; a=1,b=1)$ . I toss the coin and update my posterior by simply increasing hyperparameters of the Beta distribution. Now my question is if I know that $0.2\leq\lambda\leq0.7$ , how can I make Bayesian inference? I tried to integrate Beta function for $[0.2, 0.7]$ to find normalizing constant. However I couldn't find out a compact form. I also don't know whether Beta distribution is an appropriate prior in this case.
