Alternative to Poisson process with non-independent events?

Correct me if I'm wrong but as far I know, a Poisson distribution assumes the events are independent of each other. I have a dataset of events over several years where the occurrence of an event may drive/encourage the occurrence of the next few events (possibly, can't say for sure, some of these events may occur independently as well). I want to find the probability of exactly two events happening within a 3-month period. What is the best way to find that? I'm also concerned that the event rates were probably quite different at different years, forming something similar to a nonhomogeneous Poisson process, in case we can consider the process as Poisson at all!
