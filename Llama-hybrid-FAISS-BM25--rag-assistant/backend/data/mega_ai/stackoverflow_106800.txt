Unit Testing Guidelines

Does anyone know of where to find unit testing guidelines and recommendations? I'd like to have something which addresses the following types of topics (for example): Should tests be in the same project as application logic? Should I have test classes to mirror my logic classes or should I have only as many test classes as I feel I need to have? How should I name my test classes, methods, and projects (if they go in different projects) Should private, protected, and internal methods be tested, or just those that are publicly accessible? Should unit and integration tests be separated? Is there a good reason not to have 100% test coverage? What am I not asking about that I should be? An online resource would be best.
