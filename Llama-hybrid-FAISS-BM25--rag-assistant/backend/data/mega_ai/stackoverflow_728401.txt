If there are no circular dependencies in your object, I suggest using one of the other answers or jQuery's copy methods , as they all seem quite effective. If there are circular dependencies (i.e., two sub-objects link to each other), you are kind of screwed as there is (from a theoretical perspective) no way to solve this issue elegantly .
