High volume SVM (machine learning) system

I working on a possible machine learning project that would be expected to do high speed computations for machine learning using SVM (support vector machines) and possibly some ANN. I'm resonably comfortable working on matlab with these, but primarly in small datasets, just for experimentation. I'm wondering if this matlab based approach will scale? or should i be looking into something else? C++ / gpu based computing? java wrapping of the matlab code and pushing it onto app engine? Incidentally, there seems to be a lot fo literature on GPUs, but not much on how useful they are on machine learning applications using matlab, & the cheapest CUDA enlabled GPU money can buy? is it even worth the trouble?
