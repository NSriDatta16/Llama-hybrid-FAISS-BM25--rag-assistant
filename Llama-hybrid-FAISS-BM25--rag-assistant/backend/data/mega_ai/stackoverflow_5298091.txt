Here is a thread about chaining setups: Include another MSI file in my setup project Do you want to install prerequisites for your own application? If so, then this link should help: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/h4k032e1.aspx This is the key paragraph: "Each prerequisite is a bootstrapper package. A bootstrapper package is a group of directories and files that contain manifest files that describe how the prerequisite should be installed. If your application prerequisites are not listed in the Prerequisite Dialog Box, you can create custom bootstrapper packages and add them to Visual Studio. Then you can select the prerequisites in the Prerequisites Dialog Box. For more information, see Creating Bootstrapper Packages."
