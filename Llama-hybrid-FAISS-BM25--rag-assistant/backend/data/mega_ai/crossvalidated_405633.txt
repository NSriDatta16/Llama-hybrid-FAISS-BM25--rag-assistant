How to interpret estimates and correlation of random effects (intercepts and slope) in a mixed-effects model in a Bayesian framework(brms)?

I do not understand how to interpret random slopes from the output of brms Among others, I read this post on the output from lmer . However instead of Variance in brms I have Estimate , as for fixed factor!!. This page also helped me a bit. In the following example the variable "experience.Mom" has a positive estimate at the group level (random slope) which, if I understand correctly is always the case (why??), and a negative effect at the population level. (intervals are over the 0 so no clear effect anyhow). What does my random slope Estimate means? How does it influence my outcome variable (Y)? Group level (random) Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Eff.Sample sd(Intercept) 0.08 0.06 0.00 0.23 4323 sd(experience_Mom.z) 0.09 0.06 0.00 0.24 4831 cor(Intercept,experience_Mom.z) 0.00 0.57 -0.94 0.95 7528 Population level (fixed) Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI experience_Mom.z -0.02 0.09 -0.20
