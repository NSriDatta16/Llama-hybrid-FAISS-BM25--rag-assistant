I suggest Random Forest for a start because it classifies many cases automatically so that you can see what is going on with your data with good accuracy. This is a relatively robust algorithm compared to classic tree classification thanks to its bootstrap aggregating algorithm . Here is a notebook example to implement RF: https://www.kaggle.com/code/patrickaudriaz/random-forests-for-multiclass-classification/notebook
