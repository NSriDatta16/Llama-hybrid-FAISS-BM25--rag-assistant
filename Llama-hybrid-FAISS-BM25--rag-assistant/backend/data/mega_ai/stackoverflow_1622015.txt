ruby, libxml getting the child nodes that match an xpath

I need to get the child nodes of a node using XPath as I want to "drill down" into a node. Here's the code I'm trying: xml_ns = 'Document:http://www.google.com/books/' xml_document = XML::Document.file('./test_pages/test.xml') book_xpath = '//Document:View/Document:Books' book_title_xpath = '//Document:Title' xml_document.find(book_xpath, xml_ns).each() { | item | puts item item.find(book_title_xpath, xml_ns).each() { |item2| puts '========================' puts 'name: ' + item2.content().strip() } } And here's an XML fragment pragmatic programming x-men The first find works find and returns the Books node. However the second find('//Document:Title') return all the Title nodes in the document even though I am only searching in the found nodes. Why would this happen? I've tired modifying the second XPath, but nothing I've tired works. Any advice?
