The problem is that there isn't really a $R^2$ for logistic regression. Instead there are many different "pseudo-$R^2$s" that may be similar to the $R^2$ from a linear model in different ways. You can get a list of some at UCLA's statistics help website here . In addition, the effect (e.g., odds ratio) of the added variable, $x_2$, isn't sufficient to determine your power to detect that effect. It matters how $x_2$ is distributed: The more widely spread the values are, the more powerful your test, even if the odds ratio is held constant. It further matters what the correlation between $x_2$ and $x_1$ is: The more correlated they are, the more data would be required to achieve the same power. As a result of these facts, the way I try to calculate the power in these more complicated situations is to simulate. In that vein, it may help you to read my answer here: Simulation of logistic regression power analysis - designed experiments . Looking at G*Power's documentation, they use a method based on Hsieh, Bloch, & Larsen (1998). The idea is that you first regress $x_2$ on $x_1$ (or whatever predictor variables went into the first model) using a linear regression. You use the regular $R^2$ for that. (That value should lie in the interval $[0,\ 1]$.) It goes in the R² other X field you are referring to. Then you specify the distribution of $x_2$ in the next couple of fields ( X distribution , X parm μ , and Z parm σ ). Hsieh, F.Y., Bloch, D.A., & Larsen, M.D. (1998).
