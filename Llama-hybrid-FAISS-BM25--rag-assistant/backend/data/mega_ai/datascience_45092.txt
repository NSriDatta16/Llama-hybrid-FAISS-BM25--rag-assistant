I'm supposing you are reading the paper on GAN where $[...]$ is the loss function. $\mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{data}(h)} [...]$ now represents the expected loss where the data is taken from the distribution $p_{data}(h)$ . Edit: $\mathbb{E}[ ]$ is an operator which gives the expected value of the function on which it is acted upon. When specifically acted on the loss function it is called risk or empirical loss. And L(z) that you are asking is the loss. For more on its definition and explanation, see the below questions: Risk function or expected loss function why do we calculate risk when we already have loss functions?
