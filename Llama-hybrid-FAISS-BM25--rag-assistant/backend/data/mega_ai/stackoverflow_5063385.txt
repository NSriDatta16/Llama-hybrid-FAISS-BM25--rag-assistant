iPhone App using Online Database

Database manipulation and functionality is almost entirely new to me. I'm in the midst of learning SQL(lite too) for usage in iPhone application data storage and its all very confusing at the moment, but with due diligence I will persevere. My question is as such: I would love to make an app that has profiles for users to log into an customize certain attributes in. Say for instance Jeremy from Alaska likes fishing, I would make Jeremy a "Person" object and fill his profile in accordingly. When he quits the app his data gets cached to disk and this is all easy to do, but what about if Jeremy from Alaska expects this app he is using inputs his information to an online server where he can access the information from say... a web browser? Basically what my question boils down to is HOW in the world do online databases work? Does Jeremy's app upload his information to a SQL server somewhere? (Are there better ways?). What exactly happens when he types his user name and password into the application? Does this instantiate a query of sorts to a database including the username/password information? And what kind of software handles and processes this query? How, in its most basic concept, do I make a User/Profile/Logon/DataStorage online database setup? I'm not asking for a gimmigimmi-makeitsimple, just a pointer in the right direction and perhaps clear up some of the misunderstandings and confusion I have about online databases. Thank you every and all for any input you may give!
