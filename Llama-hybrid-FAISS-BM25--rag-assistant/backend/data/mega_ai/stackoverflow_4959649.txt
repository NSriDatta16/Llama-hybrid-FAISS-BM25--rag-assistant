Help with resizing image in container

Ok so I'm just trying to resize the div properly and have the image inside it resize as well. Here is an example of the container and image that are generated dynamically: Then the image has Jquery resizable added onto it, and the container has the draggable added onto it. All working fine. until I try to resize both elements when the client 'zooms in'. Here is my resize code: $('#imgD' + i).css("width", (resourceData[i][2]*currentScale)); $('#imgD' + i).css("height", (resourceData[i][3]*currentScale)); // Lets try every combination, like a hero! $('#imgA' + i).css("width", (resourceData[i][2]*currentScale)); $('#imgA' + i).css("height", (resourceData[i][3]*currentScale)); $('#imgA' + i).attr("width", (resourceData[i][2]*currentScale)); $('#imgA' + i).attr("height", (resourceData[i][3]*currentScale)); $('#imgD' + i).css("left",(resourceData[i][4]*currentScale) + "px"); $('#imgD' + i).css("top", (resourceData[i][5]*currentScale) + "px"); The resize icon thing bottom right of the image would indicate this is a problem relating to the jquery resizable?
