I think once you ask yourself "hmm should I layer this" the answer is yes. I've worked on too many projects that probably started off as proof of concept/prototype that ended up being full projects used in production, which are horribly written and just wreak of "get it done quick, we'll fix it later." Trust me, you wont fix it later. The Pragmatic Programmer lists this as the Broken Window Theory. Try and always do it right from the start. Separate your concerns. Build it with modularity in mind. And of course try and think of the poor maintenance programmer who might take over when you're done!
