isdigit tests whether the character is a digit. The test is only reached following assigning 0 to number, and 0 is a control code, not a digit, so isdigit(0) is always false, and so your while condition is always true. ... number=0; ... } while( !isdigit(number) ); Instead, test the input stream to determine whether it successfully read a value. int main() { const size_t COUNT = 100; int tab[COUNT]; size_t n; cin.tie(&cout); // ensures cout flushed before cin read // (not required if your runtime complies with that part of the standard) for (n = 0; n > tab[n]; if (!cin) break; } if (n > 0) // average is undefined if n == 0 cout
