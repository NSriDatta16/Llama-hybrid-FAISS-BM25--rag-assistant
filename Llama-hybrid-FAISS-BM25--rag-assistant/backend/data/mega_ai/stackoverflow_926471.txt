WPF: How do I allow scrolling with the mouse wheel in a ListView while dragging ListView items?

I have implemented drag and drop in a ListView in my WPF application. Items can be dragged and dropped inside the ListView , and also into a TreeView that is beside the ListView . Currently, I have it set up so that when you drag to the bottom of the ListView , it automatically scrolls down the list. What I'd like to know is if there's any way to be able to scroll through the ListView with the mouse wheel while I'm dragging its items? It seems like the mouse wheel events aren't being fired while I'm dragging.
