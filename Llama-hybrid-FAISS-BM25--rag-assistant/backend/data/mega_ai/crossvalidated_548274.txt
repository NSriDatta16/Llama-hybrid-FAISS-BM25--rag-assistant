Quantification of "when to worry" about deviance and other residuals when Y is binary is less well established than you might think. And looking at such general assessments of goodness of fit doesn't lead to a clear corrective action. For those reasons, it is more fruitful to postulate the most flexible model that your effective sample size will support, and to fit that model. If it doesn't fit well enough there's not much you can do about it anyway, so this is a pragmatic solution. The fit is made flexible by not assuming linearity and additivity, by incorporation of regression spline and interaction terms. In general, goodness of fit IMHO is best assessed by directed tests (although testing may make you change the model and that will distort inference). An example of a directed test is testing nonlinear spline terms to assess nonlinearity of a variable's effect on, say, the log odds scale. Regression Modeling Strategies covers the suggested approach in detail.
