Does calling `click()` in jQuery only trigger jQuery attached events?

I have a Magento site, which includes the prototype JavaScript library. Some time ago, I added jQuery as well. Before that however, I'd included a prototype based Lightbox. It was triggered by adding the attribute rel="lightbox[gallery]" . Now I'd like to make a lightbox appear on page load. I know nothing about prototype, so I tried creating a hidden link with jQuery and then calling $('#special').click() but to no avail. If I actually click the link however, it works fine. All my jQuery code is in a function like so jQuery.noConflict(); jQuery(function($) { // Now I can use $ in here... :) }); So does jQuery's click() only trigger events that jQuery has binded? If so, how could I call the click event or trigger the lightbox in prototype?
