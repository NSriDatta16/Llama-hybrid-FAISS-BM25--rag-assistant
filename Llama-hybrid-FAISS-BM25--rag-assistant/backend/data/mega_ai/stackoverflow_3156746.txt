MaxBulkMailer might be a solution for you? The organisation I work for uses it to connect to www.authsmtp.com which gives us credits for a certain number of e-mails that we can send per month. You can import a spreadsheet of your mailing list or tap straight into a SQL server and pull the names and addresses. Available for Mac and Windows.
