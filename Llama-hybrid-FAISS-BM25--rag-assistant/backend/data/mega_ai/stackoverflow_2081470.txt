Because of instrumentation profiled code on average will run slower than non-profiled code. Measuring speed is not the purpose of profiling however. The profiling output will point you to bottlenecks, places that threads spend more time in, code that behaves worse than expected, or possible memory leaks. You can use those hints to improve said methods and profile again until you are happy with the results. A profiler will not be a solution to a coding style that is x% slower than optimal however, you still need to spend time fine-tuning those parts of your code that are used more often than others.
