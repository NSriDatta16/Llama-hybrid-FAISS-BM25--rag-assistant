I would suggest the following: Theano is really powerful but yes the cod can be difficult sometimes to start with I would suggest you to check out breze: https://github.com/breze-no-salt/breze/blob/master/notebooks/recurrent-networks/RNNs%20for%20Piano%20music.ipynb which is slightly easier to be understood and has an LSTM module as well. Furthermore, an intresting choice is autograd by Harvards, which does automatic symbolic differentiation of numpy functions https://github.com/HIPS/autograd/blob/master/examples/lstm.py and therefore you can easily understand whats going on. I'm a python fan but this is my personal preference. Have you considered using Torch7 is the most user-friendly framework for neural networks and is also used by Google Deepmind and Facebook AI? You can check this very interesting blog post about RNNs http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/ . Additionally, an LSTM implementation is available in the github repo of the post, while an alternative is the rnn package https://github.com/Element-Research/rnn .
