popupWindow is hard-coded to work with links, and only responds to "click" events. That said, if you want the popup to appear on page load, you could try editing line 6 of jquery.popupWindow from this; $(this).click(function(){ to this; $(this).ready(function(){ add an id to your body element; and call the plugin; $('body#popuptrigger').popupWindow({ ... }); This is untested, but even if it works it's not a very elegant solution. I'd suggest looking around for a popup plugin that allows you more flexibility. I use jqModal to load internal url requests for popup forms and can throughly recommend it. Your mileage mey vary though, so do a google search for "jquery modal" and check out some alternatives.
