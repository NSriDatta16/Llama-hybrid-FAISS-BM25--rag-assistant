Tools to find code coverage intersections?

Our company is investigating the idea of using cobertura code coverage during manual regression tests to find out where we have 'adjacent functionality'. The general idea would be if regression test A hit method businessLogicFoo(), and regression test B also hit that method we could say that regression test A and B have 'adjacent functionality'. We're particularly interested in efficiently determining which regression tests have 'adjacent functionality' so that we can schedule better regression runs (we have vastly more tests that time to test - so we always end up testing a subset of all regression worthy tests). Has anyone attempted something like this before? With cobertura or some other code coverage library? My first guess is that we write a groovy script (my preferred scripting language) to export the cobertura reports as XML, then parse out the classes/methods covered - filter out any superfluous classes - and then find method/class intersections between the two reports. Ideally all controlle in maven. But I'm just guessing.
