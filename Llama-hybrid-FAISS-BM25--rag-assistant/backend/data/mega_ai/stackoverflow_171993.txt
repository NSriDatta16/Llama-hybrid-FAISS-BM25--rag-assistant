You're procrastinating . Stop that, and clean up your mess. If it's really big, I recommend the following tactic: Make a copy of all the stuff on your drive on an external disk (USB or whatever) Do a clean install of your system As soon as you find you need something, get it from your copy, and place it in a well defined location After 6 months, throw away your external drive. Anything that's on there can't be that important. You can also install Google Desktop, which does not clean your mess, but at least lets you search it efficiently. If you want to prevent this from happening in the future, you have to change the way you're organizing things on your computer. Hope this helps.
