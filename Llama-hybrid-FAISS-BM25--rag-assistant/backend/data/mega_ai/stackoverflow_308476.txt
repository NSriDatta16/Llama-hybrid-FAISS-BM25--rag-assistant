Fastest way to find out whether two ICollection collections contain the same objects

What is the fastest way to find out whether two ICollection collections contain precisely the same entries? Brute force is clear, I was wondering if there is a more elegant method. We are using C# 2.0, so no extension methods if possible, please! Edit: the answer would be interesting both for ordered and unordered collections, and would hopefully be different for each.
