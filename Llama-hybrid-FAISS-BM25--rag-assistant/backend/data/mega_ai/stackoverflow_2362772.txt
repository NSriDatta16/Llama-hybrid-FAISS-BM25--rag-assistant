Simple online key-value storage service

In a number of projects I plan to create (widgets/local client software) I want to store some user preferences etc. I could do this client side, the widgets have this functionality, or I could store it online somewhere, giving the user access to those preferences on any computer, or after a reinstall etc.. The problem is that I don't want to associate those widgets etc with any domain in my possession, or pay the money for another domain and hosting, also implement and maintain the server side code for such a service. So my question is: Is there any online services that provide storage for simple key-value pairs? Preferably free of course for limited usage. Keep in mind that I want to access it with javascript.
