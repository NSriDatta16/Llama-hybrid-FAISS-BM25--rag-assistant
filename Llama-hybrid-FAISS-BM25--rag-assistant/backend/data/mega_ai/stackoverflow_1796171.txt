Maybe event is updated only in Event View screen constructor... Workaround is to close and open Event View screen... using event injections mEvent.commit(); // The active screen is Event Viewer. I tested it. Screen screen = UiApplication.getUiApplication().getActiveScreen(); UiApplication.getUiApplication().popScreen(screen); KeyEvent event = new KeyEvent(KeyEvent.KEY_DOWN, Characters.ENTER, KeyListener.STATUS_NOT_FROM_KEYPAD); event.post(); Don't forget to Allow Application Permission -> Interaction -> Input Simulation. Or request it pragmatically ( How to give blackberry application all the available permission? )
