Best machine learning algorithm for loans dataset?

I have a dataset of about 75K samples with about 20 features per sample (12 of which are probably important) describing various credit profiles - credit score, late payments, income, etc. Some of the input variables are continuous and some are categorical. The output variable is continuous - the ROI associated with each loan. What is the best supervised learning algorithm to predict the ROI? How do I select the features and weigh them? I was looking at some examples of SVM but I need something that is not binary (can actually predict the ROI)
