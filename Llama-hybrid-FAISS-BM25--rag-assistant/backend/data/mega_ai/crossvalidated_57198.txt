It is not very clear from the question exactly what has been done, but I suspect the problem is that there just is not enough data (10 patterns) to train a useful neural network to do anything meaningfully. The errors are very low, which suggests that the neural network has essentially memorised the training data, which is likely to result in severe over-fitting. Unless more data is available, I would advise using something like ridge regression, rather than neural networks. What exactly is meant by "But still, after running simulation of those networks for each single column of the input matrix"? If you could write a MATLAB script that shows what you are trying to do, that would make it much easier to find the problem.
