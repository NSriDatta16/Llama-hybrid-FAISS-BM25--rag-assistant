Given how large your sample is nearing 1M CpG variables, it would surely be impractical as you have described to generate and visually inspect individual plots for each variable. Using statistical tests or functions in R would help you quantify linearity while also giving you that visual you desire. Computing the correlation between each CpG variable and the time-to-outcome would be a good approach that can be evaluated by Pearson's correlation coefficient . This is great for a linear correlation, however, it falls short when we begin working with non-linear correlations, which you might have here. In this case the Bruesch-Pagan test from the lmtest package would be good to test non-linearity. This test checks for heteroskedasticity, which can be an indicator of nonlinearity in the relationship. The approach that I would take to this in R would be: Calculate Pearson's coefficients for each CpG variable against the time-to-outcome. Perform the Bruesch-Pagan test on a simple linear model for each CpG variable. library(lmtest) # Function to test linearity for a given variable test_linearity This script will return a list of correlation coefficients and p-values for the Breusch-Pagan test for each CpG variable. You can then decide on a threshold for what you consider linear based on these metrics. This would be my simple approach and solution. For running separate models for each CpG site you might want to consider dimensionality reduction or multivariate models that can handle multiple predictors simultaneously.
