The only way to do what you want is setting a active CGEventTap to get a editable stream of kCGEventMouseMoved events and change them into kCGEventLeftMouseDragged events in the callback of the CGEventTap (obviously you need to synthesize the mouse down event first) You would think that this is done automatically by sending a click event with no release and moving the mouse but that is not the case.
