You probably want to create DAEMONS for this sort of thing. You definitely should not go the way you're headed as others have better explained. You also should not use cron because if the process takes more that the time you think it should take it will overun the other process. That could make a mess of you app and it's really not an elegant solution. A deamon will run in the background in a silent fashion. Will deal with all the work-load you need, wont overwrite itself and can also run in a pre-set amount of time. Take a look at this excellent tutorial by Kevin van Zonneveld .
