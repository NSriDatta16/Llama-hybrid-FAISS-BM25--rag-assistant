Convert an org.w3c.dom.Node into a String

Sorry I'm a Java/XML newbie - and can't seem to figure this one out. It seems it's possible to convert a Document object to a string. However, I want to convert a Node object into a string. I am using org.ccil.cowan.tagsoup Parser for my purpose. I'm retrieving the Node by something like... parser = new org.ccil.cowan.tagsoup.Parser() parser.setFeature(namespaceaware, false) Transformer transformer = TransformerFactory.newInstance().newTransformer(); DOMResult domResult = new DOMResult(); transformer.transform(new SAXSource(parser, new InputSource(in)), domResult); Node n = domResult.getNode(); // I'm interested in the first child, so... Node myNode = n.getChildNodes().item(0); // convert myNode to string.. // what to do here? The answer may be obvious, but I can't seem to figure out from the core Java libraries how to achieve this. Any help is much appreciated!
