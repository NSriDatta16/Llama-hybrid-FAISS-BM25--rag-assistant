It sounds like you're almost there - but I would do more to discourage the use of F5 . As you are already tracking users through the use of session to limit their requests to one connection you should try encouraging them to be a bit more patient. There are two ways you could do this: 1 Break New Requests Add a session variable such as InProgress that you set to true as you start performing your select commands, and set to false when you've finished. You can then check this value before starting the actions - if it's already InProgress , bail out, inform the user they've hit F5 to quickly, and please wait to try again. Obviously you should warn the user at the start that this is a long running process, and the repercussions of their actions - although we all know users don't read warnings. 2 Provide more feedback to the users You need to look at why your users are pressing F5 so much - usually it's frustration due to a lack of response from the web - people are becoming used to the AJAXy way of doing things - an "in progress" type animation informing them that stuff is happening, please wait with a "Please don't hit F5" type message usually works. You'd need to look into using something like an UpdatePanel or some other JS library to help there.
