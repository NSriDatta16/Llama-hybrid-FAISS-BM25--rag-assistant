To elaborate on the one-class SVM approach: There is this paper from a Google Scholarship recipient that uses one-class SVMs for intrusion detection, achieving significantly better performance than rule-based methods: https://www.sec.cs.tu-bs.de/pubs/2009-diss.pdf . Even if you used DTs (which almost noone does nowadays), it could still be helpful for the feature extraction step. Decision trees are limited in their modelling of the domains, see But just try out a few different classifiers, and see which yields good results. (It seems as though XGBoost has won several of Kaggle's competitions recently, and it's based on decision trees).
