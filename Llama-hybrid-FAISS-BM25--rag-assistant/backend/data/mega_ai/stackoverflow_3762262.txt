PHP: regex & hash key in string

How do I address special characters in Regex? @ ? # $ % %... this patten searches for a letter that comes between a prefix and a suffix. $pattern = '/((? But what if $string began with a # $string = '#end'; $prefix = ??? edit: This is the preg_replace in full $text = " Newton, Einsteing and Edison. #end " $pattern = '/((? \1 ', $text); this replaces all the n letters with a bold n but is supposed to exculde the n in #end
