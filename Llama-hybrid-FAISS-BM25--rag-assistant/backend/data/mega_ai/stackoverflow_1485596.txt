your solution for storage seems to be the best way to track for users. The tables don't have redundant data and your many to many relationship is represented by its own table. On another note: For anonymous users you would need to record their IP address, and the you can use the COUNT() sql function to get the number of unique visitors that way, but even and IP address not "unique" per se.
