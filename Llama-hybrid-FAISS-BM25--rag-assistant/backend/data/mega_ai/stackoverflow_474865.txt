This is great - I have to spend some more time looking at it. Thank you. I found a different solution but it's a bit of a hack. I just set my binding path property to the nested type. Using my example above, in my xaml (which has a DataContext of object A) I set my binding as... {Binding Path=B.C} Bubbling the event up is definitely more elegant.
