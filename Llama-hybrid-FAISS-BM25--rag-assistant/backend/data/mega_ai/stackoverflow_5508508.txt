Going back to list in Drill-Down Navigation Based Application using Core Data on iPhone

I want to build a simple drill down app (similar to the Contacts app on the iPhone). I am using Xcode 4.0. I start by making a new "Navigation Based Application", and also say that I will be using Core Data for storage. I then go and add 'New File' and select UIViewController, and a subclass of UIViewController. In my RootViewControler (which was made in the template) at didSelectRowAtIndexPath, I do the following: NSManagedObject *managedObject = [self.fetchedResultsController objectAtIndexPath:indexPath]; TrackerDetailViewController *trackerView = [[TrackerDetailViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@"TrackerDetailViewController" bundle:nil]; trackerView.title = [managedObject valueForKey:@"trackerName"]; trackerView.referringObject = managedObject; [self.navigationController pushViewController:trackerView animated:YES]; [trackerView release]; And this works - I can load up some details in TrackerDetailViewController. What I cant seem to figure out is how to go back! Most places I am reading online say that this should be happening automatically. I can't seem to get that to happen. If I download a few samples and compile them, they do have a back button - but I dont see how it was added or managed, and can't find what I am missing to not have it.
