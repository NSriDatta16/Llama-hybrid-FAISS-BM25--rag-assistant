push view when touchesBegan

I have a apps with a navigation controller, when the user is in a specific view, He can touch a scollview and I want a push the rootViewController. So, I have subclasses uiscrollview, and in the method "touchesBegan", I want a push the rootviewcontroller, but I don't have access to the navigation controller! How I can do that?
