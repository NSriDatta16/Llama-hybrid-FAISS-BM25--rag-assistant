Binary data is more compact than SOAP serialization, but SOAP serialization is optimized for web-use, not local storage. With regards to web services, most web services will expect their data to arrive in a very specific format, but usually, .NET and Visual Studio can take care of that for you. If you're manually trying to create SOAP for a webservice, you're probably doing something wrong. You should be able to add a reference to a web service and have Visual Studio generate a nice object model you can use that abstracts away all the SOAP and serialization issues.
