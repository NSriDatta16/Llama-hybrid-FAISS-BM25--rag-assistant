How should I expose database classes over web services?

Given that directly exposing linq to sql or entity framework classes over web services is a bad idea, how should I expose the data over a web service such as WCF? It seems like I would have to create a parallel set of classes for the web service, and then marshal the data into those, which doesn't seem very elegant. The web services will be custom, so something like RIA is not very useful in this case.
