this is a tricky point in most books in econometrics. The main point is that to demonstrate that the estimators (beta) are unbiased, you need the zero conditional mean assumption which is E[u|X]=0 . The trick is that the conditional mean assumption refers to the expectation of u given all observation in the sample (all x's). When authors are introducing regression models in their books, they implicitly use the zero conditional mean assumption referring only to the x related to the same observation of u. If you jump to the chapter on time series on your handbook you will note this distinction, since the author will explicitly state that the zero conditional mean assumption refers to the entire set of samples of X and not only to the contemporaneous X. This make sense under time series analysis, where random sampling cannot be assumed.
