Why is a Gelman-Rubin diagnostic of < 1.1 considered acceptable?

In multiple sources a Gelman-Rubin MCMC convergence diagnostic of less than 1.1 is considered evidence that chains have converged. For example in this thread: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54155673/is-there-a-function-check-rhat-in-rstan-package I'm not clear why.
