Numpy-like reduction of particular dimensions in Pandas DataFrame?

With a numpy multidimensional arrays, it is easy to reduce particular axes with functions such as np.mean or np.sum . For example, np.mean(X, axis=2,keepdims=False) will eliminate the second axis. What if our data is in Pandas long-format DataFrame and we want to reduce a particular variable in a similar fashion? For example, consider a dataset with four columns: A , B , C , and value . A , B , C specify independent variables, and value specifies a dependent measure. If we wish to reduce the dataframe by eliminating B (i.e., averaging across all levels of B , but not within levels of A and C ), we can use df.groupby(['A','C']).mean() . However, this solution becomes very clunky if there are many independent variables that we must enumerate in the groupby call. Does pandas have an efficient method for achieving numpy-like variable reduction? In principle, one can convert the DataFrame into an xarray, but this seems like an overshoot.
