A point to consider is the communications channel used to pass the tracker position back to the data centre. In Europe the GSM network is well developed and can be used (SMS or GPRS) to pass the position data. However there are large roaming charges to be considered if the application is intended to follow a vehicle across international boundaries. In other countries (USA, Canada, Africa, Asia) the terrestrial infrastructure is not so well developed or uses a different transmission system (CDMA rather than GSM) requiring a different modem device. An alternative, actually pretty price comparable with GSM, is to use satellite comms as the back channel. These are available either using Iridium or Inmarsat services and work globally, in remote regions without mobile phone coverage and without any roaming charges as the unit crosses borders.
