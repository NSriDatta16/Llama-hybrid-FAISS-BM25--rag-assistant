Download Coreutils (it's the package which contains all of these commands): http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.9.tar.gz . Rip it open, and find the source code for each one. I think the tarball is organized quite nicely. And some implementations of the commands in other languages (I like Python, as it's readable): ls : http://www.pixelbeat.org/talks/python/ls.py.html . cat : http://www.unix.com/302420159-post2.html . top is complicated . Good luck implementing it!
