Why does this Grails/HQL query with a JOIN return Lists of pairs of domain classes?

I'm having trouble figuring out how to do a "join" in Groovy/Grails and the return values I get person = User.get(user.id) def latestPhotosForUser = PhotoOwner.findAll( "FROM PhotoOwner AS a, PhotoStorage AS b WHERE (a.owner=:person AND a.photo = b)", [person:person], [max:3]) latestPhotosForUser isn't a list of PhotoOwners. It's a list of [PhotoOwner, PhotoStorage] pairs. Since I'm doing a PhotoOwner.findAll, I would have expected to see only PhotoOwners. Am I doing something wrong, or is this the proper behavior?
