Alternatives to using RFile in Symbian

This question is in continuation to my previous question related to File I/O. I am using RFile to open a file and read/write data to it. Now, my requirement is such that I would have to modify certain fields within the file. I separate each field within a record with a colon and each record with a newline. Sample is below: abc@def.com:Albert:1:2 def@ghi.com:Alice:3:1 Suppose I want to replace the '3' in the second record by '2'. I am finding it difficult to overwrite specific field in the file using RFile because RFile does not provide its users with such facility. Due to this, to modify a record I have to delete the contents of the file and serialize ( that is loop through in memory representation of records and write to the file ). Doing this everytime there is a change in a record's value is quite expensive as there are hundreds of records and the change could be quite frequent. I searched around for alternatives and found CPermanentFileStore. But I feel the API is hard to use as I am not able to find any source on the Internet that demonstrates its use. Is there a way around this. Please help.
