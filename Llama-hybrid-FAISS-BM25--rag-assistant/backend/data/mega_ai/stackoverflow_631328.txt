panoramic text visualization with seadragon (or other)?

i'm working on a visualization of a text file with 100k lines, max 1k characters/line, as one large, navigable image. similar to the bleak house example in blaise's ted talk demo of seadragon, but even simpler -- basically just the view from cat filename.txt , but with a view that's zoomed out so that the whole file is initially visible (each line fitting on the page width, without wordwrap ) and can then be zoomed in on. is this currently possible with seadragon? if not, any ideas on how i can attempt it? (oh, and including hyperlinks would be great -- but i don't expect that'll be possible.)
