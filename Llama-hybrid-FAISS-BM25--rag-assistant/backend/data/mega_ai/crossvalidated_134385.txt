You can take a bayesian approach. denote the probability of failure by $\Theta$ and think of it as a random variable. A priori, before you see the results of the experiments, you might believe that $\Theta \sim U(0,1)$. If you trust the engineers to make this product reliable, maybe you can take $\Theta \sim U(0,0.1)$ or so. This is up to you. Then, you can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior distribution of $\theta$. Denote $A$ the event that you've observed ($n$ experiments with zero failures). $$ p(\Theta = \theta | A) = \frac{p (A | \Theta = \theta) p(\Theta = \theta )}{p(A)} = \frac{p (A |\theta) p(\theta )}{\int p (A |\theta) p(\theta )d\theta}. $$ Everything is simple: $\Theta$ is uniform, so $p(\theta)$ is some constant. Since you run $n$ experiments, $p(A | \theta)$ is just the probability of no failures in $n$ bernouli trials with probability of failure $\theta$. Once you have $p(\theta | A)$ you're gold: you can calculate the probability of any event $B$ by integrateion: $\mathbb{P}(B) = \int p(B |\theta) p(\theta |A) d\theta$ Below, I work through a detailed solution, following the above approach. I'll take a few standard shortcuts. Let the prior be $U(0,1)$. Then: $$ p(\theta |A)\propto p(A|\theta) \cdot 1 = (1-\theta)^n. $$ The normalization constant $p(A) = \int p(A|\theta)p(\theta) d\theta$ is found to be $B(1,n+1)$ - see wikipedia pages beta function and beta distribution . So, $p(\theta |A) = \frac{(1-\theta)^n}{B(1,n+1)}$, which is a beta distribution with parameters $1, n+1$. Denote the probability of no failures in $m$ products in the next year by $B$. The probability of at least one failure is $1 -\mathbb{P}( B )$. Then $$ 1- \mathbb{P}(B) =1 - \int (1-\theta)^m\frac{(1-\theta)^n}{B(1,n+1)}d\theta = \frac{B(1,n+m+1)}{B(1,n+1)} $$ which is roughly $0.1$, using $n= 100,000, m = 10,000$. Not very impressive? I took a uniform distribution on the probability of failure. Perhaps you have better prior faith in your engineers.
