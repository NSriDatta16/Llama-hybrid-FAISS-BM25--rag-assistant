Quote this document in case someone has the same concern: If the processor tries to read or write improperly aligned data, an alignment fault can occur. On x86 hardware, the alignment faults are invisible to the user. The hardware fixes the fault as described in the previous paragraph. On x64 hardware, alignment faults are disabled by default and the hardware similarly fixes the fault. On the Intel Itanium architecture, however, if an alignment fault occurs while 64-bit kernel-mode code is running, the hardware raises an exception. (For user-mode code, this is a default setting that an individual application can change, although disabling alignment faults on the Itanium can severely degrade performance.)
