MSpec doesn't support the RowTest concept known from other frameworks like NUnit and MbUnit. There's limited support for reusing specifications (the It s) with behaviors, i.e. Behaves_like but that's not entirely the same as a RowTest . I generally discourage forcing MSpec to handle lots of different data points as you need to with your code kata. There are better tools out there to handle such situations, like the one you mentioned (NUnit).
