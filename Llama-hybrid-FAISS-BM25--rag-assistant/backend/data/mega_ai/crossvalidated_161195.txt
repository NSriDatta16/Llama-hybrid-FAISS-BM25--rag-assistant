As with any machine learning task, the representation of your input plays a crucial role in how well you learn and generalise. I think, the problem with the representation is that the function (modulo) is highly non-linear and not smooth in the input representation you've chosen for this problem. I would try the following: Try a better learning algorithm (back-propagation/gradient descent and its variants). Try representing the numbers in binary using a fixed length precision. If your input representation is a b-bit number, I would ensure your training set isn't biased towards small or large numbers. Have numbers that are uniformly, and independently chosen at random from the range $[0, 2^b-1]$. As you've done, use a multi-layer network (try 2 layers first: i.e., hidden+output, before using more layers). Use a separate training+test set. Don't evaluate your performance on the training set.
