Optimization in classification tasks I would suggest to start to check the 0-1 loss , which is the goal of the classification task. In other words, the objective of the classifier is trying to classify objects "correctly" / minimizing the wrong classifications or 0-1 loss. In real world problems 0-1 loss is hard to optimize directly, therefore there are other loss functions to "approximate" 0-1 loss. (A related discussion can be found here: What are the impacts of choosing different loss functions in classification to approximate 0-1 loss ) Logistic loss is one of them. And the classifier based on logistic loss is logistic regression. Optimization in clustering tasks The goal of clustering is putting objects into groups/clusters. But what grouping strategy is good? This is the essential question answered by the optimization formulation. In generally, we want objects in one group are "similar" to each other and between groups are "different". The optimization objective is trying to "maximize" the similarity within groups and "maximize" the difference between groups.
