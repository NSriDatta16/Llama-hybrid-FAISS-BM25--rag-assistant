Which test for inter-group and intra-group significance?

It's been a while since I had my statistics but if I recall there should be a test that I can run on data structured as follows: cat1 cat2 cat3 Group 0 312.621145 293.584362 382.129353 o 1 264.965909 196.390110 312.721461 y 2 450.178161 291.210000 357.659341 y 3 171.512367 178.749077 200.645902 o 4 341.158879 301.321839 268.037037 y // More data... The question would be if there are significant differences between the means within a category, factored by the group, and over the categories for a given group. I'm not sure, is this ANOVA or Multi-ANOVA (if at all)? Addition The data is structured as follows: there are two groups of particants, o and y . Every row corresponds to one participant. For every participant three values are recorded ( cat1 , cat2 and cat3 ). As an example, the mean of cat1 for group o could be formed by filtering all o entries and then forming the mean of the cat1 values. Addition 2 Essentially, the when forming the averages for the categories by group, the averages can be plotted as such: I'd now be interested in seeing if the "intra" group difference (1) and the inter-group (2) differences are statistically significant. In the example plot, only one intra-group difference is indicated, but of course the differences within groups "cat2" and "cat3" would also be of interest. Also the Intergroup differences for the blue values would be interesting.
