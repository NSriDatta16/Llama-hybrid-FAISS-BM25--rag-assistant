This pragma allows the library author to define library imports based on a range of criteria that can be analysed at compile-time. For instance, you can link against different libs, based on whether you want to link with: multithreading on or off; the shared or static version of the library in question; the shared or static version of the standard runtime library; the debug or release library; the 32-bit or 64-bit library. With the pragma form, all this can be decided via #ifdef preprocessor tests in one of the library's header files.
