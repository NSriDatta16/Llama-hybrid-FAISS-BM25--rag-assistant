The concepts in Linq (Where, Select, Aggregate) have been in LISP for years now, these aren't new at all. The implementation in C# is particularly elegant though, especially how it manages to add a pretty disruptive concept yet blend so well with existing C# 2.0 code. The "reinterpret Linq AST as SQL" is also pretty damn clever.
