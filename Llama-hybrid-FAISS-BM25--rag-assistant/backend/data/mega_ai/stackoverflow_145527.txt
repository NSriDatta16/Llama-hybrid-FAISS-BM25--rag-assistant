You don't have to type the same string over and over again in the HTML (which if nothing else would increase the number of typos to debug) You can hand over the HTML/CSS to a designer who need not have any javascript skills You have programmatic control over what callbacks are called and when It's more elegant because it fits the conceptual separation between layout and behaviour It's easier to modify and refactor On the last point, imagine if you wanted to add a "show comments" icon somewhere else in the template. It'd be very easy to bind the same callback to the icon.
