Polynomial regression assumes the samples are i.i.d, which is not the case for time series data. You can still use it, but it's something to be aware of. If you are only concerned with making good predictions I would look toward methods in machine learning like Random Forests. If you're comfortable with mathematics there are plenty of nice papers that deal with time series data in the field.
