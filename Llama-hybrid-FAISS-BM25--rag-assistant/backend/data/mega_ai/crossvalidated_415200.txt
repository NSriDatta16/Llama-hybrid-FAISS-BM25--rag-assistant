Estimating population variance considering both population sample variance AND sampling method variance

I want to estimate the variance of a normally distributed population. I can take N samples and calculate the sample mean and sample variance, which would normally suffice; however, the sampling method itself has inherent variability that is known. Is there a way to "subtract out" the known test method variance the get a better estimate of the population variance? To provide some context, I'm measuring density of an asphalt road after construction. Random locations are selected for measuring density for quality assurance. There are two methods, A and B, for measuring density and they have different known variance. The method variance was found by repeated measurements on known references. If I use Method A, with high variance, to and get N samples of the road density, I'll end up with a sample variance that is higher than if I used the more precise Method B. And in both cases, my variance will still be higher than the true variance of my sample. If I know the actual test method variance, isn't there some way to leverage that information when making an estimate of the sample and population variance?
