Effectively Design a Simple Mail Client

Requirement : JAVA desktop mail client which could connect to existing gmail,y! mail a/c & will allow receive/send mails, support offline view of mails, plus with more features as & when it comes. i am using Java Mail Api's Underlying Mail Storage: I have decided to use HSQLDB with Hibernate . Email content can have attachments , HTML , so i decided to use LONGVARBINARY type to store the email Body & attachments. Please let me know whether this approach is good & will it give me good performance when it comes to retrieval. Also give me some pointers on how to store java email objects in HSQLDB into LONGVARBINARY type & how to dereference it to get the actual data. ?? 2)I am confused over this because , with Approach 1 , i will end up storing all mail contents somehow on my local disk to enable offline viewing. And imagine if i have 1GB of mails >
