Simple answer is no , you should not. When performing a forecasting task, you don't want your trained model to have any information about the future it has to forecast . Otherwise, it might use this information. Now, if you are 100% sure that the latter data have no relation with the earlier, you could do a random train/test split (similarly using time series directly or features). For example, you could create a weather forecast model based on year 1990 and test it on year 1960 (I guess, I am no weather expert). In any case, if you can do without future data, I would say it is better (as there would be no data leak for sure).
