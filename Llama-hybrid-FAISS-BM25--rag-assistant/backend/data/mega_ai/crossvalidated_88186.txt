How to separate groups using PCA?

I have two groups: A ) controls: $25\times2000$, B ) patients: $12\times2000$. Group A has one PC explaining a lot of the variance. (Suggesting a homogenous population?) Group B cannot be explained by the first 2 or 3 (each of the PCs seem to be dominated by single patients). If I use the group A PC1 as an example of "normal control", is there a way to show how "far" or "close" each of the patients are from this? I.e. How can I establish that some patients are very similar to the controls and some aren't? I have 25 controls but only 12 patients. Each of them have a spectrogram (time x freq x channels) that is collapsed down to 1 vector.I have tried PCA on just the controls and get a good 1st PC (it's not dominated by any one subject) and looks like the individual data. With patients alone, I do not get this. If I do the PCA on both patients and normals [controls] together, the 1st PC still looks like the normals but it doesn't separate the 2 groups. So it was suggested to me to take the PCA of just normals and then project the patients into this space but how to do that is unclear. Just want to add - I don't think there are two populations; i.e., controls and patients are not very different (at least on the measure that I am using here). But, some patients are "farther apart" than others from the controls; i.e., some look like normals but others are very far from them.
