For completeness sake, here's a solution using a Bayesian model (using R and Stan ). We're going to fit a censored Poisson to the data (see the documentation of Stan for more information). The model assumes that the values are right censored at $5$ . To check whether the Poisson is a suitable model for the data, we're also going to generate a predictive distribution. The model uses a normal prior with mean $2$ and standard deviation $1$ for $\lambda$ . library(rstan) library(vcd) # The model model N; int Y[N]; int cens[N]; real lambda_start_mu; real lambda_start_sigma; } parameters { real lambda; } model { lambda ~ normal(lambda_start_mu, lambda_start_sigma); for(n in 1:N){ if (cens[n] == 0) { target += poisson_lpmf(Y[n] | lambda); } else if (cens[n] == 1) { target += poisson_lccdf(Y[n] | lambda); } } } generated quantities { int y_pred; y_pred = poisson_rng(lambda); }" # Prepare the data b The mean of the posterior distribution is $\hat{\lambda}=2.21$ and the 95% credible interval based on quantiles is $(1.96; 2.49)$ . This is very comparable with solutions based on maximum likelihood estimation. Let's use a rootogram using the predicted frequencies to check the model fit of a Poisson: mcmc_chain = 5] $x)) fitted n rootogram( obs, fitted , scale = "sqrt" , type = "hanging" , names = c(0:4, "5+") ) The red points display the square root of the expected counts. The square roots of the observed counts are shown as bars. Ideally, all bars are close to the 0 line. We can see that the Poisson seems not entirely ideal: We would expect a little more $0$ s and $3$ s and a little less $2$ s.
