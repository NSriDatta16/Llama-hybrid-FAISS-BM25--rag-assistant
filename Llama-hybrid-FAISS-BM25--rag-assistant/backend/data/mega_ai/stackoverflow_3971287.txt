I made use of this work flow where in our organization: http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/ We set up management of who can do what to what branch through gitolite. It has been a good "tail light to follow through the fog". With endless options that Git gives you, it's hard to make the decision for yourself as to what your work flow should be. Start with this one and adapt. It worked for us really well. We are using the .net stack with an OSS flavour (NHibernate, etc)
