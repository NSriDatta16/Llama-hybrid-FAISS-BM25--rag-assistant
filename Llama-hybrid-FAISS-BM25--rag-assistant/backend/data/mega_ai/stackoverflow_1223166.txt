Completely embedding a Silverlight Application in an HTML Page?

I am still trying to solve the issue of displaying an image on a website without having the image external. As the data: scheme does not work on older browsers or big images, I'm currently experimenting with Silverlight. I managed to solve the embedding by Base64 Encoding the Image and passing it in using the InitParams, but actually I just moved my problem away: Instead of an external Image, I now have an external XAP File... Is there a way taking the XAP File and somehow embedding it in the HTML? Or alternatively, can I use the JavaScript-based Silverlight 1.1 in this situation? It's literally just displaying an image that has been passed in as a String.
