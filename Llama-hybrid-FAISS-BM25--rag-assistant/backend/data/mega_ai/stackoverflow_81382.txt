I think that LINQ is a major change to .NET and it is a very powerful tool. I use LINQ to XML in production to parse and filter records from a 6MB XML file (with 20+ node levels) into a dataset in two lines of code. Before LINQ this would have taken hundreds of lines of code and days to debug. That's what I call elegant!
