How to interpret Pearl's do notation?

I'm going through the Dragonnet paper (slides available here ), and the authors use Pearl's do notation to make this claim: How can I interpret the do notation? Is the author claiming that the average treatment effect is the difference between the expectation of the outcome given that the entire population is treated and the same expectation given that the entire population is not treated? If so, why the conditioning on confounding effects would remove this need?
