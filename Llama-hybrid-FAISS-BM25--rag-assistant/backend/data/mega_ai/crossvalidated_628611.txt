One cause for the singular fit may be the decision to model an ordinal variable with Poisson regression. As @Björn and @SextusEmpiricus point out in the comments, the outcome — fat scores on a scale from 1 to 5 — is an ordinal variable: the scores are ordered categories, from least fat to most fat. It's appropriate to model these scores with ordinal logistic regression. (We use Poisson regression to model counts — number of occurrences — of an event in a fixed time interval.) Moreover, there are two post-treatment measurements (+ a baseline measurement taken before the treatment is applied) from each animal, so the observations are clustered. This suggests to use a mixed effects model for ordinal outcomes. Here are two options to fit such a model. Continuation ratio model with the GLMMadaptive package by @DimitrisRizopoulos. The code to specify the model would be something like this: fit See also this tutorial: Mixed Models for Ordinal Data . Bayesian proportional odds model with the rmsb package by @FrankHarrell. fit See also this section of Regression Modeling Strategies course: Bayesian Proportional Odds Random Effects Model . Finally, I suggest to consider treating the baseline score as a covariate (on the right side of the model formula) rather than an outcome (on the left side). That is, write the model as: Fat ~ factor(BaselineFat) + Sex * Treatment + Timepoint * Treatment after appropriately re-arranging the data. The motivation to do so is that the baseline, which is (likely to be) predictive of the outcome after treatment, is not itself affected by the treatment in a randomized experiment.
