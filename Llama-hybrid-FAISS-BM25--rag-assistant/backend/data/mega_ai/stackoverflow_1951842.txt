Call me crazy (I'm used to it!). I put my tests in the same assembly as the code under test. Code in namespace N.M gets tests in namespace N.M.Tests . In this way, internal types can easily be unit tested, which is appropriate for TDD. Without the complexity of additional assembly dependencies due to unit tests, you avoid the original problem. The main objection I hear to this is that you don't want to ship your tests to customers. However, unless bandwidth or storage are particularly constrained, I haven't seen a real reason that shipping tests is detrimental.
