Because a bootstrap by definition involves drawing a random sample (with replacement) which has the same sample size as the original dataset, i.e., $n$ objects. On average, when randomly drawing $n$ objects with replacement from a sample of $n$ objects, the probability that an object will not be selected is $(1-1/n)^n=\exp(-1)=0.368$ . Thus, the probability that an object will be drawn into the bootstrap sample is $1-0.368 = 0.632$ . So Friedman is most likely saying that the 0.5 is close to the 0.6.
