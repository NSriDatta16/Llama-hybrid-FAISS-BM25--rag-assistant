jquery toggle accordian without plugin

Hi have two content sections and i only want 1 open at a time. They both collapse and open based on clicking the headings. I have it currently working where they are independent of each other but i am looking to have them hide the other when it is shown. I dont want to have to use the plugin for jquery accordion. here is the code i have now: HTML: Most Searched Categories content 1 All Categories content 2 JS: $('#allCatsContainer').css("display", "none"); $('.topCats h4 a').click( function() { $('#topCatsContainer').slideToggle(500); $(this).toggleClass("openBox"); }); $('.allCats h4 a').click( function() { $('#allCatsContainer').slideToggle(500); $(this).toggleClass("openBox"); }); Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks
