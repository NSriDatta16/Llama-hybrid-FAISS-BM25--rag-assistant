This is the standard list of books I hound people in my office to read, and the order in which I would read them: Agile Principles, Patterns, and Practices in C# - Robert C. Martin, Micah Martin Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code – Martin Fowler Working Effectively With Legacy Code – Michael Feathers Domain Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software – Eric Evans Applying Domain Driven Design and Patterns: With Examples in C# - Jimmy Nilsson If you only want to read one book, read the Robert C. Martin book. It will make you want to read others. The Refactoring book is mostly a catalog of techniques, more of a reference book than an instruction manual, but still very well worth having. If you're doing all greenfield development right now, save the Legacy Code book for last.
