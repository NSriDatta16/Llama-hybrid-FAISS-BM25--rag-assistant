Having used DevExpress controls extensively, I assume that you're talking about XtraGrid. XtraGrid doesn't have any objects for individual rows and cells, forcing you to use Row Handles along with lots of methods on GridView to do anything to the grid. This makes the grid much more scalable; XtraGrid will perform much faster on large datasets than its competitors, which have objects for each row and cell (I speak from personal experience). I haven't had any trouble with XtraEditors; once you get used to the RepositoryItem class and the Properties property (which are necessary for embedding), they're not hard to use.
