Suppress warning on unused exception variable in C#

I have this code: try { someMethod(); } catch (XYZException e) { // do something without using e } Doing this will give me a warning about declaring but never using e , which I hate. However, I also don't want to use a catch clause without that variable, because then it will catch all exceptions, not just XYZException s. This seems like a fairly often occurring pattern. I know I can use #pragma warning disable 0168 to suppress the warning, but I don't really find that a very elegant solution. Is there a better way?
