I don't really see what you're asking, but it seems that you want to know how to perform queries in CI? In which case I suggest you take a good read of the docs $this->db->select('pcat, pcatid'); $this->db->distinct(); $this->db->from('pcategory'); $this->db->join('projects', 'pcategory.pcatid = projects.pid', 'inner'); $this->db->order_by('pcat', 'DESC'); $result = $this->db->get(); I very much doubt this will work as I do not know your table structure but may give you an idea of how to use the active record class in CI. You can of course just use the query method: $results = $this->db->query('YOUR QUERY HERE'); the active record class can do a lot of the work for you, however. As for about being difficult to do in CI, this is simply untrue - you just need a clearer picture and understanding of what you want to achieve. Edit $jobcat=$row2['pcatid']; $queryall3 = "select projid, projtit, projcost, projdate from projects where projcat= '$jobcat'"; $results=$this->db->query($queryall3); $data = $results->result_array(); // get the results of the 3rd query as an array // new query $this->db->select('query_4_select'); // select whatever you need $this->db->from('whatever_table'); // this probably isn't the most efficient way, but for examples sake: foreach($data as $row) // using the result_array from above { $this->db->or_where('query_4_id', $row['id']); // the magic !! } $new_results = $this->db->get(); So essentially, you get the ID's from query 3, run it through a foreach and build a where x=x or x=y or x=b type query, which will then (hopefully) return the desired results. This is one way, you will need to tweak it. But it sounds like you can just use a join? Perhaps if you could post your entire tables structure.
