Which logit or probit model should I use for multiple response / dependent variables?

I have $300$ time series objects that constitute the $300$ columns of matrix $X$. This matrix has $5$ rows and represents $5$ days of time series information for each $300$ columns. I set up a $300\textrm{x}5$ matrix of binary values. So the first row might look something like $(1 1 0 0 1)$, which would mean that column $1$ of $X$ had negative elements in the 1st, 2nd and 5th rows (modeled by category "$1$"), and positive elements in the 3rd and 4th rows (modeled by category "$0$"). I have $8$ predictor variables that explains/relates well to whether there are more negative elements early (i.e. if we observe something like $(1 1 0 0 0)$) versus whether there are more negative elements later (i.e. we observe something like $(0 0 0 1 1)$). How do I model this? My knowledge is not expansive enough to know if there's any statistical framework where I can use this matrix as my response: $ Y = \left( \begin{array}{ccccc} 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\ . & . & . & . & . \\ \end{array} \right) $ Using this I want to do something like: $\mathbf{Y} = a + \mathbf{B}\mathbf{Z}$ (I understand that this is not a correct logit/probit specification, but I think it's fine for communicating what I want). Then the ideal interpretation of some coefficient $b_i \in \mathbf{B}$ would be; if it's negative, then we have increased odds of seeing something like $(11000)$ instead of something like $(00011)$ if the associated predictor $x_i \in \mathbf{Z}$ is larger.
