I name my tests after the input, not after the output. I describe the scenario which is being tested: I don't try to define, in the name of the test case, what the required output is in that scenario. For example, the following test the behaviour of the Backspace key in a text editor, in various scenarios: Backspace after space Backspace around edges of inline textrun Backspace at beginning of paragraph Backspace near end of line Backspace normalize within paragraph Backspace selected word and both spaces Backspace selected word and space Backspace selected word Backspace selection spans two paragraphs Backspace several words Backspace space and selected word Backspace to far edge of other block Thus you can see more-or-less what scenarios are being tested (but it doesn't also try to tell you what the expected behaviour is in each scenario).
