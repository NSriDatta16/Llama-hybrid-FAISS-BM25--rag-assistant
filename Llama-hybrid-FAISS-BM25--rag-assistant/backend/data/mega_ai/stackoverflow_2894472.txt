Parsing PE files is possible using the Microsoft Portable Executable Specification Document . However, as Logan noted, the signatures are not included in the PE file; only the names of the exported functions are included. UPDATE: If your dll is a C++ dll created by a recent version of Microsoft's C++ compiler, then you can undecorate the mangled name to get most of the signature by calling this function: UnDecorateSymbolName from Debugging Tools for Windows . However, the return value is not included in the mangled name.
