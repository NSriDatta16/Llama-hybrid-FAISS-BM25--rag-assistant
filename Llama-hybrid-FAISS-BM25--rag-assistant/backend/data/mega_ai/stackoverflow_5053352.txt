jQuery sortable is hard to use b/c it's easy to drag outside the lines - what should I do?

I'm using the jQuery ui's sortable feature: http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/ Works great as long as the user never drags the handle past the left border of the containing , but in practice this is easy to do - and even easier on my website, where the sortable handles have a little less whitespace to the left... Ideas? Thanks!
