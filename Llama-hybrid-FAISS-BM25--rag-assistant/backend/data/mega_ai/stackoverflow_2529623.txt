Try this code with a PictureBox instead (just to get you started - there are many different ways of doing this): private void pictureBox1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { if (pictureBox1.Image == null) { pictureBox1.Image = new Bitmap(pictureBox1.width, pictureBox1.height); } using (Graphics g = Graphics.FromImage(pictureBox1.Image)) { // draw black background g.Clear(Color.Black); Rectangle rect = new Rectangle(100, 100, 200, 200); g.DrawRectangle(Pens.Red, rect); } pictureBox1.Invalidate(); } This technique will automatically "persist" your drawing, meaning that it won't disappear if another windows gets dragged across it. When you draw to a control directly (what you're trying to do with the CreateGraphics() call) you usually run into the problem of non-persistency. Update : here's another answer with a more detailed example of drawing something in response to where the mouse is clicked: how to draw drawings in picture box
