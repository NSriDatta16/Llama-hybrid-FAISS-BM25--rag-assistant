It appears that the issue is not in MSBuild but in the Version Control Settings for your TeamCity project configuration. Verify that the files you expect to be there are in the work subdirectory on the build agent. Compare those against your Visual Studio project and the build log; verify that the paths are correct. You can also post questions on the TeamCity Developer Community .
