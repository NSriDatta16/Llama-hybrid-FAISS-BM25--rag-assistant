An easy way to do this would be to have a box accepting floating point input and another control to select units. For example Time: [ 4.1 ] [ hours ] Your server code can enumerate the units for generating the control and interpreting the submission. The explicit mention of the units in the control right next to the number entry should help with users not reading instructions â€” they're probably far more likely to do the right thing if it's there with the data they're entering, than to read every little detail in the fine print a paragraph above it. (Having said that, I really like Anton Gogolev's answer too. If you can pull it off, do that.)
