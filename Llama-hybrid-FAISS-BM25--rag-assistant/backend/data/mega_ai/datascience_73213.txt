Decision Tree has 2 key benefits over Random Forest: Interpretability – In many domain, this is a must. Faster prediction time – Can be an issue with RF (if n_estomators is too high) and when it has to be an online prediction. Unless you have these constraints , RF is the go-to algorithm. For sparse and high-dimension data, SVM should also be tried.
