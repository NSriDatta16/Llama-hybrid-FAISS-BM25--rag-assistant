Product options and Add To Cart button don't appear on some pages in Magento

I have this issue where on some products the Add To Cart button and product options do not show up on the page. I have traced the code and have determined the problem is with the isSaleable attribute. Tracing the code it seems like it should be returning true and if I hard code true in the isSaleable function everything shows up correctly. It seems to only be doing this for configurable products. Looking at the code and it looks like to me that the Config product bases the isSaleable on whether the product is enabled or disabled. My question is, am I missing something else here and what would the repercussions would be if I were to just make that function return true all the time? We do not really use stock tracking.
