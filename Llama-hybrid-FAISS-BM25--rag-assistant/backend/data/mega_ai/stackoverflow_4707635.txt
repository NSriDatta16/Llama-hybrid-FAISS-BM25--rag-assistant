Break it down. You've tried to call Mage::getModel('mymodule/mymodel')->batch(); and PHP told you it tried to call the method batch on a non-object . That means Mage::getModel('mymodule/mymodel') isn't returning a Model object the way it's supposed to. First thing to do is clear out your Magento cache on the server you're having problems with. If your Module's config hasn't been loaded into the global config tree Magento will try to instantiate a Mage_Core_Model_Mymodel, and fail. Second step is to make sure your module's app/etc/module file is in place. Third step is to add some debugging (assuming a 1.4 branch) to the method that instantiates your objects and determine why Magento can't create your object File: app/code/core/Mage/Core/Model/Config.php ... public function getModelInstance($modelClass='', $constructArguments=array()) { $className = $this->getModelClassName($modelClass); if (class_exists($className)) { Varien_Profiler::start('CORE::create_object_of::'.$className); $obj = new $className($constructArguments); Varien_Profiler::stop('CORE::create_object_of::'.$className); return $obj; } else { #throw Mage::exception('Mage_Core', Mage::helper('core')->__('Model class does not exist: %s.', $modelClass)); return false; } } ...
