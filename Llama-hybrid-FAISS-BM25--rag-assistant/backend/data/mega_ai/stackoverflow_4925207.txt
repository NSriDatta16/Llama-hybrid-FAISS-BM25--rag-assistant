Can I block Chrome’s drag-to-expand feature?

In Chrome, the bottom right of fields can be pulled to expand the text area. This has its advantages sometimes, but sometimes, it does not. (This discussion is for another time.) What I want to know is how I can block this behaviour, if possible. I’m thinking something along the lines of some JS/jQuery dingus, but I don’t really know how Google programmed the feature. Has anyone dabbled with this?
