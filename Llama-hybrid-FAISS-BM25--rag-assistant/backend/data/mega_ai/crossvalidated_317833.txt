Optimize resource allocation based on total revenue

I've historical data about different types of interventions my nurses work on. Think about it this way: if a customer has diabetes and the nurse decides to intervene, then the nurse achieves a return $x on her effort with probability px. Aggregate data (at intervention type level) looks like: interve_type average_success average_return_on_success_cases tot_volume A 0.23 $2000 3000 B 0.07 $10000 500 C 0.65 $700 2500 If I set the total number of intervention (volume) I can do in a given time frame how do I find the optimal order of interventions? Is this as easy as deriving the expected return per intervention type and sorting on that?
