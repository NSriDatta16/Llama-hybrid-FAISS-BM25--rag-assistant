Windows not drawing above OpenGL windows

I have an application with an OpenGL window as a child window of the main window. When I display a dialog box above the OpenGL window, it doesn't get drawn. It's like it's not getting WM_PAINT messages. If I can guess the title bar position of the dialog box, I can drag it and it's still responsive. I realise this might be a vague question, but I was wondering if anyone else has seen this sort of behaviour before and knew of a solution? I wondered if the Pixel Format Descriptor would make a difference - I had PFD_DRAW_TO_WINDOW , but changing to PDF_DRAW_TO_BITMAP didn't make any difference. I'm not sure what else I should be looking at?
