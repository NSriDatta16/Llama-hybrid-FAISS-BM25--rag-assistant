How to get Indexing Service and MODI to produce Full-text over OCR?

I have configured Indexing Service to index my files, which also include scanned images saved as hi-res TIFF files. I also installed MS Office 2003+ and configured MS Office Document Imaging (MODI) correctly, so I can perform OCR on my images and even embed the OCR 'd text into TIFFs. Indexing Service is able to index and find those TIFF -s that were manually OCR'd and re-saved with text data (using MS Document Imaging tool). Turns out, Data Execution Prevention (DEP) which is deployed with Windows XP SP2 thinks MODI is malicious and refuses to let it do its magic. I have been able to get it to work by turning DEP off completely, but I found this solution to be inelegant. Is there a better solution to make this work, without disabling DEP?
