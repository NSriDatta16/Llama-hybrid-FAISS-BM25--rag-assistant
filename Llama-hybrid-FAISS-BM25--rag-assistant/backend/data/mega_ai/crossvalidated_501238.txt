How to Transfer Learning with Autoencoders?

I have been thinking to train a variational autoencoder on a larger texture dataset, so that I can fine-tune it on my specific texture dataset and hope that the reconstruction would be better. I did not really find anything on how to do this fine-tuning with autoencoders. Do I add a layer before and after the latent vector or do I have to do something else?
