What tests to analyze the following hypotheses with nominal data?

I have a set of questionnaire data to analyze the working culture for respondents. (There are four existing cultures; a,b,c and d) Variables including Gender, Organization, Public/Private Sector, Company Size and Culture. I would like to test the following hypotheses: Among public sector, culture B is dominant . Any type of culture is presented in Private Sector. Culture B is dominant in company with size over 1000 employees. These hypotheses can all be easily shown in charts. However, since the variables are all nominal and ordinal data, I do not have any idea on which statistical test to apply in SPSS. I would be much appreciate if anyone can discuss with me and give me an idea on it. Thanks in advance.
