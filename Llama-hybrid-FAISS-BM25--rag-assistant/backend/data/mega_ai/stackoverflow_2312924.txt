FileNotFoundException when file exists with all permissions

I am trying to read a file and the error i get is java.io.FileNotFoundException: /homes/at1106/fourthYearComputing/Individual-Project/svn-workspace/trunk/Individual_Project/src/game/player/gametheoryagent/configurations/gameTheoryAgentConfiguration.properties (No such file or directory) at java.io.FileInputStream.open(Native Method) at java.io.FileInputStream. (FileInputStream.java:106) at game.player.gametheoryagent.GameTheoryAgent. (GameTheoryAgent.java:67) at simulation.Simulator.createPlayer(Simulator.java:141) at simulation.Simulator.main(Simulator.java:64) however the file does exist and just to double check i gave it 777 permissions, as shown below: tui% cd /homes/at1106/fourthYearComputing/Individual-Project/svn-workspace/trunk/Individual_Project/src/game/player/gametheoryagent/configurations tui% ls -al total 4 drwxrwxrwx 3 at1106 cs4 1024 2010-02-22 17:45 . drwxrwxrwx 4 at1106 cs4 1024 2010-02-22 17:27 .. -rwxrwxrwx 1 at1106 cs4 260 2010-02-22 17:31 gameTheoryAgentConfiguration.properties drwxrwxrwx 6 at1106 cs4 1024 2010-02-22 17:41 .svn Any ideas as to why I'm getting the FNF exception? Thanks java code that makes the call: File file = new File(pathToConfiguration) Properties configuration = new Properties(); try{ configuration.load(new FileInputStream(file)); int RAISE_RATIO = Integer.parseInt(configuration.getProperty("raise_ratio")); } catch(IOException event){ System.err.println("Error in reading configuration file " + pathToConfiguration); event.printStackTrace(); } The properties file reads: raise_ratio=4 This was tested in windows (with a diff pathToConfiguration (which is passed into the constructor)) and works fine. Added in the following checks in the Catch block if(file.exists()){ System.out.println("file exists"); } else{ System.out.println("file doesn't exist"); } System.out.println(file.getAbsolutePath()); if(file.canRead()){ System.out.println("can read"); } if(file.canWrite()){ System.out.println("can write"); } the output is as follows: file doesn't exist /homes/at1106/fourthYearComputing/Individual-Project/svn-workspace/trunk/Individual_Project/src/game/player/gametheoryagent/configurations/gameTheoryAgentConfiguration.properties
