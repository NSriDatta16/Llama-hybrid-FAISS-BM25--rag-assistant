estimation of a yearly prediction interval for monthly data

I have a monthly time series and my objective is to provide my client with the next 12 point forecasts along with a yearly forecast. To obtain the yearly forecast, I simply summed up the 12 points forecasts. And, to associate this yearly forecast with a prediction interval, I came up with the following solution which does not make an assumption of the distribution of the residuals: Predict the 12 point forecasts using a model (ex. ARIMA or Prophet). Check that the residuals are uncorrelated. If it is the case then: To each of the 12 point forecasts yhat_i, add an epsilon e_i drawn from the train residuals (yhatâ€™_i = yhat_i + e_i) . Sum the noisy yhat_i to obtain a noisy yearly forecast. Repeat steps 2 and 3 a large number of times (ex. 1000). Select the quantiles (alpha/2, 1-alpha/2) which constitute the yearly prediction interval with alpha being the risk level. Let me know what you think
