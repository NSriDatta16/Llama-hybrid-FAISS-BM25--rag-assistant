NMF is not a classifier -- it is a transformation (or, more specifically, a factorization). We have $V \sim W H$, where (depending on your perspective) each column of $H$ corresponds to some "proto-image", and each row of $W$ corresponds to the amount that the corresponding row of $V$ is made up of each image. One approach that I might suggest (and this is not the only approach) is to take your lower-dimensional data $W$ and use some other classification method on top of that. From this perspective there is no need for the basis vectors in $H$; you operate only with $W$. So this is like seeing NMF as a preprocessing dimensionality reduction step before some out-of-the-box classifier. An advantage here is that the rank of your decomposition is often much lower than your original dimensionality, which can (among other things) reduce the necessary training time.
