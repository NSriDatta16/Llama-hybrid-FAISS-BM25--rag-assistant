It depends on the problem. If you know what the problem is [allow customers to see online bank statements], and how to solve it then use a bottom-up approach. Analyse each step, group these together by area and develop a solution. Project plan based. If you have a vague idea of the problem [allow field agents to communicate via a distributed offline/online wiki] then a top-down approach would work better. Look at the over all problem and what steps can be used to solve them. Trial and error. Agile.
