If there is no link between 2 and 8 on your graph, then any chromosome with 2|8 or 8|2 in it is invalid for the classical travelling salesman problem . If you find some other route between 2 and 8, you are probably going to violate the "visit each location once" requirement. One really dodgy-but-pragmatic solution is to include edges between those nodes with incredibly high distances, or even +INF if your language supports it. That way, your standard minimizing fitness function will naturally prune them. I think the original formulation of the problem includes edges between all nodes, so this is a non-issue.
