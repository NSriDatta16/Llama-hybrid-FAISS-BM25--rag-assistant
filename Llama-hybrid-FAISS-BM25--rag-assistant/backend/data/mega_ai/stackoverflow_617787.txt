Why should I use a thread vs. using a process?

Separating different parts of a program into different processes seems (to me) to make a more elegant program than just threading everything. In what scenario would it make sense to make things run on a thread vs. separating the program into different processes? When should I use a thread? Edit Anything on how (or if) they act differently with single-core and multi-core would also be helpful.
