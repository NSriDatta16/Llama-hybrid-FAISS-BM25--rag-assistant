This is a valid approach. Neural networks are indeed often used to simulate results of some exact, computationally heavy models. For example, Nvidia speeds up raytracing using neural nets . The benefit is, since your model is very accurate, it can generate a huge dataset, which is exactly what neural networks need. Sometimes, this is also successfully used in the form where a large neural network is trained, and then a second, smaller one is trained to simulate its outputs, leading to a compact, computationally more efficient model with similar performance. Relevant articles on the topic include Do Deep Nets Really Need to be Deep? and Distilling the Knowledge in a Neural Network .
