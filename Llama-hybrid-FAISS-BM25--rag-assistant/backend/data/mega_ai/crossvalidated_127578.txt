I think running simulations can give good intuition on how common an outcome may be given random chance. Say you have 10 volunteers who try 100 crackers each. The first five volunteers use strategy #1, while the second five use strategy #2. Both strategies have 50% chance of being successful on any given attempt. Then we can make this simple simulation using R: # Set the parameters for the simulation Nsim=10000; Ncrackers=100; Nvolunteers=10; Pwin1=.5; Pwin2=.5; StrategyUsed=c(rep(1,Nvolunteers/2),rep(2,Nvolunteers/2)) dat=matrix(nrow=Ncrackers, ncol=Nvolunteers) # Create matrix to hold the Individual Results Percent.Success=matrix(nrow=Nsim, ncol=Nvolunteers) # Create matrix to hold the Success Rates for(sim in 1:Nsim){ # Simulate the results for each volunteer for(v in 1:Nvolunteers){ if(StrategyUsed[v]==1){ dat[,v] 10))/Nsim Here is an example of one of the results: Here the top two charts are distribution of percent success from all the simulations. The bottom is the distribution of the differences between the two strategies on average: The last line calculates the percent of time the differences between the two groups was greater than 10%. For these specific simulations it was only 0.16%. #Calculate the percent of simulation results beyond threshold = 10% > 100*length(which(abs(SuccessDifferences)>10))/Nsim [1] 0.16 Is an outcome that occurs 0.16% of the time rare enough to be considered not random chance? That is up to you. Also if there were a differences between volunteers using the two strategies it is not correct to then assume the differences is due to the strategy. Other possibilities need to be ruled out, for example maybe volunteers 1:5 got a different batch of crackers than volunteers 6:10, etc. Edit: Also: I have not run the experiment yet so any suggestions (for example collect every event individually if this helps the analysis) would be much appreciated also. Yes, collect as much data as is practical to collect then plot it vs time and anything else you can think of. The reason is that if you find patterns in the individual events (eg many wins early, fewer later) then there may be other processes going on that may be interesting. For example, perhaps learning is occurring, or fatigue/boredom. These other aspects may differ between the groups and result in differences confounding the theorized effect due to strategy. The important thing is to be ready to rule out as many explanations for an observed effect as possible, then the ones not ruled out may explain them. Exploring the data that way would not mean you can conclude any apparent patterns are not "random chance", but it may cast doubt on interpreting the results in favor of the strategy effect. Just ruling out that two groups are exactly the same is not very informative without that.
