Predict rare events based on many continuous time series variables

It seems to be a common practical problem but I didn't find lots of information how to solve it. I want to predict rare events (1x/month) (e.g. a machine breaks) based on sensor data (~100 variables) with a sampling rate of 1 minute. My goal is to predict the machine failure as long as possible before (e.g. 1h-6h) with a certain level of confidence. My raw data looks like this: Timestamp Var1 Var2 VarN Status ... 2016-01-01 12:00 1.2 1000 -0.2 Ok 2016-01-01 12:01 1.6 982 0 Ok 2016-01-01 12:02 1.1 541 -0.1 Failure ... I started with adding new features like the moving average for the last 15min., 30min., 45min, 1h and also the variable changes like Var1[i]-Var1[i-1], etc. But now I am facing the following problem: As I want to make a forecast I have to know in advance how many rows before the actual failure event I want to include and label with "Failure", you know what I mean? It would be very helpful if you can give me some ideas or best practices for that kind of problem, Thanks!
