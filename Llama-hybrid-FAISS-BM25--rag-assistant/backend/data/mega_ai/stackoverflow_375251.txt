You could execute the wscript by using a SQL Server Agent task with a type of "Operpating System (CmdExec)". This requires that xp_cmdshell be enabled and it is often disabled (by default) due to security concerns. However, it does allow you to initiate programs, such as wscript, that are run at the command prompt. You could move the code into SQLCLR where you can write a stored procedure in C# or VB.Net. The VB.Net SQLCLR Code would be pretty similar to your original wscript.
