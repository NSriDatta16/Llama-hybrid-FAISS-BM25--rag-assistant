Your two inner structs are nested types , not instance members. Nested types have no effect on instances of the parent types; they are a purely organizational concept (except that they can access the parent type's private members) Therefore, your SMB_MESSAGE struct doesn't actually have any instance members. You need to make four normal structs, then make two properties in SMB_MESSAGE holding the other two structures. For example: public struct SMB_MESSAGE { public SMB_PARAMETERS Parameters; public SMB_DATA Data; } public struct SMB_PARAMETERS { public byte WordCount; public ushort[] Words; } public struct SMB_DATA { public ushort ByteCount; public Bytes Bytes; } public struct Bytes { public ushort BufferFormat; public byte[] Name; }
