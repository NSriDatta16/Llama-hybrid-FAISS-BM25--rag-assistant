Binding image in Isolated Storage

Hey. I have a list of items that the user can search. The search results are displayed in a listbox. Each animal object has a path to an image in Isolated Storage. What's the quickest way to bind my Image control inside the listboxitem to the image in the isolated storage? Examples I've seen tend to display images from the internet rather than Isolated Storage. If I have around 10 images, it seems to take up all the memory and crash. thanks EDIT: I'm using this in my BitmapConverter class (inherits IValueConverter) public object Convert(object value, Type targetType, object parameter, System.Globalization.CultureInfo culture) { if (value !=null) { BitmapImage bitmapImage = new BitmapImage(); bitmapImage.SetSource(new MemoryStream((Byte[]) value)); return bitmapImage; } else { return null; } } I have this at the top of my AppResource.xaml file: In my style, within the AppResource.xaml file: I set a breakpoint in my BitmapConverter, but it's never called. I've never used IValueConverter before, so any help would be great. Thanks
