The data engineering team should make it easy for others to access and query data. However, I would not say that they need to be experts at the data. If it's complex data then documentation of it should be written and maintained by a domain expert. This could be a business analyst, data scientist, or data analyst as an example. Taking the data science hat on me, I prefer as raw data as I almost can get. I need to know how my data is preprocessed and need to do it either myself, or in together with data engineers :) As an example N/A values can actually be informative and helpfull when building models. Hope that gives some context
