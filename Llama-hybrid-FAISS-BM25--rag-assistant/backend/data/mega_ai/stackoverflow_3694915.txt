This is the place in the C library where it is actually looking at your number in order to format it as a string, and it indicates that the number you are formatting came from uninitialized storage. Add the valgrind option --track-origins=yes for more details on the origin of the uninitialized value. Because it is common to copy around uninitialized memory, e.g. padding in structures, valgrind tracks copying of uninitialized values and does not complain until the point where the value is actually used in a way that might affect your program's externally-visible behavior. This can make it confusing to determine the original source of the uninitialized value, since it may have been copied several times before anything else was done with it. The option --track-origins=yes tracks additional information to pinpoint the origin of the uninitialized value, so that this can be displayed in the event that the uninitialized value ends up being used.
