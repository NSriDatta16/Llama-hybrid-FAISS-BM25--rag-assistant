This is something that the public API does not provide, but could be useful to many people. Your primary recourse is to file a bug with Apple that describes what you need (and it can be helpful to explain why you need it as well). Hopefully your request could make it into a future release. After filing a bug, you could also use one of the Developer Technical Support (DTS) incidents that came with your iPhone Developer Program membership. If there is a public way to do this, an Apple engineer will know. Otherwise, it may at least help get your plight a bit more attention within the mothership. Best of luck!
