Gordon's answer is "the Ruby Way," and although it is a common practice to put one line in braces, it is not required. Also note the ease with which one can act on the resulting value: cmds.each do |cmd| cmd.upcase! end.sort # Now, cmds = ["CREATE", "HELP", "LIST", "UPDATE"] Although you might already see how {} is more readable here, and therefore preferred if anyone else is going to see your code: cmds.each { |cmd| cmd.upcase! }.sort
