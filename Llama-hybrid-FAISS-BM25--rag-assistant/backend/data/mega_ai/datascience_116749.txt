You have multiple problems. I advise you to break it down and tackle each one at the time. The first problem is the fact that your dataset seems extremely imbalanced, take a look at the methods of image classification on imbalanced dataset. This post is a good starting point. For the size of your database, I suggest you use a relatively small size CNN with modern regularization techniques, and also use hyperparameter tuning with Bayesian Optimization. Try this and if it didn't work, try larger models. I say this because training on large dataset gets more expensive with larger models. Hope this helps.
