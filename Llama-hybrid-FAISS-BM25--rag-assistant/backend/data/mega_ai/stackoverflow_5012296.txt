Mark Nold's answer is generally correct except you should rather use WinHTTP instead of ServerXMLHTTP to avoid dealing with having to set proxies etc. Also set the Content-Type header appropriately. This should most likely be "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" (more on that here: http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#h-17.13.4 ) Finally you must send the data with in the Send() call. form_data = "entry.0.single=some_username&entry.1.single=some_key&pageNumber=0&backupCache=&submit=Submit" http.SetRequestHeader "Content-Type", "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" http.Send form_data
