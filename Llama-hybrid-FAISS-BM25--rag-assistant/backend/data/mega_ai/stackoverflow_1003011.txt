Oracle 10g PL/SQL- Select results as update column values

Is there a way to easily/elegantly update multiple columns in a table with record values from a query in Oracle 10g? I have a table (call it Source) which has for simplicities sake, 2 columns, ID and KEY . ID Key ---- ---- 1 1000 2 1000 3 5000 4 1000 .. 101 8000 102 9000 103 7000 104 9000 ... 201 5 202 5 ... I have another table (call it KeyMap ) that takes trunc(ID/100) and uses it as a batchID with the columns being a key map for the IDs within the batch: trunc(ID/100) key1 key2 key3 key4 ..... key99 ------------- ---- ---- ---- ---- 0 1000 1000 5000 1000 1 8000 9000 7000 9000 2 5 5 The ID's are created and processed in batches, so at the conclusion of the batch processing I would like to call a stored procedure to update the record in the KeyMap table with the new Key values with 1 update statement using a sub-select or collection providing those key values. Is this possible and what is the best/most efficient way of doing this?
