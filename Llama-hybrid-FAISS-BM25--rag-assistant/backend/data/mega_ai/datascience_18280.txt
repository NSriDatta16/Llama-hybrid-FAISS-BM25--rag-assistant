I have n dimensional data and I want to check integrity, can I downgrade to 2 dimensional feature space via PCA and do so?

Say I have n dimensional data samples. I want to check the integrity of the features, if they are good representation of the respective classes, i.e. these features are good or not. My plan is: I use PCA and convert this to 2 dim data. Plot this data. See if they're separable enough. Does the above plan sound okay for testing to see if features are any good?
