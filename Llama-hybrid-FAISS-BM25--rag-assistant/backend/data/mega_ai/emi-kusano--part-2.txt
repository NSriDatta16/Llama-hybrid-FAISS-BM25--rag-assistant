In April 2024, Emi Kusano spoke at the Standing Committee on Copyright and Other Rights at the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) in Geneva, Switzerland, where she presented AI-specific information for discussion. Style and technique Kusano draws inspiration from Japanese retro-futurism as a foundation for her artwork, which explores the cutting-edge of technology. This approach is fueled by nostalgia for the pre-internet era, specifically the postwar period when Japanese mass media held significant sway. By blending modern technology with retro-culture, she captures the complex feelings of love, hate, and ambivalence towards present and future accelerationism. While at university, Kusano was profoundly influenced by Naoki Sakai, the industrial designer responsible for igniting the retro-futurism movement. In her musical project "Satellite Young", Kusano dons the persona of an '80s female idol and sings about contemporary technology. In her installation piece "Singing Dream", she investigates the concept of an artificial life form inhabiting a karaoke machine, which has been popular since the 1980s, compelling people to sing. In the collaborative NFT art project "Shinsei Galverse", Kusano reimagines a cyberpunk anime primarily featuring female characters, incorporating elements of magical girls popular in the early Heisei period. Personal life Kusano has two sons. In August 2021, she minted her older son Zombie Zoo Keeper's pixel art on "OpenSea" as part of his summer research project. The artwork was purchased by notable figures including Brud CEO Trevor McFedries and Steve Aoki, who bought the piece for the equivalent of 21.82 thousand US dollars, highlighting the intersection of art, technology, and family in her work.
