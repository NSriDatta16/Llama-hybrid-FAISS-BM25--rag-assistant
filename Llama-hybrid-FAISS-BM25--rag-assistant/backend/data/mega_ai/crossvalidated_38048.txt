Good resources for learning Probabilistic Graphical Models

I recently started taking Probabilistic Graphical Models on coursera, and 2 weeks after starting I am starting to believe I am not that great in Probability and as a result of that I am not even able to follow the first topic (Bayesian Network). That being said I want to make an effort to learn this course, so can you suggest me some other resources for PGM or for Probability which can be helpful in understanding this course.
