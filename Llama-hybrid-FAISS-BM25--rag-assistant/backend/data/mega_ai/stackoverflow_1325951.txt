GWT lets you build using an MVC architecture and provide many view components. I don't see it mentioned in these other links and may fit your bill. jQuery isn't really MVC, but works really well. jQuery + jQuery plugins provides you an organizing structure that helps deal with the complexity and separation of concerns, the same way MVC does. Using this pattern, we've been able to delay a bulky MVC structure, and reserve it for just a few key components.
