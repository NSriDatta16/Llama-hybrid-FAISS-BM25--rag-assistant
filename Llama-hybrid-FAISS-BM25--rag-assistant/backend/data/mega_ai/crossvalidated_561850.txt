learning approach for an expert system

Step 1: I developed an expert system that classifies data into two classes, each rule in this expert system has a certainty factor (expert opinions). Step 2: The input of the system is a group of sentences and the output is classified sentences into two classes like c1, c2. Step 3: The user has to mark the sentences placed in the wrong. Step 4: the system shall edit rules certainty factors depending on the user's feedback, to make the system more accurate. I want a machine learning algorithm that uses my rules to classify the data. not: l have a labeled dataset
