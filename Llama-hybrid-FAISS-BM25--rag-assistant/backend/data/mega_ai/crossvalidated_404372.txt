Logistic regression with ordinal independent variable

I want to see whether patients have a higher risk of seizures, the bigger their brain tumor. My dependent variable is therefore "seizure (yes, no)" and my independent variable is "tumor size" ranging from 1 to 5. There is a significant correlation if I just type logistic risk size creating a logistic regression for the variable, but if I run it as logistic risk i.size there is no change, but I can see the value gets more significant the larger the tumor. I'm quite suspicious this change is significant but I think my problem is I can't get it to recognize it as an ordinal variable. Perhaps the solution is simply not to treat it as ordinal but as continuous, and therefore my original result is true?
