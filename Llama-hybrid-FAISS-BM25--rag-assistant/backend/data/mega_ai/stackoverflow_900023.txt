That error has absolutely nothing to do with authentication. You are reusing a connection from the middle before you closed your SqlDataReader returned from an ExecuteReader(). This is forbidden. You must check your code and eliminate your problem. There are alternatives to use MARS ( multiple active record sets ) but I would strongly discourage that. Using multiple connections in your application will probably be even worse because apparently you don't know what connection are in use and when, so when you'll use separate connections you will run into transaction consistency problems.
