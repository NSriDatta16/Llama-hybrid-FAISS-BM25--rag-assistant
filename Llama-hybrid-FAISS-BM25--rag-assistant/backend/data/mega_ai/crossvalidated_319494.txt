Showing Bayesian updating in R

I'm very new to Bayesian and am very interested in understanding the concept that each posterior from a previous test, can be used as a prior for a current test or in Lindley's (2000) words 'Yesterday's posterior is today's prior' . To see this in action, however, I was wondering if I could explore this concept in R as a function for the simple problem of estimating the probability of success from binomially distributed data. I tried something but my R skills were not advanced enough to show this updating concept. Since Stack Overflow was not of much help, I am wondering if any of our colleagues here might know the trick? (In R code below, pr = prior; lk = likelihood; ps = posterior) update
