Detecting discrete touch events

How do I isolate touch events from each other? For example, I have one method that should be called if the view detects a single tap, and another method that should be called if the view detects a double-tap. The problem with the way I'm doing it is that a double-tap is always interpreted as a single tap before it is intereperted as a double tap. So, for example: -(void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; if ([touch tapCount] == 1) { NSLog(@"one touch"); } else if ([touch tapCount] > 1) { NSLog(@"multi taps"); } } If I were to single tape the screen, I would correctly log "one touch". However, if I double tape the screen, I would get to logged statements, first "one touch" followed immediately by "multi taps". I'm sure this is simple, but could someone point me in the right direction?
