Beta distribution with a priors as Uniform and Pareto Distribution

I am working on a bayesian programming problem which involves a Beta Posterior, which has mean (location) parameter coming from Uniform Distribution [U(0,1)] and concentration (kappa) coming from Pareto Distribution [Pareto(scale=1, alpha=1.5]. Could anyone please explain why Pareto distribution was selected in this case and how the scale/alpha params were set up, and what might be the result of this? Adding code below for reference: m = numpyro.sample("m", dist.Uniform(0, 1)) kappa = numpyro.sample("kappa", dist.Pareto(1, 1.5)) num_players = at_bats.shape[0] with numpyro.plate("num_players", num_players): phi_prior = dist.Beta(m * kappa, (1 - m) * kappa) phi = numpyro.sample("phi", phi_prior) return numpyro.sample("obs", dist.Binomial(at_bats, probs=phi), obs=hits) Problem Statement: We are to estimate batting average of a player (in baseball), with at_bats as a predictor, and hits as a target. An at_bats can be a hit or a miss, so we see the Binomial distribution at the end, but the probabilities are coming from a Beta distribution which has Uniform and Pareto priors. Dataset sample: [[412 145] [471 144] [566 160] [320 76] [463 128] [511 140] [631 168]...]
