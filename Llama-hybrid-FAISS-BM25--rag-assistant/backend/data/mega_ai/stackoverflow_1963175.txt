I tend to pull as much non-GUI related functionality out of the Swing components as possible. That means you have some extra indirection. However: the Swing layer does nothing but GUI interaction the business functionality is a lot easier to test and consequently maintain I'm not necessarily talking about a complete MVC model (although that's no bad thing). It's more of a class/package organisation issue.
