The exact mechanism will be hard to pin down, but you are correct to note that the generally high occurrence of that category drives that category to be predicted most of the time. Think of it this way: in the absence of compelling evidence, which category would you predict is most likely? You can formalize the math by considering the predicted probability to be a posterior probability that is calculated based on the overall probability, the “prior” I discuss here . (That link mentions a logistic regression as the model, but the idea applies to other models, too.) An explanation for why you do not see similar behavior for category two could be that category two is harder to distinguish from the other categories (perhaps even that it’s hard to distinguish from category seven, so the model goes with the the generally more probable category).
