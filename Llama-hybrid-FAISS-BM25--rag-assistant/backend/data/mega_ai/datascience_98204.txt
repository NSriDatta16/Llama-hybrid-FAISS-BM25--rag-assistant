The purpose of one-hot encoding is to assign numbers to categorical variables which does not create a false, meaningless numerical pattern. If you have categorical variables "Apple", "Orange", "Cherry", "Tomato" and you assign them numerical values 0, 1, 2, 3, then these numerical values have interpretations like "Cherry is between Tomato and Apple, but closer to Tomato" because 2 is between 0 and 3, but closer to 3. This is nonsense. It's bad nonsense, because algorithms to analyze this data (like regressions, or whatever) can pick up on it and read too much into it. If you instead represent "Apple", "Orange", "Cherry", and "Tomato" as the 4-tuples (1,0,0,0), (0,1,0,0), (0,0,1,0), and (0,0,0,1), then you don't have this problem. Each coordinate is either 0 or 1, and measures the "Appleness" or the "Orangeness" or the "Cherriness" or the "Tomatoness" of your fruit. That's one-hot encoding. As an example of this, suppose that the average apple weighs 200 grams, the average orange weighs 150 grams, the average cherry 30 grams, and the average tomato 100 grams. With one-hot encoding $(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4)$ , this average weight is a linear function of the encoding: $200x_1 + 150x_2 + 30x_3 + 100x_4$ . This is something a regression can figure out from data. With the 0, 1, 2, 3 encoding, there's no nice function that will give you the average weight of a fruit given its number. Now, as for dummy encoding: one-hot encoding still has a problem, which is that the linear function is not unique. The function $100 + 100x_1 + 50x_2 - 70x_3$ gives the same values as the previous function at the points (1,0,0,0), (0,1,0,0), (0,0,1,0), and (0,0,0,1). That's because each valid point $(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4)$ satisfies $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 = 1$ . (Again, this is not just a curiosity; this affects the way we analyze the data. For example, linear regressions behave badly when an $n$ -dimensional input doesn't actually range freely across all $n$ dimensions.) Dummy encoding drops one of the coordinates, since it can be inferred from the other three, to avoid this issue. The four fruits might be encoded as (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1), and (0,0,0).
