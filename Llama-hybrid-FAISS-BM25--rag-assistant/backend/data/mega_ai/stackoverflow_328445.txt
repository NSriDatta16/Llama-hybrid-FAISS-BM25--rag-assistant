My cousin is a serious FileMaker guy. He seems to be doing great and has grown a small firm around it. Apparently FileMaker is a cross-platform Mac/PC system for rapid app development... Maybe something like that will rise up with the business power-user/RAD set? Microsoft may have a history of intentionally killing off database systems like this. I listened to a .Net Rocks interview one time with Les Pinter , where he claimed that he once heard a top Microsoft exec say that every copy of FoxPro that sells costs Microsoft thousands in lost SQL royalties. And where is FoxPro today? Officially, it is was end-of-lifed in March of 2007. So how did it get from prominance to demise? Well, Les says that Microsoft acquired it and ran it into the ground on purpose. I am not usually big on conspiracy theories, but this does resonate with Microsoft's track record from that era. Anyway, trivia aside, I believe there will be more RAD-style database tools... They empower non-developers and allow developers to solve certain types of problems very quickly. I have an aversion to using them for large projects that, unfortunately, cascades - small projects tend to grow over time. So as a result I only use them for the very tinest things. As for the long term consequences... Well, I have seen scenarios where they didn't scale well and all those fragmented solutions started to look a lot like technical debt. It is actually possible to hook Access up to a SQL Server back-end, which solves a lot of problems. Probably the biggest/weirdest thing I did with Access was writing an EDI system from scratch. For those of you who have worked first-hand with EDI, you know what I'm talking about. What a silly idea that was. My problems here had more to do with VBA than Access though -- I remember just really needing interfaces and not having them. I also used it for code generation back before things like Codesmith were available. It generated business objects (CRUD and some other basics) for ASP Classic. That actually worked awesome.
