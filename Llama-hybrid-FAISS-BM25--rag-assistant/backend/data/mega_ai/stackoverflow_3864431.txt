How can I reliably parse a QuakeLive player profile using Perl?

I'm currently working on a Perl script to gather data from the QuakeLive website. Everything was going fine until I couldn't get a set of data. I was using regexes for that and they work for everything apart from the favourite arena, weapon and game type. I just need to get the names of those three elements in a $1 for further processing. I tried regexing up to the favorites image, but without succeeding. If it's any use, I'm already using WWW::Mechanize in the script. I think that the problem could be related to the class name of the paragraphs where those elements are, while the previous one was classless. You can find an example profile HERE . Note that for the previous part of the page, it worked using code like: $content =~ / Wins: (.*?) /; $wins = $1; print "Wins: $wins\n";
