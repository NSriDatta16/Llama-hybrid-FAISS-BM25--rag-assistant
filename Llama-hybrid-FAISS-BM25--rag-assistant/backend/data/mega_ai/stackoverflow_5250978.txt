colClasses date and time read.csv

I have some data of the form: date,time,val1,val2 20090503,0:05:12,107.25,1 20090503,0:05:17,108.25,20 20090503,0:07:45,110.25,5 20090503,0:07:56,106.25,5 that comes from a csv file. I am relatively new to R, so I tried data and using POSIXlt , as well as POSIXct in the colClasses argument, but I cant seem to be able to create one column or 'variable' out of my date and time data. I want to do so, so I can then choose arbitrary timeframes over which to calculate running statistics such as max, min, mean (and then boxplots, etc.). I also thought that I might convert it to a time series and get around it that way, dataTS but have yet been able to use the start, end, and frequency to my advantage. Thanks for your help.
