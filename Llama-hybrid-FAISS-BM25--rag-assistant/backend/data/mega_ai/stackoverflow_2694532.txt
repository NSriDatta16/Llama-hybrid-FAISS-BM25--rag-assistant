MSDeploy: error using runCommand provider to call remote .cmd file (timeout)

We are running into an error when trying to use the MSDeploy "runCommand" provider to execute a .cmd file on a remote machine. The expected run time should be about 10 seconds, but MSDeploy only runs it for about 2-3 seconds, after which time error details are returned. Here is the complete MSDeploy "runCommand" command line text I am using: msdeploy.exe -verb:sync -source:runCommand="D:\web deploy tester\test_cmd.cmd",dontUseCommandExe=false,waitAttempts=5,waitInterval=1000 -dest:auto,computername=http://test-machine:89/MsDeployAgentService/,userName=aaa,password=bbb Here are the error details returned: Error 'Error: (4/21/2010 12:19:25 PM) An error occurred when the request was processed on the remote computer. Error: The process 'C:\WINDOWS\system32\cmd.exe' (command line '/c "D:\web deploy tester\test_cmd.cmd"') was terminated because it exceeded the wait time. Error count: 1. ' occurred in call to RunCommand Any ideas as to why this is happening and how to resolve it?
