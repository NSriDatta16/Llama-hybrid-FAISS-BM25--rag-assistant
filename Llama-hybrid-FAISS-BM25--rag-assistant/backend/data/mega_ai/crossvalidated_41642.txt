Book recommendations for biostatisticians in CRO and pharmacy

I would like to learn more about the work and statistical methods performed as biostatistician in pharmaceutical companies and clinical research organizations. It seems the book "Essential Medical Statistics" (Kirkwood et. al) seems useful. In another thread I saw "Clinical Trials: A Methodologic Perspective" (Piantadosi) advertised. What are your opinions and views for suitable books?
