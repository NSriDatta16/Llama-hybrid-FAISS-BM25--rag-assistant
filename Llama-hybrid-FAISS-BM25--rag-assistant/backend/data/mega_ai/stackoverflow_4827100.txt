What Standard Specifies how MTOM / XOP support should be indicated in a WSDL?

I'm adding MTOM attachment support into existing webservice support in a Home Grown appserver. The webservice framework follows a similar pattern to JavaEE5, annotated services & objects being automatically exposed as a WebService with automatic WSDL generation. I've got the actual parsing and generation going, but I've been unable to determine if I need to update the WSDL generation to indicate to clients that MTOM is supported and preferred. I've been finding multiple conflicting standards for how to Indicate MTOM support and I'm at a loss as to what's used in the real world. So far I've found: MTOM Serialization Policy Assertion (WS- MTOMPolicy) Version 1.0 - From XML Soap MTOM Serialization Policy Assertion 1.1 - From W3C As far as I can see, the W3c one appears to be a later version of the XMLSoap one, however they seem to use a different element in a different namespace for the assertion: W3C uses - MTOM in the http://www.w3.org/2007/08/soap12-mtom-policy namespace XML Soap uses - OptimizedMimeSerialization in the http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2004/09/policy/optimizedmimeserialization namespace I've also fond a random forum post which seems to indicate that Glassfish was using the XML Soap one. The W3C standard is a draft, but seems to have been a draft sine 2007. Does anyone know which of these specs is generally in use? Or is it common to just ignore the WSDL when it comes to MTOM?
