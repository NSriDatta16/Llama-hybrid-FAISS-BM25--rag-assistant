Policy gradient theorem proofs

I'm looking at two proofs for the policy gradient theorem. van heeswijk starts of with expressing the policy gradient as a gradient over expected reward trajectories: and the rest is easy. However weng starts off with a gradient of the value function of a random state: and the proof is much more involved, and requires work to express as a function of the stationary distribution of the model states and the Q function. Are these two approaches equal? is one of them making assumptions the other isn't?
