Either use of array references is valid as long as its properly balanced as () or []. The problem is probably upstream where the array is getting declared or prepared. I've had to debug historically strange instances like this where one user was going about a process in a totally different way than others, and the business work flow... Anyhow, because of some "bypassed" process, the array wasn't getting created and thus forced a failure. Does it always crash at the same location in the process? I would strongly encourage some error trapping in the process for this "one" user. Worse comes to worse, I would put something in the area of the code something like... if atc( "PersonsLoginName", sys(0)) > 0 TurnOnMyCustomDebugging() && for this special scenario trapping endif Additionally, I don't know what you have for error trapping routines, but I'd get a dump of memory at the time of the error and the full call stack that got the user to that point. If you need help on that, let me know too.
