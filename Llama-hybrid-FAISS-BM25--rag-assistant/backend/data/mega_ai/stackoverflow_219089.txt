Can anyone suggest an abstract base class to prevent XSRF in .NET 2.0+

I'm looking for an abstract base class or master page solution that will prevent anyone from doing XSRF using both a token and ttl. Can anyone point me in the right direction? Edit: The ideal solution will leverage the cookie that the default membership provider sends down to the client.
