Why not run it on Amazon's EC2 cloud-computing service or a similar such service? MCMCpack is, if I remember correctly, mostly implemented in C, so it isn't going to get much faster unless you decrease your model complexity, iterations, etc. With EC2, or similar cloud-computing services, you can have multiple instances at whatever specs you desire, and run all of your models at once.
