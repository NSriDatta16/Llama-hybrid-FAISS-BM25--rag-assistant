The question is ambiguous, for you can represent the abstract data type of a stack or queue using an array or linked data structure. The difference between a linked list implementation of a stack or queue and an array implementation has the same basic tradeoff as any array vs. dynamic data structure. A linked queue/linked stack has flexible, high speed insertions/deletions with a reasonable implementation, but requires more storage than an array. Insertions/deletions are inexpensive at the ends of an array until you run out of space; an array implementation of a queue or stack will require more work to resize, since you'd need to copy the original into a larger structure (or fail with an overflow error).
