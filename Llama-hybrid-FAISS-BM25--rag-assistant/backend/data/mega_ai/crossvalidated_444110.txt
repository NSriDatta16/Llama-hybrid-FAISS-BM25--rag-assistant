I'm not sure what you mean by "fixed accuracy" in this context. A fixed accuracy would imply that since the accuracy is always the same (and known after the first few forecasting) we can adjust for the accuracy rate to recover the original value of the time series and we end up with a perfect forecast instead. I assume what you really want is to simulate forecasts for which the accuracy (and hence by implication, the forecast error) is drawn from a known distribution. In this case you have two approaches: (1) Assume your forecast error $\epsilon_t$ follows a known distribution $P$ (Normal, Gamma, etc...). Then do the following: Generate a forecast at time $t$ , $\hat{Y}_t$ . Draw a random value of $\epsilon_t$ from $P$ . Add the error term $\epsilon_t$ to your forecast value $\hat{Y}_t$ to get a new sample of your future time series at time $t$ Use that sample $\hat{Y}_t + \epsilon_t$ to feed it to your model and generate a forecast for the next step $t+1$ , $\hat{Y}_{t+1}$ . repeat this process: drawing a random sample from $P$ and then generating the next step forecast until you have reached $\hat{Y}_{t+T}$ , the number of steps forward you want to forecast. Repeat the above process enough times (50, 100,...), each time using different values of $\epsilon$ , to create enough samples from your future time series to get a good estimate of how your forecast distribution effects your KPIs and decisions. Alternatively, instead of assuming a distribution $P$ you can use the historical forecast errors (if you have already been running your model for quite a while, or through maybe through backcasting if you have enough history). Or (2) , perform a full density forecast : This approach is more rigorous than the above mentioned approach, but is also more complicated to implement. The idea is that instead of estimating a model of your actual values $Y_t$ , you estimate a model of the full distribution $P(Y_t)$ from your historical data. This can be either parametric or non-parametric. Once you have an estimate of the distribution, you can generate the sample paths directly by sampling from the distribution, as opposed to sampling from the error and then adding it back to get your sample paths. Depending on the complexity of the distribution, you can either sample from it directly, or you might have to use some MCMC method to sample from it.
