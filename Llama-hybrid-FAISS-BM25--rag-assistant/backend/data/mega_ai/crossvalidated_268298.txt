To address your question, we first study what is a weighted sampling, which is a natural concern arise from bootstrapping technique when the sampling pool is not infinite (unlike some classical asymptotics) but finite. Weighted sampling is basically a variance reduction technique for bootstrap estimators. An crucial special case of weighted sampling is the importance sampling, which is closely related to the bootstrap: Johns, M. Vernon. "Importance sampling for bootstrap confidence intervals." Journal of the American Statistical Association 83.403 (1988): 709-714. A practical realization of importance sampler is in: Martino, Luca, et al. "An adaptive population importance sampler: Learning from uncertainty." IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing 63.16 (2015): 4422-4437. For Bayesian weighted sampling, Lo, Albert Y. "A Bayesian method for weighted sampling." The Annals of Statistics (1993): 2138-2148. Back to your question of adaptive weights, it is more or less a penalized likelihood method(based on the fitness function) of choosing weights in a weighted sampling procedure, which is proposed earlier in: Eggermont, Jeroen, A. E. Eiben, and Jano I. van Hemert. "Adapting the fitness function in GP for data mining." European Conference on Genetic Programming. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 1999.
