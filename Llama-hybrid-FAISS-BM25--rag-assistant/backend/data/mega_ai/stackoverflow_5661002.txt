LINQ distinct on 2 fields

I have a LINQ query that returns data and I want to filter based on 2 fields (fkProfileID and fkOrgID) that are often the same. I only want to show 1 record when fkProfileID and fkOrgID match, so it is similar to doing an SQL distinct, but on 2 fields rather than one. My data will look like this (other fields have been removed) : fkProfileID fkOrgID 1 1001 1 1001 1 1001 2 1001 2 1001 1 1005 1 1005 So here I want to return only the following: fkProfileID fkOrgID 1 1001 2 1001 1 1005 Here is my current LINQ (both fields above are in tblUserRights), how do I need to change it to do this? List lstProfiles = (from r in _database.tblUserRights join p in _database.LuProfiles on r.fkProfileID equals p.luProfileID join o in _database.tblOrganisations on r.fkOrgID equals o.pkOrgID where r.fkUniqueID == intPKUserID orderby o.OrgDesc, p.ProfileName select new ProfileJSON { SiteID = o.pkOrgID, SiteName = o.OrgDesc, ProfileID = p.luProfileID, ProfileName = p.ProfileName }).ToList();
