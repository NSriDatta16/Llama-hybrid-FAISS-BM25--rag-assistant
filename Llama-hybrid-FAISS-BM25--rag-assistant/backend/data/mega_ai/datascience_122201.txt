What's Best way in selecting right model for document comparison

We have different pre-trained models like BERT, USE, ELMo, Word2Vec, FastText, etc.., we have documents in different sizes (large, medium, small). now, we want to do document similarity. how can we decide which pre-trained model/transformer suits for our requirement (for fine-tuning) and what will be the best approach to do?
