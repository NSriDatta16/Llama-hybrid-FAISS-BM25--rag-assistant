I think that for your case, you should try to sit down and write down what are the variables that you can observe and what are the variables that you want to predict Observable variables: position of the appendage, how many times a specific one is interacted with, for how long, ... Variables you want to predict: which appendage will be interacted with next time, ... Once you have the input variables and output variables, you can try to go through the list of standard machine learning algorithms. There are Weka(Java), Rapidminer, KNIME ... which are both libraries and standalone tools. Try to throw your problem at the available tools and see if you are doing better than chance. If you are, tune its parameters. If you are not performing better than chance, you should ask your Data Mining/Machine Learning friends. They will know best what will work for your problem. Other things that might affect your choice of algorithms: Are there hidden states? Are the variables independence?
