In order to omit heteroscedasticity you can use weighted regression, it should help you reduce this effect. If we talk about multicollinearity, you can use PCA before fitting your model. Then you will be able to extract important linear combinations of the variables that will not be related to each other. For autocorrelation, except standard econometrics method, maybe you can try RandomForest. Bagging methods can be very good for models where we are not able to remove autocorrelation (see Lopez de Prado - Advances in Financial Machine Learning)
