Are you using WiX v2? Instead of creating the registry value with two Registry entries, just combine it all into one line. That's usually a lot easier. If you really want to nest them then I recommend leaving the Registry/@Action attribute off of the parent registry key so it doesn't actually end up in the MSI. Just organizes the child elements. Note the syntax is a bit different in WiX v3.
