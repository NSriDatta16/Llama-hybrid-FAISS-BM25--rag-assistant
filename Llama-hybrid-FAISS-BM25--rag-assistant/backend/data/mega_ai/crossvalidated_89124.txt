I would agree with the previous answer, K-means is easy and effective. However, the K-means algorithm just lets you find structure in the data. I would not use the results as labels to train a supervised learning algorithm, like an SVM. Labels like the ones used for training imply a stronger claim to categorical knowledge than simple structural patterns.
