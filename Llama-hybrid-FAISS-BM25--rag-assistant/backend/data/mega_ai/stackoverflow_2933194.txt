For a raw beginner, How to Design Programs will get you thinking like a Lisper. If you get impatient, go faster :-) Another good book is On Lisp by Paul Graham, which as a bonus is now free online. I don't care for Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs ; if you know Lisp or Scheme, already, it's a great intellectual tour de force and very satisfyingâ€”but my students and I have not found it a good book to learn from. The Little Schemer has lots of good information if you can stomach its dialectical organization and cutesie-pie style. I can't.
