Generally speaking, when the mouse down event occurs, you would need to capture the mouse. Then you will receive mouse move events even if the mouse leaves the area of the control that has captured the mouse. You can calculate delta's in the mouse move events. A drag would occur the first time the delta exceeds a system-defined "drag area". When the mouse up event is received, stop the drag operation. In Windows Forms, look at the MouseDown, MouseMove, and MouseUp events on the Control class. The MouseEventArgs will contain the X/Y coordinates. To capture or release the mouse, set the Capture property to true or false respectively. If you do not capture the mouse, then you will not receive the MouseMove or MouseUp events if the mouse is released outside of the bounds of the control. Finally, to determine the minimum "distance" the mouse should be allowed to move before starting the drag operation, look at the SystemInformation.DragSize property. Hope this helps.
