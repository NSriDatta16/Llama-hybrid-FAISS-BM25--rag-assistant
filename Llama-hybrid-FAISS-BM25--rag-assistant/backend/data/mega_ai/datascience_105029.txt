hdbscan greatly prefers lower dimensional data than the output of sentence-BERT. Ultimately the hdbscan library wants to use KDTrees of BallTrees for efficient nearest neighbor querying, and these work best in 50 dimensions or less. With higher dimensional data the library defaults to using a much slower and far more expensive code path. To make this run faster the best approach is going to be to reduce the dimensionality of the data. In my (high biased) opinion UMAP will be a good way to achieve this, but you could also try PCA, or other dimension reduction techniques.
