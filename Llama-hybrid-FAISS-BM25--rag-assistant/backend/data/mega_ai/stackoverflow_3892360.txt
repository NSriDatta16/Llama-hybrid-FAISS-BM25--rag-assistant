If you're a .Net developer, I'd start with Windows Phone. You have an opportunity to be one of the first apps on the device, you already know the language (if you do C#) and framework, etc. From the perspective of market share, I believe , emphasis on believe, iPhone still holds the crown there although that is rapidly changing and may have already been overtaken by Android. Depending on what language you use in .Net (as .Net isn't actually a language), Android might be the easiest to pick up because it relies on Java which, in my opinion is not super far from C# or VB. Objective-C in my opinion, is a little bit more foreign coming from a .Net background than Java is. This is just my opinion though and has a lot to do with syntactical differences rather than actual differences. To be honest, I'm willing to bet that they are about equidistant from the .Net languages, just in different directions. In short, I would stick with what you know and leverage the fact that you already understand the .Net platform. If you want to learn something new, then I'd go for Android/iPhone. They're both so close in market share that I'd make the decision between the two based on other factors: can one do something the other can't, do you have a Mac for development, etc.
