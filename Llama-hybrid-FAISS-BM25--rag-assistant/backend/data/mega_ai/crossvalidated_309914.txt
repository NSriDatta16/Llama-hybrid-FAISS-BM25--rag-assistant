Do I need to use stationary time series data when building linear model with AR error terms?

I have a linear model $y=\beta*x+\epsilon$. However, the error term is modeled as an AR term, where $\epsilon(t)=p*\epsilon(t-1)+w(t)$, $w(t)$ is white noise. Y and X are both time series economic variables. ADF test shows that both x and y are non-stationary. Johansen test cannot reject the null there are cointegration in between the two variables. What is the assumption behind? Is stationarity required on x and y to start with such model?
