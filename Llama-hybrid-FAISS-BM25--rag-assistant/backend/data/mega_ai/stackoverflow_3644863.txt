How do I get the correct case of a path?

I have a small but itching problem. How do I get the correct case for a Windows path in Qt? Let's say i have a path c:\documents and settings\wolfgang\documents stored in a QString str and i want to know the correct case, here C:\Document and Settings\Wolfgang\Documents . QDir(str).absolutePath() doesn't get me the path with correct case. Any suggestions, since I have no clue what else i could try? Thank you for your time!
