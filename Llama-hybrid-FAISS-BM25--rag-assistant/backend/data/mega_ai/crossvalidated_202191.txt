Are variables influential in random forest also influential in svm?

This paper https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/papers/features.pdf highlights the following approach to feature selection: Repeat: 1. Fit a random forest model, calculate CV error 2. Drop bottom half of predictors based on out-of-bag variable importance 3. Go to step 1, stop if number of predictors I was curious how this method works, since SVM's (RBF kernel) distance-based approach of mapping features to response is very different from the interaction-based approach of random forest. Would variables considered influential in random forest necessarily be influential in svm?
