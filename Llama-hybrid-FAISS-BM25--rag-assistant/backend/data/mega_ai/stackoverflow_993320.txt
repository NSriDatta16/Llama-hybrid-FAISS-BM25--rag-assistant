I got myself a very cheap hosting provider where I can save up to 35GB. I access the webspace via "ssh/ExpanDrive" and store my repositories in crypted containers (TrueCrypt). In addition to the external storage I keep a local backup. I think this is one of the best approaches, if you want your source code to stay private. No problems so far. For official projects/team work in most cases there is enough hardware/money involved to put together some dedicated hardware.
