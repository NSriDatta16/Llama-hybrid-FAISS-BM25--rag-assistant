I'll probably be downvoted into oblivion for this, but until IE6 is gone from the face of the earth, using a table for a multi-column layout is really the safest, easiest way to go. Sure, it's not the "right" way to do it, but in this case the reward for doing it the right way is so miniscule that you might as well just drop in a table and move on to more important things. Don't get me wrong; I love CSS. I just think that the pragmatic choice for multi-column layouts is still the table. You'll spend less time fighting with browsers and have more time to focus on the things that will really benefit your website's consumers.
