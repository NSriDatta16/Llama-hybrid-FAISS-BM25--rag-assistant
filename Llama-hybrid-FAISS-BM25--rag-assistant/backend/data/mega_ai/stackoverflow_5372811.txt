How Can I show Profile information of the current user in ASP.Net?

Hi all i'm completely new to ASP.Net and C# so will explain as best as I can what I am after. I am using Visual Studio 2010 Ultimate (MSDNAA) Basically I have setup up user registration and login using the wizard with the user data stored in aspnet_users table in the database ASPNETDB.MDF. I have also created in the data base a table called UserProfile with the fields, UserID, Address, Telephone, etc. I have then created a relationship between the aspnet_users table and the UserProfile table by linking UserID. What I am trying to do is create a profile page where users can insert and update their profile information. I have therefore created a page called userinfo.aspx and after following several tutorials, which often seem to be revolving around asp2, I have dragged in the FormView Option, and created a link to the database. What I am stuck on is how I can get the current UserID that is logged on and display their information. My problem is under the WHERE option I cannot get it to use a current user as the source or is this totally wrong? If you could advise me I would be grateful. Matt
