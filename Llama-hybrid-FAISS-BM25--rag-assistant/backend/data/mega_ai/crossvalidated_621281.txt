Inhomogeneity by independent thinning of a homogeneous (Poisson) point process Your question concerns a method to generate an inhomogeneous point process with intensity function $\lambda(x)$ from a homogeneous one with intensity $\lambda$ , by independent thinning , that is by counting points in $x$ with probability $\lambda(x)/\lambda$ . The original point process need not necessarily be a Poisson point process, it would work with any other point process, too, and also the formulae hold. Let us look at denominator and numerator in the second last fraction, $$\frac{\int_0^T P\{\text{time}\leq s, \text{counted}\mid\text{time}=x\} d x\,/T}{P\{\text{counted\}}} $$ Denominator: $P\{\text{counted}\}$ denotes the mean probability of a randomly chosen event in the base interval $[0,T]$ to be counted. So, no, $P\{counted\} = \int_0^T \lambda(x)/ \lambda dx$ is not totally right. You would need to calculate the integral average of the $\lambda(x)/\lambda$ , which is $$ \begin{aligned} P\{\text{counted}\} &= \frac{1}{T}\int_0^T P\{\text{counted}\mid\text{time}=x\} d x \\&=\frac{1}{T}\int_0^T \lambda(x)/\lambda\ dx \\&=\frac{1}{\lambda T}\int_0^T \lambda(x)\ dx . \end{aligned} $$ Numerator: the integrand $P\{time \leq s, counted |time=x \} = \lambda(t)/\lambda$ ? Well, the numerator stands for the mean probability that a randomly chosen event lies in the shorter interval $[0,s]$ and is counted, $$\begin{aligned} P(\text{time}\leq s \wedge \text{counted}) &= \frac{1}{T}\int_0^T P\{\text{time}\leq s, \text{counted}\mid\text{time}=x\} d x \\&=\frac{1}{T}\int_0^T \mathbf{1}_{[0,s]}(x) \lambda(x)/\lambda\ dx \\&=\frac{1}{T}\int_0^s \lambda(x)/\lambda\ dx. \\&=\frac{1}{\lambda T}\int_0^s \lambda(x)\ dx. \end{aligned} $$ Final (and now easy) step: When taking the quotient of this numerator and denominator, the factor $1/(\lambda T)$ cancels out. Additional remark: You get the formula for the denominator as a special case of the formula for the numerator, by setting $s=T$ .
