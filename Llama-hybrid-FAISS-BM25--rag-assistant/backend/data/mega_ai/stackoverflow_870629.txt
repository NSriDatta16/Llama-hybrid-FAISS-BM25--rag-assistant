I prefer your spacing, though I would do it a bit differently. I believe your most important question is how to convince someone your approach is best: Code formatting can be very subjective. Some people object because it takes too much time to get right. Others object because the team doesn't have any coding standards. Some object because the feel it is crammed down their necks. The best method is to work with your team to build consensus that your particular approach is the best practice. This is true if you are the lead, or if you are a individual contributor. Once a team consensus is generally accepted (it may not be universal), then I find that code reviews are the best place to ensure that team practices are followed. I suggest that you will find peer pressure is the most effective way to encourage other people to follow an accepted best practice. The corralling is often true; it is hard for one person to drive this kind of thing on team without consensus. Here are some of my related StackOverflow answers Do any other developers get yelled at for making every thing public? How would you format/indent this piece of code? How do you perform code reviews?
