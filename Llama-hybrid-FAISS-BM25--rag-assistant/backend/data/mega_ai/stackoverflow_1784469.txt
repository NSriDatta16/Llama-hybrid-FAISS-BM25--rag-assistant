yeah, since flex builder is an eclipse based IDE use Web Tools Platform. I haven't installed it on straight flex builder, but you can download the Eclipse J2EE version and it includes WTP. Then just install flex builder as a plug-in. I think you should be able to find a Ganymede version of the J2EE IDE. However, if you cant, look into the workaround for getting Flex in Galileo and you're good to go!
