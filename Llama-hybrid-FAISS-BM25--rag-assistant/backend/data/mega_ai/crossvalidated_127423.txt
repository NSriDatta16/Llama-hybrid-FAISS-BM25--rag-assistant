How to determine whether a dataset can be learned by Logistic regression?

As far as I know, Logistic Regression can deal with data in which positive and negative samples can be separated by a linear hyperplane. But if the data cannot be separated by a hyperplane, it cannot be learned by simple Logistic Regression, more features should be added to make a higher space in which the data can be well learned by linear hyperplane. My question is: How to determine whether a dataset is linear enough that no more features should be added?
