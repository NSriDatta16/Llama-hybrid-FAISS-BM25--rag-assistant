Would it be possible to replace the standard dummy variable for treated/control by a continuous (price) variable with values = zero before intervention and values = actual price after intervention? Yes, you can use a continuous variable indicating treatment intensity instead of a dummy variable for treatment. I have seen people call this by various names. Hudson, Hull, and Liebersohn call it "instrumented difference-in-differences." Similarly, would be possible to somehow use actual year information (i.e., 1,2,3, etc.) instead of a time-dummy for before/after intervention? You need a time-dummy for before/after intervention whether or not you are using year-level data. The years after the treatment are all affected by the treatment. You can use year-level data and possibly use year fixed-effects as controls, but you need to be careful about how you handle your standard errors if you are not collapsing the pre and post-treatment periods. Most outcome variables will be autocorrelated and the usual standard errors or even cluster-robust standard errors will not necessarily alleviate it. See Bertrand, Duflo, and Mullanaithan (2003) for details.
