Don't. Escape. SQL. Don't. Quote. SQL. Use SQL placeholders/parameters ( ? ). The structure of the SQL statement and the data values represented by the placeholders are sent to the database completely separately, so (barring a bug in the database engine or the DBD module) there is absolutely no way that the data values can be interpreted as SQL commands. my $name = "Robert'); DROP TABLE Students; --"; my $sth = $dbh->prepare('SELECT id, age FROM Students WHERE name = ?'); $sth->execute($name); # Finds Little Bobby Tables without harming the db As a side benefit, using placeholders is also more efficient if you re-use your SQL statement (it only needs to be prepared once) and no less efficient if you don't (if you don't call prepare explicitly, it still gets called implicitly before the query is executed).
