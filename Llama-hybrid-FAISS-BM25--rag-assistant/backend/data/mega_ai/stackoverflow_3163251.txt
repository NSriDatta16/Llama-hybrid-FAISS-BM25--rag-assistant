It may be useful if you post some actual code of how you are trying to update the value. As per the CFPreferencesCopyAppValue documentation: Note that values returned from this function are immutable, even if you have recently set the value using a mutable object. And the Preferences Best Practices document specifies that you should be using CFPreferencesSetAppValue to save the value. Update : I suspect I am missing something in your scenario and maybe my answer below is what you're doing, since you did mention that your current code works on 3.1.3. If that's the case, you might want to specify on which event are you saving the value. It might be that you're updating it when your app is being shut down, but if you have not explicitly specified in your plist you don't support suspend, your app might just be suspended. Update2 : The CFPreferencesSetAppValue documentation explicitly mentions: You must call the CFPreferencesAppSynchronize function in order for your changes to be saved to permanent storage
