You are incorrect that is called Transfer learning, which focuses on storing knowledge gained while solving one problem and applying it to a different but related problem. Joint Training is basically when the neural network trains on several different task simultaneously so optimizing more than one loss function rather than one loss function as the case with Transfer learning. It is also called Multi task learning. Refer this article to know more.
