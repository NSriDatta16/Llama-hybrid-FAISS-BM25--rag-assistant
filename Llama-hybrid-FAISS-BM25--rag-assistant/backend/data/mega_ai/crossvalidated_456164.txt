When zero is a valid value for a variable (i.e., not missing) then use it in the analysis. However, for home price, when zero is replaced for price since it's missing, delete the zeroes, since most software will recognize the missing fields as missing. You don't ever want to (e.g.) calculate average house price by including home with price values of zero, since it will artificially lower the average - and that it not a true average based on houses that didn't have a missing price. The other problem you will learn when zero is used for missing is that it will often result in a large spike at zero in a histogram for a variable. In summary, if zero truly represents something, then use it. It could be an outlier quite easily. You might report e.g. average and s.d. for renovation of homes that were renovated, and then list the number of homes that weren't renovated, since all the remaining homes that were renovated will have renovation costs much larger. Zero values that are true are usually not an outlier if the range of values falls in e.g. [0,1], [0,2] or [-2,2]. When non-zero values are large however, like home renovation costs, I would not use the zero values, and would just say for example there were 30 homes that weren't renovated (zero), and then give the average and s.d. of renovation costs for homes that were renovated for which the cost is non-zero.
