An outlet is a path that connects one object to another. An action is a method name that is called on a particular object in response to an event. Cocoa traditionally uses target/action quite a lot for communicating, though this is now being partly displaced by blocks. Anyway, your project: The firstViewController.xib incorrectly thinks that its file owner is a class of type 'firstViewController'. It's actually of type 'FirstViewController' â€” like most programming languages, Objective-C is case sensitive for class names. In Interface Builder, open firstViewControlller.xib, select 'File's Owner', open the inspector and head to the 'i' tab, then correct the class name at the top. When you've done that, try switching to the connections tab (the one with the arrow pointing to the right) and you should see that it's correctly found your class and your IBAction. You should then be able to control drag. Basically the same comment applies to secondViewController. In case you're curious, Objective-C differs from e.g. C++ in that all class names are known at runtime and it's possible to instantiate a class from the string version of its name. That's how XIBs/NIBs are loaded.
