How to choose the right machine-learning classifer

I am facing a problem on selecting a correct classifier for my data-mining task. I am labeling webpages using statistical method and label them using a 1-4 scale, 1 being the poorest while 4 being the best. Previously, I used SVM to train the system since I was using a binary (1,0) label then. But now since I switch to this 4-class label, I need to change classifier, because I think the SVM classifier will only work for two-class classification (correct me if I am wrong). What kind of classifier is most appropriate here for my classification purpose?
