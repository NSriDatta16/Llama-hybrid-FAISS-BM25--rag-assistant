How to handle out of the bag token in NLP?

In my current language model my model is unaware of any token that is out-of-bag for example:- In my summary generating model when we pass some token that is out-of-bag then my model will completely forget that token entirely. Such token might be any Noun such as name of a person, city or anything. And when my main token of the text is unknown in this case John who is main character of any story whose summary we are going to extract, how can i ensure that John is also include in my model although it is out-of-bag vocabulary. Summary not including John will make summary very poor.
