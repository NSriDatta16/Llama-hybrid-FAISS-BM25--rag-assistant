Variance is not similar to entropy at all. The variance has a scale, and entropy doesn't. Yes, the variance measures the uncertainty, but in a very different manner compared to the entropy. The variance, and especially its cousin standard deviation, reflect the absolute uncertainty. For instance, you could say that the volatility of S&P 500 index annual return is 20% in an average year. However, you can model the returns with different distributions, such as Gaussian or Student-t, then you'd get different entropies for the same reading of the volatility. The mean also has a scale, the same scale as the dispersion (volatility). So you are looking for a metric that somehow reflects the location of the distribution but without a scale, i.e. relative to all other values. The only thing that comes to mind is skewness. It's a shape parameter, that places the location relative to the entire domain of the variable.
