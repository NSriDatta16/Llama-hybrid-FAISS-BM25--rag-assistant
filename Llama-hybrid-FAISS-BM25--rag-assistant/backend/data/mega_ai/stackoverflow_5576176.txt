Techniques for persistent website data storage with a low or zero server-side back-end overhead & setup?

I'm looking to build a dynamic website without bringing much extra server-side code/apps into the picture, and need some persistent & dynamic information that would be stored, displayed, edited, & displayed across page loads. I'd like to try some alternatives to using a full-fledged php+database back-end, a database is ideal, but I'd only be using the php for a single script for storing json data, and expect that running the full-fledged php apache mod for that purpose is overkill. So for example, I want to have: an html page --> that loads some message data via javascript (e.g. "Killroy was here.") --> Which can be edited by an admin, via js ( "roy was here" ) --> The page can be left, and returned to with a different browser, by a public user --> and the message would repopulate to the changed state ("roy was here") Ideally the json data would be stored either on a free external service (amazon ec2 or something? google app engine? I have no idea what might be available for this purpose), or the app & database for storing the data server side would be simple and have quick setup. So what ways are there to acheive those goals?
