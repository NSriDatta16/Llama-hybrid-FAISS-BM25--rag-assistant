Without subject-matter knowledge of the problem it is impossible to say what summary (be it a scalar or a vector one) of the time series is the most relevant. What can one do then? You could expand $X$ as $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n$ where $X_j$ is the value of $X$ at time period $j$ . This way your problem turns into a general regression problem with multiple predictors. The problem can be tackled by a variety of statistical and machine learning tools for regression. If the time series are not too short, you will have a high-dimensional problem and some regularization and/or variable selection will be needed.
