What is the point of using SAE and then CNN?

I am trying to find a suitable pipeline for condition monitoring and one of the suggested pipelines is to use the stacked auto encoder (SAE) and then Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). I am not sure what is the benifit of doing this and how using SAE with CNN is different from using SAE only?
