Logistic regression is a GLM. The linear ("L") part of GLM relates to the fact that the covariates are included within a linear predictor. However, the linear predictor is transformed by a link function, which may be non-linear, to get to the expected response. In other words, the relationship between the predictors and the expected response is non linear in this case.
