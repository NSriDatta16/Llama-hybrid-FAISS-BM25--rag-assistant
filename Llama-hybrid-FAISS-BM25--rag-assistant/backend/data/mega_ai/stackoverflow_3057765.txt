you're on the right track. Remove '_' from 'IS_NULL' and change 'COUNT(average)' to 'COUNT(1)' and you will have it. For more information on working with NULL in MYSQL see http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/working-with-null.html And for working with IS NULL specifically see http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/comparison-operators.html#operator_is-null
