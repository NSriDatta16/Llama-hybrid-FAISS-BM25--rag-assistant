AFAIK there is no elegant way to do what you are looking to.. VS will always end up copying it. I think to be honest it may not be a great idea.. Obviously you want to share the lowest common code, but a whole MasterPage?.. Sounds like you could be asking for trouble since one minor change could have such an impact on one or more applications.. I would suggest instead seperating out the good bits of functionality into components/controls and deploying them.
