Point 1. implicitly deals only with processes that can be rendered stationary by differencing. There are other processes that do not belong to this category. With that in mind, any contradiction between 1. and 2. disappears. Regarding 3., the ADF test deals with a certain set of processes that may have a unit root. Again, this does not encompass each and every stochastic process. This matches the fact that while presence of a unit root implies nonstationarity, absence of a unit root does not imply stationarity. Without seeing your time series and detailed test results it is a bit difficult to comment on its stationarity and unit roots. However, note that many of the processes discussed in textbooks are simple, idealized versions of what is encountered in reality. The actual data generating process may be much more complex and it also may be changing over time, either gradually or abruptly. Perhaps your time series is plagued by that. This does not mean you cannot approximate it by a simple model to a decent extent, but diagnostics may well show that the approximation is not ideal. Regarding your title question, Order of integration for a time series with constant mean and increasing variance such a series is not integrated (it does not contain a unit root), yet it is not stationary (because of nonconstant variance).
