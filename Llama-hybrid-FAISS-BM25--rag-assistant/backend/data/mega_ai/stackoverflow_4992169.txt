I've done this before using drupal e-commerce to sell app downloads via Paypal and used SSL neither on the redirection nor the landing page. While technically I suppose a hacker could intercept the token of someone who paid for the app and use it to pretend he paid, I don't think this is likely scenario because the average criminal is more interested in credit card numbers than one-time free access to some product/service. Further, one of the main reasons you would use Paypal in the first place is so that you wouldn't have to pay as much attention to security as you would if you had to process the users credit cards yourself since Paypal takes care of this for you (and their system is secured by SSL).
