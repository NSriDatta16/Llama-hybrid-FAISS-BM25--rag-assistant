I've been tooling around for this kind of solution for some time, but it looks like, right now, the only way to do this would be to use the aforementioned modules and create your own views filter (look at the Location module for an example) to send the proper coordinates (geocoded from Google or someone else's API) to the Views map you're using. I have a solution on one of my sites that allows users to enter their zip code to get a close approximation of where they are—this is using the Location module—but it's not as precise (or elegant) as geocoding an address or city-level marker. See: http://www.opensourcecatholic.com/blog/oscatholic/beautiful-easy-maps-drup - there's a video explaining how I have the maps set up on http://archstl.org/parishes [Edit: also, read through this thread on drupal.org to see if it helps - http://drupal.org/node/904576 - I really wish there were an easier solution that didn't involve so many different modules!]
