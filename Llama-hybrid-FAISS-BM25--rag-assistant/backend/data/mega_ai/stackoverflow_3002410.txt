How to prevent caching from jQuery Ajax?

Could anyone please help me with this? I have a web page using .manifest for offline storage caching. In that page, I use jQuery ajax call to get the data from the server. If I first load the page, it is OK. I can switch between Online and Offline. But the problem is when I go back online and refresh the page. jQuery ajax cannot be able to talk to server anymore. Is there a way to for ajax to talk to the server or clear offline cache? My ajax call is as such: $.ajax({ type: "GET", url: requestUrl, success: localSuccess, error: error, dataType: "text", cache:false });
