Should outliers be removed from Principal Components Analysis?

I have calculated Hotelling's T2 statistic for detection of outliers in PCA analysis in Matlab. However, I am unsure as to whether or not it is a robust approach to remove these outliers? The output will be used in a cluster analysis and I am wondering if I remove the outliers, am I fundamentally changing the outcome of the cluster analysis in a very subjective way? ie. the outliers could be the thing that makes a specific data point belong to a specific group. So, my question is: Is it generally the rule that outliers are removed from PCA? I see a lot online about identifying them, but not so much about what to do with them afterwards.
