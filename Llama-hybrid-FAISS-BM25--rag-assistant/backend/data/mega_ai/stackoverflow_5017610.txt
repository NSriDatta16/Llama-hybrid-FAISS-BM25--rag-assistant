I do not believe so. Such phrases as: The size of the internal floatingpoint representation is implementation-dependent, can vary, and shall have precision at least as great as that of the variable or expression being represented and: This design allows the CLI to choose a platform-specific high-performance representation for floating-point numbers until they are placed in storage locations. For example, it might be able to leave floating-point variables in hardware registers that provide more precision than a user has requested. At the same time, CIL generators can force operations to respect language-specific rules for representations through the use of conversion instructions from section 12.1.3 of MS Partition I would tend to indicate that rounding differences might occur if all operations occur within the internal representation
