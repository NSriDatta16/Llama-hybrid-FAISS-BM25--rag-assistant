How do I Activate a different Tab from inside a Page on a different tab and do a PostBack on it

I'm having trouble figuring out something that should be simple but I'm having trouble trying to figure it out. I have a Page (Default.aspx) which contaiins a WebTab Control (Infragistics, but shouldn't matter really). Inside each Tab Control of the WebTab is another page, Page1.aspx, Page2.apx, so it's like this: Default.aspx WebTab WebTabControl(0) Page1.aspx I'm in Page1.aspx codebehind doing a postback as I have a parameter that I need to pass to the next page, and I want to open Page2.apx which is inside the 2nd Tab. Basically, I think I need to do the following steps. 1. Set the Active Tab to WebTabControl(1) 2. Give it the Parameter that I have for it to do something with. I know I'll have to shoot myself once someone tells how to do it :-) Thanks!
