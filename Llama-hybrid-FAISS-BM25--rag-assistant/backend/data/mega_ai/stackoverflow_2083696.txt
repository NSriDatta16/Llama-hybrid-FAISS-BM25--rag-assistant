Technically your HTML is invalid. A list is a block level element and you can't (or shouldn't) embed then in paragraphs since they should only take inline elements. There is no Name and Age mentioned anywhere in your markup so I'm not sure what you're referring to there. Edit: to put the image on the left and have the two labels on the right one above the other, use this markup: Source Item Link Title and either this CSS: html, body, div, ul, li, img { padding: 0; margin: 0; border: 0 none; } #container { background: yellow; overflow: hidden; float: left; } #container img { float: left; } #container ul { list-style-type: none; float: left; background: green; } The float: left on the container is optional. It simply means that it isn't as wide as its container. The first line is a crude reset CSS. I'd suggest using a real CSS and a DOCTYPE always.
