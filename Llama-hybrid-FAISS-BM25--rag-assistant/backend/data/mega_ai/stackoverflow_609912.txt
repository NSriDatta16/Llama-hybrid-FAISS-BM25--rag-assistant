my understanding is that state pattern is quite good for UI only or in memory only executions, where in my situation when retrieving data back from application table, there still need to be if else statement to determine what object to cast to. public AbstractApplication convert_db_application_to_object(obj db_application) { AbstractApplication app; if (db_application.Status == (int)Status.New) app = application_factory.create(application_state_new); else if(db_application.Status == (int)Status.Closed) app = application_factory.create(application_state_closed); return app; } i don't see this as an elegant solution as i still need either an enum or lookup table to save the application status into database
