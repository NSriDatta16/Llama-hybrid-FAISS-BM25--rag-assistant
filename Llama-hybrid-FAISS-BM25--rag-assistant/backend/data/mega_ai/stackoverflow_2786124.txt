SQL Server CE doesn't directly support this; you'd have to use a different product. In addition to VistaDB , you could also use db4o if you don't need a relational database (it's an object database and has an isolated storage wrapper). You can technically use Reflection to get at the full path of an Isolated Storage file, and use the result in a connection string, although I would guess that if you're required to use Isolated Storage then your application is not running under full trust. And even if it is, it's still a dangerous thing to do. Still, if you get really desperate, you could have a look at this thread that has an example, which involves creating a stream and reflecting on one of the private fields of the stream that contains the file name.
