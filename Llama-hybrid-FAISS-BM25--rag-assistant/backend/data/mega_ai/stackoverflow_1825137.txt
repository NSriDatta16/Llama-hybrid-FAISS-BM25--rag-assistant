For the love of all that is holy and just and beautiful, please don't try to do anything with tables that requires you to know where the mouse pointer is relative to the tables. The amount of hurt you will receive will probably drive you insane. If the interface you're designing requires drag and drop, use something like divs or paragraphs or anything that uses the good old box model.
