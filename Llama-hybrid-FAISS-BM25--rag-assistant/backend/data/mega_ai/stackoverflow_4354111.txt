"Web Page Editor (optional)" package from the Eclipse Galileo/Helios update site has the following very minor quirks in a JSP editor: Auto-commenting in Java code fragments does not work (Ctrl /); [fixed in Helios SR2] [present in Galileo, fixed in Eclipse Helios SR1] If a Java code fragment has errors that are already fixed, the editor does not remove the error marks until you modify the erroneous place or close/reopen the file being edited; This was valid at Dec 7, 2010.
