What is the best way to model a spatialtemporal (3d) problem?

A very common problem in machine learning is that we have time variables. For this we use more statistical approaches like ARIMA or more ML approaches like LSTM. A sophistication of a time series is a space-time series, that is, we have time in one vector and latitude and longitude in two other vectors, and since our observations are autocorrelated in these vectors, we have a problem in 3 dimensions. Traditional machine learning models do not understand this behavior, for them the observations are independent of each other which is not true in this case. An example: I have a history of moving people around cities (either individually or in aggregates or small polygons) over the days and I want to predict what this flow will be like. What would be the right way to deal with such problems? Do we have a super 3d LSTM?
