I think there is no other way as using the extra method. It should look like this then (not tested): Item.objects.extra('avg': 'AVG(UNIX_TIMESTAMP(created))'.values('avg') The problem is, that you have to convert the date to a UNIX timestamp before. Otherwise you cannot calculate the average. An average of string will indeed produce garbage.
