Method to register method to be called when event is raised

I have a Panel which contains 20 PictureBox controls. If a user clicks on any of the controls, I want a method within the Panel to be called. How do I do this? public class MyPanel : Panel { public MyPanel() { for(int i = 0; i func ) { foreach ( Control c in Controls ) { c.Click += new EventHandler( func ); } } } How do I implement RegisterFunction() ? Also, if there are cool C# features that can make the code more elegant, please share.
