As Yogi Berra said, "It's tough to make predictions, especially about the future." Many stat software modules will generate forecasts based on the univariate stream of time series in the absence of any future information, e.g., Proc Forecast in SAS or any number of ARIMA modules available. These forecasts are projections based on the historic behavior of your data. You tell us that your data is monthly but don't tell us how many periods you have available. Another approach is to set your three IVs back 24 months relative to the DV so that the period they are predicting is t+24. This assumes that you have a sufficient amount of date both to initialize the model and calibrate any relevant seasonality, as appropriate.
