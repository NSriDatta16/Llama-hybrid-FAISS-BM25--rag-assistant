The continuous word representation using Neural Networks is widely used to represent words. Surprisingly, it has the ability to model the semantic context of words, i.e. detect similar words and put them near together in feature space. You can use the word2vect tool to process a large text corpus and create word vector. It is worth noting that for specific domain you need utilize a domain specific corpus for constructing word vectors.
