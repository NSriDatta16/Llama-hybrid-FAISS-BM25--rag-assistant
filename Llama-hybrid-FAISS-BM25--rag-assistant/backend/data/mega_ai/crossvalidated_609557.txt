Logistic regression tries to fit a model such as $$p(x_i)=\frac{1}{1+e^{-(\beta_0+\beta_1 x_i)}}$$ or equivalently with the log-odds $$\log_e\left(\frac{p(x_i)}{1-p(x_i)}\right)=\beta_0+\beta_1 x_i$$ to estimate $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ from the data, typically by using maximum likelihood methods: with the data $\{(x_i,y_i)\}$ where $y_i\in \{0,1\}$ , you find the $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ which maximise $\prod_i p(x_i)^{y_i}(1-p(x_i))^{1-y_i}$ . Here $p(x_i)$ is indeed a Bernoulli parameter in $(0,1)$ , varying with $x_i$ . You are trying to fit this with the logistic model. $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ are not Bernoulli parameters, and can each take any real value.
