Remember that the source could be generated through javascript, so you may not be able to "just" do a regex replacement for img src. Using Mechanize/Hpricot/Nokogiri in ruby: require 'mechanize' agent = WWW::Mechanize.new page = agent.get('http://www.google.com') (page/"img").each { |img| puts img['src'] = "http://www.yahoo.com" + img['src'] } And you are done!
