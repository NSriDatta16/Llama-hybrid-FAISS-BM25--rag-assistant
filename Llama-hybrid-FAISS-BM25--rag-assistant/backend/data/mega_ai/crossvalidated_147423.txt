Why do you have to use MLE instead of OLS in time series data?

I know it has something to do with the errors being correlated with the variable, but I'm not sure exactly what that means. Could someone please give me a quick simple explanation about why you must use MLE over OLS? Thank you edit: I'm also slightly confused about the details of the LM test used in the MLE procedure. I don't really need anything too in-depth, just some details of what actually goes on in this test.
