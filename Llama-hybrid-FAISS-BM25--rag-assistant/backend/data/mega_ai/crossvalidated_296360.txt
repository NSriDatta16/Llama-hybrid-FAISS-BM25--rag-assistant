On the one hand, GARCH is a model for the conditional distribution of the time series $y_t$: \begin{aligned} y_t &\sim d(\mu_t,\sigma_t^2), \\ \mu_t &= \dots \text{(e.g. some ARMA equation)} \\ \sigma_t^2 &= \omega + \alpha_1 ( y_{t-1} - \mu_{t-1} )^2 + \dotsc + \alpha_s ( y_{t-s} - \mu_{t-s} )^2 + \beta_1 \sigma_{t-1}^2 + \dotsc + \beta_r \sigma_{t-r}^2, \\ \varepsilon_t &:= \frac{y_t-\mu_t}{\sigma_t} \sim i.i.d(0,1). \\ \end{aligned} GARCH specifically characterizes the conditional variance equation, but this inevitably depends on some equation for the conditional mean; otherwise the conditional variance would be undefined. This hopefully answers your questions 1. and 3. On the other hand, GARCH happens to characterize the conditional variance of the residuals from the conditional mean model, $u_t$, as well. The exact same model as above can be represented as follows: \begin{aligned} y_t &= \mu_t + u_t, \\ \mu_t &= \dots \text{(e.g. some ARMA equation)} \\ u_t &= \sigma_t \varepsilon_t, \\ \sigma_t^2 &= \omega + \alpha_1 u_{t-1}^2 + \dotsc + \alpha_s u_{t-s}^2 + \beta_1 \sigma_{t-1}^2 + \dotsc + \beta_r \sigma_{t-r}^2, \\ \varepsilon_t &\sim i.i.d(0,1), \\ \end{aligned} and $\sigma_t^2$ is the conditional variance of the residual $u_t$ since $\text{Var}(u_t|I_{t-1})=\sigma_t^2$ where $I_{t-1}$ is information available at time $t-1$. This hopefully answers your question 2.
