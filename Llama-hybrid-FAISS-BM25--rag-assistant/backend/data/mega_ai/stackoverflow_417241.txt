Assuming that the allowed values for location and order are unique (i.e. when they come in, you can tell them apart, or else if they only supply one, how are you going to know if it's a location or an order?), then you could just take two parameters and work out what they are in the controller. Route: {controller}/{action}/{param1}/{param2} Controller action: public ActionResult MyAction(string param1, string param2) { string location; string order; if (!ParseLocation(param1, out location)) { ParseLocation(param2, out location); } // ... } Not particularly elegant, but does let you have the URLs you want.
