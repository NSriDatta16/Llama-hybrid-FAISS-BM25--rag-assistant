I'm going to guess from the code so far that you haven't covered ArrayList yet, and that if you submit a solution that does use it, your teacher might be a little suspicious :-) It looks like perhaps a couple of simple arrays would help. You will need to obtain the number of players first so that you can create arrays of the proper size. Use one array for storing cumulative scores for each player and one for storing number of scores for each player. Populate the array values as you gather the input. The stored values should then allow you to calculate average score for each player, team average, and highest player average. The key is that there's the input phase where you're populating the arrays, and then a calculation phase (where you iterate through the arrays and perform your caculations), and then a display phase.
