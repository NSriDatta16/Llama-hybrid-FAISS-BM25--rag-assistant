For .NET 3.5 and WCF REST 3.5, I don't know of any way to do this elegantly. .NET 4 and WCF REST in .NET 4 will support the "content negotiation" strategy that you use - just setting the ContentType = "application/json" will cause the service to automagically return JSON instead of XML. So if there's any chance for you, wait for .NET 4 (should be out mid April 2010) and use that - it should offer lots of improvements in WCF anyway, especially in the WCF REST area.
