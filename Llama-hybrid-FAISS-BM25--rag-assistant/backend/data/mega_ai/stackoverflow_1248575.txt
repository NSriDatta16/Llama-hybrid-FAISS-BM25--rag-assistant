Security implications of storing a password in Settings.bundle and getting with CFPreferencesCopyAppValue

Apologies for the seeming obviousness of this question, but for whatever reason I haven't been able to find a definitive answer in the Apple documentation about where and how Settings.bundle password info is stored. My question: if I need to store some credentials for an app, and I use a Settings.bundle so that the password is entered into a PSTextFieldSpecifier textfield in Apple's Settings area with IsSecure = YES, and then I access the value from my app using CFPreferencesCopyAppValue, never writing it out to NSUserDefaults and only sending it over the network securely, how secure is that storage and retrieval method when compared to storing and retrieving the password using the keychain in my own app settings? Thanks for your input.
