Help Identifying If Specific Problem is a Classical Comp Science Problem

I have a manufacturing-process issue I tackled ages ago in VBA, and it's held up for some time now although it's progressively running slower and slower as more data gets into the file. I think it's finally time to rewrite a more elegant solution in a different language, outside of VBA, but am curious if anyone knows of this being a classical computer science problem and if it has been given an academic name so I can research a quicker algorithm. I'll kind of outline it in point form below: Say there exists different types of Widgets.... call them... Widget-Type A Widget-Type B Widget-Type A has various serial numbers Widget-Type B has various serial numbers Furthermore, You can tell what Type a Widget is (A or B) based on the serial number alone. Serial Numbers are appended a build-date (i.e. 2010-08-10)... if the serial exists but the date is missing, the Widget exists but isn't finished being built. Widget-Type B can contain (one or more of) the parts from a Widget-Type A; therefore, Widget-Type B's serial number can have a list of sub-serial numbers from that of A. Similarily, Widget-Type A can contain (one or more of) the parts from a Widget-Type B; therefore, Widget-Type A's serial number can have a list of sub-serial numbers from that of B. Lastly, There exists a Widget-Type C Widget-Type C can only exist (be built) if given a Widget-Type A, that Widget-Type A has a build-date appended to the serial, AND all it's corresponding sub-serial numbers (from Widget-Type Bs) have build-dates appended to the serial. Again, you can have the other case that Widget-Type C can only exist (be built) if given a Widget-Type B, that Widget-Type B has a build-date appended to the serial, AND all it's corresponding sub-serial numbers (from Widget-Type As) have build-dates appended to the serial. As you can see, if Widgets A and B have many sub-serials, there's a lot of cross-checking and referencing going on to make sure a Widget C is produceable. I know this was kind of a long-winded description, but any ideas if this is a variant of any common computer science problem?
