Let me clarify your question: First, linear regression models comprise all linear models in general. Generally, linear regression models are all about describing the relationship of one variable (dependent) with other variables (independent). Second, simple and multiple regression models simply refer to the number of independent variables that one uses in a model. We have a simple regression model in case one uses only one independent variable. In case one uses more than one independent variable to describe a dependent variable then we are calling it multiple regression. Finally, one can estimate linear regression models in several ways. The most common technique is ordinary least squares (OLS). The OLS method minimizes the sum of squared residuals to estimate the model. It is conceptually simple and computationally straightforward. Other techniques include ML estimations or Bayesian regressions. That means, we can start talking about the necessary assumptions only once we know what estimation technique we are using to estimate a linear regression model. The only technique you mention in your question is ordinary least squares. You can find a basic understanding of OLS on the following website: https://economictheoryblog.com/ordinary-least-squares-ols This site also provides a nice and intuitive description of the assumptions of the OLS estimator: https://economictheoryblog.com/2015/04/01/ols_assumptions
