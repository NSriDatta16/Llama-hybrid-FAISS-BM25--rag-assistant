I don't think it is fragile -- at least I can think of scenario's where it won't be fragile. Have a retry time of 5 seconds and its not bad at all. its a KISS approach and there aren't any corner cases which you don't understand. Getting a distributed environment synchronized is not for the faint of heart, and its overkill in your example. To give you some confidence in your approach I can tell you that I have dozens of hand-written complex server processes distributed over a web-farm, they have never given me any grief even when database servers have disappeared, or when network trunks have gone down etc. They simply keep running in degraded mode till the databases come back.
