I suspect Trey's answer is probably elegant and preferred for some reasons that hurts my brain whenever I try to grok (defadvice) but I would take the brute force simple approach and use the following: (setq my-dired-default-dir "/home/fred/lib") (defun my-find-name-dired (pattern) "My version of find-name-dired that always starts in my chosen folder" (interactive "Find Name (file name wildcard): ") (find-name-dired my-dired-default-dir pattern)) I'm guessing that I lose history with this approach so if that is important to you Trey's approach is better. One of these days I have to wrap my head around (defadvice)
