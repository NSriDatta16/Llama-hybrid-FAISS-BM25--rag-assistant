Put a narrow view above your UITableView. This view would be a sibling of your UITableView, but in the front. Enable user interaction on that view, and in your code, when you get a tap on that view, determine if you want to keep it or pass it on to the UITableView and otehr views below it. If you want to pass it off, you call: [self.nextResponder touchesBegan:touches withEvent:event]; Otherwise, go ahead and handle it as you wish. Keep in mind that the right hand side of a TableView is usually where the index goes, if you've got it configured that way.
