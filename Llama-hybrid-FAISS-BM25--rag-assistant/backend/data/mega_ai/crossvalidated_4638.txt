I think that for subject-specific characteristics, like demographic data, you can proceed the usual way (t-test, etc.). This will help showing that your samples don't differ according to these variables. About self-reported attitude data, if you have very few items, skip to step 2, otherwise step 1 might be appropriate. 1. Assessing measurement equivalence Rather than saying that the two populations (or actually, samples) are "the same", I would say you have to show that your two questionnaires are assessing the same construct(s). This is what is done in cross-cultural surveys or international clinical trials where health-related quality of life is used as a secondary endpoint, for example. In each case, we have a set of items that purports to assess different dimensions, and we want to demonstrate whether we are measuring individuals in the same way irrespective of their country. When dealing with uni- or multidimensional scales, it is know as measurement invariance in psychometrics, that is you want to show that the factorial structure is comparable between the two groups. But, the same remark would apply as well if we were considering longitudinal data (I interpret your question as involving different samples at each time point). A multi-group confirmatory factor analysis is appropriate in this case. Standard references include: Meredith, W (1993). Measurement invariance, factor analysis, and factorial invariance. Psychometrika , 58 , 525-543. Vandenberg, RJ and Lance, CE (2000). A review and synthesis of the measurement invariance literature: Suggestions, practices, and recommendations for organizational research. Organizational Research Methods , 3 , 4-70. In R, the lavaan package provides facilities for that kind of analysis, but see the documentation: lavaan: an R package for structural equation modeling and more (ยง6.2). Otherwise, you have to resort on Mplus or a good software for SEMs. Studying Measurement Invariance Using Confirmatory Factor Analysis provides illustration with LISREL syntax. You may want to consider data from 6 to 12 months (to collect 1 or 2 waves for survey A). After that, I think you can just pool your data. 2. Assessing group comparability Now, if you cannot define a clear construct common to those two questionnaires, or if you have so few items that it would make no sense to consider a scale, then you can rely on basic group statistics for each item (using e.g., t-test, trend test for ordinal data, tests for nominal data, etc.). In this case, you are essentially studying between-group differences. This basically tells you whether (aggregated) scores differ, but not whether items are perceived as having the same meaning (or underlying the same construct) across the two groups.
