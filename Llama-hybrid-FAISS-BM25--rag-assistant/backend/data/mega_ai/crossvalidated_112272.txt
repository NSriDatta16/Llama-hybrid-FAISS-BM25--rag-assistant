Probably $p_F$ refers to the F-statistic developed by Iman and Davenport? They showed that Friedman’s $\chi^2$ is undesirably conservative and derived a "better" statistic $F_F=\frac{(N-1)\chi^2_F}{N(k-1)-\chi^2_F}$ which is distributed according to the F-distributionwith k−1 and (k−1)(N−1) degrees of freedom.
