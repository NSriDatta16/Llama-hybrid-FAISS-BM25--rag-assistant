I think that in a certain sense it is meaningful. The FDR is a frequentist achievment of a test (relating to the fact that 95% of the confidence intervals will contain the true value). The procedure you mention in your question is a Bayesian one and in general has no reason to provide this property simply because in general the Bayesian credibility interval (or HDI in your question) has no reason to come with the above mentioned frequentist coverage (see From a Bayesian probability perspective, why doesn't a 95% confidence interval contain the true parameter with 95% probability? fore details). So by making the test you mention, you can see in what extend a given Bayesian model has this, sometimes attractive, property. Notice that there exists the so-called "matching prior" that are priors ensuring the coverage property of Bayesian credibility interval of the associated model.
