Using Regression Analysis to Predict Property Prices

Hi I'm currently working on a project at my new graduate job, a client has come to ask us to create a model that predicts care home property prices, we have a lot of data on this, such as average house prices in region, number of beds in home, ensuite rooms, property specification. I have all these independent variables which I want to use to predict Property price (we also have some data on property prices). Now originally I wanted to create a sort of regression model similar to work I have done in university, on a software such as Stata, but my data has some percentages e.g. (Ensuite %), some in letters (Purpose built or Conversion). I have been put in charge of creating this model and am looking for any suggestions, or to bounce some ideas. Thank you very much in advance.
