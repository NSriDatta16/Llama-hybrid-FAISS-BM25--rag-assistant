A different approach to the for loop would be... $array = array(); foreach(range(0, 9) as $i) { $array[] = 'new element'; } print_r($array); // to see the contents I use this method, I find it's easier to glance over to see what it does. As strager pointed out, it may or may not be easier to read to you. He/she also points out that a temporary array is created, and thus is slightly more expensive than a normal for loop. This overhead is minimal, so I don't mind doing it this way. What you implement is up to you.
