Embedding only selected characters from fonts with ActionScript?

I would like to embed just a subset of characters from a font (for example only a certain number of Chinese characters instead of the whole character set). The traditional way I've known how to do this is using the "Include these characters" input box method outlined below: http://help.adobe.com/en_US/AS2LCR/Flash_10.0/help.html?content=00000277.html Is there a way to do the equivalent using only ActionScript? (and without using Flex)
