No, It doesnt annoy me, IE6 annoys me :) It would be a useful feature to have, especially in a css framework, however, are we not being encouraged to lump all our css into one file now for "optimisation". I havent heard any rumours about such a feature in css3, but there is still a way to go on that spec yet, so who knows, it could make it in if you make enough noise now!
