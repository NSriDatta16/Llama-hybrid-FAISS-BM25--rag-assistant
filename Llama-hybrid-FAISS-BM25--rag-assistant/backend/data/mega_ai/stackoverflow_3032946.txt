Your implementation, through integer division, ignores the smallest 4-5 bit of the random number. Since your RNG is seeded with the system time, the first value you get out of it will change only (on average) every 20 seconds. This should work: randx = (min) + (int) ((max - min) * rand() / (RAND_MAX + 1.0)); where rand() / (RAND_MAX + 1.0) is a random double value in [0, 1) and the rest is just shifting it around.
