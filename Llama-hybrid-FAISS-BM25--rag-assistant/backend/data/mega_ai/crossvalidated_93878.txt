Assuming the usual logistic regression model (that includes a constant) $$P(y_i \mid 1, \mathbf x_i') = \Lambda (\alpha+\mathbf x_i'\beta) = \left(1+\exp\{-\mathbf \alpha-\mathbf x_i'\beta\}\right)^{-1}\qquad i=1,...,n$$ the maximum likelihood estimator is such that, among other relations, we have $$\frac 1n\sum_{i=1}^ny_i = \frac 1n\sum_{i=1}^n\Lambda (\hat \alpha_{MLE}+\mathbf x_i'\hat \beta_{MLE})$$ The LHS is the proportion of the $y_i$'s taking the value $1$ in the sample. So in order to recover this proportion one would need to know the RHS -either component per component (the sample size and the estimated probabilities per observation), or as a single number (the "average probability"). So one does not need to know the regressor matrix, but, one needs to know something more than the values of the estimated coefficients, since moreover, there is no closed-form expression for the estimator.
