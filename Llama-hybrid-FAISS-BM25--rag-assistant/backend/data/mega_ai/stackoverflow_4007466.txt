Try to imagine the organization of the parts of your game in a slightly different way. In the first place this World class you mention could contain both the Map object also contain the Unit objects for the spawned player or creatures. The Map object which also contains Tile objects which each one have its own information as terrain and attributes. Also the Unit objects would contain the information related to each spawn. For the interaction with your player you could have a Game object that contains both the World and a representation of your player, namely a Player object, and this Game object would communicate the instructions from the player towards the World as to make things happen. As you can see each object contains other objects of finer detail, the World contains the Map that contains the Tile 's, this way the higher object uses the lower finer objects and makes them all communicate between them. This could be a good approach to start something quickly or to learn while you experiment. More complex situation require other ways of arranging all the information of the game like the Model-View-Controller structure, but you probably should not worry to much about it until you have learned enough as to know you need a better solution.
