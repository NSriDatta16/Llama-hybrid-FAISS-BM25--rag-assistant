Question does not quite make sense. Stationary distributions are not identified by ARMA parameters of the series. For the same ARMA parameter $A$ and $B$ (with stationary solution), any i.i.d. $\epsilon_t$ with finite second moment would give a strictly stationary series. Different marginal distribution of $\epsilon_t$ would give different stationary distribution. For a trivial example, take i.i.d. white noise with different distributions. What is "limit cyclostationary distribution"...? An example of cyclostationary series is seasonal ARIMA time series---e.g. the seasonal AR(1) specification $$ (1- \phi L^{12}) X_t = \epsilon_t. $$ In SARIMA notation, this is an SARIMA(0,0,0) $\times$ (1,0,0) $_{12}$ model. Its ACF is $\rho(12h) = \phi^h$ , and zero at other lags. No, clearly this is not true---e.g. take the unit root $(1-L) X_t = \epsilon_t$ . In fact, given the way you've specified ARMA series (with not intercept), there can be no deterministic trend.
