Flex: looking for Su-Sa Cal control

Ive been tasked with doing some scheduling work for our dept. One issue is the use of shared spaces (conference rooms, etc). To schedule such spots Im hoping to find a flex control that displays SuMTWThFSa with hours of the day onto which I can drag blocks of time. There are several commercial calendars (Ilog being one) that let one schedule using blocks of time over a calendar but they are pinned to actual dates. I want something that is just a week at a glance. Does such a beast exist?
