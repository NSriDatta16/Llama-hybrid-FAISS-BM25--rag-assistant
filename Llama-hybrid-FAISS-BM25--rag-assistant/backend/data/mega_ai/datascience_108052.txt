Seems like an unbalanced SVM could work here? https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/svm/plot_separating_hyperplane_unbalanced.html Looking at the features, I'd guess an rbf kernel would be more useful than a linear one (two of the above features look more-or-less gaussian). A grid-search for the optimal parameters could also be useful here.
