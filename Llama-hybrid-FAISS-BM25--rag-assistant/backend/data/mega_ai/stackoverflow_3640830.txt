Why not do the reverse. Look for all the substrings enclosed in tags. Then you know which parts of your string are not enclosed in . EDIT: More elegant solution: use split() and use the HTML as the delimiters. This gives you the HTML outside the blocks. var s = "blah blah formatted blah blah another formatted end"; var rgx = / .*? /g var nonPreStrings = s.split(rgx); for (var idx in nonPreStrings) alert(nonPreStrings[idx]);
