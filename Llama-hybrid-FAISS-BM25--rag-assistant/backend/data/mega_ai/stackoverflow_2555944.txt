See Drag-and-drop accordion panels? (ASP.Net) it is related. Basically, you use something like @Banzor's solution and then using something like $('#myrepeater').sortable( 'serialize'); and you stick those results in a hidden field whenever a postback happens. Then, you just look at the hidden field in ASP.Net and parse it as appropriate. It's easier to do than I can explain really :)
