AI Subdomain, sometimes referred to as an "Agent Address", is a digital subdomain used to host AI‑focused services and conversational interfaces. The concept was popularized by the startup New Generation as a turnkey solution enabling brands to deploy AI‑optimized storefronts and APIs alongside existing domains. Overview and purpose AI Subdomains serve as dedicated environments for natural language interaction and structured data access. They isolate AI functionalities such as chatbots, conversational commerce interfaces, or agent‑accessible APIs from a brand’s main website, reducing interference with traditional web traffic. Providers like New Gen facilitate instant subdomain activation that integrates with product catalogs to support AI agents and human users alike. The prevalence of AI-driven agents (such as ChatGPT) has shifted online discovery, recommendations, and commerce toward conversational modalities. Traditional website navigation has become less effective for agentic interactions. AI Subdomains address this by providing structured, brand-controlled spaces optimized for programmatic and conversational access. Use Cases Conversational commerce: Brands use AI Subdomains (e.g., ai.brand.com) to power product queries, recommendations, and purchases via chatbots or voice assistants, enabling simultaneous human- and agent‑driven traffic. Product experimentation: Subdomains can host beta AI tools, generative pages, or agent-focused interfaces separate from core properties. Research and collaboration: Academic or enterprise AI labs may deploy AI Subdomains to expose APIs, demos, and documentation within a controlled environment. Benefits Brand clarity: Adopting a dedicated AI subdomain signals corporate AI commitment and innovation. Technical optimization: Brands can tune infrastructure—APIs, caching, gateways—for conversational loads without affecting their main websites. Centralization: These subdomains consolidate AI-related tools, metadata, and analytics into a cohesive hub. Implementation and Management Deployment requires DNS configuration, backend integration, and catalog structuring. Platforms like New Gen offer rapid setup for storefronts accessible via agent‑friendly subdomains like ai.brand.com. Governance—including branding, compliance, moderation, and analytics—remains under the organization's control.
