Can UMDF drivers be packaged/shipped via WiX?

I put together a WiX 3.0 package, utilizing the DIFx extensions, with the intentions to install a Windows 7 Sensor (UMDF driver). During installation, DIFXAPP logged "No matching devices found in INF" and simply threw the driver into storage. I read I'm to populate my INF with an appropriate DriverPackageType , but according to MSDN's enumerated list , nothing fits. Is UMDF driver installation a supported scenario? If not, what's the best practice for using WiX to install such drivers? Disassembling the DIfx extension shows intent to support Co-installer packages, I have yet to try 3.5 beta.
