Stationary distribution of an infinite Markov chain

The exercise is asking for the stationary distribution, the estimated time to get from state $0$ to state $4,$ and to conclude if the chain is time-reversible. So I have the following transition matrix: $$P=\left[\begin{matrix} 1/2&1/2&0&0&0&\cdots\\ 1/2&0&1/2&0&0&\cdots\\ 1/2&0&0&1/2&0&\cdots\\ 1/2&0&0&0&1/2&\cdots\\ 1/2&0&0&0&0&\cdots\\ \vdots&\vdots&\vdots&\vdots&\vdots&\ddots \end{matrix}\right]$$ This means $P_{i,0} =1/2,$ $P_{i,i+1} = 1/2,$ and $P_{ij}=0$ in every other case. I have progressed up to this point: \begin{align*} n_1&=\frac12\,n_1+\frac12\,n_2+\frac12\,n_3+\dots\\ n_2&=\frac12\,n_1\\ n_3&=\frac12\,n_2\\ &\vdots\\ n_k&=\frac12\,n_{k-1}\\ \sum_{k=1}^\infty n_k&=1. \end{align*} I'm not sure how to solve the problem, though. Any help would be very much appreciated.
