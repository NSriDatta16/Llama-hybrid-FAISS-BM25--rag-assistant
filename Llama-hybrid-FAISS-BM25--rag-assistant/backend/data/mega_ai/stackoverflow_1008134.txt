I'd suggest you look at SQLIS.com, it's a great site written by some SSIS experts. There are a number of blogs, and we have some articles at SQLServerCentral.com, though not sure we have a good "get started" series. PragmaticWorks does a lot of SSIS and I've started to see some details on their blog about the various tasks.
