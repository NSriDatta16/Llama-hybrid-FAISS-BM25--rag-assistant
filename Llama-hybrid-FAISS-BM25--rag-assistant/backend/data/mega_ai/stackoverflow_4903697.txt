The reason CSS uses the box model as: +--------------------- | Margin | +------------------- | | Border | | +----------------- | | | Padding | | | +--------------- | | | | Width x Height Is because CSS is a document styling language. It was (originally) designed with research papers and other formal documents in mind, not as a way to make pretty graphics. As such, the model revolves around the contents , not the container. CSS isn't a programming language, it's a styling language. It doesn't explicitly tell the document how it should be displayed, it suggests some guidelines the browser should follow. All of these can be overwritten and modified by an actual programming language: JavaScript. Going back to the content-model idea, consider the following CSS: p { background-color: #EEE; border: 1px solid #CCC; color: #000; margin: 10px; padding: 9px; width: 400px; } height isn't specified, because the content defines the height, it may be long, it may be short, but it's unknown, and unimportant. The width is set to 400px because that's how wide the content (text) should be. The padding is just a means of extending the background color so that the text can be nicely legible away from the edges, just like how you leave space when writing/printing on a sheet of paper. The border is a means of surrounding some content to differentiate it from the other backgrounds, or to provide a border (go figure) between various elements. The margin tells the paragraph to leave some space between edges, and with margin-collapsing, each group will remain evenly spaced without having to specify a different margin for the first or last element. To maintain fluidity, width defaults to auto , which means the width will be as wide as possible: without squishing the content unreasonably without the padding extending beyond its container Of course, in edge cases, the padding will extend beyond its container because the content might get squished. It's all about the content.
