Common definitions in loose coupled design

I'm trying to put together a very granulary loose coupled design. But I can't decide how to handle common definitions. Right now I seperate concerns by adding it as an external dll. Through injection and interfaces my domain can use my business logic without knowing the implementation. The problem I'm having is that for all my components to be loosely coupled, they need to implement the same interfaces. My solution was a seperate project (dll) with just all the definitions. This started out well, but seems to become bloathed and chains all code together on this one dll-dependency. What's the most pragmatic way to go about ? Thanks!
