What are some compact algorithms for generating interesting time series data?

The question sort of says it all. Whether it's for code testing purposes, or you're modeling a real-world process, or you're trying to impress a loved one, what are some algorithms that folks use to generate interesting time series data? Are there any good resources out there with a consolidated list? No constraints on values (except plus or minus infinity) or dimensions, but I'm looking for examples that people have found useful or exciting in practice. Bonus points for parsimonious and readable code samples.
