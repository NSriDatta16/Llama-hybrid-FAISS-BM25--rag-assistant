Mean equation changes considerably after adding GARCH conditional variance

I am checking different GARCH models for my financial time series. What I have noticed is that regression coefficients in mean equation change considerably when different GARCH models are applied. Is it normal? I am not an expert, but my intuition tells me that changes shouldn't be dramatic. Maybe my model is bad? By the way, when I tried checking the best model using AIC/BIC; they all were approximately same, but coefficients considerably different.
