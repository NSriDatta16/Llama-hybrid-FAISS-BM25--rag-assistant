Choosing a model for my unsupervised machine learning problem

I need to choose a model for unsupervised machine learning problem. There are 4 clusters in 3D space. These are my requirements: I will run the same model multiple times with different training data (it is for real-time application). Size of training data is expected to be around 400 points. I can assume that points for each of the clusters are drawn from a Gaussian distribution. This is not necessary requirement to be present in the model. I need to get 4 points that represent "centers" of clusters. In prediction time, for each new point I need some kind of number for each cluster that will represent probablity of belonging to the cluster. I will have a lot of outliers, assume around 30%. I have tried Gaussian mixture model, and it works very good when I don't have outliers. Unfortunately, this model is very sensitive to outliers. Any suggestions how to handle the outliers with Gaussian mixture model? Or should I go with completely different model?
