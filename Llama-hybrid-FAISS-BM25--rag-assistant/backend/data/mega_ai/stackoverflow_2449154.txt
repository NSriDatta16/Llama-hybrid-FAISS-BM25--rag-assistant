A good framework for these kinds of calculations is Bayesian inference. You have a prior distribution of the demographics - eg 50% male, 37% childless, etc. Preferrably, you would have it multivariately: 10% male childless 0-17 Caucasian ..., but you can start with one-at-a-time. After this prior each site contributes new information about the likelihood of a demographic category, and you get the posterior estimate which informs your final guess. Using some independence assumptions the updating formula is as follows: posterior odds = (prior odds) * (site likelihood ratio), where odds = p/(1-p) and the likelihood ratio is a multiplier modifying the odds after visiting the site. There are various formulas for it, but in this case I would just use the above formula for the general population and the site's population to calculate it. For example, for a site that has 35% of its visitors in the "under 20" agegroup, which represents 20% of the population, the site likelihood ratio would be LR = (0.35/0.65) / (0.2/0.8) = 2.154 so visiting this site would raise the odds of being "under 20" 2.154-fold. A site that is 100% male would have an infinite LR, but you would probably want to limit it somewhat by, say, using only 99.9% male. A site that is 50% male would have an LR of 1, so it would not contribute any information on gender distribution. Suppose you start knowing nothing about a person - his or her odds of being "under 20" are 0.2/0.8 = 0.25. Suppose the first site has an LR=2.154 for this outcome - now the odds of being "under 20" becomes 0.25*(2.154) = 0.538 (corresponding to the probability of 35%). If the second site has the same LR, the posterior odds become 1.16, which is already 54%, etc. (probability = odds/(1+odds)). At the end you would pick the category with the highest posterior probability. There are loads of caveats with these calculations - for example, the assumption of independence likely being wrong, but it can provide a good start.
