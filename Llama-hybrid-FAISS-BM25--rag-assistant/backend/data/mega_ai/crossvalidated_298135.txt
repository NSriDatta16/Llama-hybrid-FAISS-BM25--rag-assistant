Average of all data vs. average of group averages

Assume I operate a chain of 20 hot dog stands. I am asked to figure out the average % of customers who buy a hot dog after visiting a stand. Method 1: Divide total number of hot dogs sold by all 20 stands by the total number of people who visited one of my stands. Method 2: Follow process for method 1 for each individual stand. Then take the average of the 20 individual averages. Are there any inherent benefits/drawbacks of method 1 vs. method 2? Any implicit assumptions in either approach?
