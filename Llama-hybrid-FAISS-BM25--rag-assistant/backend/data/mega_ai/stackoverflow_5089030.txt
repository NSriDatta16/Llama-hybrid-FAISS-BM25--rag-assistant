How do I create a radial cluster like the following code-example in Python?

I've found several examples on how to create these exact hierarchies (at least I believe they are) like the following here stackoverflow.com/questions/2982929/ which work great, and almost perform what I'm looking for. [EDIT]Here's a simplified version of Paul 's code, which now should be easier for someone to help get this into a radial cluster instead of this current cluster shape import scipy import pylab import scipy.cluster.hierarchy as sch def fix_verts(ax, orient=1): for coll in ax.collections: for pth in coll.get_paths(): vert = pth.vertices vert[1:3,orient] = scipy.average(vert[1:3,orient]) # Generate random features and distance matrix. x = scipy.rand(40) D = scipy.zeros([40,40]) for i in range(40): for j in range(40): D[i,j] = abs(x[i] - x[j]) fig = pylab.figure(figsize=(8,8)) # Compute and plot the dendrogram. ax2 = fig.add_axes([0.3,0.71,0.6,0.2]) Y = sch.linkage(D, method='single') Z2 = sch.dendrogram(Y) ax2.set_xticks([]) ax2.set_yticks([]) fix_verts(ax2,0) fig.savefig('test.png') But instead of a tree-like structure, I need a radial cluster like the following diagrams.
