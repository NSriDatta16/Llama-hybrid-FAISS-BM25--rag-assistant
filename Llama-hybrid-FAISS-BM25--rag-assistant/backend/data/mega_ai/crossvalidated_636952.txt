EDIT: I was endorsing the notation indicated below. At first I was on board, on the basis of the fact that the notation for probabilities (e.g., $\mathbb{P}(\theta)$ ) also appears function-like but doesn't actually follow the function-like convention of putting inside the parentheses the argument(s) and/or operand(s). However, I'm concerned it could be too confusing. Thus, I have a new suggested notation indicated in another answer I've posted on this page. Original post: parameter: $\theta$ estimator of $\theta$ : $\operatorname{estr}\left(\theta\right)$ estimate of $\theta$ : $\hat\theta$ standard error of $\operatorname{estr}\left(\theta\right)$ : $\sigma_{\operatorname{estr}\left(\theta\right)}$ estimator of the standard error of $\operatorname{estr}\left(\theta\right)$ : $\operatorname{estr}\left(\sigma_{\operatorname{estr}\left(\theta\right)}\right)$ As far as I am aware (I also asked ChatGPT 4), "estr" is not an operator name that is already used in other areas of mathematics, thus there is little to no risk of cross-disciplinary confusion with using it. Notice the letter 'r' in $\operatorname{estr}()$ is important, otherwise it would be $\operatorname{est}()$ which novices may easily misinterpret as "estimate"
