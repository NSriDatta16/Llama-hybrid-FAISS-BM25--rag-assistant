Interpreting the pre-processing information of a the ridge regression

I have a dataframe of 39,600 records and 13 columns (12 of which are the predictors. 3 of the 12 are factor variables, the rest are numeric). The response variable Class has 2 outcomes ('Normal' and 'Malicious'). I tuned a ridge logistic regression as follows library(glmnet) library(caret) lambdas However, when I examined the ridge_log_mod , it showed there were 13 variables (instead of 12) for the Pre-processing step as shown below > ridge_log_mod glmnet 39600 samples 12 predictor 2 classes: 'Normal', 'Malicious' Pre-processing: centered (13), scaled (13) Resampling: Cross-Validated (10 fold, repeated 3 times) Summary of sample sizes: 35640, 35640, 35640, 35640, 35640, 35640, ... Resampling results across tuning parameters: lambda Accuracy Kappa 1.000000e-03 0.9890320 0.9780640 1.149757e-03 0.9890320 0.9780640 1.321941e-03 0.9890320 0.9780640 1.519911e-03 0.9890320 0.9780640 ... I simply couldn't understand where that number 13 came from. Did it mean the train(.) function also scaled the response variable Class ? How did the function train(.) scale the 3 categorical variables? Did I do something wrong?
