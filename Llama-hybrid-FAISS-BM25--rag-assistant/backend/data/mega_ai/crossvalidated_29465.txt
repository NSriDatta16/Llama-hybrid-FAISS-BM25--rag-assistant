martinthenext! I am not sure about the peculiarity of your problem, but if it's really crucial for you not to show -1 samples to a user, maybe you would better have a look at so-called "One-class classification" , carefully described in a publicly available paper . SVM method is presented there, but as I understand, it can be generalized for any metric algorithm. The paper even describes a method when you are given some number of -1 samples (section 2.2). You can then combine this approach with online learning: just update the decision rule, with one new sample it will change very little (that comes from the properties of metric algorithms) and will converge when the number of samples increases.
