Steps to perform time series analysis

I'm trying estimate an autoregressive model with an exogenous variable. It's about the impact of changes in oil prices on the economy. I'm planning on regressing gdp growth rate on its own lagged values and lagged values of oil price. I don't know from where to start. Here's what I think so far: I should check if the gdp and oil price are stationary, right? (dickey-fuller test??) Find the number of lags for gdp and oil price.( AIC criterion?.) Estimate the model. Test the signification of the estimators, heteroscadesticity and then serial correlation. Should I test for the presence of cointegration? later I'm planning on using the same variables in a Markov switching model. I have the same question for Grangers causality test. I've been reading a few books and watching more than one video about times series, but I still can't find my way through it. Can you please guide me and see if there is something missing in those steps?
