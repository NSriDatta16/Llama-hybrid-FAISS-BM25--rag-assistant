async_write - boost. Does it copy the buffer?

async_write(*this, BoostAsio::buffer(pck->_storage), boost::bind(&tcp_socket::handle_wrote, this, pck, BoostAsio::placeholders::error)); pck is allocated on heap, if I delete it, would _storage become invalid as well or does async_write copy the buffer into its internal structures and it can be freely deleted/allocated on stack? Thank you.
