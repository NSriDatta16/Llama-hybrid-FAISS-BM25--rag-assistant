There are a few methods, but it depends on your software. If your using Apache, you can look at the following: apache_request_headers() getallheaders() apache_response_headers() for figuring out what you are going to send back. I believe that all of those links above require that apache be configured as a module, and not as a cgi. You can check your current settings if you are unsure by using your phpinfo() and seeking Server API. If it says CGI, your out of luck on these functions. There are however additional variables that you can use if your looking at the CGI installation. These exist both with the module and the CGI/CLI API's btw, and are all children of the $_ENV/$HTTP_ENV_VARS (envirornmental) superglobal: HTTP_ACCEPT HTTP_ACCEPT_ENCODING HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE HTTP_CONNECTION HTTP_USER_AGENT HTTP_REDIRECT_STATUS HTTP_REMOTE_ADDR HTTP_REMOTE_PORT SERVER_PROTOCOL and REQUEST_METHOD You may have more depending on your configurations, but chances are these are containing all the information you are looking for. If your php version is >= 5.0.0, you can also use get_headers() which I believe is API independant. Hope that helps!
