A primary advantage to a linked list as opposed to a vector is that random-insertion time is as simple as decoupling a pair of pointers and recoupling them to the new object (this is of course, slightly more work for a doubly-linked list). A vector, on the other hand generally reorganizes memory space on insertions, causing it to be significantly slower. A list is not as efficient, however, at doing things like adding on the end of the container, due to the necessity to progress all the way through the list.
