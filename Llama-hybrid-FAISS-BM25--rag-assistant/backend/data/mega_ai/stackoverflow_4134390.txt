Max, Min, Average are part of Linq: int[] ints = new int[]{3,4,5}; Console.WriteLine(ints.Max()); Console.WriteLine(ints.Min()); Console.WriteLine(ints.Average()); Median is easy: UPDATE I have added order: ints.OrderBy(x=>x).Skip(ints.Count()/2).First(); BEWARE All these operations are done in a loop. For example, ints.Count() is a loop so if you already get ints.Length and stored to a variable or simply use it as it is, would be better.
