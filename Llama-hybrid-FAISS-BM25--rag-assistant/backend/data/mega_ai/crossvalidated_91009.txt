One way to do it is to represent a kernel as a convex combination of kernels having different parameters and have MKL algorithm decide which kernels to use. Here is great paper on MKL algorithms: Sonnenburg, SÃ¶ren, et al. "Large scale multiple kernel learning." The Journal of Machine Learning Research 7 (2006): 1531-1565.
