Installing Office 2003 and 2007 side-by-side on the same machine is definitely possible - we do it in our organisation even on end-user production workstations. In that linked article, Microsoft recommend that you don't do this for actual use. But in your case it appears to be just for a single build machine, i.e. you're not going to actually use either version of Office on that machine. In this context, I would try to see if you can make the side-by-side installation work. My assumption might be wrong, and you're attempting to do this for every developer's machine. In that case, you should ignore this answer :-)
