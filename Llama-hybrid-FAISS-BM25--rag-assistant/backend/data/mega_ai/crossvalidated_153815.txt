I see a strong seasonality. Look at the attached picture: I split your time series in two parts (2012 and 2013), and then I drew three squares (A,B,C) representing three four-months-periods for each year. Notice that the pattern inside squares A,B, and C belonging to different years is very similar. Such a similarity indicates a strong seasonality in your data.
