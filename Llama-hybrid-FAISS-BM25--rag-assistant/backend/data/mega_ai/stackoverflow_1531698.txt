Implement custom zooming for a UIScrollView

I have a UIScrollView with the requirement that, when zooming, the contentSize.height should remain the same. Zooming in from 200x100 should result in a new contentSize of 400x100 instead of 400x200, for instance. I'd like to do my own drawing while the user is zooming. I don't think I can use the normal zooming behaviour of UIScrollView to achieve this, so I'm trying to roll my own. (I could just let it do its thing and then redraw my contents when -scrollViewDidEndZooming:withView:atScale: gets called, but that wouldn't be very pretty). Currently I am subclassing UIScrollView and trying to do my own zooming when two fingers are on the screen: - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { if ([touches count] != 2) { [super touchesMoved:touches withEvent:event]; } else { // do my own stuff } } I thought that by overriding touchesBegan:withEvent:, touchesMoved:withEvent:, touchesEnded:withEvent: and touchesCancelled:withEvent: in this way should work, but it doesn't. An earlier failed attempt was to place a transparent view on top of the scrollview and send touches that I'm not interested in to the scrollview : - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { if ([touches count] != 2) { [self.theScrollView touchesMoved:touches withEvent:event]; } else { // do my own stuff } } Any help would be appreciated. Thanks, Thomas
