Because I had to explain why I wanted to co-op (besides needing the money) during my interview, my manager made sure my first project allowed me to work on what I had identified as weak areas: very little Linux experience (I chose a Linux-only R&D team so I would be forced to learn), not knowing a useful text editor (I really wanted to learn Vim), and how to learn another programming language (very different approach than learning a language as you learn to program). He told me I was being paid to study for a while. I learn best by reading books, so after chuckling over Unix for Dummies (yay! I wasn't the only one who thought this was obscure and knuckleheaded sometimes) I started with Unix in a Nutshell and Sobell's Practical Guide to Linux Commands . After that I printed out the Vim documentation and started going through it. Then I looked through a couple books on Python, the language of my first project. I was given all the time I needed to feel comfortable about these things (which was the real problem, as I now understand) and then began adding functionality to a previous co-op's project. I realize now it would have been terrific to meet with someone every day or two for code review, as Kamikaze Mercenary said.
