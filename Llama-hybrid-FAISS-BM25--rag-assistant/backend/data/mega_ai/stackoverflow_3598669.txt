cookie or localStorage with chrome extensions

I've read all the other q's here regarding the topic but couldn't solve my problem. I'm setting on my website the email of the user in the localStorage and i want to retrieve it in the extension. localStorage.setItem("user", "andrei.br92@gmail.com" ); But when i try to receive it with the chrome extension it fails to do so value = localStorage.getItem("user"); Which way is easier ? cookies localstorage ? im not pretentious
