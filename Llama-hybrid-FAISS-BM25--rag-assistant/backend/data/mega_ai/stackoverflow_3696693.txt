Finding the maximum area in given binary data

I have a problem with describing algorithm for finding maximum rectangular area of binary data, where 1 occurs k-times more often than 0. Data is always n^2 bits like this: For example data for n = 4 looks like: 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 Value of k can be 1 .. j (k = 1 means, that number of 0 and 1 is equal). For above example of data and for k = 1 solution is: 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 But in this example: 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 Solution would be: 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 I tried with few brute force algorithms but for n > 20 it is getting too slow. Can you advise me how I should solve this problem? As RBerteig proposed - the problem can be also described like that: "In a given square bitmap with cells set to 1 or 0 by some arbitrary process, find the largest rectangular area where the 1's and 0's occur in a specified ratio, k."
