You can perform selection and logistic regression simultaneously using the LASSO or Elastic Net regression algorithms. The basic idea behind LASSO is to solve the $l_1$-penalized optimization problem $$\min_{\beta} \{ l(\beta) + \lambda||\beta||_1 \},$$ where $l(\cdot)$ is the likelihood function. Popular implementations, e.g. glmnet , efficiently solve for a grid of $\lambda$ values. This is useful because we usually don't know $\lambda$ a priori and need to apply some type of cross-validation. If you have correlated features then it helps to add some $l_2$ (ridge) penalty, which is the idea behind the Elastic Net. Since you don't have a lot of data, I think this is probably your best bet. If you want to use a separate variable selection stage you will need to choose a metric (e.g. deviance of single-variable regression) and also a threshold. The LASSO gives you only one parameter to tune and operates within the context of multivariable logistic regression models directly. EDIT: The question now specifically requests an approach that is implemented in SPSS. As I don't have/use that software I don't know whether lasso logistic regression is implemented. Perhaps someone can let us know in the comments.
