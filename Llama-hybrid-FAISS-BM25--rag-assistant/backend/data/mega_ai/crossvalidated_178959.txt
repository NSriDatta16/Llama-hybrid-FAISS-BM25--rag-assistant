You can do this with linear regression! Whether you use the MLE or minimize the mean squared error, you are actually modeling the mean response, conditional on the predictors, and you are implicitly assuming that the response itself is normally distributed around that mean. For other distributions, you would use a generalized linear model. What you're looking for also arises naturally as the "posterior predictive distribution" in a Bayesian model. It might be helpful to think of maximum-likelihood-based inference as Bayesian inference with flat priors. Fully nonparametric density estimation is very difficult in general except in low-dimensional cases. I asked an involved question about it about a year ago, but I can't find it now.
