I think that dbRDA (distance based Redundance Analysis) can solve your problem. You need a Y-variable (dissimilarity matrix of your species composition) and two X-variables (Lat and Long, in this case you don't need a spatial distance matrix, you use your coordinates). If you want, you can use more X-variables too, maybe ecological variables. R use capscale() function of VEGAN package to do dbRDA. Then you can use anova() and RsquareAdj() or plot() to explore your results (dbRDA object) and the importance of your variables to explain your species differences between your plots.
