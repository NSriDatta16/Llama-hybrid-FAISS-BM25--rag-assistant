In some ways, I've found it striking how much I had been unconsciously using functional style programming, without recognising it for what it was. For example, in Java I make heavy use of constructs in Commons Collections such as Transformer and Predicate, which are essentially closures, but implemented as Java interfaces. You then use the provided utility functions to transform and filter elements in a collection. This goes against the "standard" imperative way of doing this sort of thing in Java. These, of course, are vanilla functional map and filter operations, but I had been instinctively using them without realising what it was. That suggests to me that functional style is to a large degree intuitive even if you're not told about it.
