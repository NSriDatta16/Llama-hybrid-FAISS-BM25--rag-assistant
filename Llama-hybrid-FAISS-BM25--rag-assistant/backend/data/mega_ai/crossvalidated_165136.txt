Finding all relationships from 500 independent variables to 400 dependent variables (time series)

I am interested in finding statistically significant relationships from a set of 500 independent variables X (actually about 25 variables + their 25 annual moving average x 10 monthly lags) to a set of 400 possible dependent variables Y (200 + their moving averages). I have about 50 data points which represent monthly data. What is the best way to go about this? So far, I have done 200,000 univariate OLS regressions from each X to each Y. Using the Bonferroni correction, I am able to find a number of significant univariate models. How can I go on to multivariate modelling from so many possible variable combinations? I am mostly interested in solutions that can be implemented in Python.
