Android MapView with High Res tiles?

I have created a simple map app that shows the local garage sales in my town. It was simple enough to create and I parse out the Google Maps (html) xml doc that the local paper uses on their google maps mashup on their website. I have noticed that the Map Tiles used in the MapView class are not as high-res as the tiles used in the real Android Google Maps app (I have a Droid). I have searched the docs and google, but I cannot find any info on this. Actually, I can't even find anyone mentioning this, which surprises me and makes me think I am missing something simple. Is this a case of Google making the APIs available, but at a lower quality, or am I missing some setting that enables higher quality map tiles?
