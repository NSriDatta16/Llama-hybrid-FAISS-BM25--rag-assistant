Calculate the average marginal effect (AME) in the multilevel regression with glmmTMB package

I am writing this message because I want to calculate the average marginal effects (AME) in order to be able to interpret an interaction resulting from a multilevel regression. However, I am finding that the vast majority of packages that are used for this purpose (marginal and marginaleffects) cannot be applied to regressions from the glmmTMB package. Any recommendations? Thanks
