Interpretation of results in non-inferiority study

I need some help interpreting some results from a non-inferiority study. The primary endpoint for assessment of non-inferiority is the change from baseline in Power of Attention Score. The study is looking to show that the new treatment is no worse than placebo in its impact on a patient's cognitive function. The non-inferiority limit is 121ms. Results from the analyses show a difference between treatment groups of 23.23ms in terms of increases from baseline in power of attention score (Placebo-Treatment), so the new treatment is showing a smaller increase from baseline than placebo. The 95% CI for this difference is (-145.1,191.59). Given that the mean increase from baseline was smaller in the new treatment group and the upper limit of the 95% CI is I am asking this question as I am a little confused on whether to be using the upper bound of lower bound of the non-inferiority interval. The 95% CI does in fact include the lower limit. Also, the CI is very wide so I am wondering how valid this conclusion is anyway based on the number of patients included in the analysis. Thanks for your help with this.
