I suppose your could use ffmpeg to do that kind of conversion, calling it via exec() or an equivalent. (I've seen quite a couple of questions/answers on SO that use ffmpeg to do some kind of video-conversion) To answer the question about "*why flv is preferred for video ?*" : I suppose it's because : Almost everyone has flash player installed in their browser while not everyone has a video-player -- especially when you think about the multitude of exiting codecs and using flash probably allows for better embedding of the videos in the browser Well, at least, this is for now -- we'll see in some time, with HTML 5, if this still stands ^^
