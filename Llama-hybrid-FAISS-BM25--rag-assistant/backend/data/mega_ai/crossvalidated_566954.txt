Why do I get different results for the Isolation Forest after using PCA?

I am working on an unsupervised anomaly detection project and used the Isolation Forest and AutoEncoders (a normal one and a VAE) to detect anomalies. The AutoEncoders' prediction are identical but are different than the Isolation Forest's prediction. Since I a have One-Hot-Encoded dataset which has 200 features I wanted to visualize the data by using PCA for dimensionality reduction (down to two dimensions). Out of curiosity I used the Isolation Forest on the new, lower dimensional dataset and got completely different results and I do not understand why. Does the Isolation Forest not work on datasets transformed by PCA? Furthermore, is it possible for the Isolation Forest and an AutoEncoder to have completely different results when it comes to detecting anomalies ? Since it is unsupervised, I cannot measure the accuracy etc.
