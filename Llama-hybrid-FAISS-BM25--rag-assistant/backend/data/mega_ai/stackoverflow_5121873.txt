According to the OpenGL ES 2.0 specification , glReadPixels() only supports RGBA as the format to read back from your FBO. I believe the extension you quote there only allows for BGRA pixel format data to be provided to your texture, not that you can read back an FBO in BGRA format. As Ben suggests, you can just swizzle the color components in your fragment shader if you need to have the end result be BGRA.
