In java, the convention is to name packages prefixed by the reverse of the domain name of the package provider. For example, the package "foobar" developed by microsoft (which owns "microsoft.com") might be named "com.microsoft.foobar". If your company owns the domain "fantastic.net", you would name the package "net.fantastic.foobar". The packages are organized on disk related to their name, so "net.fantastic.foobar" would be in the folder "com/fantastic/foobar". This is just a simple, low-overhead way to prevent two companies from developing packages that have the same name. FWIW, the "com" in a domain name context stands for "commercial", as in "related to commerce". Wikipedia has more information if you are curious.
