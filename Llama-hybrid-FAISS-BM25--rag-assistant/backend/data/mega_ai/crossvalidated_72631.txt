Machine learning algorithms/approaches for class recommendations?

I am asking a theoretical question about machine learning in terms of clustering. Is it possible, given a set of data of classes that students have taken in a semester to recommend additional classes that students should take if they selected some classes? I am thinking along the line of forming clusters of classes and figuring out if a particular set of picked classes match with a pre-existing set of classes. Then, recommend the class that are in the set. But I am new to machine learning, and so welcome any other suggestions of algorithms. In addition, this is not particularly theoretical, so feel free to ignore: but does anyone know any particular software that can accomplish this? I know LensKit is a software to handle recommendations but it seems to need ratings (which I do not have). I welcome any mathematical manipulations that can turn clusters into "ratings." Thanks.
