How to use Random Forest for categorical variables with missing value

I have a labelled dataset of 1M rows and 600 features. I am trying to build a supervised learning model for prediction. I am particularly working with Random forests in R. The data I have has following properties. Most of the features are categorical in nature. Each categorical variable has multiple levels ( some of them having 20 levels) Some of the features have data missing Can random forests work without imputation of these missing values? If no, then what is the best way to impute these missing categorical values? Any literature or R functionality which addresses this issue will be really helpful.
