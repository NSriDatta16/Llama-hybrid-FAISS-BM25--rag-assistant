Difference between AR(1) lagged models with exogenous variables versus ARIMA(1,0,0) models with exogenous variables

Assume a general time series $y_t$ for $t = 1, \cdots, T$ and a sequence of known exogenous variables $x_t$. Consider the two options: Fitting the parameters $a$ and $b$ of the lagged model $y_t = a y_{t-1} + b x_t + u_t$ with $\{u_t\}$ standard noise. On the other hand, fitting the parameters $c$ and $b$ of the model $y_t = b x_t + n_t$ with $n_t = c n_{t-1} + u_t$ [i.e., using ARIMA(1,0,0) with the same exogenous regressors] I am wondering what is the relation between these two approaches, as they both seem to account for dynamic effects in the time series, such as e.g., trends.
