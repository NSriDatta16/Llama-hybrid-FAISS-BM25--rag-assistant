Statistical Significance , which approach?

[editing original post to clarify my question] I have looked at some of the other posts on this but still can't grasp if these 2 are different approaches to determining somethings stat sig, or if one/both are just plain wrong. Approach 1: Control group ={mean: 10, CI (90%)=[5,15]} Test Group = {mean: 20, CI(90%)=[17,22]}. This is stat sig because 90 % of control group is below 15, and 90+ % of test group is above 15. Thus the distribution of average test - control > 0 with 90% CI so we have a stat sig result. Approach 2 : Control group ={mean: 10, CI (90%)=[5,15]}, Test group ={mean: 20}. Because the mean of test group is > +2 SE of the control the effect is stat sig. Are either of these approaches right/wrong?
