What you're asking is essentially the general form of how do I get a confidence interval for the mean of a function broadcast over a sample. This should help you out. You're already 95% of the way there. Thus, the inference here is (usually) about a nonlinear function of the parameter vector $\beta$ . Presumably this means that forming a confidence interval involves use of the asymptotic normal distribution for the coefficient vector, combined with the delta method to deal with the nonlinear transform. I am aware of some general ways this could be done, but I'm not sure what is "best practice" here. This is precisely what you should do if you want a confidence interval. If the data are independent, then it's fairly easy to derive. After you compute your Delta method distribution, you're just multiplying by a vector. So, $$ \sqrt{n}\left(w^T g^{-1}(X\beta) - w^T\mu_\delta \right) \sim N\left(0, w^T \Sigma_\delta w \right)$$ You have to be careful about how you define the covariance matrix you use in your Delta method approximation. Do you want a confidence interval for the mean (in which case you want to use the $\Sigma = \Sigma_\beta$ from the coefficient estimates)? Or do you want a prediction interval for the quantity (in which case you'll want to use $\Sigma = \Sigma_\beta + \sigma^2 I$ combining the prediction uncertainty as well)? You should be able to derive the necessary quantities for logistic regression with this. You seem to know the Delta method already. You know $g^{-1}$ for logistic regression, $\frac{\exp(X\beta)}{1 + \exp{X\beta}}$ . You can get the necessary covariance matrix from glm . It's just a matter of plugging it in.
