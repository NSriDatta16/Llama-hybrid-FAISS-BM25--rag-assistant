Python: Elegant way to check if at least one regex in list matches a string

I have a list of regexes in python, and a string. Is there an elegant way to check if the at least one regex in the list matches the string? By elegant, I mean something better than simply looping through all of the regexes and checking them against the string and stopping if a match is found. Basically, I had this code: list = ['something','another','thing','hello'] string = 'hi' if string in list: pass # do something else: pass # do something else Now I would like to have some regular expressions in the list, rather than just strings, and I am wondering if there is an elegant solution to check for a match to replace if string in list: .
