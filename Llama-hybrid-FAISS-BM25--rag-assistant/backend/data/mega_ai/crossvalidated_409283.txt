Multivriate Time Series Model - ARIMAX

I have Weekly Units sales data of products for 2 years (104 weeks). And I am trying to forecast the Unit sales for each productid for next 8 weeks.. Please find the data image below. note: Productid column denotes the products. Columns like Mtype, DType, Weight and PPU(Price Per Unit) are main KPIs helps in Unit's sales. My Target Variable is Units, All other columns are Predictor Variables. Like the above 3 weeks data sample, I have data around 3000+, for 104 weeks. How can I perform multivariate time series analysis ? I don't have any other period column other than "Week" column. How can I make it into ts data ? I am stuck in the begining intself, as how to use the time (period) column ?
