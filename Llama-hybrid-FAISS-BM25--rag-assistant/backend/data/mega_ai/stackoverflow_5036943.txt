How to store a very large image on an iPhone/iPad

What's the best way to store a very large image for an iOS app? I want an app to be able to view images that might be hundreds of megabytes, perhaps as much as a gigabyte as jpeg. I need to be able to store the image and retrieve selected areas for display. Currently the images are cut into 512x512 pixel tiles and stored as jpeg files in a directory tree with tens of thousands of tiles (actually an image pyramid including downsamples). Ignoring the question of displaying the image, I'm interested in the most efficient, manageable way to store this data on the device: files, like they currently are, in an sqlite database or something else? Second part to the question. Is there a limit to the amount of data an app can store, or can an app keep importing data up to the storage limit of the device. I'm asking here about data that an app imports after it's installed.
