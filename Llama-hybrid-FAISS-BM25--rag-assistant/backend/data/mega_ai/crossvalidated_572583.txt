How to deal with low survey response rate and hypothetical question about influence of people not responding?

Background: Imagine you are running a survey, asking 1000 random people: "do you like blue marbles?" Now, 200 people respond. 150 say yes, 50 say no. If I had only sent that survey to only those 200 peoples, I know how to make pymc3 give me a Bayesian estimation of the proportion of people that like blue marbles. However, in this case 800 people did not respond to the survey. When I present my estimation results I can say that am assuming those 200 are a random sample under assumption that people responding was random. Problem scenario: But say when someone is reviewing my results, they have a question: "Let's suppose that people that did not like blue marbles are twice (or any other number) as likely not to respond. How does your result change?" So far, all tutorials I can find on data imputation assume some columns are missing, not entirely not responding to a survey Questions: How do I handle that in a Bayesian way? Can I tell pymc3 to handle that? Note : Since I am self-learning pymc3 I prefer answers using it, but I really do not mind if you know how to solve this using, for example, R and Stan or Julia and Turing.
