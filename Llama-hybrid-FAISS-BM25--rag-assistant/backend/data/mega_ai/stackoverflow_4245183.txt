HTTP requests failing on mobile networks, fine on WiFi

I have an WP7 application that I have been developing via the emulator. This app sends off a few web requests and waits for the responses. It works fine on the emulator but on the phone it only works on the wifi. Any ideas? EDIT: On mobile networks the application just closes after the first reqest is made. I'm pretty sure that there is some sort of exception being thrown here as it is the only time the app would close without user input. To further aggravate the issue I live in an area where there is no mobile coverage so I cannot test with the debuger attached. EDIT: ok tests done, it seems the first request I send comes back null. This only happens when on a cell network, it works fine on WIFI here is the request: RequestUrl = String.Format("https://www.o2online.ie/amserver/UI/Login?org=o2ext&IDToken1={0}&IDToken2={1}", UserName, Password)
