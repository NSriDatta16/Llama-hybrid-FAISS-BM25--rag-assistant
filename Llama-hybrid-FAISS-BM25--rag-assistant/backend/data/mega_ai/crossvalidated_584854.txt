Summarize LDA output using PCA

According to the perplexity' score, optimal number of topics for my dataset is 100. Once I run my LDA algorithm, I'd like to input those topics into an OLS but 100 independent variables is too much. My idea was to summarize them using a PCA (or t-sne) but i'm not so sure if I can given LDA is already a dimension reduction technic. Would you have any suggestions in that regard ? Thanks
