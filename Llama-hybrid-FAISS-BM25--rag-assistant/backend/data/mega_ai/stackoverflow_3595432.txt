WordPress 3 Visual Editor - How to add spaces?

I am using WordPress 3.0.1 and the Twenty-ten theme. How can I add spaces to this section of text in the Visual Editor? HTML Editor Mode looks like this: - With each visit each client will be provided with a full detailed report and invoice - Each pool and spa service and maintenance is covered with an activity check list - Each personnel has the experience required - Our organization can supply and install all major brands and models - All workmanship is guaranteed - All products supplied come with manufacture warranties But I am in actual fact modifying this block of text within the Visual Editor using manual entry with the hyphens and text but unfortunately when I press shift-enter between the words "detailed" and "report" first line, the "return" word does not sit right under the word "With" even when I add spaces before the "return" word.
