Options for uniquely identifying objects at runtime?

I need to attach a unique identifier to objects at runtime. The identifier must be unique for the duration of the application. I plan to do this my having a private member variable in the base class of my object model. This variable will be set at object initialization and the value will remain constant for the life of the object. No other object can have the same identifier for the duration of the application. I can, of course, use a System.Guid , but that costs a 128 bits of storage for each object and I would like to consume fewer resources. I tried using an Int32 and initializing it with the System.Environment.TickCount property, but I don't get enough resolution and some objects wind up having the same value assigned. The documentation for the TickCounter says that the TickCount property will roll to negative after ~29 and then back to zero in another 29 days. I would happly trade more resolution for a shorter roll over time. Do I have other options that I don't know about?
