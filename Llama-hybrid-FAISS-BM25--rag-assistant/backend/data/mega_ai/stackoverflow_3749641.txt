I believe this is working as espected. What I mean is, if you put an attribute on a table that establishes a relation between two entities, that table MUST (from data representation theory at least) be represented as a proper entity. If you think about this carefully you'll understand why. The quantity you mentioned is an attribute of the relation not of any of the related entities. As such that table must be treated as an entity and not as a relationship. Now on how to overcome this, one thing that comes to my mind (although I'm not sure if this will completly solve your problem) is to treat the relationship as you originally thought (without the quantity) and have another table (that will be mapped to an Entity in you model) that stores the quantity of a certain relation. I think that this table can even have a foreign key constraint on you db to the original relationship table, although this foreign key can't be mapped to a relation on your model (because you have no entity for the endpoint), but this still allows you to mantain data integrity on you storage. Hope this helps, VÃ­tor
