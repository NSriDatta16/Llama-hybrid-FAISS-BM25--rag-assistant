I recommend {smartassembly} . We have been using this now for quite a while and have had great results. Quoting their website, here are some features: Further secure your .NET application (Strings Encoding, Anti-disassembler & Anti-decompiler options, Strong Name signature...) Deploy your .NET application in one file (Dependencies Merging, Compression and Embedding) Remove all non-useful code and metadata (Pruning) Perform other code optimizations (Memory Management, Automatic Sealing of Classes...) And debug your obfuscated and deployed assembly (automatic unhandled exception reporting via 24x7x365 managed Web Service).
