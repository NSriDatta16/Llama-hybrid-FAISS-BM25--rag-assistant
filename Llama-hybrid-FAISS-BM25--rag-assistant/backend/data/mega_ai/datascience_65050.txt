How to interpret coefficients from logistic regression?

I ran a logistic regression (statsmodel) on my data with 60 features using the below code import statsmodels.api as sm logit_model=sm.Logit(y_train,X_train_std) result=logit_model.fit() print(result.summary()) I was able to see that few variables had negative coefficient and few had positive coefficients . Am I right to understand that irrespective of sign of coefficients, all the below variables are significant predictors that influence the outcome? Or does negative coefficient mean they don't have any influence on the model outcome? But p-value is significant. Am a bit confused. Can you help in simple terms please The below output shows the records whose p-values were less than 0.05
