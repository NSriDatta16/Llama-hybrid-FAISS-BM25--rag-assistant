Ok, so you say just storing the data..? You really only need a DB for retrieval, lookup, summarising, etc. So, for storing, just use simple text files and append lines. Compress the data if you need to, use delims between fields - just about any language will be able to read such files. If you do want to retrieve, then focus on your retrieval needs, by date, by key, which keys, etc. If you want simple client side, then you need simple client db. SQLite is far easier than BDB, but look at things like Sybase Advantage (very fast and free for local clients but not open-source) or VistaDB or firebird... but all will require local config/setup/maintenance. If you go local XML for a 'sizable' number of records will give you some unnecessarily bloated file-sizes..!
