View controllers do not have any size attributes associated with them (that information is stored within the view). However, you can change the width of your UITableView by setting 'frame' property or by updating the properties in interface builder (Tools > Inspector > Size). If you have a UITableView contained within a UIView, you should be able to drag to resize in interface builder.
