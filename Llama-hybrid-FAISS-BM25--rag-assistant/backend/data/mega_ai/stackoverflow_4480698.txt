For sending your own crafted TCP packet on Windows 7, you will need a driver like WinPcap . If you use WinPcap, you can use one of the many .NET wrappers or code your own. Sending a raw frame only with objects provided by the Windows API (like sockets) will not work. Just look in TCP/IP Raw Sockets . The only alternative would be to create your own network monitoring driver, or to buy a commercial version of WinPcap which does not require installation but integrates seamlessly into your program. On Windows 7, Windows Vista, Windows XP with Service Pack 2 (SP2), and Windows XP with Service Pack 3 (SP3), the ability to send traffic over raw sockets has been restricted in several ways: TCP data cannot be sent over raw sockets. For the case you change your mind. Maybe you can find something you need in the library eExNetworkLibrary . It includes a WinPcap wrapper and a lot of methods and objects to craft and analyze packets. May it will be useful.
