Perhaps some are thinking it as a way to do variable selection via automated stepwise or other methods, but I think it might hide some problems related to data minining results quality. Why not do first independently all models and do some quality checking via ROC-curves or such? It could also be proper to do ensembling, such as averaging probability estimates from the various models.
