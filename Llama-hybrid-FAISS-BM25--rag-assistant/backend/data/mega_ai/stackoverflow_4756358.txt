Queries against Windows Azure table storage can return partial results with a continuation token, which means you need to reissue the query (with the continuation token) to get the next batch of results. Typically, you'll see code that just uses .AsTableServiceQuery() and then enumerates, which will cause that chain of calls to happen transparently during enumeration. This code is doing it explicitly, by using BeginExecuteSegmented to retrieve each batch of results. Right below the line List listSongs = resultSegment.Results.ToList () , you should be able to consume those Song s. (More may be coming, but those results should be valid and usable.)
