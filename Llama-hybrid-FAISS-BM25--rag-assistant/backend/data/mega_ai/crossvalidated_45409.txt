Dimitriy’s answer is ok if the grades are Gaussian already. In the general case, just perform quantile renormalization : modify your grades to map their quantiles on the Gaussian quantiles. The following R code generates normal grades. Pay attention to the use of rank to deal with ties. # generate uniform grades grades I have to warn you that many teacher tell this (with varying values for mean and standard deviation), but this is just a joke. Don’t do this. I once made a normal qq-plot for around 150 grades. It was almost perfect. This is not very nice, because it’s what you expect if answers are random and independent... I never tried that again, since then.
