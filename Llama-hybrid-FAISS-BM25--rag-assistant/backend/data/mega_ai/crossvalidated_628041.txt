Shift target values by a big value to improve the Mean Absolute Percentage error (MAPE)

I'm working on a Machine Learning regression task, where I have to predict a continuous value, and I have to minimize the Mean Absolute Percentage error, the problem that the target values ranges from zero to a bigger values, but most of the values are closer to zero, and when calculating the MAPE, it explodes due to small numbers in the denominator, so I came up with idea of shifting the values by some big amount, like adding the value 100 to each of the target values, and after training I can subtract 100 from the predictions to get the real value, I tried it and it works well, but is that right? $$ MAPE = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{t=1}^{n}\left| \frac{At - Ft}{At} \right| $$
