Others have pointed out the XSD support in visual studio. This has a visual designer, but while it will not map to your classes - it can create strongly typed objects. XMLSerialization is great in a few cases: 1) Data transfer (web services) 2) To save time in prototypes. I strongly recommend against direct XML serialization of objects as a persistence mechanism (permanent storage). When you need to change your schema it will be painful. Yes, there are theoretical solutions, I've never seen them work easily in practice. I have felt a lot of pain maintaining (and re-architecting) quick serialization solutions and feel strongly about this :) The question is why you are exporting the domain model? Is this an just an export functionality? If so, serialization is probably great. You might not find a visual tool to do this. But it's usually easy to create formal, even pretty, XML with attributes on the classes.
