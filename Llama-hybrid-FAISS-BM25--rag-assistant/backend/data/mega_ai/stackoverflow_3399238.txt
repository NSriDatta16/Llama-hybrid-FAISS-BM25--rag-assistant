PHP config quark with if statements

Ok this is weird on my development server if I am running a test on a script and shorthand a if statement like so: if($_GET['cat']){ ... Instead of a more pragmatic way like so: if(isset($_GET['cat'])){ ... I will get errors stating that Notice: Undefined variable: pwdmsg in C:\wamp\www\myfile\decrypt-text.php on line 16 Just wondering if anyone would know what this could be not a big deal really because I only do it when I am testing a theory or trying to check something it is just an annoyance. Oh and please don't ding my question if it's something totally stupid or like "...even n00bs know that!" I just know it doesn't do it on my live server but does on my dev server. My basic dev-server info: PHP 5.3.0 Apache 2.2.11 MySQL 5.1.36 PHP exts: * Core * bcmath * calendar * com_dotnet * ctype * date * ereg * filter * ftp * hash * iconv * json * mcrypt * mysqlnd * odbc * pcre * Reflection * session * SPL * standard * tokenizer * zip * zlib * libxml * dom * PDO * openssl * SimpleXML * wddx * xml * xmlreader * xmlwriter * apache2handler * curl * gd * imap * mbstring * mysql * mysqli * Phar * pdo_mysql * pdo_sqlite * mhash
