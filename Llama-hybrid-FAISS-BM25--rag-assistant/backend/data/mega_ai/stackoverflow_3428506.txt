Edit : Unfortunately in Xcode 4.0, this capability was removed. Once you have your subview configured in Interface Builder, you can create a new group (use the cog button at the bottom of the library window) and drag your subclass object (containing your images and labels) from the list view (i.e. not the layout view) back to the library window. You can then graphically add multiple instances of your view subclass to any interface builder view or window like you would with the built-in objects in the library.
