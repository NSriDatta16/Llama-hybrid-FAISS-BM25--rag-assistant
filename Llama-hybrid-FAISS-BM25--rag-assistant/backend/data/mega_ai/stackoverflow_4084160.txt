A static local variable e.g. self once initialized (one first pass through the function getInstance) remains for the entire duration of the program unless explicitly deleted. Therefore it is perfectly safe to return the reference to self . Note that it is getInstance which is static in the function declaration. Storage class specifiers are not allowed on return types of a function. I would suggest you to use the Monostate design pattern unless of course the need for Singleton is strongly suggested
