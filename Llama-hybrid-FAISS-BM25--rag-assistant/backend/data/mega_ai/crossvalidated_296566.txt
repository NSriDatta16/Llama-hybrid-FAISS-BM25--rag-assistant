When you sum $N$ IID samples from a univariate distribution, the sum approaches a normally-distributed value. Not exactly. The sum doesn't converge. Under certain conditions, the average converges to the mean, and a scaled version of the de-meaned average converges to a normal distribution . In particular, using your example, say you have an RV $X_i \sim \chi^2$, then its MGF is $$ \left( 1 - 2t \right) ^{-\frac{k}{2}}. \; (1) $$ The second-order expansion of (1) is $$ \sim \left( 1 - 2t \right) ^{-\frac{k}{2}}|_{t = 0} + \frac{\partial \left( 1 - 2t \right) ^{-\frac{k}{2}}}{\partial t}|_{t = 0}t + \frac{\partial^2 \left( 1 - 2t \right) ^{-\frac{k}{2}}}{2 \partial t^2}|_{t = 0}t^2 = 1 + k t + \frac{k}{2}(k + 2) t^2 $$ If you have $n$ independent RVs $X_1, \ldots, X_n$ with this distribution, then the MGF of $\sum_{i = 1}^n\left[x_i/n\right]$, which is just a linear combination, is therefore known to be $$ \sim \left( 1 + k\frac{t}{n} + \frac{k}{2}(k + 2)\left(\frac{t}{n}\right)^2 \right)^n $$ The MGF of $\sqrt{n} \left(\sum_{i = 1}^n\left[x_i/n\right] - k\right)$, therefore, is $$ \sim \left( 1 + \frac{\frac{k}{2}(k + 2)t^2}{n} \right)^n \sim e^{\frac{k}{2}(k + 2)t^2} $$ This is the MGF of a normal distribution.
