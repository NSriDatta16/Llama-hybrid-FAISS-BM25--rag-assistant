Sales prediction with neural networks

How is a time series like the Rossmann Kaggle competition used to forecast sales? The simplest solution I saw is a random forest. There the data for every time point is used to feed the random forests. So there is no time dependence because I use every data at each time as independent. Thats also good. But what I a doing if I want to solve this with a neural network? So my input layer corresponds to every time point (for the same time independence)? In the data mining Cup 2017 there is a similiar competition. there are over 5000 products with attributes like if it was clicked or drawn to the basket or ordered. Since there are intreractions between the user actions like clicking at the product, history come important. Do I have to train a neural network for each product to forecast revenue?
