In SharePoint 2010, this functionality is provided out of the box. From the Microsoft SharePoint Team Blog : To add an item to this library, you can click on the Add document button in the view. That button will always be available at the end of the current page, if you want to quickly add documents to this library. When you click it, you’ll notice that instead of navigating the entire page, we just put up a dialog asking you where you want to upload. This makes it faster to load and also easier to understand what’s going on. For this post, I actually want to upload multiple files – so go ahead and click on Upload Multiple Files. ... You can drag files onto the blue rectangle to add them to your upload list, or you can click on Browse for files instead to find the files in a windows dialog. Once you’ve picked them, click Ok and they will start uploading I just tried this in a SharePoint 2010 Document Library. I created a hierarchy of folders and added a couple notepad files to it. I then dragged the topmost folder into the Upload Multiple Files dialog and it uploaded that folder along with all of its subfolders and files. Note that use of Upload Multiple Files requires Silverlight on the client.
