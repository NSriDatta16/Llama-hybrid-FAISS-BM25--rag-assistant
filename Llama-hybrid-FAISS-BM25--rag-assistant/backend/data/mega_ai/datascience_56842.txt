You can use google colab which is free. It proposes notebooks usage, which are hosted on a server with good GPUs for machine and deep learning. You can write python code and train your models in real-time. https://colab.research.google.com/ However, if you are inactive for a medium period, the platform will eject you. So if you plan to train really big models durings days and weeks, you should use cloud plateforms like AWS or Google Cloud. Note that these plateforms can quickly become expensive (but you often get some free credit when you register).
