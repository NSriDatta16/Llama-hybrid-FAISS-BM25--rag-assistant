Is this a case for ordered logistic regression?

I have the following study setup: Three groups of people were asked a question, and the answer was ordinal (likely, somewhat likely, somewhat unlikely, unlikely). In my data set, I have a contingency table between the response and groups, and would like to know whether some of the groups of people were more inclined to answer the question with likely than others. EDIT: I didn't clearly state this above, but I want to treat the answer as ordinal, i.e. likely = 1 I think I could do it with an ordered logistic regression model, but isn't that like shooting cannon at sparrows?
