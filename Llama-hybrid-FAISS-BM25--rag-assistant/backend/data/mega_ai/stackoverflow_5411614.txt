Your life would be easier if your JSON was actually data represented as JSON, instead of serialized DOM fragments embedded in a JSON value, e.g., [ {"value": "one"} , {"value": "two", "selected": true} ] Then when you turn that into an object, you could just do something like this (assume for the sake of the example that you named the result myArray ): myArray[0].selected = true; // Select the first element myArray[1].selected = false; // Deselect the other element; in many cases, you'd probably need some sort of loop.
