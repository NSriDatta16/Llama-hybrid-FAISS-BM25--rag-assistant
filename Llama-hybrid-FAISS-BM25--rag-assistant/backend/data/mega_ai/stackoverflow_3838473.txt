I had a quick look at your Weld setup on Tomcat and it looks ok (just in case, see 18.3.1. Tomcat for details if required). However, I have some questions/remarks: Is your archive CDI enabled? In other words, do you have a beans.xml file (for a web application, the beans.xml file can be in either the WEB-INF directory or in the WEB-INF/classes/META-INF directory)? See Why is beans.xml required in CDI? You're not supposed to instantiate beans yourself (like in new InjectionExample() ) if you want your beans to be managed by CDI. Use @Inject . I did not really pay attention to the fact that you were trying to inject something in a ContextListener , I was too much focused on the use of the new operator. That being said, while the Weld documentation states that the CDI specification requires the container to provide injection into non-contextual resources for all Java EE component classes , I'm totally sure of what this covers, especially when using Tomcat. Personally, I would try to get CDI working with a Servlet first (or maybe use a full blown Java EE 6 server to avoid any limitation).
