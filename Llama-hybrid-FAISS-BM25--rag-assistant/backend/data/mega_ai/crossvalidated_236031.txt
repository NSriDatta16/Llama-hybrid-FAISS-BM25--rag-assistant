Extract data for bayesian meta analysis of survival data

I want to do a meta-analysis of survival data using a bayesian framework (gemtc). In the package documentation the input needed are the responders and the exposure in person-time for each arm of a study. How can i calculate these data from published studies? Are the responders the percentage of person alive at a certain time point? How do I deal with censored data when calculating person-time?
