Coming to this site after counting my bubble distributions and using power law for viscosity data. Skimming through the example data sets in the power law paper by Clauset et al. they have put up some real horrors of data sets, far from the power law data sets to support their argument. Just from common sense I certainly wouldn't have tried to fit a power law function to the whole data range for most of them. However, self-scaling behaviour in the real world may be valid across a part of an observed system, but break down when some system property reaches a physical or functional limit. The very readable papers below refer to growth-curve fitting for ecologists, with a good discussion on power law and related distributions, based on observation-based models of population behaviour. The author is much more pragmatic than Clauset et al. Quoting: "...if the aim is only a best ﬁt and scales outside the scale window of the data set are not discussed, any model may sufﬁce given that it produces a good ﬁt and produces no maxima or minima inside the scale window studied." "One is often forced to ﬁt the same model, as other researchers have applied to their data, in order to be able to compare parameter values, but one can do this in addition to the application of a better ﬁtting model or models with better expected shapes, or both."
