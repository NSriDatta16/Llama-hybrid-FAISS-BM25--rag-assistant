How to build a portal page with saveable state in jquery UI?

I know I should spend more time researching this and having a go before asking the question but I've got just 2 weeks to build a site with a portal style homepage (much like http://www.bbc.co.uk ). I'm fairly good with jQuery and have played with jQuery UI draggables in the past but I was wondering if there were any tutorials or best practice examples of how to build a portal with multiple drop zones and the ability to remember which "portlets" have been dragged into which dropzones in some kind of state object. I would need to be able to save the state object to the back-end using a $ajax() call and somehow reorganise the portlets when the user logs back in to the site, presumably by sending a JSON state object from the back-end. Just some ideas of where to start would be useful. Thanks
