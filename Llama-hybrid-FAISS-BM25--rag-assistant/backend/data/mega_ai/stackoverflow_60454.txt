It encourages users to sign-up to OpenID, find out more about it and hopefully to evangelise it themselves. Stack Overflow proves just supporting OpenID can work. "Adds critical point to failure to the site" In the event of an OpenID provider failing to work, the site should have a mechanism to allow users to login and add/change OpenID providers. Perhaps the site could email a temporary link to bypass security so users can access their account. "Takes a user to another sites content and every time they logon to your site" My OpenID provider allows me a trust a given website so I do not need to even view their website. "Adds a non-trial amount of time to the signup" This becomes less of an issue the more sites that support OpenID.
