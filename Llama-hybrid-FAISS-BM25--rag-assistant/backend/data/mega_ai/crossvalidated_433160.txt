Quantile forecasts are really little different from prediction intervals. For instance, if you want a symmetric 90% prediction interval, you would use the interval between a 5% and a 95% quantile forecast. (As a matter of fact, I don't really see a way of calculating prediction intervals that does not explicitly or implicitly use two quantile forecasts.) That said: Each submission to the Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2017 (GEFCom2017) of course used a different approach to calculating these quantile forecasts. Many of the submissions were explained in papers that appeared in a special issue of the International Journal of Forecasting , somewhat confusingly entitled "Energy Forecasting In The Big Data World". It's volume 35, issue 4 of the IJF , and the various papers make for interesting reading. Yes, that ties into my opening paragraph: if you have an expectation forecast and a forecast of the future standard deviation, you can add a distributional assumption (e.g., normal) to the mix and derive predicted quantiles, and any two quantiles will give you a prediction interval. Energy data typically has rather long histories, with many observed seasonal cycles. Energy demand usually exhibits multiple-seasonalities , so when we talk about a "seasonal naive forecast", we need to specify which seasonal cycle we are talking about. The simplest and highest frequency one is the intra-daily cycle. There are also intra-weekly and intra-yearly cycles. So if the seasonality is the intra-daily one, then we can derive a "seasonal naive 90% quantile forecast" for next Monday by taking the observations from all past Mondays and taking the empirical 90% quantile of these - interpolating when necessary.
