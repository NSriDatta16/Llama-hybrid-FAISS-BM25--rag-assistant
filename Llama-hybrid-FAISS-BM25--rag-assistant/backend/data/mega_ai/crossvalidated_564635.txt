t-test with data in long-format including levels of non-interesting factor in R

I've computed an ANOVA with one between-subjects factor (2 groups each including 26 participants) and 2 within-subjects factors (item type with 3 levels and emotion with 2 levels) in ezANOVA. Therefore, my data is ordered in a long-format in which all conditions for each participant are listed underneath each other: ID group itemType emotion dependentVariable p001 A type1 negative 3.88 p001 A type1 neutral 2.34 p001 A type2 negative 5.21 p001 A type2 neutral 10.00 ... When I am now computing post-hoc t-tests, e.g. the difference between two item types in a specific group regardless of the emotionality of the items, should I then keep working in this long-format? Or should I change into a wide-format which includes the average over the non-interesting factor, in this case emotionality? I am wondering if in case of the long-format, R might treat the levels of the non-interesting factor as two independent observations and that this computation might then be statistically incorrect? In case of the long-file, I used this code: t.test(x = long_file $dependentVariable[long_file$ delay=="A" & long_file $itemType=="type1"], y = long_file$ dependentVariable[long_file $delay=="A" & long_file$ itemType=="type2"], paired = TRUE) resulting in t=2.43, df=51, p=0.02 I used this code to analyze the dependent variable as average of the non-interesting factor in a wide-format: t.test(x = wide_file $dependentVariable_type1_averageOverEmotions[wide_file$ group=="A"], y = wide_file $dependentVariable_type2_averageOverEmotions[wide_file$ group=="A"], paired = TRUE) resulting in t=2.38, df=25, p=0.03 So, in this case, results don't change a lot regarding the statistical significance, but using the long-format doubles the degrees of freedom.
