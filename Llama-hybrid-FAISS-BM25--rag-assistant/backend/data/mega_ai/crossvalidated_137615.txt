It seems the creators of this particular R command presume one is familiar with the original Dickey-Fuller formulae, so did not provide the relevant documentation for how to interpret the values. I found that Enders was an incredibly helpful resource (Applied Econometric Time Series 3e, 2010, p. 206-209--I imagine other editions would also be fine). Below I'll use data from the URCA package, real income in Denmark as an example. > income It might be useful to first describe the 3 different formulae Dickey-Fuller used to get different hypotheses, since these match the ur.df "type" options. Enders specifies that in all of these 3 cases, the consistent term used is gamma, the coefficient for the previous value of y, the lag term. If gamma=0, then there is a unit root (random walk, nonstationary). Where the null hypothesis is gamma=0, if p 0.05) then we presume a unit root exists. From here, we can proceed to interpreting the tau's and phi's. type="none": $\Delta y_t = \gamma \, y_{t-1} + e_t$ (formula from Enders p. 208) (where $e_t$ is the error term, presumed to be white noise; $\gamma = a-1$ from $y_t = a \,y_{t-1} + e_t$ ; $y_{t-1}$ refers to the previous value of $y$ , so is the lag term) For type= "none," tau (or tau1 in R output) is the null hypothesis for gamma = 0. Using the Denmark income example, I get "Value of test-statistic is 0.7944" and the "Critical values for test statistics are: tau1 -2.6 -1.95 -1.61. Given that the test statistic is within the all 3 regions (1%, 5%, 10%) where we fail to reject the null, we should presume the data is a random walk, ie that a unit root is present. In this case, the tau1 refers to the gamma = 0 hypothesis. The "z.lag1" is the gamma term, the coefficient for the lag term (y(t-1)), which is p=0.431, which we fail to reject as significant, simply implying that gamma isn't statistically significant to this model.

"tau2" is still the $\gamma=0$ null hypothesis. In this case, where the first test statistic = -1.4462 is within the region of failing to reject the null, we should again presume a unit root, that $\gamma=0$ . The phi1 term refers to the second hypothesis, which is a combined null hypothesis of $a_0 = \gamma = 0$ . This means that BOTH of the values are tested to be 0 at the same time. If p $a_0$ or $\gamma$ are not 0. Failing to reject this null implies that BOTH $a_0$ AND $\gamma = 0$ , implying 1) that $\gamma=0$ therefore a unit root is present, AND 2) $a_0=0$ , so there is no drift term.

In this case, the test statistics are -2.4216 2.1927 2.9343 In all of these cases, these fall within the "fail to reject the null" zones (see critical values below). What tau3 implies, as above, is that we fail to reject the null of unit root, implying a unit root is present. Failing to reject phi3 implies two things: 1) $\gamma = 0$ (unit root) AND 2) there is no time trend term, i.e., $a_2=0$ . If we rejected this null, it would imply that one or both of these terms was not 0. Failing to reject phi2 implies 3 things: 1) $\gamma = 0$ AND 2) no time trend term AND 3) no drift term, i.e. that $\gamma =0$ , that $a_0 = 0$ , and that $a_2 = 0$ . Rejecting this null implies that one, two, OR all three of these terms was NOT zero.
