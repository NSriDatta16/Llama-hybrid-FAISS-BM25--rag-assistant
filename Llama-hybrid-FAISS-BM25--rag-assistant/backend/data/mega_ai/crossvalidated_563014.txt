If you have a large number of customers and you can consider a linear model, you may choose to use a random effects term for customer. Random effects are great for categorical variables with large number of levels. Without them, you may see huge and unrealistic differences for different customers, especially if there isn't a lot of data for some of them. You can also include lag terms for previous payment delay of the customers. You may have to write some code to create these features. Perhaps columns for (delay in customer's previous order) and (delay in customer's order 2 previous), ... An interaction between the customer variable and the lagged variable will allow each customer to have their own contribution of this history. However if you have a large number of customer and lag terms, this will explode the number of features. I would start small and try only 2 lags to start. An alternative to including multiple lags is to calculate the exponential moving average of the previous payment delays for each order within each customer. For example using R function TTR::EMA . You will have to assume a value for the constant. But this has the advance of less features, and smooth contribution from larger set of previous order information.
