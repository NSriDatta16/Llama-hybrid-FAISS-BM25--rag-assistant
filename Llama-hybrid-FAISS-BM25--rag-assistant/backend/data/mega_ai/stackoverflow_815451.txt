Well I would start to find a system / programing language which is available for the top phones on the market. I think a good go is python for that. Which makes it easy to use large portions of the same code on all of the phones which are going to be supported. Then I would probably start with the iPhone, because I believe its userbase is still demanding for new toys :) Creating a webapplication would be another way... but that would mean you need to be online. if you are not using flash or some other possibilities of persistent storage. P.S.: I would not use javame :) .. I still don't like anything java at all
