How do I specify max results for a filter query in Django?

I want to retrieve the first 500 results from a large database that match a given filter query. At the moment I'm using the following (terribly inefficient) method.. results = Entries.objects.filter(text__icontains="somequery")[0:500] But I think this query loads the entire database in memory and then truncates the results. It's terribly slow. Is there a more elegant way to do this? Thanks!
