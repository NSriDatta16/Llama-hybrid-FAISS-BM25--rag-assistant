Logistic regression: What are use cases for logistic regressions where $n \neq 1$, i.e., $n >1$?

NOTE: This question relates to Binomial logistic regression. Thus, the $n$ in the title, refers to the parameter of the Binomial distribution. Most real-world use cases of logistic regression introduced in statistics courses and employed in machine learning models are about binary logistic regression where $n = 1$ . Given that the logistic regression, in general, is based on a Binomial distribution (as can be seen, for example, in the application of logistic regression models in R, where the R library/package, glm , requires the user to set the argument family to binomial , in order to perform logistic regression. My question is thus: What are use cases of logistic regression where $n \neq 1$ , i.e., $n >1$ ?
