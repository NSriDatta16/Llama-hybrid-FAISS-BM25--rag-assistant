How should I organize my Git repositories and branches to create multiple versions of a website?

I'm an SVN user hoping to move to Git. I've been reading documentation and tutorials all day, and I still have unanswered questions. I don't know if this workflow will make sense, but here's my situation, and what I would like to get out of my workflow: Multiple developers, all developing locally on their work stations 3 versions of the website: Dev, Staging, Production Here's my dream: A developer works locally on his own branch, say "developer1", tests on his local machine, and commits his changes. Another developer can pull down those changes into his own branch. Merge developer1 -> developer2. When the work is ready to be seen by the public, I'd like to be able to "push" to Dev, Staging, or Production. git push origin staging or maybe git merge developer1 staging I'm not sure. Like I said, I'm still new to Git. Here are my main questions: Do my websites (Dev, Staging, Production) have to be repositories? And do they have to be "bare" in order to be the recipients of new changes? Do I want one repository or many, with several branches? Does this even make sense, or am I on the wrong path? I've read a lot of tutorials, so I'm really hoping someone can just help me out with my specific situation. Thanks so much!
