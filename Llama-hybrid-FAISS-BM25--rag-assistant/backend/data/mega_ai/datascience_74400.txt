How to pre-process the name String of a customer?

I implement logistic regression to predict if a customer is a business or a non-business customer with the help of TensorFlow in Python. I have several feature candidates like name, street, zip, longitude and latitude. At them moment I am thinking of how to use the name field. The name often has repeating parts like “GmbH” (e.g. “Mustermann GmbH”) which in this context has a similar meaning to Corp. which is an indicator that the customer is a business customer. This information is useless in combination with the other parts of the name because then the name will be unique. So my question is: how should I pre-process this field so that only repeating parts will be used to predict the classification?
