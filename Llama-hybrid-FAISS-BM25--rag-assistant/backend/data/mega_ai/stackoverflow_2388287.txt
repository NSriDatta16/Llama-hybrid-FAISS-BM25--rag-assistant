Case insensitive string search

What is the quickest most efficient way to search text for words using non-casesensitive search. E.g here is my text to be searched : string textTosearch = "Here is a paragraph or Some text. Here is some more text". If I wanted to find the indexes of "Some" and "some", is there a .Net class that does this or would I need to use something like regular expressions. Your thoughts are much appreciated. I'm using visual studio 2008.
