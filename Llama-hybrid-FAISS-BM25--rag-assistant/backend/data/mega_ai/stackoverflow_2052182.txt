Using @"User_Agent" simply causes a custom header to appear in the GET request. User_agent: Foobar/1.0\r\n User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; U; CPU iPhone OS 3_1_2 like Mac OS X; en-us) AppleWebKit/528.18 (KHTML, like Gecko) Mobile/7D11\r\n The above is what appears in the dissected HTTP packet, essentially confirming what Sfjava was quoting from that forum. It's interesting to note that "User-Agent" gets turned into "User_agent."
