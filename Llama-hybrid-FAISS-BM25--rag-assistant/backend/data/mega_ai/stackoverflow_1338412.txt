Paging not working in asp.net gridview inside AJAX updatepanel

I have an asp.net gridview that is originally bound to a sqldatasource control, but when the user presses an external button, it instead gets the contents of a datatable rather than a SQLdatasource control. I therefore had to write code in the PageIndexChanging event of the gridview to allow for paging. My code is as follows: Protected Sub gvEvents_PageIndexChanging(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.Web.UI.WebControls.GridViewPageEventArgs) Handles gvEvents.PageIndexChanging gvEvents.PageIndex = e.NewPageIndex gvEvents.DataBind() This worked beautifully until I added an AJAX update panel so the whole page wouldn't postback every time it paged, and paging stopped working. I debugged it and discovered that it is actually calling the PageIndexChanging event, but nothing is happening. I searched the web and found a few people with the same problem, but their solutions did not work for me. There was one on this site whose problem was solved by the following: In PageIndexchanging event, where you bind data to grid, make sure, data is again fetched from the DB I don't know what that means; my data was being bound as demonstrated above. I have "enable paging" set to true and EnableSortingAndPagingCallbacks set to false. I would really appreciate if someone can help me. I am including my markup for the updatepanel below. Thank you so much! '> '> '>
