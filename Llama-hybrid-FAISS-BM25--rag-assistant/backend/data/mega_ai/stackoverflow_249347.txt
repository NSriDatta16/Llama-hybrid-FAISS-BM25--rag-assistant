How to disable array bounds checking in opensource Java?

Now that Java is open source, one of the first things I would like to do is to disable array bounds checking for certain blocks of code, where I'm dead sure I cannot go offbounds and where performance heavily matters. Now, I'm not a compilers/grammar expert, so any syntax would be good enough for me: Here's one that I can think of: pragma_disable_array_bounds_checking_begin for(x = xMin; x I understand that after this change, my local version will cease to be Java. But I care less since I can always bundle the recompiled VM along with my app. I don't know how to go about making this nontrivial change, hence the question. Note that I'm not interested in the JNI approach.
