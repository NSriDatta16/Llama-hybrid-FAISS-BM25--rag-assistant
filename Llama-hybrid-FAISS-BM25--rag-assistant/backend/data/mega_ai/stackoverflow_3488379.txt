I have the same problem it seems like we are drawing a lot of stuff. And if we have the ShowsPreview property set. The user can drag outside the grab-handle while it is trying to update the screen. But the user thread is supposed to be separate from the graphic rendering thread so I don't know. If the user selects the splitter and uses the up and down arrows on the keyboard it works fine also. Ah whilst writing this. I tried using larger values for dragincrement and that seems to work also. Better solution. This is with two gridsplitters in the same direction(three sections of screen) I don't know if that is also your setup.
