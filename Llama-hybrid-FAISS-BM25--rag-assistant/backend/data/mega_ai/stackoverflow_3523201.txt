How to databind a XML file with a treeview in C#

I want to be able to view a XML file in treeview, and the user can drag the node around in treeview, or delete some node, then the change should be automatically reflected in the XML file. To give an example of my purpose, think of the Favorites hierachy in IE: The XML file before modification: Google The treeview before modification: -Favorites --Google Websites ---Google The user dragged a node in the treeview, the treeview becomes: -Favorites --Google --Google Websites Then the XML file should be automatically modified to reflect the change in the treeview: Google Right now I am able to display the XML in treeview, can drag node around in treeview, but I don't know how to make the XML reflect the changes in the treeview. Anyone can give me some hint about how to do this in C#? Thanks in Advance. Vincent
