How late it is to not migrate to .Net 3.5 from .Net 2.0?

We have some applications that are being worked upon in .Net 2.0 since long back. I'm recommending my team to move the base from .net 2.0 to .net 3.5sp1 and focus and leverage from C# 3.0 but I'm facing difficulties in doing so. What are the implications of not migrating to .net 3.5 and C# 3.0 ? What are your experiences on this front and what tactics did you use to successfully migrate your team and projects to .net3.5.
