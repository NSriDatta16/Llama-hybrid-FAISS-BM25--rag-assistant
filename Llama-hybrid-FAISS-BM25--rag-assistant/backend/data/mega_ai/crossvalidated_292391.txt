Unless you describe your application in much more detail (what is the objective, what are the inputs, what are the output classes, how the study was designed, etc.)., it's hard to give you an answer. A possible issue may be that the modeling hypotheses of logistic regression are not satisfied: maybe the log-odds of class A, say, are not a linear function of predictors (features). Said in another way, logistic regression classifiers are linear classifiers (the classification boundary is an hyperplane). Instead, SVMs or neural network classifiers are non-linear: the classification boundary can be any manifold, it doesn't have to be an hyperplane. To have an idea of whether the classification boundary is linear or not, you may proceed this way: assuming you have features $X_1,\dots,X_p$, make scatterplots of $X_i$ vs $X_j$, colored by class (so, red dots are class A, and blue dots are class B, for example) 2D projections of an hyperplane are lines. Thus, in the scatterplots you should see that class A and B are approximately separated by a linear boundary. If this isn't the case, then you could consider using nonlinear classifiers.
