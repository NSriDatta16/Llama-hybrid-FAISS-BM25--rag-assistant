If the debugging print lines are not going to stay in the code after you've fixed your bug, then do whatever is easiest for you. Lambert's advice of using System.err.println() is a good idea since you can differentiate it from other output that your program may produce. If the debugging print lines are going to stay in your code, then I would advise on using a logging framework like log4j. This way you can dial up or down the level of output based on whether you're trying to debug something or just running in production. Be sure to output things at the right level when using log4j. Don't just log everything at INFO.
