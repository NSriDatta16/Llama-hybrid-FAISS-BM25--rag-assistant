This is the most low-level way of querying a database with ADO.NET. Open connection, send command, read out results. You should however use parametrized queries instead of String.Format, since that will open up your program to SQL injection. Just consider what would happen if UserName has a ' character in it. The following would be much better: string sql = @"Select mx.Id, mx.UserName, mx.firstname, mx.surname, mx.sectorCode, mx.deleteFlag, dn.sectorGroupCode, dn.region, dn.district From users mx Inner Join sector dn on dn.sectorCode = mx.sectorCode Where (mx.UserName = ?)"; var command = new OleDbCommand(sql); command.Parameters.AddWithValue(0, UserName); If you want a higher level interface, look into DataSets/DataAdapters . They aren't as fancy as LINQ, but they'll give you an easy fill/update, and work with any database adapter. If you're using Visual Studio, you even get a visual designer that can generate Typed Datasets in drag-and-drop fashion that'll give you strong-typed accessors for all your data. You might also want to look into the native MySql connector classes , instead of using ODBC.
