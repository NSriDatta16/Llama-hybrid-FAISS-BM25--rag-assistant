How do I interpret the results of this t-test?

I have two datasets, dataset A going from 1980 to 1990, and dataset B going from 1990 to 2000. I wanted to check if there is a significant difference between the two datasets so I ran a t-test. The result is not statistically significant (t-stat: -1.02), but I'm not sure on how to interpret that. From what I understand, the null hypothesis is that the difference between the averages is 0 (in this case the null hypothesis is that there is no difference between the two datasets) and if the result of the t-test is statistically significant we reject the null hypothesis (meaning that the two datasets are statistically different). Since in this case the t-stat is not statistically significant should I say that there is no statistically significant difference between the two datasets? I'm wondering if my writeup is correct. What I've currently written is: After running a t-test I find that the difference is not statistically significant (t-stat of -1.02) so the 1980 – 1990 performance is not statistically different from the 1990 – 2000 one.
