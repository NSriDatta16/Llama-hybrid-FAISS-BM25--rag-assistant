Similar problem for me. getElementsByTagName was failing on safari but not Firefox/Internet Exlporer. Turns out the namespace prefix was needed for Firefox/Internet Explorer and not for Safari so now, according to the agent... getElementsByTagName("iesr:Collection") // ff/ie getElementsByTagName("Collection") // safari
