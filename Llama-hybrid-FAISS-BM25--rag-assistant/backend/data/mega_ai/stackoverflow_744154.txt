Personally, I like to use integer data types in MySQL for date storage in the UNIX timestamp format. I leave all the processing of that integer up to PHP. Keeping tables and queries as simple as possible has always served me well. Predominantly, in the code I write, dates have some sort of calculation done to them. This is all done on the PHP side and always in the UNIX timestamp format. Storing or retrieving the dates in anything other than the UNIX timestamp format just means another step for errors to creep in and makes the query less modular. How a date is formatted is best left up until the last minute before it's displayed. It's just my opinion, but unless there are extreme circumstances where you can't process the DB value after extraction, a date shouldn't be formatted SQL-side. A simplified example: The report is due on . That is from now.
