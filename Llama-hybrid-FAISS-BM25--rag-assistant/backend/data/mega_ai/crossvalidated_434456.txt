What is the difference between first order difference and moving average?

I am doing a time-series classification problem where I recently came accross the concepts; moving average first order difference I know how to compute the aforementioned two types in time-series. However, what I am still not clear is the difference of these two outputs. What are similarities and differences of moving average and first order difference? I am happy to provide more details if needed.
