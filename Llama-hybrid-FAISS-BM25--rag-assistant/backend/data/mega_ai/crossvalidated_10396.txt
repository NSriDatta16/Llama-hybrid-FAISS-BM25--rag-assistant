Regression for dependent variable with 4 categories

I want to do a regression where my dependent variable has four categories (1,2,3,4) which represents the number of dependents. Can I do this with logistic regression? I read somewhere that link=glogit option is useful in this, can somebody please shed some light? I am new to this. Writing the syntax here would be very useful for me.
