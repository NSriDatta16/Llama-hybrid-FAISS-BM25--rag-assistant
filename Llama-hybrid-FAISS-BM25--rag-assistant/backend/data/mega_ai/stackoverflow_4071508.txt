I don't think something is necessarily wrong with your solution. IMHO if you think about stuff you've said from Aspect Oriented Programming 's point of view, it's just an aspect on your resources that will be handled by a class. Although if you think in large, your code base may evolved in hundreds of lines, so it would be better to break down your Infrastructure functions( Domain Driven Design Patterns). I think your class is a cohesive one and the manager name is not always a bad sign except that it consolidates the control flow of many possibly unrelated classes that collaborate with each other to accomplish a task. If your requirements about caching and mapping is prone to change maybe it would be better to Separate your Concerns. Rule of thumb when trying to write a well organized code is don't take it too serious at first, watch out code smells as you go forward and refactor or refactor to patterns when necessary.
