I have created a package that might give you some ideas. It's made to work with sklearn kind of estimators, so I don't think it's ready to be used with keras. But you can take a look, maybe you get some insight for your setting: https://github.com/JaimeArboleda/nestedcvtraining/blob/master/README.md My approach is to use a nested CV scheme, building ensembles of inner models (or fitting an only model) and estimating the quality on the outer loop. It's prepared to optimize the hyperparameters (and parameters of the post-process) by using the bayesian approach with the skopt library.
