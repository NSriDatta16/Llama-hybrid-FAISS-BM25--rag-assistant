The Highest Density Interval (HDI), a concept used in Bayesian Statistics, is the narrowest interval that contains XX% samples from a distribution. Using a 50% boundary should be maximally robust, having a 50% breakdown point. The only assumption behind it is that the distribution is unimodal, which may not be true for the general case.
