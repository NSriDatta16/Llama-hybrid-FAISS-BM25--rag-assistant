Using ASP.NET only? I'm not sure you can do this without some sort of browser plugin. I suspect that it might be advantageous to leverage the Flash Player to make the call. You'd still need a communication server to do the plumbing. Check out Red5 (Open Source), FlashMediaServer (Adobe's product), Wowza Media Server (cheaper than FMS).
