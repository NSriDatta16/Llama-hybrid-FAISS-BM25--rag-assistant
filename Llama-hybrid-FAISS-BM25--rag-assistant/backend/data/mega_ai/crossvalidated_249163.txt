If the observations for each individual are demeaned, then the only variation left is how much each individual deviates from their mean over time. Think about it this way. In the fixed effects model $y_{it} = x_{it}\beta + \alpha_i + u_{it}$, where $\alpha_i$ represents a dummy for each entity in the data, the dummies are all averages for each entity. These are partialled out, so only each $i$'s deviation from its average is used to estimate $\beta_i$. The demeaned model does the same thing. Subtracting the $i$'s mean from $i$'s observation centers it around 0. The only variation left is each $i$'s deviation from its own mean . If $i$ has no change over time, $x_i - \bar x = 0$, so does not contribute to the estimate of $\beta$. If $i$ has changes over time, this gets picked up in $\beta$. So only changes within $i$ get estimated.
