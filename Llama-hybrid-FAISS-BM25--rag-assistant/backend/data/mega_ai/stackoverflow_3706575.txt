I would recommend looking into User Controls . User Controls come with a designer, just like forms, and have a rich event model to tap into. Unlike forms, they are easy to embed into other controls and forms. As a matter of fact, user controls will show up in your toolbox to drag-and-drop onto another form. It's at least worth taking a look at.
