What you can do is turn each score into a standard score , where you normalize each score based on the mean and standard deviation of each judge. So, for example, if Judge1's scores have mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$, and Judge1 gives a score of $x$ to a given proposal, then the standard score for that individual is $$z=\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}$$ Once all of your individual scores are converted to standard scores, you can rank them by average score to determine the winner. I am not sure what you mean by "significance of the ranking".
