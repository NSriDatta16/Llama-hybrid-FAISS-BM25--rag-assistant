How does this solution relate to the actual real-life stats problem?

4.62 in Newbold (8 ed): A new warehouse is being designed and a decision concerning the number of loading docks is required. There are two models based on truckarrival assumptions for the use of this warehouse, given that loading a truck requires 1 hour. Using the first model, we assume that the warehouse could be serviced by one of the many thousands of independent truckers who arrive randomly to obtain a load for delivery. It is known that, on average, 1 of these trucks would arrive each hour. For the second model, assume that the company hires a fleet of 10 trucks that are assigned full time to shipments from this warehouse. Under that assumption the trucks would arrive randomly, but the probability of any truck arriving during a given hour is 0.1. Obtain the appropriate probability distribution for each of these assumptions and compare the results. The solution to this is that in the first case it's the Poisson cumulative distribution function with mean =1, while in the second model it's binomial with n=10 and p=0.1, similar but not quite identical. Great. What I don't understand is 1. What do the x/n numbers mean in this case; and 2. how does this help us make a decision about the number of loading docks? What I mean is that e.g. with the Poisson it's 0 - 0.367 1 - 0.735 2 - 0.919 . 8 - 1.000 So... does this mean that there is a 0.367 chance that zero trucks turn up, and 1.0 chance that 8 trucks turn up?! Even though on average it's 1 an hour?! And how would this help us decide how many loading docks we need? So, it's a classic problem: I can (kind of) do the maths, I just have no idea how any of it relates to real life...
