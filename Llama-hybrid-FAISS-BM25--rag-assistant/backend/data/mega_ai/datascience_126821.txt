What exactly is saved when I save a NN?

After we trained a Neural Network, we can save it in order to be able to predict without re-training. So when we use model.save('my_model.keras') what exactly is being saved? tensorflow tutorial says: Save a model's architecture, weights, and training configuration in a single model.keras zip archive. What exactly does it mean "model's architecture, weights, and training configuration". Is it a set of matrices? Or is there a better way to visualize it? For reference here is my model: model = Sequential() model.add(Masking(mask_value=0., input_shape=(X_train_scaled.shape[1],))) model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu')) model.add(Dense(42, activation='relu')) model.add(Dense(1, activation='linear')) # Linear activation for regression model.summary() model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_absolute_error')
