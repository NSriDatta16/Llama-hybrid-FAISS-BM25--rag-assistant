Estimating autocovariance from repeated time series

Consider a parent process $Z_t$ whose characteristics I wish to estimate. Consider two time series (or any stochastic process) realizations of this parent process $$X_1, X_2, \dots, X_T\,, $$ and $$Y_1, Y_2, \dots, Y_T\,. $$ That is, $Cov(X_1, X_{1+s}) = Cov(Y_1, Y_{1+s})$ in addition to them having the same stationary distribution. Then I would think that in order to estimate the lag- $s$ autocovariance, I can first define an overall mean $$\mu_{X,Y} = \dfrac{1}{2T} \sum_{t=1}^{T}X_t + \dfrac{1}{2T} \sum_{t=1}^{T} Y_t\,, $$ and measure deviation around $\mu_{X,Y}$ . That is, for a parent process $Z_t$ $$ \widehat{\text{Cov}}(Z_1, Z_{1+s}) = \dfrac{1}{2T}\sum_{j=1}^{n - s}(X_{1} - \mu_{X,Y})(X_{1 + j} - \mu_{X,Y}) + \dfrac{1}{2T}\sum_{j=1}^{n - s}(Y_{1} - \mu_{X,Y})(Y_{1 + j} - \mu_{X,Y})\,. $$ The alternative is that I average the individual lag- $s$ covariances $$ \widehat{\text{Cov}}(Z_1, Z_{1+s}) = \dfrac{1}{2T}\sum_{j=1}^{n - s}(X_{1} - \mu_{X})(X_{1 + j} - \mu_{X}) + \dfrac{1}{2T}\sum_{j=1}^{n - s}(Y_{1} - \mu_{Y})(Y_{1 + j} - \mu_{Y})\,. $$ Are there any references to know what are the properties of these two estimators, and which is known to be better? I would guess that the first one is better since I am using a better estimate of the mean to measure the deviation around.
