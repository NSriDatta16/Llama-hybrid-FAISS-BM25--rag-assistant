TCP fragmentation

I know that TCP provides stream-like data transmission, but the main question is - what situations can occur while sending data over TCP? 1. The message can be split to N chunks to fit in MTU size. 2. Two messages can be read in 1 recv call. Can there be the next situation? MTU for example 1500 bytes. Client calls send with 1498 bytes data. Client calls send with 100 bytes data. Server calls recv and receives 1500 bytes data. Server calls recv and receives 98 bytes data. So it end up with situation when 2 bytes from second client send will be received in first server recv. My protocol defined as foolows: 4 bytes - data length data content. I wonder can I came up with situation when 4 bytes (data length) will be split into 2 chunks?
