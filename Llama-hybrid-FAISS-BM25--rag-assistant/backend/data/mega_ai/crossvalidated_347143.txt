Space-Time Principal Component Analysis with Missing Lat/Long Data

Thank you for your help, I am looking to run a space-time Principal Component Analysis on Shotspotter data from Brockton, MA: http://justicetechlab.org/data/ . Shotspotter sensors record the timing, location, and number of gunshots. There are gaps in the data when no shots were detected. I would like to include the gaps in my PCA. At the temporal scale of a day, I have filled in the gaps and assigned a value of zero rounds to days when there were no gunshots detected (e.g. row six of the table below). I am confused about how to handle the missing lat/lon data for these zero shots-fired days. When there are no shots detected, there are no shots detected everywhere , so assigning a lat/lon seems strange. But I would like to include the zero shots detected data points. Statistically speaking, would the best solution be to? : 1. ignore the zero data completely 2. use the mean lat/lon for the observed data 3. randomly generate lat/lon data within the region of study and substitute these for missing lat/lon 4. use another statistical method well suited to my problem - any suggestions would be much appreciated I have found some papers on how to impute missing measurements, but have not found much explaining how to handle missing lat/lon data: http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/members/dray/files/articles/dray2015a.pdf https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7bf7/e383847e7d29134f95894b463de731fd4c1d.pdf Thanks again for your time and feedback
