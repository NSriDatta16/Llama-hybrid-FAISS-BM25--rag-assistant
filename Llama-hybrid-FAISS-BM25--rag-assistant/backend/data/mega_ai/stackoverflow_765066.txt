Standard Django way for letting users edit rich content

I have a Django website in which I want site administrators to be able to edit rich content. Suppose we're talking about an organizational info page, which might include some pictures, and some links, where the page is not as structured as a news page (which updates with news pieces every few days), but still needs the ability to be easily edited by site admins which do not necessarily want to mess with HTML (or rather, I do not want them to). So where do I put this dynamic content? On the database? In which format? How do I make it accesible in the django default admin?
