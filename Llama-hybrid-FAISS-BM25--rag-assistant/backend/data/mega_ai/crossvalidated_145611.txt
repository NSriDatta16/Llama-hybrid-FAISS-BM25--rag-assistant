With respect to 1, I think that adding uninformative features will impact the classifiers performance. The degree to which the performance is affected depends on the ratio of informative features/ amount training data (point 3 and 4 that you made) and noise in the training data.But generally the SVMs are often said to be robust to noise. I think, the second point may be true but can be checked by ensuring that the training and test data is chosen appropriately and the error is calculated well. This may not be a problem in SVM, but rather a general problem in all machine learning problems.
