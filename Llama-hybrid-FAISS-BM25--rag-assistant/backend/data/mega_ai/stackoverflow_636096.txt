The closest thing you have to something that does this is Unicode Paragraph Separator (U+2029). if you surround a body of text with paragraph separators then the renderer is not supposed to leave the first line or the last line of the paragraph on its own in a page. This behavior can be easily observed in MS-Word. If however the text of the block is four lines or more then you don't have a grantee that all four lines will be in the same page. they could split 2-2 between pages. The concept you're talking about is widely used in a smaller scale between words and lines. If you put an NBSP (No-Break Space, U+00A0) between words instead of a normal space then the renderer knows that the line should not be broken in this space. What you're actually looking for is a "No-Page-Break Line-Feed". Unfortunately Unicode does not have such a character. What you can try is to write the whole block of text using NBSPs instead of spaces. Eventually your only-NBSP text is going to get larger than a line and it will have to break somewhere. this is a certain end-case of Unicode which I'm not sure is really defined. Perhaps there's a chance that the line break which will be generated is such that does not break between pages. This is even a further end-case to the end-case. The only way to know what happens in this situation is to try.
