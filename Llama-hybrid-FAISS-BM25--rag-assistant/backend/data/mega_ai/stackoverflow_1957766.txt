CRC is a non-secure hash function designed to detect accidental changes to raw computer data, and is commonly used in digital networks and storage devices such as hard disk drives. A CRC-enabled device calculates a short, fixed-length binary sequence, known as the CRC code, for each block of data and sends or stores them both together. When a block is read or received the device repeats the calculation; if the new CRC code does not match the one calculated earlier, then the block contains a data error and the device may take corrective action such as requesting the block be sent again.
