AR Modelling. Box Cox and Differencing don't give Stationary Data

I am trying to fit an AR/ARIMA model on electricity data on hourly prices during a almost three year period, I am following the guidelines in Hyndman, R.J., & Athanasopoulos, G. (2018) to do this. This post is about understanding the histograms, ACF and PACF, and what the Differencing do to these graphs. My prices are clearly not Stationary with skewness = 4.22, kurtosis = 27.68 . (Graphs below). So, I am first applying a Box Cox transformation, since I have negative data, I add a small constant. # Add constant df1 = df.Price_REG1+2.1 # Apply Box Cox fitted_data, fitted_lambda = stats.boxcox(df1) # Convert to DataFrame (so I can plot) df1 = pd.DataFrame(fitted_data) This gives me a vastly improved distribution but the ACF plot still show these gradually decreasing correlations, the PACF doesn't change a lot either. So I am thinking, that maybe I should difference the Series. So I try, both a normal difference and a seasonal difference. df1diff = df1.diff() # Diff on 24 steps, one day, (there is daily seasonality). df1diff24 = df1.diff(24) What happens then is that the kurtosis gets very high (slightly better for the diff(24) but still high) and the ACF plots don't show anything. Which I guess is because the data is to far from a Gaussian distribution. If I difference again, the distribution only gets a slightly lower kurtosis. So, I am stuck here. Do I have to use another method, like dealing with seasonality with dummies or Moving Averages, or do I miss something in this approach. Because right now I don't see a way to move forward. The figures show the four different series with original (top-left), Box Cox (top-right), Box Cox Diff (bottom-left), Box Cox Diff 24 steps back (bottom-right).
