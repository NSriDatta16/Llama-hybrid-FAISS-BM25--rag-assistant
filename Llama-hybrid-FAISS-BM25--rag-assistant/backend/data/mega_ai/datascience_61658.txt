It depends on the algorithm you choose for your data set. Anomaly detection can be done using all three types of algorithms and which one you choose depends on the data set and domain. Supervised Approach - If your data set has a good distribution of samples for normal data and anomaly data, then you can do a supervised class of algorithms like CNN classifiers, etc. Semi-Supervised - If your data set has a good distribution of normal data but not anomalous data, then you can use semi-supervised data. In this approach, you train the model on normal data and get an anomaly score of how much actual data deviates from normal data. Example AnoGAN or DCNN based Image Completion, etc. Unsupervised - If your data set doesn't have a good distribution for both normal and anomalous data then you can consider clustering algorithms and look at those clusters which have few members.
