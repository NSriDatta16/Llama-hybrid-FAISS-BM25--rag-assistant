Getting Original Phone useragent with J2ME

Kinda new to J2ME. I was wondering how I could go about in getting a J2ME midlet to send the original user agent of the mobile device to a server instead of: "Profile/MIDP-1.0 Configuration/CLDC-1.0" ? The problem here is that I wont be able to kno the specific device the midlet runs on in order to manually set the useragent. This is because I'm developing a J2ME SDK that will be widely distributed for advertising purposes within other applications. It's like a plugin that fetches and display ads within an app. For example, if the midlet runs on a sonyericsson, how can i get the midlet to send the original phone useragent: "SonyEricssonW300i/R4EA Browser/NetFront/3.3 Profile/MIDP-2.0 Configuration/CLDC-1.1" to my server without actually using "setRequestProperty(" User-Agent", "SonyEricssonW300i/R4EA Browser/NetFront/3.3 Profile/MIDP-2.0 Configuration/CLDC-1.1")" ? I want to detect the true device using WURFL on the server-side. If the midlet sends "Profile/MIDP-1.0 Configuration/CLDC-1.0" as the useragent, WURFL will detect the phone as "Generic J2ME midlet" instead of SonyEricsson W300. I'd really appreciate it if someone assist.
