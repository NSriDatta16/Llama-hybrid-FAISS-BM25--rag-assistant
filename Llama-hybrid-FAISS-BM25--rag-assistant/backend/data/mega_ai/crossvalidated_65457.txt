A process which is integrated of order one, $I(1)$, is stationary after differencing once. A process which is integrated of order $d$, $I(d)$, is stationary after differencing $d$ times. There are tests for determining the integration order of a time series, like the Dickey-Fuller test or KPSS test. E.g. If you find from a test, that the process is not stationary, you may difference it and run the test on the differenced series to see if it's still non-stationary.
