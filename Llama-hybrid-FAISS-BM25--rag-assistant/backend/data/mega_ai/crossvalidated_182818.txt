You should always use the deflators from your training data (same goes for if you standard scale your data for Support Vectors or Neural Networks). As for learning the idf, sklearn's TfidfVectorizer learns the idf after fit or fit_transform method call and is available as an attribute of the classifier: clf = sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer() clf.fit(mydata) clf.idf_ # this is the idf data
