Would it be more useful to think of the changes in the time series as a beginning of a new trend rather than an anomaly? Taking the difference between adjacent points would help tell when the slope (derivative) is changing and might signal the beginning of a new trend in the date. Also taking the differences of the difference values (the second derivative ) might be of use. Doing a Google search on "times series beginning of trend) may give good suggestions for methods. In financial data a late of attention is paid to new trends (do you buy or sell?) so there's papers on this topic. A good intro to wavelet is "The world according to wavelets" by Hubbard I believe is the author.
