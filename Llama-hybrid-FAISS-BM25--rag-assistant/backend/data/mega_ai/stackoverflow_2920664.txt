It's difficult to know what you really want without more information on your structures. What should the return object be - the asset attribute or the time series? If it's the attribute then something like this should work //Finally build the needed collection select new {timeSeries.Key, assetAttribute}) .ToDictionary(t => t.Key, t => (object)t.assetAttribute); or if it's just the time series then //Finally build the needed collection select timeSeries).ToDictionary(t => t.Key, t => (object)t); I'm not a LINQ guru so there may be better ways to do this but these ought to compile at least. [edit] just spotted your function name: I guess you want the first one then.
