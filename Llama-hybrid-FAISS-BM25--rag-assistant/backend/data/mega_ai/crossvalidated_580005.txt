There are various Chi-square minimization methods described in the literature. All of them boil down to minimizing a sum (or average) of normalized squared residuals (or Chi-square distances). The normalization constant is usually the predicted value or an average of the predicted value and the observed value. Provided the data generating process satisfies some mild hypotheses (to be checked), all of these estimators are M-estimators , hence extremum estimators . Extremum estimators are asymptotically normal and their asymptotic covariance matrix is easy to compute (see, the popular Econometrics book by Fumio Hayashi). The asymptotic covariance can be used to compute standard errors.
