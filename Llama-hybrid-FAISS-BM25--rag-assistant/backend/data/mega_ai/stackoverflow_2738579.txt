One issue with ThreadPool would be that if the pool happens to be smaller than the number of Agents you would like to have, the ones you try to start later may never execute. Some tasks may never begin to execute, and you could starve everything else in your app domain that uses the thread pool as well. You're probably better off not going down that route.
