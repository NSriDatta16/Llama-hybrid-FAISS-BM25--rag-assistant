The answer is "Yes". If you both train and apply your model only on the samples with non-missing $x$, then it is totally OK . Your single heroic assumption here is that the process that makes $x$ be missing is the same for the training and test data, which is quite reasonable. If you want to train and apply your model on any data (both with and without missing values), there is a preprocessing scheme with wich popular families of models (linear, neural network, decision trees and their ensembles) can work adequately. You impute missing $x$ with any value you want (e.g. 0), and at the same time you create a binary marker of missingnes for each column with potential missing values. For example, the table x1 x2 0 1 2 nan 3 1 nan 0 nan nan turns into x1 x2 x1m x2m 0 1 0 0 2 0 0 1 3 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 In this case e.g. a linear model would find values for coefficients to x1m and x2m which give the best prediction, even if the values are missing not-at-random.
