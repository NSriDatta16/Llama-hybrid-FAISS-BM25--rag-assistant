In case you have labeled data (previous complaints labeled by humans), you can implement a standard binary text classification model. A rather simple approach would be to encode the text e.g. as TFIDF or "one hot" and run a simple classification task to learn of some text belongs to label "referred" or "not referred" (which would be 0, 1 encoded). Alternatively, you can employ more sophisticated methods, e.g. by using neural nets . Keras for instance provides a number of useful examples . You can also look into BERT (as mentionned by you per tag). You can also check self supervised learning if you only have few labeled training observations. In case you do not have labels, you can also "cluster" the text by topics using topic modeling , using Latent Dirichlet Allocation . This usually works quite well to separate topics and might be worth a try.
