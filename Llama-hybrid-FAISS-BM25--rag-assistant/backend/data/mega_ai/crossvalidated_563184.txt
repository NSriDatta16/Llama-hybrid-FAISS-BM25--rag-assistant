Why do we need to multiply linear equation with class in the SVM?

At 2:29 in the video there is an equation; $$ y_i (w^T x_i - b) \ge 1 $$ Could anyone please explain why do we need to multiply the class which is $y_i$ with the linear equation $w^T x_i - b$ ? N.B: I attached the video URL at 2:29 so that answerers could see the video where I got stuck.
