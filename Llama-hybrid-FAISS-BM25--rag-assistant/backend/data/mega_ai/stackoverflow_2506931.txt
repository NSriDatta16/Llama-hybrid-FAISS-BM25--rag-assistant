No, ViewData is not intended to be used that way. It is only a temporary shared storage between a controller action and a view. It allows the controller to pass some model to the view. From design perspective ViewData should not be read by the controller action, it should only be written to. You could use the Session object if you want to store objects between multiple requests or TempData (which internally uses Session) to store data between two requests.
