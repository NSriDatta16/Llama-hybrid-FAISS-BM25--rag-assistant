I have recently been working on a number of similar packages in SSIS and the only way that I have been able to get around this is to have a holding table similar Remou's suggestion. This table is extremely generic, where all fields are NULL able and VARCHAR(255) . I then have a validation Stored Procedure that checks things such as typing, the existance of data etc before I move the data into a "live" situation. Although it may not be the most elegant of solutions, it gives you alot of control of the way you check the data and also means that you shouldn't have to worry about converting the file(s) to .CSV first.
