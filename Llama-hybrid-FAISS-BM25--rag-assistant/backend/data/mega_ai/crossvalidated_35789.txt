Bayes factors with improper priors

I have a question regarding model comparison using Bayes factors. In many cases, statisticians are interested on using a Bayesian approach with improper priors (for example some Jeffreys priors and reference priors). My question is, in those cases where the posterior distribution of the model parameters is well-defined, is it valid to compare models using Bayes factors under the use of improper priors? As a simple example consider comparing a Normal model vs. a Logistic model with Jeffreys priors.
