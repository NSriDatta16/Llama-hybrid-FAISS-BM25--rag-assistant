New style for a new GWT component

I am using SmartGWT 2.4, and I have two types of TabSet(s), each one has a different look and feel, and I am facing a problem implementing that. The new TabSet has been implemented as the following : public class MainTabSet extends TabSet{ public MainTabSet(){ super.setStylePrimaryName("MainTabSet"); build(); } private void build(){ setMargin(6); setWidth100(); setHeight100(); setStyleName("nt-main-tabset"); Tab inboxTab = new Tab("Inbox"); inboxTab.setPane(new InboxPane().get()); } } based on the last paragraph (Multiple looks for the same component type) here : I've defined a new class that holds the same primary name I used above : isc.defineClass("MainTabSet", "TabSet"); and then I've added some properties to it : isc.MainTabSet.addProperties({ tabBarThickness:100, scrollerButtonSize:100, pickerButtonSize:100, symmetricScroller:false, symmetricPickerButton:false, scrollerSrc:"nothing", pickerButtonSrc:"nothingg", closeTabIconSize:100 }) The code above has been written at the top of section 6 (TabSet) in load_skin.js file. Now, I am still getting the same old TabSet look and feel in MainTabSet. my Questions now are : did I follow the right steps to achieve my goal ? how could I consider new classes to some sub elements of TabSet -like TabBar- but only for the new component (MainTabSet)? Thank you guys.
