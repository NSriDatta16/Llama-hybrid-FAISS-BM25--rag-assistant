Nonparametric estimation of standard error on large samples

The bootstrap seems to be the gold standard for attaching a standard error to a point estimate on a sample. However, if the sample size is very large, it can be prohibitively expensive to repeat the point estimate for >50 times, as required by the bootstrap technique. Is there a cheaper alternative, potentially leveraging the fact that the sample is very large?
