You can do it by attaching a mousedown handler before the .draggable() call, like this: $(".draggable").mousedown(function(event) { $(this).draggable('option', { helper : event.ctrlKey ? 'clone' : 'original'}); }).draggable({ revert: "invalid" }); You can see it in action here , since the widget also works on mousedown , we just want to attach an event handler before the widget's handler, since event handlers run in the order bound , so all we're doing is setting the helper option just before the drag starts.
