Do you mean you are seeing a round trip for each insert to go get a new high value for the ID? If so are you using a new instance of the SessionFactory on each operation? The SessionFactory is responsible for managing the retrieval of the high value. Typically you should only have one SessionFactory per application instance (via singleton or IoC container).
