What is a small and fast real time compression technique, like lz77?

What is the minimum source length (in bytes) for LZ77? Can anyone suggest a small and fast real time compression technique (preferable with c source). I need it to store compressed text and fast retrieval for excerpt generation in my search engine. thanks for all the response, im using D language for this project so it's kinda hard to port LZO to D codes. so im going with either LZ77 or Predictor. thanks again :)
