Having testing accounts in production is something I usually frown upon because it opens up a potential security hole. One should strive to duplicate as much of the production environment in testing as possible but there are obviously cases where that isn't possible. Expensive production only hardware is a prime example. I would say as a general practice it should be discouraged but as with all things if you can provide a reason which makes sense to you then you might overlook a hard and fast rule.
