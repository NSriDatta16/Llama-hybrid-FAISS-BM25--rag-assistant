SQLite does not distinguish booleans from ints. So you can just use bind_int. The only real storage classes are NULL, INTEGER, REAL, TEXT, and BLOB. Note: "But as soon as INTEGER values are read off of disk and into memory for processing, they are converted to the most general datatype (8-byte signed integer)."
