Once inside the Template you're sort of isolated from other elements (with good reason - it can be reused elsewhere). In this case (assuming the template is used somewhere under "MainGrid") it looks like you can use a RelativeSource FindAncestor Binding to locate the parent Grid (you'll need to make sure to count the Grids in the VisualTree to get the right AncestorLevel - in just the code here it would be 2). The Path would be ColumnDefinitions[1].Width. Keep in mind that this depends on you maintaining the structure of the elements where you are using the template so it is a bit fragile. There is also an alternate method using SharedSizeGroup that can connect Grid Rows or Columns at different levels but that works only with Auto and fixed pixel sizes. This Binding method works with fixed and * sizes. Entire Binding: Width="{Binding RelativeSource={RelativeSource Mode=FindAncestor, AncestorType={x:Type Grid}, AncestorLevel=2}, Path=ColumnDefinitions[1].Width}"
