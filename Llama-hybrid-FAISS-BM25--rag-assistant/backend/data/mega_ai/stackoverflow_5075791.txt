Is there a small and clean jQuery-like library that focuses only on HTML5?

jQuery can do some nice things for you. It also frees you from having to take care for different browsers. The tradeoffs are the size and readability jQuery's own code. Is there a similar library that purely relies on the new HTML5 APIs like draggable , querySelector , postMessage , etc. ? It should support jQuery's basic stuff, such as querying, basic animation, drag&drop, xhr, etc. Thx, Juve [Edit] 9muses proposed zepto.js , which might be a good starting point.
