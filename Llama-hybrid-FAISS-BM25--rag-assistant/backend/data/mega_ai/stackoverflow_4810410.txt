Photoshop JSX -- Using Split Method on Array, why does one not work and the other work?

I have this code which generates an array of information on where the guidelines are set in any Photoshop document. var guides = app.activeDocument.guides;// get the current doc's guides var guideArray = []; for (var g = 0; g And the prompt gives this output: Direction.VERTICAL,47 px,Direction.VERTICAL,240 px,Direction.VERTICAL,182 px,Direction.VERTICAL,351 px,Direction.VERTICAL,119 px,Direction.VERTICAL,21 px,Direction.HORIZONTAL,89 px,Direction.HORIZONTAL,199 px,Direction.HORIZONTAL,54 px,Direction.HORIZONTAL,171 px I want to split this array with by adding this code var b = []; for (var i = 0; i which gives me this error, exceptionMessage([Error:ReferenceError: guideArray[i].split is not a function]) Why? Ignoring purpose of what I'm doing (already figured it out in a more elegant manner), I am curious to know why this is failing. I'm really curious because I tried this and it works, var guides = app.activeDocument.guides;// get the current doc's guides var guideArray = []; for (var g = 0; g And this works, even though I am doing seemingly the same thing with split in the for loop as above.
