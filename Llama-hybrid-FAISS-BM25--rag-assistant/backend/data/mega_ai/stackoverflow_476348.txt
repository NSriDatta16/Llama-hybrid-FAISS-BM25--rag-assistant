That A-Ha Moment for Understanding OO Design in C#

I've been studying C# for a couple of years, reading voraciously, even taking a few C# data access courses from Microsoft. I've also been reading books on OOP. I'm coding a web-based database application at work. While my job title is not "programmer", I'm fortunate enough to be able to work on this as a side project. I coded in Basic in the early 80's and was even good at utilizing pokes and peeks to manipulate the Apple ][ + and the TRS-80 to astound and amaze my friends. But that was a very linear approach to coding. All this being said, something is just not clicking with me. I haven't had that a-ha moment with either C# or OOP that gives me the ability to sit down, open up VS2008, and start coding. I have to study other people's code so much that it simply seems like I'm not doing anything on my own. I'm getting discouraged. It's not like I'm not capable of it. I picked up t-sql really quickly. Someone can tell me what information they want out of the database and I can code out the tsql in a matter of a few minutes to give them what they want. SQL is something that I get. This isn't happening for me with OOP or C#. Granted, C# is inherently more complex, but at some point it has to click. Right? I read over stackoverflow and I'm overwhelmed at how infinitely smart you all are. What was it for you that made it click? Edited to add: A lot of the answers here were outstanding. However, one in particular seemed to have risen to the top and that's the one I marked as the "answer". I also hate not marking my questions with the answer.
