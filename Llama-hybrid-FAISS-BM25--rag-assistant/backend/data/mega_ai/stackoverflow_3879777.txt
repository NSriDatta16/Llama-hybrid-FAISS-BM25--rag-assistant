Visual C# Express with DryadLINQ?

Can we use Visual C# Express (instead of Visual Studio) with DryadLINQ? We know that Visual C# Express 2010 supports LINQ. But I am not sure if DryadLINQ would also be supported, because Dryad might require PLINQ features also. If anybody can shed light, I would be grateful. Procuring a license for Visual Studio is a tedious process in my organization, and If DryadLINQ can be worked on with Visual C# Express, I can start my work immediately.
