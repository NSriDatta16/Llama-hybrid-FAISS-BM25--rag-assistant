Network clustering stability using bootstrapping techniques

I use the standard modularity-maximisation Louvain clustering method to partition a large undirected network into communities. I fear the result of the partition is quite fragile. Is there a standard bootstrapping methodology to get a sense of the precision of my estimate in R for an igraph objects? Resources I found that are partial solutions: Bootstrapping networks with R and igraph Bootstrap Evaluation of Clusters GitHub/Skynet GitHub/Snowboot Package ‘DIscBIO’ Package ‘bootnet’
