I don't think that it makes that much difference as to which method you use . The only way I could find out would be to measure ultimate model accuracy to determine a winner. What does matter is what you do after you have successfully formed your data matrix. Regression models (without ARIMA structure i.e. appropriate lag structures on all the series) requires among other things independent residuals. If you don't condition your model for auto-regressive time effects your results could be problematical. See http://autobox.com/dave/regvsbox.pdf (which I authored) discusses issues/differences/opportunities/pitfalls when dealing with time series that your possible regression solutions may be ignoring.
