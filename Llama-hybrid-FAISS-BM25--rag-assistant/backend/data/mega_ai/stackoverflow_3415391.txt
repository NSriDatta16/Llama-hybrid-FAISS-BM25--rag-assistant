Boost::Signals encapsulation over network

I am currently involved in the development of a software using distributed computing to detect different events. The current approach is : a dozen of threads are running simultaneously on different (physical) computers. Each event is assigned a number ; and every thread broadcasts its detected events to the other and filters the relevant events from the incoming stream. I feel very bad about that, because it looks awful, is hard to maintain and could lead to performance issues when the system will be upgraded. So I am looking for a flexible and elegant way to handle this IPC, and I think Boost::Signals seems a good candidate ; but I never used it, and I would like to know whether it is possible to provide encapsulation for network communication.
