An MA model has MA characteristic polynomial $(1 − 1.4x + 0.3x^2 )(1 + 0.5x^{12})$, obtain the model

When the characteristic polynomial of a moving average s model is given as $(1 − 1.4x + 0.3x^2 )(1 + 0.5x^{12})$ , how to obtain the MA model and then calculate the ACF of this model? I am expecting an explanation of how to solve this type of problem.
