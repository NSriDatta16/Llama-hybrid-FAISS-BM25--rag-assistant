Differencing a time series

I am looking to find the ACF of a time series, but after it is differenced. $y_t = a_1y_{t-1} + \epsilon_t , \mid a_1 \mid I understand that to find the ACF this process needs to be stationary, but I am struggling to difference the equation due to the constant $a_1$ Any help would be greatly appreciated.
