Paragraphs within the comments are throwing off the line count. Starting at line 137... /** This constructor created a new Category instance and sets its name. It is intended to be used by sub-classes only. You should not create categories directly. @param name The name of the category. */ ...the two empty lines are shifting the line count off by two. So line 146 is being reported as line 144, etc. Not sure why, however. If you change the comment to the following: /** This constructor created a new Category instance and sets its name. It is intended to be used by sub-classes only. You should not create categories directly. @param name The name of the category. */ ...the line numbers after the comment will report correctly.
