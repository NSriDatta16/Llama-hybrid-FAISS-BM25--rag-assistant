When y= 1, logit is infinity. How can you regress that? Yet somehow, that's logistic regression

Logistic regression essentially means taking the logit of your response proportions, p, and then doing standard regression. Consider the case where one p is 1. logit(1) = log(1/(1-1)) = infinity. How can you do regression with infinity? That is, if one of your observed proportions p is 1, then you are trying to find the line that minimises the sum of squared differences from a set of points that include infinity. How does this not drive the regression line to always have infinite slope?
