Is there an AI function that can provide the definition of a word or phase with reasonably good accuracy?

I would like to make use of a software function which can provide the definition of a word or phrase. These words and phrases are in the realm of common knowledge - objects like "DVD player", or specific places like "Canary Islands". I am pretty sure GPT-3 can do this because it's trained on the internet in general and Wikipedia, and it produces generally fluent language. However, I was curious if someone has already written this function and provided it in some software library somewhere already.
