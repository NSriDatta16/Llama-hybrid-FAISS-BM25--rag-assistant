What is the actual infection rate (per 100,000) of Covid-19 in my area (I'm in the UK)?

I think I'm misunderstanding some basic data given by the UK Government. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51768274 On the above page, about three fifths of the way down, there is a table entitled, "Infection rates by local authority: Number of cases per 100,000 over seven days". And the average across all areas is close to 7. So that means that the number of cases of Covid-19 in the UK is 7 (new?) per 100,000 , right? Whereas here and here it basically says the rate is in the hundreds: maybe 200 - 500 ish per 100,000 depending on area. If my maths is correct, 7 is nowhere near 350. But my understanding of the data is probably off. So what am I not understanding about this data?
