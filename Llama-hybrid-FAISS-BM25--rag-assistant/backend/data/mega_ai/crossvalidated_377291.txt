R logistic regression throwing error

I have data with 6 predictor variables and a response variable ( default ). When I do a logistic regression using probit estimation , I get a result different from SAS. ( the link to my data https://drive.google.com/open?id=1TZvEsOpuzLQ_BvGBR26n5M-yzlp2yUWH ) equation But R is giving the following error: glm.fit: fitted probabilities numerically 0 or 1 occurred Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -5.13523 1.55705 -3.298 0.000974 *** dlagR3 0.04719 0.03696 1.277 0.201711 loglaginf6 -0.39395 0.05637 -6.989 2.76e-12 *** dloglagImp6 0.13151 0.02981 4.412 1.02e-05 *** loglagRR9 6.78246 0.09228 73.497 But when I use SAS or Eviews , this error is not thrown and they both agree on the coefficients. So I tried implementing a lot of supposed solutions as given in a lot of forums but no matter what I do, R is giving the same coefficients. The results given by Eviews and SAS is the accurate one. Note: SAS gives the probability of 0 (not 1) so I have created a new response variable default2 which is opposite of default proc logistic data=data; model default2 = dlagR3 loglaginf6 dloglagImp6 loglagRR9 dlagFX6 laglogRGDP6 /link=probit; run;
