Simple way to categorize: terrible, poor, average, good, excellent

I have a data frame with the following: > summary(d5$points) Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. -4.200 0.000 1.000 2.579 5.000 23.400 > sd(d5$points) [1] 3.736616 What's a simple, but statistically sound way to categorize this data into terrible , poor , average , good , excellent . I'm using R. Edit: Higher is points is better. Negative points is terrible . A good game would be a player scoring 6+ points, but that's just from my observations. As requested, are are the histograms. All Players Top 100 Players (based on their avg points)
