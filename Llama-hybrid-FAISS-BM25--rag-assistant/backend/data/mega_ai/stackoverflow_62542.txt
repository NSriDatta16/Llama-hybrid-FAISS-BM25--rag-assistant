What is the best free test tracking software?

I'm not talking about bug tracking software (like Bugzilla or Jira). I'm looking for something that: Stores test specifications in text format Combines test specs into test coverage scenarios Keeps track of the progress through testing scenarios Links test specs with bug reports stored in Bugzilla Generates progress reports Is centrally managed on its own (i.e. is not a hack/extension on top of something else)
