Based on the comments, first of all try to decide whether there is a reason to suspect an autoregressive generative process. You could do this, for example, by looking at correlation between outputs at varying delays. If you are modeling some kind of physical system you can use information about the structure. Since you mention it's a black-box I assume you have no such information. If there is a reason to assume some kind of autoregressive process, I would focus on fitting an AR model. From a fitted model you can typically get confidence intervals on predictions which you can then use to assess whether a certain output falls within expectations. In case you get a terrible fit, (i) maybe there really is no underlying autoregressive process or (ii) you may need to use a nonlinear technique like SVM to adequately model the process.
