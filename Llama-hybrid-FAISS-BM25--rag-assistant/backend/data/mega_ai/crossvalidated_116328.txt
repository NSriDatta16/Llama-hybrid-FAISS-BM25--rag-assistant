This is more of a statistics question than a specific programming one. If you have your heart set on using neural nets an example using feature selection with Garson's algorithm is here . Below I have provided the code that you can try. Hopefully this can give you something to start with. But please note this is only one possible answer. There are many other approaches people have taken as this is an active area of research (neural networks are complex!). There are very likely other methods that may be more suitable, more efficient, etc. You may not want to even use neural nets (I don't know your specific reasons). Depending on your data it may be better to use some alternative feature selection up front before the neural net. A simple google scholar search for 'neural network feature selection' will return several papers on the matter. There are many very strong opinions on the subject of neural networks so be warned there is no definitive answer out there. # code from link noted above (slightly updated) require(clusterGeneration) require(nnet) #define number of variables and observations set.seed(2) num.vars Here is the output plot. You can see there are both positive and negative values. The negative and positive values reflect negative and positive relationships between the variable and the response variable.
