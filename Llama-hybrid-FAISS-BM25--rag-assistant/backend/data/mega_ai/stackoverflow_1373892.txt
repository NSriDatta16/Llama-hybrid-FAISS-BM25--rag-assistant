Here's my experiences of the two technologies, probably doesn't answer your question directly but I thought I'd share it anyway: I've recently ported an ADF application over to MVC. I found MVC easier to work with in general. ADF's declarative databinding and Faces page flow configuration is elegant, but I found it awkward to use at times. Conversely, I get the impression it would be easier to break rules and good practice within Microsoft's framework, but that's probably just me being ill-disciplined! I was using Toplink with ADF which I migrated over to NHibernate fairly easily. Regarding drag and drop in JDeveloper, I never really found myself using it. The rendering engine didn't seem fine-tuned enough to give an accurate representation of the final page and I found it generally clunky, so I stuck with the XML in the editor. I'm still getting to grips with MVC, but hope this info is helpful anyway.
