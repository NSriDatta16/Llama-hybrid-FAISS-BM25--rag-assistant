I can't say I fully understand exactly what you are trying to do. If you are dealing with the problem of how a "child" Control of a UserControl placed on a Form at Design-Time can be made to function as a container onto which you can drag-and-drop other controls from the Toolbox : this CodeProject article by Henry Minute may be helpful : Designing Nested Controls . For example : you have a UserControl with a Panel inside it : an instance of the UserControl is placed on a Form : in the Design-time view of the Form : you want to be able to drag-drop controls onto the Panel in the UserControl and have them become child controls of the Panel : Henry's article will show you how to do that. This from Microsoft : How to make a UserControl object acts as a control container design-time by using Visual C# Perhaps might also be useful, although it seems like you already have this step accomplished.
