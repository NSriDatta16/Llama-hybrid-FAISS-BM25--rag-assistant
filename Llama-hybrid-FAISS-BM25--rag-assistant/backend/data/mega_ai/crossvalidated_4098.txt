The audio application is a one-dimensional simplification of the two-dimensional image classification problem. A phoneme (for example) is the audio analog of an image feature such as an edge or a circle. In either case such features have an essential locality: they are characterized by values within a relatively small neighborhood of an image location or moment of speech. Convolutions are a controlled, regular form of weighted averaging of values within local neighborhoods. From this originates the hope that a convolutional form of a DBN can be successful at identifying and discriminating features that are meaningful.
