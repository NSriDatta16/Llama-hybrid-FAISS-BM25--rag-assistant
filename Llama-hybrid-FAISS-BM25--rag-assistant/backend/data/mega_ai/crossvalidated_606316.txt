Stepwise binary logistic regression, Forward or Backward?

I want to run a binary logistic regression to understanding (modeling) factors affecting nest-site selection in a bird species. I have Presence/Absence data and 13 predictors. The sample size is small. 32 Presence points and 64 Absence points. I want to run a stepwise binary logistic regression in R manually. I have 2 questions about it. Which method can be better? Forward or Backward? Which statistic is more important for removing or adding variables at each step? AIC or p-value of ANOVA (Wald test) ?
