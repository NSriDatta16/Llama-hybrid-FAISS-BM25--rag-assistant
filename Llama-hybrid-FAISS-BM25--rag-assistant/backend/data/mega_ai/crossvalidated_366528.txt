The theory about Type I errors states that at $\alpha=0.05$, on average , you can expect about 5 % of hypotheses to be false positives, but since this is an average it could also happen for ex., that you have 0 % false positives or 10 % false positives or any another number (which is unknown). If, as in your example, all your p-values are greater than 0.5 then you can definitely claim that you have no false positives. In the example where all the p-values are less than 0.5 then you can expect about 5 % of them to be false positives (on average). Sample size does affect this measure, the bigger the sample the better this estimate approaches $\alpha$ (less variability around its predefined value).
