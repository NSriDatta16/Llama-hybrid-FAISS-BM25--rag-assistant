http://robjhyndman.com/researchtips/crossvalidation/ contains a quick tip for cross validation of time series. Regarding using random forest for time series data....not sure although it seems like an odd choice given that the model is fitted using bootstrap samples. There are classic time series methods of course (e.g. ARIMA) that can be used, as can ML techniques like Neural Nets (example example pdf ). Perhaps some of the time series experts can comment on how well ML techniques work compared to time series specific algorithms.
