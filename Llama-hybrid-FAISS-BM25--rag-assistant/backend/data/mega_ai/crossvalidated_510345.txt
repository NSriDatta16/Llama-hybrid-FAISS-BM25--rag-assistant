If the pattern of the innovations explains perfectly the movement of the whole time series (also extent of movements) then you failed to capture anything. Why? Because for a good fit, the remaining innovation in the residuals should be as small as possible and further, it should definitely not be essential to describe the data. In general, you predict by leaving the innovations out and just use your estimated coefficients and the regressors (in TS-context lags). Try that and compare it to the data.
