In a Dashcode project I'm working on right now I have a datasource that includes a URL to the product on Amazon.com. I haven't done this from the list view, but from my detail view I created a link to the Amazon page for the currently displayed product. On the detail layout the URL field is transformed to be: "Click here to purchase the product on Amazon.com." And the word here is a standard html link. I used a Value Transformer to do this. In my data source the URL field contains a fully qualified URL to the product on Amazon.com. So where you see "value" in the code below Dashcode is replacing that with a URL in the HTML code that is then included in the page. myBuildAmazon = Class.create(DC.ValueTransformer,{ transformedValue: function(value){ // Insert Code Here value="Click here to purchase the product on Amazon.com."; return value; } }); One important thing is that when you bind the datasource to the field select HTML from the popup menu that comes up rather than Text. I hope this helps.
