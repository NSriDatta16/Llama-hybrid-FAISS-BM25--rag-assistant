regexp target last main li in list

I need to target the starting tag of the last top level LI in a list that may or may-not contain sublists in various positions - without using CSS or Javascript. Is there a simple/elegant regexp that can help with this? I'm no guru w/ them, but it appears the need for greedy/non-greedy selectors when I'm selecting all the middle text (.*) / (.+) changes as nested lists are added and moved around in the list - and this is throwing me off. $pattern = '/^( .*) (.+ )$/'; $replacement = '$1 $3'; Perhaps there is an easier approach?? converting to XML to target the LI and then convert back? ie: Single Element TARGET Multiple Elements foo TARGET Nested Lists before end foo bar TARGET Nested List at end foo TARGET bar
