When should we use the principles of tidy data by Hadley Whickham, and when should we avoid using it?

I have been studying and data science for the past 6 months, however I just came across the principles of tidy data by Hadley Wickham in an article by Jean-Nicholas Hould . This completely changed my perspective of how I work with data. Not only should I clean the data, but the data should also be formatted correctly. Seems pretty obvious when you think about it, but that is besides the point. I decided to start applying those principles into my data cleaning workflow, however, I was wondering whether there are times where having tidy data would not be ideal? When would we not want to "tidy our data"? Ideally when should we use Tidy Data and when should we avoid it? Your input to this would be highly appreciated.
