Perhaps when setting the maximum lag to $k$, all models are estimated on a sample where $k$ initial observations are not considered (but they are used when lags of the original time series are formed), even though it is technically possible to estimate models with non-maximum $k$ on samples longer than that. (Recall that you need the exact same sample to be able to compare AIC values.) So the underlying data set gets truncated to a different degree for different maximum $k$, and thus the estimates and the test statistics change even if the selected model remains the same.
