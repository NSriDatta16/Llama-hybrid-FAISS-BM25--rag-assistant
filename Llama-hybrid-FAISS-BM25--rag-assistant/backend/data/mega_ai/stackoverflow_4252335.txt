What is the best method for taking a string url and encoding it

I feel like I must have missed the right thread, because this seems like it would have been clearly answered before, so sorry if it's a repeat. I read a lot of the threads here and elsewhere and I didn't see a clear "This is how you do it" kind of answer to this question... The program will be receiving full urls as strings. For example: "http://www.stackoverflow.com/questions/somepage?somequery#somefragment" I want to take this string and ensure it is properly encoded for use in a connection like with HttpClient. From what I read, it seems like the way to do this is to use a URI() constructor with the various parts as parameters. So that then begs the question, what is the most reliable way to take a string url, that we know nothing about, other than it is a url, and break it up into the various pieces needed for the URI() constructor. Here is what I pieced together. Are there any flaws in this method? URL url = new URL(urlString); URI uri = new URI(url.getProtocol(), url.getAuthority(), url.getPath(), url.getQuery(), null); Then, the uri variable contains a encoded ready to use URI. This code works so far, but I want to make sure there aren't any pitfalls that might occur. Thanks
