I know of one good use for this: you have to do this to declare a COM interface that's derived from another COM interface. It is touched upon in this magazine article . Fwiw, the author completely misidentifies the source of the problem, it has nothing to do with an 'inheritance tax'. COM simply leverages the way a typical C++ compiler implements multiple inheritance. There's one v-table for each base class, just what COM needs. The CLR doesn't do this, it doesn't support MI and there's only ever one v-table. Interface methods are merged into the v-table of the base class.
