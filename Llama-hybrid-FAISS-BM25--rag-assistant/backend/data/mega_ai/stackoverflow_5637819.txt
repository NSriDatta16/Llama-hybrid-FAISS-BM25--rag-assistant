C++: Cloud computing library: is there such a library where I don't need to write much network stuff?

I want my server app to be able to send data to be processed by a bunch of various clients, and then have the processed data returned to the server. Ideally, I'd have some call like some_process = send_to_client_for_calculating(connection, data) I just need to be able to send a bunch of data to a client, tell the client what to do (preferably in the same message, which can be done with an array [command, data]), and then return the data... I'm breaking up pieces of a neural network (tis very large), and then assembling them all later. If I need to be clearer, let me know how.
