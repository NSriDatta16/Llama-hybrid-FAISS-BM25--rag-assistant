An option that looks fancy is to use vim in batch mode to generate a bunch of colorized HTML files and then print by dragging all of them to the printer (I know that can be done, some time ago a colleague printed the whole J2SE API, and I hope she didn't it page by page xD). find -name "*.java" -exec vim '+set nu' +TOhtml +wq +q '{}' \;
