multinomial model with some certain parameters

I might be asking a naive questions here, sorry. Imaging I have 4 categories, each one has a probability of $\theta_i$ being selelcted, $i=1..4$ and sum of $\theta_i$ is 1. For this simple multinomial model I can use a 4-dimensional Dirichlet distribution to capture the 4 unkown parameters $\theta_i$, then after observing data, I can Bayesian inference $\theta_i$ simply via conjugacy. Everything is good so far. But what if I know, say $\theta_1=0.1,\theta_2=0.2$ for certain and $\theta_3, \theta_4$ are the only two parameters that I am not sure. How can I Bayesian inference those two in this case, since a 2-dimentional Dirichlet prior seems cannot be used... what other parameteric family of multivaraite distribution can fit in my case. Thanks, hope the quesiton is making sense..
