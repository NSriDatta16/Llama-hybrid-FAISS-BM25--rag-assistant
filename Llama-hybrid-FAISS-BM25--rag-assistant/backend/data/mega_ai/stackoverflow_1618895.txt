Organize small utilities functions

After years of programming, we all have a set of small functions used as helpers utilities that we wish it comes build-in so we can use it in any project and have ti taken care by more people (test and optimized). I have quite a collection of these functions. I wonder how do you guys organize them? Do you have any tips? This is how I do it. I put it in a separate project (an eclipse project) let say "MyUtils" and it referred to by other projects. This works but because the utils collection are getting bigger and bigger something it is kind of weird that the utils are bigger than the project code (for small projects). And to ship it in Jar, you have to select them all by hand (or include them all). Is there a better way? Also, as Java requires all functions to be in a class so I have ton of static functions (those that does not fit in OOP) for example a function read text file from a file name. Like this: package nawaman.myutil; public class UText { static public String ReadTextFile(String pFileName) { ... } static public String[] ReadLines_fromFile(String pFileName) { ... } static public String ReadLine_fromFile(String pFileName, int pLineNumber) { ... } ... } So when I need to include all the functions goes when though it is not used. Is there a better way to do this? I use eclipse on Linux anyway if there is special technique for it but fell free to share if you have techniques with other tools.
