Estimating the decay parameter in Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) model

Given the data $y_t$ , $t=1, \cdots ,N$ ; I would like to estimate the decay parameter $\lambda$ in Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) model, such that $y_{t+1} = \sum_{k=0}^K \lambda^k y_{t - k} + e_t $ , where $K . I am wondering, is there any common way and solver for this nonlinear least squares problem? Is it possible to make this problem more "friendly" by changing of the variables?
