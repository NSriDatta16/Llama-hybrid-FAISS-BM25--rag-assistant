In this Quora question, an IBM researcher answers that the statistical modeling done by Watson is mostly logistic regression, although this is built into a very complex hierarchy. They also state that the statistical modeling is not necessarily the most challenging part of Watson. I have also independently heard the same thing reported by another Watson researcher.
