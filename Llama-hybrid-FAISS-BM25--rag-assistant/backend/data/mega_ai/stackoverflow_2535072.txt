Accessing C++ Functions From Text storage

I'm wondering if anyone knows how to accomplish the following: Let's say I have a bunch of data stored in SQL, lets say one of the fields could be called funcName, function name would contain data similar to "myFunction" What I'm wondering is, is there a way I can than in turn extract the function name and actually call that function? There's a few ways I can think of to accomplish this, one is changing funcName to funcId and linking up with an array or similar, but I'm looking for something a bit more dynamic that would allow me to add the data on fly without having to update the actual source code every time I add a call to a new function assuming of course that the function already exists and is accessible via scope location we call it from. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
