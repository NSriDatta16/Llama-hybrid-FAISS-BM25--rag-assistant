Use cases are meant to show how someone uses a system to get something of value. Actors always represent persons, in the sense of an independent being who has goals and is capable of seeking something of value. Actors are represented in one of several ways, either directly by name, or by inclusion through a role, or by proxy in the form of an agent acting on behalf of a person or role (the "system" actor). Regardless of the form, the actor is always independent, and always capable of "acting" upon the system to achieve its own ends. The diagram you have here is NOT a use case diagram. "Modules" are not independent, goal-seeking entities, they appear to be simply components of some system. They are not capable of "seeking" anything, they are just implementation details. The diagram you are probably looking for is the Deployment diagram (if you want to model how specific components are wired together), the Activity diagram (if you want to model application logic), or the Class diagram (if you want to model the formal relationships between components).
