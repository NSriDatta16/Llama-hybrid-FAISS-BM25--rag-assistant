FastReports allows you to intercept the program's default report construction process with events at several useful places. If you have, for example a master band, in its OnBeforePrint event, you can put code that checks out the type of product and then a case statement could set the visible property to true only on detail bands that are the right kind of property. I have found the news group at news://newsgroups.fast-report.com/fast-reports.public.fastreport.4 to be an incredible source of help and encouragement. I am sure you can find a much better answer to your question there.
