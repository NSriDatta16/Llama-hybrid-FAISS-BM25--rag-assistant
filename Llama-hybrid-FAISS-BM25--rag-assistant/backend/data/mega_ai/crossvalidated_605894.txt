With what argument can I use splines method in a binary logistic regression analysis?

I want to run a binary logistic regression and I guess some variables have nonlinearities. So I want to use splines method to understand affect of each range in a continuous variable. When I 'guess' that nonlinearities it will enough to using splines method or I should run a 'test' on variables?
