reporting results of a multivariate logistic regression using the glm function in R

I would like to use the glm() function in R to run a multivariate logistic regression. I have also run bi-variate statistics for each variable but want a test that controls for all variables at once (what I understand the glm function in R does - let me know if I should use a different function). My problem is that I don't know what to report in an academic paper and can't find anything online. There are clear guidelines for reporting other tests (example: t (34.17) = 2.22, p = 0.033) but I don't know what to report for the glm. Here is the output of my glm: Call: glm(formula = EPI ~ premed + kg + sim + bup + premed.min + ami.type + breed, family = "binomial", data = df) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -0.7316 -0.2980 -0.2351 -0.1573 2.9108 Coefficients: Estimate Std.

I have found out how to get confidence intervals and odds ratios in R if I need those: > exp(cbind(OR = coef(LM), confint(LM))) Waiting for profiling to be done...

EDIT: EPI is a binary variable that is assigned 0 or 1
