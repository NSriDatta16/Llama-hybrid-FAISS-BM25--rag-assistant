If you want to keep your investment in the controller_action_predispatch events and stay in the Magento framework for your code, you could do a couple of things. Add the URL param into the cache key. That way the FPC will serve the different versions of the page that the param can trigger while still giving the benefit of caching. Refer to this blog post for an example of creating your own PageCache container and overriding the cache key. Exclude those controllers from FPC. Obviously this is only valid if the controllers affected are a subset of the overall site, otherwise you won't get any caching benefit. Cheers, JD
