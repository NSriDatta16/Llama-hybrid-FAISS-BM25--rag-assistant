VB6 program hangs (slows) Windows 7 64-bits but not in 32-bits. Any solution?

We have a program coded in VB6 running well on Windows7 32-bit with a Dual core, at any time. Now we are trying on Windows7 64-bit (dual core), and our surprise is that it's not working so fine: In long process, long loops, the system becomes saturated (hangs with 50% processor use) and it's impossible to change to another program (for example: ALT+TAB doesn't work or works very slowly), like 5-10 years ago, when our computers had only one processor or core. Any idea? Any limitation? Any bottleneck with 64-bit SO and VB6 runtime? Old-fashion and not elegant solution at this time : I can fix this with Doevents (We've tried it, and it works) disabling and enabling all the controls, but it's full of enabled/disabled controls and it's hard to manage this and return the correct state Thanks in advance. Update Info : If we are running 2 applications based on 32 bits mode (it notes in taskmanager like *32), when one of them hangs the Windows7, the ALT+TAB works fine between 32 bits applications and GUI works fine. But if we change to an application using 64 bits, the GUI doesn't reponse.
