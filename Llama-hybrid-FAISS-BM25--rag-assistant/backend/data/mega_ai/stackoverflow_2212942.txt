IMHO, There is a BuiltIn Control designed for Login called as LoginView . It integrates into your Master page or any other page and could provide full use of the authentication system. Here is the code for it Asp.Net provides a complete framework for authentication and authorization of an application. I would recommend having a look at if you are about to implement one for your application and you have not reviewed it as option already. Security Framework For Asp.Net EDIT: If you want a button to be place over master page, Drag and Drop the button like we do for a normal Web-form and Implement following event: protected void Button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { Response.Redirect("MyApplication/SomePage.aspx"); } Hope it Helps
