I don't think you can do this. See the following counter example. Assume the GDP at the beginning of 2009 was $100$. If it grew 1.5% every month, it would have been equal to $100\cdot1.015^{12} = 119.56$ at the end of 2009. However, since it grew 1.5% over the whole year the actual value at the end of 2009 was $101.5$. In order to get the correct average monthly compounding growth rate, you need a different approach. Let $r$ be the average monthly compounding growth rate, $GDP_B$ the GDP at the beginning of 2009 and $GDP_E$ the GDP at the end of 2009. Then, the following holds: $GDP_E = GDP_B \cdot (1+r)^{12} $. So you need to rearrange this in order to get the correct $r$: $GDP_E = GDP_B \cdot (1+r)^{12} \\ GDP_E/GDP_B = (1+r)^{12} \\ r = (GDP_E/GDP_B)^{(1/12)} - 1$ This means you get $r = (101.5/100)^{(1/12)} - 1 = 0.00124148771$.
