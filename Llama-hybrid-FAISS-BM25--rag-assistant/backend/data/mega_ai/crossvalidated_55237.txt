Good books/papers on credit scoring

I'm looking for recomendations of books on credit scoring. I'm interested in all aspects of this problem, but mostly in: 1) Good features. How to build them? Which have been proved to be good? 2) Neural networks. Their application to credit scoring problem. 3) I've chosen neural networks, but I'm interested in other methods as well.
