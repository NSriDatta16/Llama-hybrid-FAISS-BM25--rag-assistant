Will you be doing anything beyond just showing dates in this database, e.g. bookings? Because that would strongly point towards going even further than the bit-wise solution: Having one record per departure date . Storage space questions should be irrelevant unless you have trillions of tours, which is unlikely. But it would become very easy to query dates, build totally irregular intervals, and cancel select dates within a range. The hard part with this is editing. When creating a new tour, you would have to create the date records according to the specified interval. If the interval changes later, you'd have to roll back creation.
