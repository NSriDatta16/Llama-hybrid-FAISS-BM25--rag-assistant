Distributions with undefined parameters

I am studying the Bayesian Lasso and noticed something interesting on Page 682 at the bottom of the second column here Some background: a hierarchical setup for data $X, y$, regression coefficients, $\beta_i$, variance $\sigma^2$ and additional parameters $\tau^2_i$ is setup leading to an intractable posterior. The goal is to implement a Gibbs sampler to sample from the posterior, and thus this requires full conditionals. The full conditional for each $\tau^2_i$ is $$ \dfrac{1}{\tau^2_i} \mid (\beta, \sigma^2, y) \sim \text{Inverse Gaussian} \left(\sqrt{\dfrac{\lambda^2 \sigma^2}{\beta_i^2}}, \lambda^2 \right) $$ where $\lambda^2$ is a fixed quantity $ > 0$. The support of $\sigma^2$ and $\tau^2_i$ is $\mathbb{R}^+$, but the support of $\beta_i$ is $\mathbb{R}$. Thus, $\beta_i$ could be 0, leading to an undefined first argument in the Inverse Gaussian. My question is: How is this not a problem?
