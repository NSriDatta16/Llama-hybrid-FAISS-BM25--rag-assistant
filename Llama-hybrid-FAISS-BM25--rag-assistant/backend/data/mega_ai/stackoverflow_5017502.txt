Maybe you could subclass QSlider and override sliderChange(SliderChange change) and not invoce the superclass method as long as the slider is still being dragged? That is assuming that this is the correct method that will eventually emit the signals that update the guy around. Haven't tested it, but thats generally a pattern that works in QT (for instance one can subclass the reject slot of QDialgo to abort dialogs).
