This is impossible to answer accurately without knowing more details of your study and the person's criticism. But here's one possibility: if you've run multiple tests, and you choose to focus on the one that came out at p and ignore others, then that "significance" has been diluted by the fact of your selective attention to it. As an intuition pump for this, remember that p=0.05 means "this result would happen by chance (only) 5% of the time even if the null hypothesis is true". So the more tests you run, the more likely it is that at least one of them will be a "significant" result just by chanceâ€”even if there's no effect there.
