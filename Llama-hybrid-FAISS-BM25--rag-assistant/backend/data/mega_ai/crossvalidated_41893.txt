Reliable factors

Briefly, my study ($n=188$) consists of using PCA on a 111-item questionnaire claiming to have 21 different disorders (factors). I did a MAP test (Velicer's Minimum Average Partial test) to decide on the number of factors to extract (it said 16), followed by PCA with varimax rotation. Using .4 as minimum loading. The tenth and eleventh components of the rotated component matrix have only 3 items (.698, .616, .542 and .572, .568, .483). Are these components reliable?
