Missing value handling in cforest in R

I'm trying to build a random forest with 100k records and 2K variables. I have an imputation process to handle missing values while using randomForest but I want to understand what exactly happens to missing values in predictors in cforest . I looked at a tree and there were no specific actions for missing values. The code says na.action = NULL . Is there any imputation going on internally in cforest or it can handle NA s as separate entity? Also is it advisable to use cforest instead of randomForest to deal with missing values?
