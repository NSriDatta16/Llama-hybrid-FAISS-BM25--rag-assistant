I like HardCode's schema, but it might be a closer match to the situation being modeled to store a location instead of a status (in any case I'd discourage the use of the word "status" which is so generic as to be meangingless). Location is really what is being tracked here, and could even be used to indicate who is the current holder of the item when it is checked out. I think that physical condition ought to be held separately, if it is to be tracked at all. That would allow finer grades of condition based on tool user feedback or staff observation. (Responding to comment 2) I'd expect that you'd have a table to record the individual movements of tools (from location A to location B at a certain time by person Z) and another to record a higher level summary or current location. Much would depend on whether tools were individually identified by serial number for example, in which case you'd track them individually, or whether they were just one of a number of the same tool, not identified individually. This would determine whether you'd record 5 transactions (one for each tool) or 1 transaction of 5 tools. You might just summarise as "5 tools checked out" or you might state "these individual tools are currently at these locations".
