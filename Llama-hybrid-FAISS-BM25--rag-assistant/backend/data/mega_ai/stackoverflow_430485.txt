IE CSS bug: table border showing div with visibility: hidden, position: absolute

The issue I have a on a page which is initially hidden with a visibility: hidden; position: absolute . The issue is that if a hidden this way contains a table which uses border-collapse: collapse and has a border set on it cells, that border still shows "through" the hidden on IE. Try this for yourself by running the code below on IE6 or IE7. You should get a white page, but instead you will see: alt text http://img.skitch.com/20090110-enuxpb5aduqceush46dyuf4wk7.png Possible workaround Since this is happening on IE and not on other browsers, I assume that this is an IE bug. One workaround is to add the following code which will override the border: .hide table tr td { border: none; } I am wondering: Is this a known IE bug? Is there a more elegant solution/workaround? The code /* Style for tables */ .table tr td { border: 1px solid gray; } .table { border-collapse: collapse; } /* Class used to hide a section */ .hide { visibility: hidden; position: absolute; } Gaga
