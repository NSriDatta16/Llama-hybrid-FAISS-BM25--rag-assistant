How to improve the performance of an object detector model?

I have few questions regarding improving the performance of my object detection model. When there is color match between person uniform and the background, it becomes difficult for my model to distinguish person from background and detect it. How to overcome this? I'm using faster rcnn with resnet backbone. The data is taken from a factory, where uniform of the workers is matching with the background color of that factory In multi-class detection one specific class is not properly being detected, precision value for that class is very low. What can be the reasons behind this and how to overcome the issue?
