Your intuition is correct: such an example is impossible. To see why not, consider both $M_1$ and $M_2$ as collections of $p$-vectors. Because the predicted value of any vector in a logistic regression is a linear function, perfect prediction means there exists a codimension-$1$ affine hyperspace that separates all the points in $M_1$ from those in $M_2$. That implies their centroids cannot coincide, QED . In this figure $p=2$ and the groups have sizes $30$ (red circles) and $10$ (blue triangles). Their centroids are shown as corresponding filled graphics. Perfect separation occurs, as shown by the gray dotted line. Since the centroids must lie on opposite sides of this line, they cannot coincide.
