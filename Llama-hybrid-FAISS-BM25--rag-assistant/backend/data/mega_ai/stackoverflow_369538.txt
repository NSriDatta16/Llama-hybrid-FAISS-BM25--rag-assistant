Source Control for an Academic Research Group?

In contrast to most software development organizations, our little research group within a university department consists of a professor and a flow of grad and undergrad students, it's hard to retain any working knowledge beyond the research itself. Our backgrounds vary, and rarely involves much computer science background. (i have not myself ever taken a computer-related class.) Yet we need to work on our homebrew software for planning and analysis, with distinction between the best current production version and development versions, protection against ill-conceived changes, ability to recall last year's version, etc. It'll be hard to get each student up to speed on subversion and learn to be careful about the repository, understanding branches/tags or however we organize it. (secondary question: how to get someone up to speed on svn?) Perhaps one of the distributed version control systems would be better suited, or a centralized system other than svn would be wise, or if not, are there easily propagated practices with subversion we should follow?
