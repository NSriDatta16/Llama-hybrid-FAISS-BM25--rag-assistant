Once i started leveraging dependency injection, my classes became smaller and more specialized which allowed me to write simple unit tests to confirm they worked. Given the limited number of tests i knew my class had to pass to work, the goal of my TDD effort became more clear. It was also easier to identify which classes required integration tests due to dependencies on external resources and which classed required unit tests that injected mock/stub/fake objects into the SUT to narrow the focus of my test.
