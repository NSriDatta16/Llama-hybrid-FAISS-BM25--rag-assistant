How to calculate Odds ratio and 95% confidence interval for logistic regression for the following data?

I have the following data from a Research paper: S1 : n = 30 / Rest : n = 66 SH 11 / 8 For this to calculate p-value I have done it like following: library(MASS) x = matrix(c(19,11,58,8), nrow=2, byrow=T) D = factor(c("S1","SH"), levels=c("S1","SH")) m = glm(x~D, family=binomial) summary(m) Call: glm(formula = x ~ D, family = binomial) Deviance Residuals: [1] 0 0 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 0.5465 0.3789 1.443 0.14914 DSH 1.4345 0.5346 2.683 0.00729 ** --- Signif. codes: 0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1 (Dispersion parameter for binomial family taken to be 1) Null deviance: 7.3387e+00 on 1 degrees of freedom Residual deviance: -8.8818e-16 on 0 degrees of freedom AIC: 11.607 Number of Fisher Scoring iterations: 3 The p-value is 0.007. This is same as I saw in the research paper. And the Odds Ratio is given as 4.20 and 95% CI is (1.47-11.97) I would like to know how to calculate Odds Ratio and 95% Confidence interval for this? Can anyone please tell me how can I calculate this in R? Are there any functions?
