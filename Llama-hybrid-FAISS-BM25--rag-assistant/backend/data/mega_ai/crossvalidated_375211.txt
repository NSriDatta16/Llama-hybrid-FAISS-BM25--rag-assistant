Look at the model summary: > m Linear mixed model fit by REML ['lmerMod'] Formula: dep ~ f1 * f2 + (1 | sub) Data: data REML criterion at convergence: 371.7578 Random effects: Groups Name Std.Dev. sub (Intercept) 1.222 Residual 4.768 Number of obs: 64, groups: sub, 8 Fixed Effects: (Intercept) f1Male f2day2 f1Male:f2day2 3.9375 3.1250 0.1250 0.0625 This gives estimates of the subject SD (1.222) and the error SD (4.768). This is a balanced experiment, and each mean consists of 16 observations. However, there are only 8 different subject effects. The random component of each cell mean includes the average of all 8 subject effects, and the average of 16 of the residual effects. So its SD is estimated as: > sqrt(1.222^2 / 8 + 4.768^2 / 16) [1] 1.267882 This is the same (except for slight error due to roundoff) as the SE displayed in the emmeans results: > emmeans(m, ~ f1*f2) f1 f2 emmean SE df lower.CL upper.CL Female day1 3.9375 1.267923 40.78 1.376463 6.498537 Male day1 7.0625 1.267923 40.78 4.501463 9.623537 Female day2 4.0625 1.267923 40.78 1.501463 6.623537 Male day2 7.2500 1.267923 40.78 4.688963 9.81103
