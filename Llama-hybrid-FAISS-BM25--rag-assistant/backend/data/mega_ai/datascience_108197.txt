Normalize new data and old model

I'm playing with machine learning and LSTM. My goal is to learn something new and work with real data. Currently, I'm trying to predict bitcoin price. I have understood the necessity to normalize data, but there is something that I don't get. When I use a scaler like MinMax (or any other scaler as I understand it), I give my train, validation and test sets to the scaler and I get a range of value easiest for tensorflow to work on. After that, I can train my model and save it for later with model.save . For this example, let's say that I trained my model on the 2021 (2021-01-01 to 2021-12-31) data for bitcoin price and the minimum price was \$20_000 and maximum was \$50_000. Now it's 2022 and I got new data and I want to use my model saved last year for predicting the future! Let's say that minimum price here is \$15_000 and maximum \$55_000. If I load my old model and add my new data (and normalize them) to it, the scaler need to be updated. How can I do that? I only find some basic tutorials with "finish dataset" or temperature prediction but not how to feed my model with new data. I hope you understand my problem and that you will guide me to a solution. I can share my code if you want more information on my workflow. Regards.
