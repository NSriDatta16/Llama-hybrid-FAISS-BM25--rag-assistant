Accessing scratch pad memory from C

That might be a little bit an exotic problem, but I hope somebody can still help me out a bit ;). I would like to execute a standard C program, however, at some point during program execution I would like that a certain number of instructions, which are stored in a local scratch pad RAM, are executed. The scratchpad memory is accessable for all processes. Lets assume this local memory starts at address 0x80000000 and I would integrate this in the following C code fragement int main { int a=1; int b=2; int c=3; c = a + b; %goto address 0x80000000 and execute three instructions before continuing %program execution here return(0); } The program counter would go through the following stages, assuming main is loaded at 0x40000000 0x40000000 a=5; 0x40000004 b=2; 0x40000008 c=1; 0x4000000C c=a+b; 0x80000000 first instruction in the local scratch pad 0x80000004 second instruction in the local scratch pad 0x80000008 third instruction in the local scratch pad 0x40000010 return(0); Anyone an idea how to do this? Do I need to use assembler jump instructions or is there something more elegant. Many thanks, Andi
