I think you chose the wrong direction. It's true that the Trial docs is very light. But Trial is base on unittest and only add some stuff to deal with the reactor loop and the asynchronous calls (it's not easy to write tests that deal with deffers). All your tests that are not including deffer/asynchronous call will be exactly like normal unittest. The Trial command is a test runner (a bit like nose), so you don't have to write test suites for your tests. You will save time with it. On top of that, the Trial command can output profiling and coverage information. Just do Trial -h for more info. But in any way the first thing you should ask yourself is which kind of tests do you need the most, unit tests, integration tests or system tests (black-box). It's possible to do all with Trial but it's not necessary allways the best fit.
