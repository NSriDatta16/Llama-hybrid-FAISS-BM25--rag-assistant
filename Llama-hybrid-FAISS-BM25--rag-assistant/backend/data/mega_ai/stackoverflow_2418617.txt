HTML Email Template as NSString

I am adding functionality to my app that will allow it to email some rather detailed information. I would like to send this as an HTML-formatted email so that I can take advantage of HTML and CSS styling. The approach I'd like to take is to design the template with placeholders for the fields to be filled in, load the template into an NSString, then use string replacement to change out the placeholders with the actual data. Rather than having one huuuuuuge line such as: NSString *emailTemplate = [NSString stringWithFormat:@" TITLE Here is the information about the thing that you are interested in. Find more from the table below: . . ."] I'd like to do this in a more elegant way. Should I write the template into a file then load it? What's the best way to do this? Also, how could I do this in a localize-able way? Thanks!
