Comparison of distribution mean or median

I am working with very noisy biological data for which I will compare two experimental settings. For each setting I will get a set of measure with a huge variance, sometimes with a skewed distribution, but sometimes not (after log transformation). If I want to statistically compare my two experimental settings should I compare the means, with the appropriate statistical test (e.g. t-test) or should I compare the medians (typically with bootstrapping although I know some statistical tests exist)? I am well aware of why the median is a better description of the average of a skewed distribution, also it better describes a distribution where you do not have good estimates of extreme values. I have read several other thread about "mean vs median" (e.g. Is median fairer than mean? ) However my question is specific to comparing two noisy datasets, like in biology, you can assume that some extremes values are incorrect measurements, hence the median could be more robust. In general, data are unpaired, and it is actually beyond our current understanding of the process whether outliers are meaningful or not (very noisy measurements but the data itself is also very variable). However comparing the median seems a very naive approach specifically in the case when you could get a normal distribution. What is the best approach for such comparisons ? Are there any scientific papers I can refer to? Edit: Following comments I will try to make this question less vague. If have a to compare two distributions of unpaired data, that represents noisy data, but for which you can not tell whether outliers are meaningful or not. This happens a lot in biology where some processes are largely unkown and very variable between individuals. Let's say that after a log transformation your points are kind of normally distributed. 1) How do you go about deciding which is the best test to compare the two experimental setups between mean or median? 2) What is the best approach concerning these possible true outliers but could also be biological noise? Discarding them typically means increasing the power to see a difference between the two distribution, but isn't that some form p-hacking? 3) Isn't using the median instead of the mean the same as discarding the outliers? 4) Putting 3 and 4 together, how can you justify using the median for such comparisons as not doing p-hacking?
