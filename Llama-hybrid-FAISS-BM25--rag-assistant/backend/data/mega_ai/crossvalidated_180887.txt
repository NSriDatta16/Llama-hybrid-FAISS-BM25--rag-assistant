You are indeed correct that the value before the @ indicates the amount of filters, and not the amount of feature maps (although for the first convolutional layers these values coincide). Regarding your last question: yes it does make sense to have every feature map at layer l connected to every filter at layer l+1. The sole reason for this is that this greatly increases the expression power of the network, as it has more ways (paths) to combine the feature maps which thus allow it to better distinguish whatever is on the input image. At last I don't know if you are practicing your neural network skills by implementing them yourself, but if you just want to apply convolutional networks to a specific task then there are already several excellent neural network libraries such as Theano, Brainstorm, Caffe
