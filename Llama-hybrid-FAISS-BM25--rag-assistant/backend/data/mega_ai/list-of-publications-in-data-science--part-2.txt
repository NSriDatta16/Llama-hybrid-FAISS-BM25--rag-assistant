The Composable Data Management System Manifesto Author: Pedro Pedreira, Orri Erling, Konstantinos Karanasos, Scott Schneider, Wes McKinney, Satya R Valluri, Mohamed Zait, Jacques Nadeau Publication data: Online version: Description: The vision paper advocating for a paradigm shift in how data management systems are designed using standard, composable, interoperable tools rather than siloed software tools. Importance: A paradigm shifting view on how future data science software tools should be designed for more efficient workflows, the principles of which "will be especially crucial for addressing fragmentation, improving interoperability, and promoting user-centricity as data ecosystems grow increasingly complex". Data collection and organization Tidy Data Author: Hadley Wickham Publication data: Online version: Description: Describes a framework for data cleaning that is summarized in the quote, "each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table". This allows a standard data structure for which data analysis tools can be consistently built around. Importance: Cited over 1,500 times, this effort for tidy data has been described by David Donoho as having "more impact on today’s practice of data analysis than many highly regarded theoretical statistics articles". In the context of data visualization, this publication is said to support "efficient exploration and prototyping because variables can be assigned different roles in the plot without modifying anything about the original dataset". Data Organization in Spreadsheets Author: Karl W. Broman and Kara H. Woo Publication data: Online version: Description: This article offers practical recommendations for organizing data in spreadsheets, like Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets, to reduce errors and lower the barrier for later analyses due to limitations in spreadsheets or quirks in the software. Importance: Influences teaching both data and non-data practitioners to create more analysis-friendly spreadsheets, and has been described to outline "spreadsheet best practices". Data visualizations Quantitative Graphics in Statistics: A Brief History Author: James R. Beniger and Dorothy L. Robyn Publication data: Online version: Description: Outlines history and evolution of quantitative graphics in statistics, going through spatial organization (17th and 18th centuries), discrete comparison (18th and 19th centuries), continuous distribution (19th century), and multivariate distribution and correlation (late 19th and 20th centuries). Importance: Helps put into perspective for learning data practitioners the recency of graphics that are used. A later publication "Graphical Methods in Statistics" by Stephen Fienberg in 1979 writes that his publication "owes much to the work of Beniger and Robyn". Tooling Hidden Technical Debt in Machine Learning Systems Author: D. Sculley, Gary Holy, Daniel Golovin, Eugene Davydov, Todd Phillips, Dietmar Ebner, Vinay Chaudhary, Michael Young, Jean-François Crespo, Dan Dennison Publication data: Online version: Description: This paper argues that it is "dangerous to think of [complex machine learning] quick wins as coming for free" and overviews risk factors to account for when implementing a machine learning system. Importance: All authors worked for Google, article is cited over 1,000 times, and helped practitioners thinking about quickly implementing a machine learning tool without understanding the long-term maintenance of the tool. A few useful things to know about machine learning Author: Pedro Domingos Publication data: Online version: Description: The purpose of this paper is to distill inaccessible "folk knowledge" to effectively implement machine learning projects because "machine learning projects take much longer than necessary or wind up producing less-than-ideal results". Importance: Cited over 4,000 times to influence the common set of knowledge for data practitioners us
