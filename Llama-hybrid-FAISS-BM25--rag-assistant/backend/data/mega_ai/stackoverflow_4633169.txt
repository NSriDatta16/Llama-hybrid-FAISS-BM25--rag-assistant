Sometimes the user-agent also contains characters, e.g.: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:2.0b9pre) Gecko/20101228 Firefox/4.0b9pre Internet Explorer is the only other browser where I've seen the characters as part of the version information: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0b; Windows NT 6.0 ; .NET CLR 2.0.50215; SL Commerce Client v1.0; Tablet PC 2.0 Also, there can be Firefox user-agent strings with only two version digits like this one: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux armv7l; en-US; rv:1.9.2a1pre) Gecko/20091127 Firefox/3.5 Maemo Browser 1.5.6 RX-51 N900 Based on that I came up with this regex pattern: Firefox\/([\d]+\.[\w]?\.?[\w]+) It will match any version number with 2-3 levels and numbers > 10 but also allow characters in the 2nd or 3rd level.
