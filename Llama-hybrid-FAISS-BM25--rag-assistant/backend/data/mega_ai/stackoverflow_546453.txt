Secondary indexes would indeed be useful for many potential applications of HBase, and I believe the developers are in fact looking at it.

In the mean time though, if your application data storage can be modelled as a star schema (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_schema ) you might like to checkout the solution that Hypertable proposes for secondary index-type needs http://markmail.org/message/rphm4q6cbar2ycgp
