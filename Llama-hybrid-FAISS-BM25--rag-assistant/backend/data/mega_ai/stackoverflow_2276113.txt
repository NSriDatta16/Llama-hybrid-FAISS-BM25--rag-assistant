The Last-Modified header is indeed not set by some web servers, and there is nothing you can do about it. For those cases you'd need to grab the HTML and make a hash of the data. If the hash matches on a next retrieval, it has (very very likely) not changed. In case there is a constantly changing part of the HTML you could parse the HTML tree and remove the typically changing parts of them, like Google Ads. But this starts being a whole lot more effort than merely checking the header, depends on what is your actual use case to see if it's worth your effort. A good tool to use for this last endeavour is the HTML Agility Pack Yet another approach that might yield better results would be to measure the distance between two versions of a page and mark as updated those above a certain threshold. Again, this will fail (and will now give false positives) on many cases. Just throwing this here in case it inspires you for something useful.
