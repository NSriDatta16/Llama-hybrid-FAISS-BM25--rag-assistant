I believe you are attempting document classification, which is a well-researched topic. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_classification You will see a considerable list of many different methods. But to suggest any one of those (or neural networks or the like) prior to determining the "trends" as you call them is to suggest it prematurely. I would recommend looking into "web document classification" or the like. It is evidently a considerable subset of document classification, and if you have access to academic journals there are plenty of incomprehensible articles for your enjoyment. I did also find your idea as a homework assignment -- perhaps if you are particularly audacious you could contact the professor. http://uhaweb.hartford.edu/compsci/ccli/wdc.htm Lastly, I believe that this is an accessible (if strangely formatted) website that has a general and perhaps outdated discussion: http://www.webology.ir/2008/v5n1/a52.html I'm afraid I don't have much personal knowledge of the topic, so the most I could do was tell you the keyword "document classification" and provide some quick googling. However, if I wanted to play around with this concept, I think simply looking for the rate of certain keywords is a decent starting "trend." ("Sale" or "purchase" or "customers" are trends for shopping sites, "my," "opinion," "comment," for blogs, and so on)
