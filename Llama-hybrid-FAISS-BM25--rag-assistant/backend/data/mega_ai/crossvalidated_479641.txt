Comparison of fit from OLS, GLS, GLM, ARIMA and DLM

I've been comparing the fit of OLS, GLS, GLM, ARIMA and DLM modelling approaches to my 20 observation time series data set. I had originally done so using RMSE, but wondered whether you could use AIC or whether the different type of model would render such pointless? Any ideas much appreciated.....
