Keras functional API can be used to create models with multiple inputs (E.g. : Image, Categorical and Numerical). From Geotiff, you can extract : TIFF CSV with other features TIFF will be an input to stack of CNN layers and other features will feed dense layers. Output from both of these is combined in a dense layer. Example : https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2019/02/04/keras-multiple-inputs-and-mixed-data/
