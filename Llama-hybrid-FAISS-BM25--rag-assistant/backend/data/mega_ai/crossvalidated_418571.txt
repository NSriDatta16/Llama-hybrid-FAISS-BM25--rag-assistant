The residuals from your model are not random as one can "see" a change in the mean possibly at year 2 period 4 effectively identifying the need for deterministic structure of some form . This data set requires a hybrid model containing memory (ARIMA) and deterministic structure. I will present the "logic" in identifying this model. Following this discussion Seeking certain type of ARIMA explanation and this paradigm https://autobox.com/pdfs/ARIMA%20FLOW%20CHART.pdf and schemes to identify deterministic structure here http://docplayer.net/12080848-Outliers-level-shifts-and-variance-changes-in-time-series.html . Your data has been studied here https://www.kaggle.com/dromosys/shampoo-sales and here https://books.google.com/books?id=S4wwDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA367&lpg=PA367&dq=shampoo+data+set&source=bl&ots=bV2ddJq_Hk&sig=ACfU3U3wPaDdTODGvGsYo-mkTxphnM-zxA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj18Ni2nMjjAhXvs1kKHcwcCq4Q6AEwCXoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=shampoo%20data%20set&f=false and here https://machinelearningmastery.com/persistence-time-series-forecasting-with-python/ . Here is a set of residuals of a useful model suggesting not only memory but determinstic structure with an ACF here with Actual/Fit and Forecast here . Two very obvious visual trends in the data trends in the data periods 1-15 (1/1 - 2/3) and periods 16-36 (2/4 -3/12)are discovered/identified and incorporated into the model. Model identification is not simply done by fitting a trial set of models but rather in an iterative self-checking way validating the Gaussian assumptions of randomness. The initial data's ACF and PACF is here and here suggesting some sort of possibly complicated model. An initial model ( a trial balloon ! ) of (1,0,0) results in with a residual ACF & PACF here and residual plot (trending) here Following Tsay's suggested approach we identify the need for two time trends ( one starting at year 2 period 4 )and one pulse indicator suggesting the need to add three dummy series to our model Final analysis suggests this hybrid model with the following statistics and ACF/PACF here You say your residuals are uncorrelated , I say the variance of your residuals is bloated by a mean shift ( year 2 period 4) leading to a downwards estimate of the acf .. This is commonly referred to as the "Alice in Wonderland Effect" How to determine order of sarima? . While the series is non-stationary, differencing is the wrong remedy in this case. Finally the unusual spikes at the end are a resultant of estimating toooooo many ACF VALUES . You have 36 observations and you fit a model that implied that the first 6 errors are zero (5,1,0) thus you effectively have 30 non-zero residuals. Estimating auto-correlations up to lag 34 is not suggested thus numerical non-sense. Note that a level shift in a first difference model is functionally a time trend in the undifferenced data. The impact of visual hint (level shift/mean shift in the OP's residuals) in the first paragraph of this response is now clearer.
