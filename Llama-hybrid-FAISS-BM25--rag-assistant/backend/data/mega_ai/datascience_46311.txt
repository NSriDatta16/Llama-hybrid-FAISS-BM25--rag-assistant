How should continuous outputs be in convolutional neural network?

I have labeled faces images (label is the age -continuous value-) dataset and I want to construct a Convolutional Neural Network model to predict the age of a person. I have the following questions. How the label i.e. the age must be encoded ? Which activation function to use ?
