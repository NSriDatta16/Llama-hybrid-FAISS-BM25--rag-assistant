Do you have access to the CVS repository storage? If yes, then you should be able make a complete copy of the repository, remove any files/directories that you don't want to convert, and then run hg convert with a working directory checked out from this local repository. I say should because I haven't tried it, but since CVS stores revision history on a per-file basis, there's no reason I can think of that it shouldn't. It would not work with a SCM like Subversion, which stores multiple changes in a single revision.
