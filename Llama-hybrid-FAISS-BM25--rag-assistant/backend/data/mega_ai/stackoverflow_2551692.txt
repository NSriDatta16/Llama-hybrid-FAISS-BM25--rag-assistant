Chain your queries as CTEs, like this: WITH Orders(Id) AS ( SELECT DISTINCT anfrageid FROM MPHotlineAnfrageAnhang ), OrderDescs AS ( SELECT Id, ( SELECT CONVERT(VARCHAR(255),anfragetext) + ' | ' FROM MPHotlineAnfrageAnhang WHERE anfrageid = Id ORDER BY anfrageid, erstelltam FOR XML PATH('') ) AS Description FROM Orders ) SELECT Description FROM OrderDescs WHERE Id = 100012 You can have as many CTEs as you like, each referencing the previous, before the actual query.
