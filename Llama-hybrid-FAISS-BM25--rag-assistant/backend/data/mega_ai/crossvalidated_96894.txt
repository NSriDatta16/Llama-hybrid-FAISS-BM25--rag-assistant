Non-binomial posteriors for a binomial prior?

Let's assume we have a discrete binary random variable K (K=0 or K=1) for which the prior distribution is binomial. My understanding of Bayesian statistics tells me that regardless of the likelihood, the posterior distribution for K can only be binomial as well. However, I have encountered a text which talks about "beta posterior for a binomial prior" -- am I correct that this is wrong?
