I don't know of an elegant solution (although I'm a novice in this area.) Perhaps there's some way for you to create a temporary boolean field in your ClientDataSet... (Maybe a calculated field?) Suppose you name the new field "NewRecord" and include it in your IndexDef so that it is the most significant sort criteria. In an .OnCreate event, you set it true (which would be 1 internally?). In an .OnPost event you set it false. If you don't want to depend on the internal representation of booleans, then you could create a string field and put "ZZZZZZZ" in it. Or an integer field and put MaxInt in it.
