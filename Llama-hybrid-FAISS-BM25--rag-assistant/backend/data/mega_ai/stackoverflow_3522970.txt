HTTP doesn't support pushing of data. You need to use a webserver specific technique. In Tomcat, that's Comet . This is however a lot of work. I would rather recommend to use JavaScript/Ajax to let the client poll for the version change at certain intervals. E.g. every five minutes or so. If the result indicates a change in the version. then you can let JavaScript reload the page by window.location.reload . As to your caching problem, verify the response headers of the requested file in question. It should match at least the following headers: Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate Pragma: no-cache Expires: 0
