The FlashPaper software produces an .swf file for your document. In order to embed such a document in your web page you need to embed the .swf file via FlashPlayer in your page. Where the example says myFlashPaperFile.swf , you'll need to put the URL where the swf containing your document can be retreived by the player. You also may want to adjust the width, height and bgcolor attributes and parameters. You'll need both the object and embed tags in order to support all browsers. A good alternative for embedding Flash in web pages is to use SWFObject rather than to create the object/embed tags manually.
