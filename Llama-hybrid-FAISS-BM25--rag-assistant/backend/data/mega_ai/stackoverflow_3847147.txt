When you call setTimeout() , store the timer ID so you can clear it. If you're creating many timeouts, then an array is a good option for storing the IDs. For example: var timeouts = []; //then, store when you create them timeouts.push( setTimeout( { ... }, 1000) ); Then when you want to clear them: for (var i = 0; i As @Robert noted below, clearTimeout() won't throw an error if the timeout has already occurred, so there are no race/timing issues here.
