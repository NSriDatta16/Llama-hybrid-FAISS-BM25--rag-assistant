I am using following code to draw a line based on touch moved as it is in MS Paint? It works fine.but when I try to draw a line again after touch Ended, The previous line is erased..any help please? - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { mouseSwiped = NO; UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; if ([touch tapCount] == 2) { //drawImage.image = nil; //alphavalue = 0.0; //isErase = TRUE; //return; } lastPoint = [touch locationInView:self.view]; }
