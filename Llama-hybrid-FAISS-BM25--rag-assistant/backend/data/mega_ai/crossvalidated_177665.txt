Speed, computational expenses of PCA, LASSO, elastic net

I am trying to compare computational complexity / estimation speed of three groups of methods for linear regression as distinguished in Hastie et al. "Elements of Statistical Learning" (2nd ed.), Chapter 3: Subset selection Shrinkage methods Methods using derived input directions (PCR, PLS) The comparison can be very rough, just to give some idea. I gather that the answers may depend on the dimension of the problem and how that fits the computer architecture, so for a concrete example one may consider a sample size of 500 and 50 candidate regressors. I am mostly interested in motivation behind the computational complexity / estimation speed but not in how long it would take on a certain processor for the given example.
