To compute the class of states for the given transition probability matrix

I have been given the following transition probability matrix of a markov chain: $P = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{3}{4}{} & 0 & \frac{1}{4} &0 \\ \frac{1}{2} & 0 & 0 & \frac{1}{2}\\ 0& 0& 0& 1\\ \frac{1}{4}&\frac{1}{4} &\frac{1}{4} &\frac{1}{4} \end{pmatrix}$ I want to compute the class of each state. My current understanding of class of state is this: The class of state $i$ , denoted by, $C(i)$ is the set of all such states which are communicating with $i$ . Where communicating means, two states will be communicating if they can be accessed from each other, irrespective of the number of steps, meaning that one $i$ state can be accessed through another state $j$ in $m$ steps and $j$ can be accessed through $i$ in $n$ number of steps. $m$ and $n$ need not be equal. Please let me know if my current understanding of class is the correct one. Then, to actually compute the class, I draw the digraph. I don't know how to do that in latex. So, I am uploading an image. Here, we go: From this digraph, I want to compute the class of states $1,2,3,$ and $4$ . $C(1) = (2,4)$ 1 is communicating with 2 although we cannot go from 1 to 2 directly but we can go like this $1 => 3 => 4 => 2$ . Also, we can come to 2 from 1 like this: $1=>3=>4=>2$ . Is this the correct way to solve these type of problems?
