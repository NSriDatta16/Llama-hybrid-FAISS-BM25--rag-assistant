In the context of VxWorks errno is defined as two 16-bit: The upper 16-bit identifies the "module" where the error occured. The lower 16-bit represent the particular error for that module. The official vxWorks module values (for errno) are located in the ../h/vwModNum.h file. They are currently using a few hundred numbers. These module numbers all have the form #define M_something (nn It is strongly discouraged to modify this (or any) vxWorks header file. What you could do is create your own module header file and start at a large enough number to not cause conflicts. /* myModNum.h */ #define M_MyModule (10000 The in the individual module header files, create the individual errno values. /* myModule.h */ #define S_MyModule_OutOfResources (M_MyModule | 1) #define S_MyModule_InvalidHandle (M_MyModule | 2) ... In your code, you can then set errno to your defined macro.
