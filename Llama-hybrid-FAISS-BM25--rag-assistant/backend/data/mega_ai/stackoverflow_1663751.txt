Javascripting for Adobe Illustrator

I am trying to produce a script that will: comb through all the layers and sublayers in a file then flatten each layer that DOES NOT have a layer inside of it. take the flattened layers and gets their POSITION RELATIVE to an item with a name containing the word "area" that resides in the flattened layers' parent layer, combs through all layers and finds all sibling layers or sublayers, and gets their POSITION RELATIVE to each other in order from the top down, assigns a variable to each value, then applies each value varioius mathematical formulas, takes the results of those formulas and exports the data to a different text file and changes the extension to a word I would define, creates a list of all layers and sublayers and organizes the list as an xml document with a nested structure based on the nested structure of the layers and change the extension to a second word I would define, THEN selects certain layers based on whether or not that layer or sublayer has a name containing a currently undefined word or phrase like "column" and copies these layers to new documents, repositions certain layers within the new documents based on whether or not that layer or sublayer has a name containing a currently undefined word or phrase like "top-left", selects certain layers based on whether or not that layer or sublayer has a name containing a currently undefined word or phrase like "top" and flattens them together, and exports them to a .png file, a .gif file, and a .jpg2
