How to build a classification pipeline that will pass to another model?

Not sure if the title explained it, but I am trying to build a pipeline where it's like a decision tree, but also not. Say for example, I had a picture. The model classified the picture, but now I want to send it to another CNN. How could I create something like this? Sorry if it's not detailed, still figuring it out!
