It's a philosophical question; it depends on the type of module, and the trade-offs. I think I have personally done all of them at various times, except for the GUID to type mapping, which doesn't have any advantages over the string to type mapping in my opinion, and at least strings are readable. I would say you need to look at what level of decoupling is required for the particular module, given the expected external usage and code organization, and go from there. You've hit all the conceptual methods as far as I know, and they are each useful in particular situations. That's my opinion, anyway.
