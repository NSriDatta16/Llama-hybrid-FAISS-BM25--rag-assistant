Forecasting Multi-variate data using Arima errors with Fourier terms and covariate on a weekly data in R

I'm planning to do a multivariate time series forecasting using arima errors with fourier terms. Data assumptions-moderate seasonality. one independent variable(x) and dependent variable(y) Weekly data collected for 148 weeks. y has some good correlation with x. So planning to forecast y based on the correlation with x along with the fourier values of y. df.y Is it right to use forecasted values of x and Fourier values of Y when forecasting the Y variable? i have just used cbind on the xreg parameter to use both forecasted variable(x) and Fourier values of y Please advise
