Get the eigenvalues when you know the explained variances of a PCA plot

I'm performing a PCA using the sklearn.decomposition.pca function. It appears to work as it should. Acording to this question , I can get the eigenvalues like this:. The eigenvalues represent the variance in the direction of the eigenvector. So you can get them through the pca.explained_variance_ attribute: eigenvalues = pca.explained_variance_ If this is correct, the eigenvalues for my first few components seem to be way to high. eigenvalues = pca.explained_variance_ eigenvalues # returns [1188.482427 760.26572144 581.29434167 325.56710676 267.10095401 219.49301802 155.1603308 107.8855256 76.17770897 64.09568959] For every scree-plot I've seen and for example, when you google screeplot on google, the eigenvalues are usually much, much lower. Can eigenvalues be this high?
