What is so mysterious about machine learning?

I have come across several articles online stating that mathematicians don't really understand how machine learning works. One example I can come up with right now is this . There are several others too but can't remember enough to mention. Some other article mentioned that they are like black boxes producing elegant solutions without providing any clear insight as to how the solution was arrived at. Could someone explain it in a bit more detail?
