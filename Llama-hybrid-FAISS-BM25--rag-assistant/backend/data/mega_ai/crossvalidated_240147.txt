(Just for reference, I am posting my comments as an answer. Note that the first version of the question did not include the formula.) "Accuracy" and "precision" are general terms throughout science. A good way to internalize the difference are the common " bullseye diagrams ". In machine learning/statistics as a whole, accuracy vs. precision is analogous to bias vs. variance . However in the particular context of Binary Classification * these terms have very specific definitions. The chart at that Wikipedia page gives these, which are $$\mathrm{Accuracy}=\frac{\mathrm{True}}{\mathrm{Total}} \text{ , } \mathrm{Precision}=\frac{\mathrm{True\;Positive}}{\mathrm{All\;Positive}} $$ i.e. the fraction of cases that are correctly classified vs. the fraction of positives that are true. (*Note that this context is much more specialized than simply "machine learning".)
