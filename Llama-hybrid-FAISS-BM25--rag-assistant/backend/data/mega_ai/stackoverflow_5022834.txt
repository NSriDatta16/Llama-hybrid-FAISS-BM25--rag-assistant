Parent Page shows through Filter Menus in RadWindow embedded RadGrid

I have a RadGrid in a RadWindow set to Modal. I'm seeing two issues. The first and most critical ONLY HAPPENS IN IE7 and NOT in FIREFOX is that the Filter Menus of the RadGrid do not display when clicked. Instead a box the size of the menus is opened through which I can see the parent page. The second and probably related HAPPENS IN BOTH IE AND FIREFOX is that when I drag the RadWindow the content of the RadWindow disappears and is replaced by the same transparency to the parent page. Any help you could offer would be great. I've spent all day hunting and pecking through CSS trying to find it. Grid and window declarations follow. ...ommitted...
