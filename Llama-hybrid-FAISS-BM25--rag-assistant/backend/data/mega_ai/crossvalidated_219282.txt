General validity/reliability of questionnaires

I have a general question concerning the reliability/validity of questionnaires. I'm working in Human Resources and we plan to conduct a workplace engagement survey. I attended a conference and a company presented their questionnaire on workplace engagement. They explained that they did research within many different organizations, and based on their analysis (Confirmatory Factor Analysis) they came up with 7 drivers of engagement. Each driver/theme is made of various questions. My question is, if we would choose to use their questionnaire for our workplace engagement survey, could I then assume that the identified themes would be valid for our organization as well? The research has been done within different organization, however, our organization is a university. So I wonder if using this questionnaire might not give me valid and reliable results. Many thanks for all your help in advance, Tanya
