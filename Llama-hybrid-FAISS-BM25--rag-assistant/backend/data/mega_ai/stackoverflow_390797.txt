Are comments necessary for a programming language?

After some stupid musings about Klingon languages, that came from this post I began a silly hobby project creating a Klingon programming language that compiles to Lua byte-code. During the initial language design phase I looked up information about Klingon programmers , and found out about this Klingon programming rule: A TRUE Klingon Warrior does not comment his code! So I decided my language would not support commenting , as any good Klingon would never use them. Now many of the Klingon ways don't seem reasonable to us Human programmers, however while dabbling with the design and implementation of my hobby language I came to realize that this Klingon rule about commenting is indeed very reasonable, if not great. Removing the ability to comment from a programming language meant I HAVE to write literate code , no exceptions. So it got me wondering if there are any languages out there that don't support comments? Is there are any really good arguments to not remove commenting from a language? Edit: Any good examples of comments required? P.S.> My hobby language above is partially silly anyways, so don't focus too much on my implementation, as much as the concept of comments required in general
