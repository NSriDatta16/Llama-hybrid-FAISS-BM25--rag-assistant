I'm sorry, but this is not a sensible thing to do. Comparing a total to a subset of that total is not good. If you wanted, you could separate fatal vs. non-fatal and see if those are different, but, they clearly are, you don't really need a test. Still, if you wanted to do this, a paired t-test would not be the way, there is no pairing here. You would want some time series method. As for trend, yes, of course there is a trend. Since both of these are totals over time, both can only go up or stay stable. So, I would look at deaths or total in each time period. And, since the time periods are not equal (some are 1 week, some are more than 1 month), I would divide by the number of days in each time period. Then you could fit curves to each. If you are doing this just for yourself (or a class project) then the above should be OK. If it part of a serious analysis, then I strongly urge you to consult with a professional statistician (not me, I've retired). Time series are tricky.
