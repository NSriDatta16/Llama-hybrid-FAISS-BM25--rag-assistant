Does a more complicated neural network necessarily increases the computational time? Why?

I'm currently new the field of machine learning and neural networks. Been doing some quick tests regarding how a structure of neural network affects the computational time. below is result of my tests. (**the network structure is in a format of: input layer, hidden layer 1, hidden layer 2, output layer) I can understand for the accuracy drop for the "overfitting" cases, but I don't understand why would a more complicated structure (sample 2.1a) will have the same recognition time as a simpler structure (sample 2.1c) Any kind of help is much appreciated.
