I don't believe this is possible with ResourceBundles loaded from a properties file. The PropertyResourceBundle leverages the Properties class to load the properties file. The Properties class loads a properties file as a set of String->String map entries and doesn't support pulling out String[] values. Calling ResourceBundle.getStringArray just calls ResourceBundle.getObject, casting the result to a String[]. Since the PropertyResourceBundle just hands this off to the Properties instance it loaded from the file, you'll never be able to get this to work with the current, stock PropertyResourceBundle.
