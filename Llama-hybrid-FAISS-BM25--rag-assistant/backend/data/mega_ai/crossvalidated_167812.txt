How to approach a regression problem?

I have to solve a regression problem involving 302 variables. How do we select appropriate models or ensemble of models to work well ? Does this decision of choosing models come from the ideas obtained by Exploratory Data Analysis or by trial method ? This is the problem from Kaggle that I have to solve: https://www.kaggle.com/c/liberty-mutual-fire-peril
