Nature of outcome variable and predictors in regression analyses

Let’s say I have a questionnaire that measures whether someone is depressed. It ranges from 1 to 50. I ask people to report stressful life events in a 30 days period. I hypothesize that stressful life events can predict the value of this score. I do a regression analyses and find a coefficient value of 0.1 for my predictor that represents the number of stressful life events. It is highly significant and the average number of reported stressful life events is 100. Let’s say I have an individual who reported 1000 stressful life events, then the resulting value of the regression model would exceed the limits of my questionnaire. Can I hence do a regression analyses where my outcome variable is fixed between two values (e.g. 1 to 50), and predictors do not have clear minima and maxima?
