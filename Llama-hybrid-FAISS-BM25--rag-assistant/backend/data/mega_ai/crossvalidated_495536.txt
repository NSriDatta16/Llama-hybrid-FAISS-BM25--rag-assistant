Kwiatkowski–Phillips–Schmidt–Shin (KPSS) and Augmented Dickey–Fuller (ADF) Tests

I have been searching for a sample usage of the KPSS and ADF tests, however I can only find pages reporting examples using R or Python. The mathematical definition of the KPSS test also seems to be pretty hard to find and I would love to see it. My question is: can you showcase a very simple but complete example of how to perform/compute the KPSS and ADF tests on a toy time series in plain math, without any programming language?
