Building a machine learning model to predict variables measured after the end of the crop based on environmental data

I have dataset (20 samples) containing timeseries on temperature, humidity etc (a total of 6 variables). Each timeseries is 5 complete days, which is 24 * 5 = 120 values. So dataset has hourly values of temperatures etc but when it comes to lets say yields parameters I have only one vector containing subjective crop quality (scale 1-10), vitamin A, C, E content, protein content and fat content measured after the end of the crop. I am familiar with machine learning using scikit-learn or tensorflow. But I am not sure how to represent this problem. The tricky part here for me is that I have just six values of yield per one sample. I have read some articles and I have applied RNN (like in those articles) but they usually had some 'yields parameters' measured during plant growing. How do I approach this? I have thought about 6 models of RNN each for all yield parameters or maybe one RNN where last Dense layer is 6. So far I transformed the data and it has shape: (20, 6, 120) and the y shape: (20, 6) or (20,1) (depends on approach).
