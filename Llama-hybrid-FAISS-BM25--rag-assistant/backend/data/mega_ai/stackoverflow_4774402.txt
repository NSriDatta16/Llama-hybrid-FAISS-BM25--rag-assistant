Is there a quick way to get a users country code?

I want to know if the user is browsing from the UK, or using a UK browser. If not, I can safely assume that they are a US visitor. I can lookup their IP in a database, but this is a bit slow and I'd rather just find out from their User-agent or some other HTTP header. It doesn't matter if it's not always correct, and there are ambiguities (such as someone using a US computer in the UK).
