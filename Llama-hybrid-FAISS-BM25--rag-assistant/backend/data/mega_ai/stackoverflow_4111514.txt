Modifying an advanced-indexed subset of a NumPy recarray in place

I have a recarray with a couple columns that I use for selecting a subset. Something like >>> x array([ ('label1',True,3), ('label2',True,2), ('label1',False,4)], dtype=[('status', '|S16'), ('select', '|b1'), ('somedata', ' Data is selected from this array using an approach similar to a previous SO question . condit=(x['status']=='label1')&(x['select']==True) x_subids=numpy.where(condit)[0] x_sub=x[x_subids] Then I do some work on the subset and update the original. x[x_subids]=x_sub I understand that x_sub is a copy rather than a view due to advanced indexing, and I was wondering if there was an elegant way of avoiding the array copy and just working with the original given the conditions that I need to subset the data.
