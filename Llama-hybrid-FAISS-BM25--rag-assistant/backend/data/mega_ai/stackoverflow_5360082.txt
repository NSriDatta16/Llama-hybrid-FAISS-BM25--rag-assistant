Adobe Air for Android takes care of the integration for you - you don't have to write any Java to make it work. It's actually a straight-up AIR app and if the user of the device has Air for Android installed then your app will work, simple as that. The native code (java) vs AIR debate has been raging for a long time - depending on the type of app you're making you COULD see gains from writing Java, since it's one less layer on the project. On the other hand, the difference is minimal if you're not animating a billion shapes or whatever - so in many cases AIR is just fine. The other option that you have is to build your app using HTML/JavaScript and simply embed it into a Java or ObjC wrapper that compiles into a native app on Android/iPhone - many apps, especially the ones that are just user interfaces for some sort of data set, use this approach. So, depending your use case you have lots of options! :)
