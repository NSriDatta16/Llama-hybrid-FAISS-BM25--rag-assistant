Clustering for mixed data

I would like to perform clustering with a dataset consisting of survey data including likert type vars, binary and categorical variables (eg age group, type of car, residence), that are >30 in total. The objective is to identify groups of customers, based on their demography and preferences. Would kmeans on PCA results make sense? Any other approaches that could be suitable?
