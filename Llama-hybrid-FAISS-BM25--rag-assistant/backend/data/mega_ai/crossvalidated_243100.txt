In regards to the question in the title: The function pca in MATLAB uses the SVD of the centred dataset to perform PCA; this excellent thread elucidates the relation between the two. Using the SVD corresponds to using the covariance matrix, not the correlation matrix. Having said that and to answer the main question of post: if one z-scores the data and then uses the covariance matrix for PCA, the results will be equivalent to using the correlation matrix of the original data. This can be easily seen by computing the difference: cov(zscore(A)) - corr(A) which should be zero to numerical precision (where A is the dataset matrix). So yes , there will be a difference if you use the correlation-based instead of the covariance-based PCA methodology; if you $z$-score your dataset though the two methodologies will give equal results. In general, I would recommend you $z$-scale your variables before doing PCA, especially if they are measured in different scales. Otherwise the differences in their magnitudes can potentially dominate the subsequent eigenanalysis (and the interpretation of the final results). This topic is explored in more detail in this thread on doing PCA on correlation or covariance?
