Open source NLP annotation tool/library supports active learning

I am looking for an NLP annotation tool/library that supports active learning. I am looking for something that works in this scenario: Annotating N samples. Training a model on the annotated data. Getting the model's predictions on the next N unlabeled data. Correct/annotate (manually by the annotator) the annotations of the unlabeled data. Retrain the model by including the labeled data from the last step. I found a library that's called Prodigy but it's not free. Any suggestion for a free library?
