How do I add htmltablecell data to database after I click submit

I created an htmltable in .aspx.vb, because I have a lot of rows that come from database and they depend on the querystring. that part is fine. But when someone makes a change in one of the cells how do I save data back to database? Code - Dim tr As New HtmlTableRow Dim td As New HtmlTableCell td = New HtmlTableCell Dim txtbox1 As New TextBox txtbox1.ID = "price_" & rd("id") txtbox1.Text = rd("price") td.Controls.Add(txtbox1) tr.Cells.Add(td) tb1.Rows.Add(tr) Now when someone changes the price in the textbox, how do I save it in database? This is code for submit button - Protected Sub submit_Click(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs) Handles submit.Click Dim sqlcnn As SqlConnection = Nothing, sqlstr As String = "", sqlcmd As SqlCommand sqlstr = "UPDATE ???" sqlcmd = New SqlCommand(sqlstr, sqlcnn) sqlcmd.ExecuteScalar() End Sub Please answer in detail.
