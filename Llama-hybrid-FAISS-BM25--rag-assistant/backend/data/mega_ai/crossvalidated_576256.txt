Difference between cross validation vs model accuracy measures

I have a time series ARIMA model and I want to validate the accuracy my prediction. But I dont understand the difference of using cross validation vs model accuracy measures such as MAPE, MAE, MSE and RMSE which can easily generated using R. If they have different purposes, should I be using both? Could someone help clarify the difference and my understanding? Thanks!
