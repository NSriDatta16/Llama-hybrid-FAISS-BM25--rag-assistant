Poisson regression intercept downward bias when true intercepts are small

When fitting a Poisson regression on data with low expected values, the intercept term has a small bias even when the model is perfectly specified. Below, I simulated data just using $y \sim rPois(exp(\beta_0))$ and then fit the data using the glm model $log(E[y]) \sim \beta_0$ . On average, the estimates are slightly biased downwards. The bias is small, but I would like to understand why this happens. I could understand why this would happen if $\beta_0$ was a large negative number and the data were mostly zeros, but the data from the $\beta_0$ values I chose is always mostly non-zero. Why would this happen? # function to run the simulation for one set of beta values run_sim
