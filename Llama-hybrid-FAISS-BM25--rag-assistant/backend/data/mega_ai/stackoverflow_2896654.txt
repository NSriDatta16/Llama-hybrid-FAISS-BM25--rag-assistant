Is there open-source java/c/c++ framework for pipes-and-filters paradigm?

I'm interested in open-source Java/C/C++ framework for pipes-and-filters (like described in that book ) paradigm. Can you recommend some? EDIT: I'm looking for as much "pure" (or lightweight) frameworks as possible: frameworks which encourage programming in "pipes-and-filters" technique, without reliance on any standards, such as XML or JMS, but on language only.
