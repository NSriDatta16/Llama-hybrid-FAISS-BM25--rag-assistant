The trade-off in GMM is between the number of gaussian distribution (number of components) and the likelihood of your model. The difficulty is that there is "no truth" about the number of distributions. The more you add the higher your likelihood, the less you add the poorer your likelihood. To model that trade-off, the classic approach is to use AIC ou BIC. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akaike_information_criterion https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_information_criterion
