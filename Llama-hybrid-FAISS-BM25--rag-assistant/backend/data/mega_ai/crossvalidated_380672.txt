Does forecasting with ARIMA lose non-stationary components?

Suppose I have a time series $Y$ . I have read that an ARIMA model consists as an ARMA model of a stationarized version of $Y$ . If I try to predict $n$ ticks ahead with an ARIMA forecast model (with $n$ big), would I loose any non-stationary component of $Y$ like trend or seasonality ?
