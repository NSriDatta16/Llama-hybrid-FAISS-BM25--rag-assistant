I agree with @Ragster - get the database guy and the UI guy to work together. There's even a buzzword for this - it is called pair programming . But I'd add one thing. It sounds like a significant part of the problem is that the database guy has all of the knowledge in his head ... and there is nothing written down. This is not good . What happens if the database guy is run over by a green bus? Maybe you need to make the database guy's number one priority to document the database design in a form that the UI guy can assimilate.
