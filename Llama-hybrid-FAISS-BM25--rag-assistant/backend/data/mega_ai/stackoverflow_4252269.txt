when the parent object is created save the bounds to a var outside your function so you can call to the stored size later. If you keep checking the bounds within your function then of course it will change as the objects with in the parent change. Or set the bounds on mouseDown but not on drag so you have an updated bounds before your drag object hits the edge.
