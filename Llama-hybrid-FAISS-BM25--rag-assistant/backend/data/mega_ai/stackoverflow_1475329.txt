Organizing Images By Color

Maybe you've noticed but Google Image search now has a feature where you can narrow results by color. Does anyone know how they do this? Obviously, they've indexed information about each image. I am curious what the best methods of analyzing an image's color data to allow simple color searching. Thanks for any and all ideas!
