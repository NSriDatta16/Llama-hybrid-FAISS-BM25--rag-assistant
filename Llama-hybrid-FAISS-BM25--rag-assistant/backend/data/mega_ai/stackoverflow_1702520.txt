Assuming that you were able to set the encoding properly in your database, my recommended approach here is to: Make sure that the Content-Type header has been set properly by the server. This can be done in php by using the header function. header('Content-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1'); Note that this takes precedence and is the easiest information to get since user agents do not have to parse it. Set the meta tag in the HTML file. For further readings, refer to: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html http://www.webstandards.org/learn/articles/askw3c/dec2002/
