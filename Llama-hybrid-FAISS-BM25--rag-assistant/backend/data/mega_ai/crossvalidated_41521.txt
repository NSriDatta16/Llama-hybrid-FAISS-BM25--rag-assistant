It might be helpful to isolate all the moving parts in a particular expectation. In doing so, recall that an expectation is a Lebesgue-Stieltjes integral. I will adapt the notation slightly and use $X$ to denote a random variable, $x$ to denote a fixed value taken by that random variable in its support, that is, $x\in\mathcal{X}\equiv\text{support}(X)$. For the average loss , it might be helpful to distinguish between the true parameter $\theta_0$ and the parameter value $\theta$ at which the risk of the estimator $\delta$ is being evaluated. $$ \begin{align} R(\theta, \delta) &= \mathbb{E}_{\theta_0} \left(L(\theta, \delta(X)\right)),\, \theta\in \Theta\\ &=\int_\mathcal{X} L(\theta,\delta(x)) \, d\mathbb{P}_{\theta_0}(x) \end{align} $$ Note that the integration here is with respect to the true underlying probability measure generating the random variable $X$, which belongs to the model class $\mathcal{P} = \{\mathbb{P}_\theta\mid \theta \in \Theta\}$, $\mathbb{P}_{\theta_0}\in \mathcal{P}$. If the probability measure is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure, then we can write it equivalently as you have written it $$ \begin{align} R(\theta, \delta) &= \int_\mathcal{X}L(\theta, \delta(x))f(x\mid \theta_0)\, dx \end{align} $$ For the posterior loss , which is defined conditional on a value $x \in \mathcal{X}$, that is it is conditional on you having observed the data to be $X=x$, matters are more straightforward. It just says that the expectation is an integral with respect to the posterior which is conditional on the value of the $X$, and if the data were to change, the posterior would change, and so would the posterior expected loss. The following notation might clarify matters (or not), $$ \begin{align} \rho(\pi(\mid x), d \mid X=x) &= \mathbb{E}^{\pi(\mid x)}\left(L(\theta, d)\mid X=x\right) \\ &= \int_\Theta L(\theta, d)\pi(\theta \mid x)\, d\theta \end{align} $$ to indicate exactly where the conditioning variable appears in the integral.
