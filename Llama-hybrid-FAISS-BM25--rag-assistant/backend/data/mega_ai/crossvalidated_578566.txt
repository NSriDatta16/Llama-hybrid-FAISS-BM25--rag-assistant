Compute conditional probabilities in Bayesian hypothesis testing

I would like to solve a problem by the Bayesian approach. I have measurement samples $\texttt{y}_{1}$ and $\texttt{y}_{2}$ , they are Gaussian independent with (scalar) means $\theta_{i}$ ; $i=1,2$ and the same variance $\sigma^{2}$ . I want to test whether $\theta_{1}>\theta_{2}$ (hyp. $H_{1}$ ) or instead $\theta_{1}\leq\theta_{2}$ (hyp. $H_{2}$ ). Assuming I know the joint a posteriori density of the two random variables $\theta_{i}$ ; $i=1,2$ , what is the expression that I should use to compute the two conditional probabilities $P(H_{i}|\texttt{y}=y)$ , $i=1,2$ ? EDIT: with $P(H_{i}|\texttt{y}=y)$ , $i=1,2$ obviously I mean $P(\theta_{1}>\theta_{2}|y_{1},y_{2})$ and $P(\theta_{1}\leq\theta_{2}|y_{1},y_{2})$ . Thanks!
