(Moving my first comment down to an answer now that it's not a coding question.) Repeat many times: Simulate each of the internode travel times. Compute the resulting travel times for each of the four possible routes. Find the quickest, which is then the travel time for that iteration of the simulation ... collecting each of the pieces of information being asked about on the way (i.e. using sample averages and proportions to estimate the population quantities).
