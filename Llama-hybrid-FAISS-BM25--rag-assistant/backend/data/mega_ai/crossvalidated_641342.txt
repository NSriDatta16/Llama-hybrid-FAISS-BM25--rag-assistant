Why does FPCA not use scaling as PCA?

Functional principal component analysis (FPCA), according to the original paper, does not use scaling before FPCA, as in PCA. Instead, it uses a covariance matrix to compute the eigen-components. I just don't get it. Is it supposed to be better to use scaling before FPCA? Related question: Functional principal component analysis (FPCA): what is it all about?
