Optimizing Join, GroupBy, Distinct, Min/Max on naturally sorted sequences

LINQ operators operate on the assumption that input sequences are not sorted, which is great for generic cases. However, the above operators could be more efficient if source sequences were sorted on the key values. For example, Join reads whole inner sequence into a hash table and only then iterates over outer sequence. If two sequences were sorted, Join could be implemented as a simple merge with no additional storage and hash table lookups. Is there a library that has alternative high-performance LINQ functions operating on pre-sorted sequences?
