Open link to specific domain within an iFrame in a new window

I need to be able to open a link to a specific URL that is within an iFrame; the link is generated by php and I can't change the source code, so I need to change the link in the iFrame dynamically, if possible. What I'm doing is this: on a non-profit organization's site, I have an affiliate store (generated by php) displayed within an iFrame on a page in order to make it more styled with the rest of the site. The php store pulls products from an affiliate service; the link to the store.php is in the same domain as the main non-profit's site. The problem is the final "Buy Now" link from a product opens the final destination e-commerce store within the iFrame, and as such the page is stuck in the iFrame and looks bad and one must scroll V and H to see it and check out. The link I need to open in a new window always has the class "av_buy_now" I have access to the CSS file, which I can change. I have access to the PHP files, i.e. shop.php, but it doesn't appear that the final link is generated locally. I'm showing the iframe this way: Is it possible to use jQuery or Javascript to find the links to mydomain.com with that one class and add a new window attribute to them? Or is there a better way? Thanks
