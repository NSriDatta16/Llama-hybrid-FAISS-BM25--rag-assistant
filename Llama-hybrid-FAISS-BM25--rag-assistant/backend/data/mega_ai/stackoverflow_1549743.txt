When to Use the Decorator Pattern?

I am going over my design patterns, and one pattern I have yet to seriously use in my coding is the Decorator Pattern. I understand the pattern, but what I would love to know are some good concrete examples of times in the real world that the decorator pattern is the best/optimal/elegant solution. Specific situations where the need for the decorator pattern is really handy. Thanks.
