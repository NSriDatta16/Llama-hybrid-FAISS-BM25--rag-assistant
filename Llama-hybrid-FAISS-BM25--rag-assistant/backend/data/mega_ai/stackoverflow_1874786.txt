Is it possible to use an Amazon EC2 instance as an email server?

I want to be able to run an EC2 instance (CentOS LAMP based) as a mail server and create email addresses for users when they sign up so that they can upload files via email. The emails would be parsed and attached files processed and added to S3 for storage. Is this feasible? What mail package would I need for this? I would like to be able to create email address such as username@uploads.domainname.com my domainname points to a webserver not on amazon web services so I realise this may not be possible. where do I start with this, are there any good resources for setting up a mail server on EC2 many thanks
