rstrip doesn't do what you want it to do, it strips any of the characters you give it and not a suffix: >>> '30000.0'.rstrip('.0') '3' Actually, just '%g' % i will do what you want. EDIT: as Robert pointed out in his comment this won't work for large numbers since it uses the default precision of %g which is 6 significant digits. Since str(i) uses 12 significant digits, I think this will work: >>> numbers = [ 0.0, 1.0, 0.1, 123456.7 ] >>> ['%.12g' % n for n in numbers] ['1', '0', '0.1', '123456.7']
