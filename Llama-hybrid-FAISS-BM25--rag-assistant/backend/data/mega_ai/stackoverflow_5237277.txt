Will Doctrine notice? Probably not. Will it cause problems? Only when things go wrong. MyISAM is not a transactional storage engine. If you change a MyISAM table while inside of a transaction, then have to roll back changes, they won't roll back in that table. It's been a while since I tried to break it horribly, but I'm willing to wager that MySQL won't even issue a warning when this happens. This will lead to data consistency issues. If you control the server, you should seriously consider external search software to take the load off the database, like ElasticSearch (integrates at the application level), or Sphinx (integrates at the MySQL level).
