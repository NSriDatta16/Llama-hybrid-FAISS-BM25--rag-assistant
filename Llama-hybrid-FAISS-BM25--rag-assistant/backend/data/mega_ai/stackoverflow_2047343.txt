irpa is an instance of a class, meaning it's a reference type. A reference type variable needs to be initialized with the new() operator or it needs to point to an existing variable of the same type using the '=' operator. IResourcePolicy irpa = new IResourcePolicy() ; irpa.AgentVersion = agentVersion; However, the syntax indicates that irpa might be an Interface - which is abstract and thus unusable in this way
