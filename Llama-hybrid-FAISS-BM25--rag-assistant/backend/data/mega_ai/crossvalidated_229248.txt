I decided to turn my comment into an answer. What you are experiencing is an example of Simpson's Paradox, where a marginal result can be in the opposite direction of a conditional result. In this case having so much more data on 2-door cars than 4-door cars masks the difference based on color. Before you can answer the question of "How do I decide if 2-door or 4-door is better?" you need to address the following questions. 1) What is your research hypothesis, are you interested in the difference between 2-door and 4-door in general or do you care about how the relationship changes for specific things like color (or price range, or gas mileage, or leather vs cloth interior, etc..). Because you could probably always play with your data in such a way that you could find evidence that 2-door or 4-door sold better. 2) Do you really care about the difference between black and white cars specifically, or is this phenomenon something you just happened to notice while messing around with the data. I would be concerned about this one because you are only looking at two colors. This could be an issue because it's not unreasonable to assume that differences between 2-door and 4-door cars lead people to choose different colors. (i.e. 2-door cars are considered sportier and therefore have a higher proportion of red.) If that is true then when you break down this proportion into 2-door vs 4-door based on red, white, black etc this could change. Answering these questions will help you decide whether you need more data(maybe more colors included) or maybe you only care about the very general 2-door vs 4-door. After you've settled on your Hypothesis I would consider using a Categorical technique. If you're interested in describing the data you could start with Odd's Ratios. Personally I would probably include color because you don't want to be accused of fishing for a result. I would try to include more colors than just black and white, and it looks like you've also broken up your data by car type. So to analyze this I would recommend looking at a logistic regression model. A logistic regression model takes into account the binomial nature (success vs failure) of your data and will allow you to account for the different variables affecting the overall result. A good reference for everything concerned with Categorical Data is Alan Agresti's Categorical Data Analysis.
