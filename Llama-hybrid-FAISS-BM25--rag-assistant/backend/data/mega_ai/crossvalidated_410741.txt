Spectral embedding: interpretation of new dimensions

I'm trying to gain an intuition for the 2nd dimension in the spectral embedding of an S-shaped dataset as in this example : The 1st dimension seems to neatly capture the local similarity between points, but is there a similar physical interpretation for the 2nd dimension? More specifically, why do both red AND blue points show low values for this dimension? I am wondering whether these dimensions can be interpreted in a similar way as done for the embedding of hand-written digits :
