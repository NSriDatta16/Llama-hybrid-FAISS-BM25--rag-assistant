I think 20 years of data is plenty. Let's assume that the variable you are looking at is the Unemployment rate for 20 different regions over a 20 year time series. You already looked at a correlation table 20 x 20, and found that Unemployment rate at the regional level is highly correlated. To analyze their respective patterns, you could run a simple linear regression for each of those regional Unemployment rate (dependent variable) with the National Unemployment rate as the independent variable. This way you would have a linear regression equation for each of those regional Unemployment rate variable characterized by a slope vs the National Unemployment rate and a constant. Each regional variable will have a different pattern (different Slope and Constant). But, directionally they would be similar. Also, each linear regression would divulge the statistical significance of the relationship between the specific Regional Unemployment rate and the National one... or whatever is the x variable you are looking at... the rational would be the same.
