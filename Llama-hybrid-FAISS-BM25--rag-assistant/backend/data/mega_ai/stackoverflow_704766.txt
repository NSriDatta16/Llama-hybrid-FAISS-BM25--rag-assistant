Why does Firefox allow images to be dragged but not dropped?

If you browse a web page through Firefox, any image on the page can be dragged anywhere on the screenâ€”but you can't drop it. Other browsers such as IE or Chrome do not allow dragging images. Is this a issue? Why does Firefox allow dragging?
