I try to stay true to the command pattern that Mike refers to when developing WPF applications, using a combination of Andy's #2 and #3 approaches. I can think of only one downside of commands in my view: only certain actions of certain UI elements invoke commands. One way to get around this is to have your event handler call the Execute method on a command. I think that commands provide a very good way to encapsulate execution logic. If you maintain a large piece of UI and implement it using a MVC/MVC/MVVM pattern, this becomes very apparent. I encourage you to take a look at Dan Crevier's series on the DataModel-View-ViewModel pattern, in particular the section on Commands and Encapsulating Commands. Even if this pattern doesn't meet your needs, it gives a great overview of how you can encapsulate logic inside a separate class.
