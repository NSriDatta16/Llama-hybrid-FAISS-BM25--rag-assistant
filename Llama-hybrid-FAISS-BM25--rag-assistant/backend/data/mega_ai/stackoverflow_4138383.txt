Advice for website speed improvement?

I'm almost done with this online library: http://gramma.ro I have grade C in YSlow but I'm still dissatisfied with the average time consumed for this website to be loaded (~7 seconds on my internet connection). Maybe some of you will say that it works well but please compare with the speed of this one: http://www.libris.ro/ which is absolutely fast. Do you have any advice for my application? Do you see critical places where I can improve which can seriously reduce the loading time of my site? Database used: sql server 2008. Language used: c# + asp.net Hardware used: dedicated server, AMD 64 2.2 Ghz, 2 GB Ram Thanks in advance... UPDATE : I've used OutputCache (1h or 1 day) option for 4 user controls on my page which improved the site's loading with 3 seconds!!!
