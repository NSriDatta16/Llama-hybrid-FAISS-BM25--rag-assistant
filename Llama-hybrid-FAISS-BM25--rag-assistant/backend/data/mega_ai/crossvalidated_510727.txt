How to correctly word a frequentist confidence interval

I am aware that there are many, many threads on this (e.g. this excellent thread). I may have missed it but I can't seem to find one that actually explains how to accurately report a frequentist confidence using the actual numbers contained in the interval. So say I have coefficient from a regression $\beta = 3.4$ with $CI = [0.5, 5.6]$ Bayesian Credible Interval If the CI were a Bayesian Credible interval reporting this interval is quite straightforward: "Given the data and the assumptions of the model, there is a 95% probability that the true value of $\beta$ lies between 0.5 and 5.6" Frequentist Confidence Interval Now as we know when the interval is a confidence interval reporting it properly is more tricky. Based on what I've read I would hazard "If we ran many experiments 95% of the 95% intervals constructed would contain the true value of $\beta$ " What confuses me is that the actual numbers in the CI do not appear in this interpretation. How do I work either the mean or CI into my reporting of the effect while staying faithful to the frequentist view of probability?
