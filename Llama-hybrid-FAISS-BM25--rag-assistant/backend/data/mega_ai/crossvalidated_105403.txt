How can root mean square error be used to predict logistic regression model accuracy?

The problem which I have at hand consists of a logistic regression model for risk evaluation that has been made on some credit card data of Quarter-1'12 (Jan'12 - Mar'12). Now I use the same model to evaluate risk for the data of Quarter-2'12(Apr'12-Jun'12). I want to devise an accuracy score that gives an insight into how "accurately" my model fits the new data (Quarter -2 data). I have used Hosmer Lemeshow Statistic and Balanced Accuracy Method till now but none served the purpose. What further can be done in this regard?
