How to disable mouse gestures as a developer?

I'm developing a web application and I noticed how irritating mouse gestures can be on it, so, is there a way to disable them (Firefox and Opera particularly)? Edit: It seems there is some confusion. I'm developing a web based software that has an interface with such complex actions and tasks such as mouse selections, file drag and dropping, a desktop and a Windows Explorer -style filesystem. Whenever I try to select multiple virtual files and move them around, mouse gestures will apply and take me away from the software and navigate to the previous page or do something else nasty. My project is not a website, it's a web application -- mouse gestures are poison to this project.
