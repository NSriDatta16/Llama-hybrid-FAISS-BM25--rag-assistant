fastest bidirectional java prolog implementation

I am trying to use a a java-prolog layer on top of my current agent-based simulation. I am running Mac OS X Snow Leopard and Netbeans 6.9 and tried to use JPL from swi-prolog however I haven't managed to run a test successfully due to problems with the libraries and their paths. I need a very fast implementation and I was wondering if anyone has any benchmarks or personal experience with bidirectional java-prolog interfaces.
