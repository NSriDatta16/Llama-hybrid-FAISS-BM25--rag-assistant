Survey weights are used when data are collected according to a probability sampling design with unequal probabilities of selection and/or response. In survey sampling, the inferential goal is to generalize from the sample to the finite population. The original motivation for survey weights comes from Horvitz-Thompson estimator of the population total: $$ t[y] = \sum_{i \in \mbox{units in sample}} \frac{y_i}{\pi_i} $$ where $\pi_i$ is the probability of selection. In this expression, $1/\pi_i$ can be interpreted as a weight attached to unit $i$, $w_i=\pi_i^{-1}$. In practice, survey weights also include corrections for nonresponse, lack of population coverage, and other corrections for imbalance between the sample and the population.
