WebDeploy 2.0 component on IIS7 - drive root permissions

I have installed and configured MS WebDeploy 2.0 on a (test) server so that WebMatrix and Visual Studio 2010 users can use this to upload their applications to our Windows 2008R2 environments. This works well with WebMatrix but I encountered a problem deploying an application from Visual Studio 2010. If I click publish and use the WebDeploy method, Visual Studio reports an error and nothing gets published: So I turned on Failed Request Tracing for the Web Management Service and I see this: 53 AspNetModuleDiagErrorEvent Uri /MsDeploy.axd eventData Tracing deployment agent exception. Request ID ''. Request Timestamp: '01/22/2011 00:18:54'. Error Details: System.UnauthorizedAccessException: Access to the path 'd:\' is denied. at System.IO.__Error.WinIOError(Int32 errorCode, String maybeFullPath) at System.IO.DriveInfo.get_DriveFormat() To facilitate use of the WebDeploy feature the site's delegated management user is granted Full Control of a site's web folders. This is covered in this article: Configure the Web Deploy Component on the Web Server No other permissions are mentioned. Given the nature of the error I tried giving the site's delegated management user Read Attribute permission on D:\ and limited it to This Folder Only and immediately Visual Studio 2010 is able to publish the application using WebDeploy. Do I really need to assign read permissions to the root of the drive where a website is hosted to get Web Deploy 2.0 to work with Visual Studio 2010?
