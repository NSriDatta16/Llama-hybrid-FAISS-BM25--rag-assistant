Dividing up Training Data into Test Set

Suppose we have a training data set. We want to learn some hypothesis using some algorithm. Would we divide up the training set differently if we used, for example, logistic regression as opposed to support vector machines? So if we divide the training data set into: $70 \%$ in-sample data and $30 \%$ out-of-sample data, would this hold if we used logistic regression or support vector machines?
