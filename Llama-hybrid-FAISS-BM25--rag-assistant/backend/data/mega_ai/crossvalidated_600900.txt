Existence of the optimal control in finite horizon MDP

For infinite horizon MDP with finite state and action space, there exists an optimal (stationary) policy. For finite horizon MDP with finite state and action space, does there exist an optimal policy? If so, are there any assumptions? Is the optimal policy non-stationary?
