Based on your comments to tvanfosson, it sounds like MVC would be a good choice for you as you listed your desire to learn as a reason to choose that technology. I doubt MVC will change drastically from its beta. So, this could be a good opportunity to learn a new tool. As for as WebForms being the "quick and nasty" solutions, I worry that is MVC propaganda.
