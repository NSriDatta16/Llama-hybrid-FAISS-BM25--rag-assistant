Thanks Everyone. We use database for client storage. UUID seems more reliable and is useful for logged in customers; But, CFID & CFTOKEN might help in the case where customer chooses 'checkout without crating an account' option. Which one do you think is the best solution in both the cases? Please see both the scenarios below. "For users who are logged in, the cart items will be stored in table 'CartTemp'. For customer who choose 'checkout without crating an account', the cart items will be stored in a structure client.Cart."
