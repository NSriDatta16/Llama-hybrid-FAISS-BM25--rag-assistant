Issue with using a .net class in ironpython

If I have a .Net class that is not part of any namespace then I'm not able to use it in ironpython. Here is an example Suppose I have a assembly FooLib.dll with the following class definition //note the following class is not part of global namespace public class Foo { } Now I try to use it in ironpython clr.AddReference("FooLib") # This call succeeds. f = Foo() The line f= Foo() returns the error Traceback (most recent call last): File "", line 1, in NameError: name 'Foo' is not defined I tried the following from FooLib import * f = Foo() The line from FooLib import * reports an error which does make sense as the from clause should be used on namespaces and not assemblies However, If the class Foo belong to some namespace, then i don't have a problem importing in ironpython So, my query is how do I use a .net class belonging to a global namespace from ironpython regards Ganesh
