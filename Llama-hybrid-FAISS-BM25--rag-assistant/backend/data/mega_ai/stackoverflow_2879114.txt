3 quick choices... (Make sure the class implements INotifyPropertyChanged, and FileName is raising this event.) You can simply pull the VM out of the View's DataContext and during the Drag-and-Drop event set the FileName property of the ViewModel. Use an AttachedBehavior to allow the Event (Drag-and-Drop) to be used like a Command ( Link ) Use a Messenger pattern, like MVVMLight's Messenger, to send a Message from the View to the ViewModel and handle the Message on the VM like you would a Command Action.
