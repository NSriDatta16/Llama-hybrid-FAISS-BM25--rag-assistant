How do I organize imports in Compass/Blueprint?

I have researched SASS and Blueprint seperately, and think I understand how they work, and I have set up my project directory using the compass CLI tool, but I am at a loss as to the correct way to organize my project. After initializing my project with $ compass create my_project --using blueprint/semantic ...I was told to link the generated CSS files in my HTML with these lines ...but where should I put my own application-specific .scss files and how should I include the appropriate blueprint files? It seems to me that I should not be including the generated print.css and screen.css directly into my HTML but instead doing something like: @import "screen"; body { @include container; } ...and then using only the file generated from the above in my HTML. Otherwise why would we have a line like this in screen.scss ?: // Import all the default blueprint modules so that we can access their mixins. @import "blueprint"; I can't use mixins in my HTML. I'm finding the docs to be very vague and contradictory, and any sort of short example illustrating the combination of: HTML SCSS files generated from compass command above SCSS files containing site-specific styling would be very helpful for me and probably others.
