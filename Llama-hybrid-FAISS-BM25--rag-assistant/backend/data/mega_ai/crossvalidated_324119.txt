Elimination of Trend and Seasonality Using Classical Decomposition Model

Brockwell and Davis (2016, page 26) have illustrated the classical decomposition model for elimination of trend and seasonality. the assumptions for this model are: $X_{t} = m_{t} + s_{t} + Y_{t}, t = 1, 2, ...., n,$ where $EY_{t} = 0 (ASM.1), S_{t+d} = S_{t}(ASM.2)$, and $\sum_{j=1}^ds_{j} = 0(ASM.3)$ In the second step, they have illustrated how they removed seasonality: The second step is to estimate the seasonal component. For each $k = 1,... , d$ we compute the average $w_{k}$ of the deviations ${(x_{k+jd} − \hat{m}_{k+jd}), q $\hat{s}_{k} = w_{k} − d^{-1}\sum_{i=1}^dw_{i}$, $k = 1,... , d, $ (1.5.13) and $\hat{s}_{k} = \hat{s}_{k}−d, k > d$ I am a bit confused with their notations: how shall I interpret the term $w_{k}$, is that single term or is it a summation? if it is the average of deviations , i.e $w_{k}=d^{-1}\sum_{k=1}^dw_{k}$ which implies that $k = i$ and therefore satisfies $ASM.3$ above? for example when $j=2$, $d=2$, $k=1$ then, $X_{k+jd} = X_{1+2\times2} = X_{5}$. if $j$ means year, $k$ means month, is this the correct indexing method? i.e. shouldn't the point in time for 2nd month in 2nd year be $X_{2+2} = X_{4}$? why do we need to have the condition of $q sincerely appreciate any guidance.
