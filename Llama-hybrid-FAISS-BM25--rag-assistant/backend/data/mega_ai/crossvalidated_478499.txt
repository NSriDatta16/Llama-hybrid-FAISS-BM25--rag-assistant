TL/DR--it's just about covariates Philosophical Introduction "Simpson's paradox" is not really a "paradox" in the sense of the barber's paradox or others. It is more like some of Zeno's paradoxes of motion where the paradox results from either not using all of the available information, or not fully understanding the problem. For instance, by using the concept of a rate , we know that Atalanta will reach her goal because she is walking at a constant rate. She reaches half way there in half the time, 3/4 of the way there in 3/4 of the time, 7/8 of the way in 7/8 of the time, and so on, and eventually gets there. You don't resolve Simpson's paradox. It's not a paradox. It's just the difference between doing the best you can with limited information vs. getting more information and using it appropriately. Simpson's Covariate Confounder Situation There is really no paradox. If you do not know the age of a subject, then actually you can do reasonably well predicting the score because there really is positive linear relationship between the two. At the very least, you can do a better job predicting the score than if you don't have any information, as your prediction in this case would simply be the overall average score. However, you can make better predictions if you include the additional covariate of group membership. You only screw up if you try to use the model made from one group on another group. So the lesson is about paying attention to confounders, specifically effect modifiers, not avoiding paradoxes.
