There are other options for serialization you could look at: Plain old HTTP - just encode information in the headers and body. You'll need to use a HTTPClient from ASP for this though. JSON - look at http://www.webdevbros.net/2007/04/26/generate-json-from-asp-datatypes/ for generating JSON from ASP datatypes On the Java side just use a Servlet, you can embed this in something like Jetty or Tomcat. There's a very simple example here: http://docs.codehaus.org/display/JETTY/Embedding+Jetty
