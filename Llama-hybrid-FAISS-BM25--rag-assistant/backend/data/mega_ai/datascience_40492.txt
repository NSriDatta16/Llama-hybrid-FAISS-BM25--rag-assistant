What is NLP technique to generalize manually created rules in text?

Let's say we have a free text containing key-value entities. Example: "... patient's tumour has width 6 cm and height 5 cm " Then an expert comes, marks it as important, thus we do have the rule for finding the same entity in new, different texts. What is the name of NLP technique that produces generalized rule, so that we are able to recognize also synonyms/variations with the same meaning? Example: "... patient with cancerous growth , 60 x 50 mm " I need to to learn terminology to be able to search for papers. If you could add also some references to state-of-art approaches, would be great.
