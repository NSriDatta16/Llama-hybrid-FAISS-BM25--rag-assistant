Don't. How would you like it if you went to your friend's myspace page and your cursor suddenly turned into a big purple dragon and you had no idea where it was actually pointing. It's jarring to the user, therefore irritation. If you want to let them know something is working in the background use an animated gif displayed over the page, not as the cursor. If you have too, you may be able to set it with javascript on all your the elements on the page. I don't think it cascades. If it does, just set it on body and be done with it.
