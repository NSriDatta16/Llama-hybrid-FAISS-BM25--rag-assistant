I didn't know where to add this but I figured posting it as an answer is better because it sorts what I was trying to do. What I did is adding a new 'Image' property (of type BitmapImage) for the CustomLayer class; so the thumbnail is now actually part of the CustomLayer object. The new constructor in the CustomLayer class now looks like this: Public Sub New(ByVal filename As String) Dim info As New FileInfo(filename) Name = info.Name Path = info.DirectoryName Dim bi As New BitmapImage() bi.BeginInit() bi.DecodePixelWidth = 60 bi.CacheOption = BitmapCacheOption.OnLoad bi.UriSource = New Uri(FullPath) bi.EndInit() Image = bi End Sub Also, inside the ItemTemplate of the ComboBox, the following line: changed to this: Now the actual creation of the thumbnails happens while the Window is loading, and when the user clicks the combobox the first time, it loads pretty quickly! Now to figure out how I can use BackgroundWorker(s) to create all four collections at the same time rather than make them one after the other to improve loading time.
