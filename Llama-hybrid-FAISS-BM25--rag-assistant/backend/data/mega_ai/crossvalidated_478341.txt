Basically any method text classification can be applied here. If you want to stick with classical MT methods, you can try: Different model (logistic regression, SVM), Feature engineering (e.g., replacing all phone numbers with a special token, removing stop words, in case of discriminative models, you can weight the input with TF-IDF scores, including n-gram features), Word embeddings (such as GloVe or FastText) as an input of a discriminative model. If you do not care about the inference time, you can try some neural models. 7k messages should be enough to train a small LSTM classifier and definitely enough to fine-tune BERT or RoBERTa.
