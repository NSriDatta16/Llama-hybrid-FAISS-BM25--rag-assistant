This is usually done by carefully choosing two things: The sentence representation. Word count is the most simple option but there can be many others: TFIDF weights, with/without removing stop words, with/without lemmatization, etc. In a DL approach the sentence would be represented as a sentence embedding. The similarity measure between two sentences. Again there are many options, in BoW approaches the standard ones would include counting words in common (e.g. Jaccard) and cosine TFIDF. So the answer is: it depends on the similarity score. A complex similarity score like cosine TFIDF rarely produces ties so the highest score can be selected. More simple methods give ties, and then the logical answer is to return all the tied sentences.
