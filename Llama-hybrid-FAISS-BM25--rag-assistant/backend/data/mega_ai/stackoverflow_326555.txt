I wrote PNUnit as an extension for NUnit almost three years ago and I'm happy to see it was finally integrated into NUnit. We use it on a daily basis to test our software under different distros and combinations. Just to give an example: we've a test suite of heavy tests (long ones) with about 210 tests. Each of them sets up a server and runs a client in command line running several operations (up to 210 scenarios). Well, we use the same suite to run the tests on different Linux combinations and windows variations, and also combined ones like a windows server with a linux client, windows xp, vista, then domain controller, out of domain, and so on. We use the same binaries and then just have "agents" launched at several boxes. We use the same platform for: balancing load test load -> I mean, running in chunks faster. Running several combinations at the same time, and what I think is more interesting: defining multi client scenarios: two clients wait for the server to start up, then launch operations, synch with each other and so on. We also use PNUnit for load testing (hundreds of boxes against a single server). So, if you have any questions about how to set it up (which is not simple yet, I'm afraid), don't hesitate to ask. Also I wrote an article long ago about it at DDJ: http://www.ddj.com/architect/193104810 Hope it helps
