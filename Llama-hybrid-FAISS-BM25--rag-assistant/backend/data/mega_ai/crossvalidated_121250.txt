How to define samples in caret package?

I am using the caret package and need to train a random forest, where only certain samples should be in the held-out set. I want to define the sampling for each tree in the random forest, for say 100 tress. How can I do this? What does the number of re-sample iteration even mean (is it the same as the number of trees)? I have tried the following but for some reason it is taking an unusual long time to train, so I am not certain whether it is correct or not: library(caret) temp.resample_in
