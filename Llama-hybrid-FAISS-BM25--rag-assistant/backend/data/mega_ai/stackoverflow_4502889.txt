I feel like a lot of folks get swept up in the "best practice wave" where it's always best to go by what the elite programmers say. Here's my opinion: If it works and it's pretty elegant, go with it. As long as your solution isn't "hackish" and will scale as the volume of usage your app sees increases, whatever you come up with is fine. In terms of which will be most maintainable, you've got two fundamentally different views: grid and list. If you assume that you're going to need two separate chunks of HTML for each, as long as you're not duplicating code up and down, then it's fine. If you do see that you're duplicating a lot of code, make a private function in PersonDisplay and centralize the logic there. Frankly, it seems like this bit of code isn't going to grow much farther past, say, a thousand lines of code (max). Use some common sense and take a reality check every now and then. If you see that you're creating too many functions, merge some functions. If you're writing duplicate code, move that code out into a separate function. You really can't screw this one up too much. As the saying goes, "don't sweat the small stuff." You can afford to have marginally imperfect code every now and then.
