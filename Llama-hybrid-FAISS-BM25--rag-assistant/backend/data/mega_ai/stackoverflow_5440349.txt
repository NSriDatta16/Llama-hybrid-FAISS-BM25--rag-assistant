I think these are your options. 1) NSUserDefaults If you just want to store a single array information you can use NSUserDefaults one of the easiest method of storing data.A good tutorial here . PS : Never use NSUserDefault for saving sensitive information, like login credentials. For that use KeyChain services .A simple tutorial explaining the usage here . 2) Core Data If you have a large set of data and looking for a database style storage, then you should look at core data. Core data is a high level API written over lower SQLite concepts and is very good. A good tutorial here and here 3) SQLite If you want to use database using old fashioned way (writing queries) you can use sqlite directly on iPhone. You could get good information from here , here and from this SO question .
