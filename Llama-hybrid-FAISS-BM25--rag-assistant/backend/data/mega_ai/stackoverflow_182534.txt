How long does it take to become reasonably proficient in Oracle given SQL Server

In applying for jobs via agents I sometimes get blocked by an agent who says do you know software package X. When I reply that I know the similar package Y they might say unless you know X I cannot put you forward. The problem is that some of these agents don't know what they talking about, they are merely being used by their clients as a screening filter. It would be useful to be able to say to these agents that because I know Y I can expect to become reasonably proficient in X in a given number of days/months. However not knowing X determining the required time is why I'm asking this question. Most recently X was Oracle and Y was SQL Server. Please can those of you who know both, express an opinion on how long is required to become reasonably proficient? NB I'm not talking about becoming a DBA!
