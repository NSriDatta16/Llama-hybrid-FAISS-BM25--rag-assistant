The question you raise is quite important. WE have implemented the CHOW Test for constancy of parameters in order to test the hypothesis that the parameters haven't changed significantly at one or more points in time. If we detect a significant change then we can then use the most recent data set to develop a new model. This test requires ( at least for us who know time series ) that any anamolous data points have been rectified/corrected via Intervention Detection procedures ( see R. Tsay's work ). If you want to pursue this topic please feel free to contact me off line and I will try and help you.
