Ran into this problem too, the only option for missing case deletion in logistic regression is listwise. It is very weird that its not an option, there are certainly cases where pairwise deletion is appropriate (e.g. ipsative data) I recommend switching to R Its a steep learning curve but well worth it for the degree of control, particularly if youre working with large datasets
