What do the features in this neural network simulator mean?

While learning about neural networks, I stumbled upon this really cool resource where you can tinker around with NN's architecture and hyperparameters in a point classification problem. What I'm confused about is the meaning of the input layer which they call the "features." Since the data is just points, I would assume there could only be two features: the X value and the Y value of each point. My question: What do their features mean and why aren't they just using the (X,Y) coordinates of the points as the input data? Are they perhaps transforming the (X,Y) values into these other features? If so, what are the actual numerical values they are getting transformed into?
