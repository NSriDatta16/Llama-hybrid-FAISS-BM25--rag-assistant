Random Forest train-test gap in metrics

I am training a random forest classifier on a dataset with 5000 values, and obtain much better values for the train than the test set, but the test set values are still satisfactory. Doing an extensive hyperparameter search and trying recursive feature elimination indicates that it is impossible to reduce the train -test gap without drastically hurting the test performance. So by conventional measures (train vs test performance) the random forest is overfitting horribly. But everyone seems to think that random forests don't overfit. I am aware that some people say the training performance is not a meaningful metric (see answer to Random forest is overfitting? ). But this argument should apply equally well to any machine learning model. And for most of them, a large train-test gap is a good indication of overfitting. Is there a conceptual explanation for how the random forest is able to get unrealistically good performance on the train set without harming its prediction on the test set?
