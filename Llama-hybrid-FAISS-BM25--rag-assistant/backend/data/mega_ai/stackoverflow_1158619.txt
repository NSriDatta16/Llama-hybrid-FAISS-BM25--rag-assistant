searching for php "supplied argument is not a valid mysql result resource" reveals that to get the actual error, you'd need to call mysql_error, and the error that you get is because the result of the query is FALSE - this value not being a valid mysql result resource. i.e. in short you have something like: $res = FALSE; # should contain the mysql result but does not, due to error. $cfg = htmlspecialchars(mysql_result($res,0)); # the attempt to call mysql_result on invalid argument errors out. So you'd want to use something like this: $query = "SELECT * FROM cats WHERE id=$id"; $qr1 = mysql_query ($query) or die ("Query failed: " . mysql_error() . " Actual query: " . $query); You might want to give this a shot and see what the underlying error message says. Given that the error is "MySQL server has gone away", There can be multitude of reasons for it - this article would be a good start to investigate. Searching suggests also some php-related and stack-specific bugs, so it looks like you might need to debug it with a closer attention. Maybe try to duplicate the setup on another box and then start experimenting with the versions/settings, and see if any of the already reported scenarios match your case. Unfortunately, seems there's no single simple answer to this.
