Portable periodic timer for period around 100ms

Hej! I am looking for a portable way of periodically dispatching a task in a C++ project. The use of libraries such as boost should be avoided in this particular project. The resolution requirement is not too serious: between 5Hz to 20Hz on an average Netbook. The project uses OpenGL to render the HMI but since I am working on the backend part I am not too familiar with it. Thanks your any advice or suggestions, Arne EDIT: What our 'Task' class actually does is creating a thread using either CreateThread(..) for windows or pthread_create(..) for linux.
