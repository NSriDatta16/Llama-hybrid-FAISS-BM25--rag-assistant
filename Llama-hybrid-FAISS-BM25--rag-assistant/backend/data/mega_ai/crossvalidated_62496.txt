Testing for population similarity on non-parametric data

I'm looking at similarity of samples for non-ordinal/non-parametric data. I've included a dummy dataset below for reference in the question. Neither A, B, or C is ordinal data: it's entirely categorical. Where C is filled in, it shows a Pareto distribution. The actual dataset is large and a very small subset of the population has C's data filled in ( Phrased another way: "Do id's who have a marked C behave the same way in relation to (either/and A, B) as id's who don't have a marked C". And, "do id's who have a marked C behave the same way (as indicated by A,B) as the entire set of id's?" My readings[1] indicate that what I am looking for is Pearson's Chi-squared test, as I will be testing a non-parameteric dataset against another dataset (in this case, the same dataset in itself); there is no average/stddev meaningful for A,B, or C. [1] I'm boning up on analytics stats on the fly; this isn't my area of expertise. id A B C 1 0 1 a 2 0 0 a 3 0 1 a 4 0 0 a 5 0 1 a 6 1 0 a 7 1 1 a 8 1 0 a 9 1 1 a 10 1 0 b 11 0 1 b 12 0 0 b 13 0 1 b 14 0 0 c 15 1 1 c 16 1 0 c 17 1 1 d 18 1 0 e 19 0 1 f 20 0 0 g 21 0 1 null 22 0 1 null ... null C's continue on for a long time.
