cannot rebase: you have unstaged changes git

I am on a branch named new_nlp and when I do a git status, I get the following: # On branch new_nlp # Changed but not updated: # (use "git add/rm ..." to update what will be committed) # (use "git checkout -- ..." to discard changes in working directory) # # deleted: untitled. I cannot see this file untitled as it is deleted. I want to switch to master and perform a rebase from new_nlp but when I checkout master and issue the command: git rebase new_nlp I get the following error message: cannot rebase: you have unstaged changes D untitled. I cannot see this file and I have no idea how to delete it. I have no idea how it got added. Does anyone know how I can get past this road block. I have no idea why the file remains in the index.
