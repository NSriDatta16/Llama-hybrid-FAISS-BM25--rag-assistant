Implementing a HomeScreen-like horizontally scrollable widget?

Most Android devices feature a home screen which you can scroll horizontally by dragging (there're others that have a grid-like 2d scrolling feature too, but I'm only interested in horizontal scrolling). Could someone shed some light for me on how this might be achieved? First I was thinking about using a custom ViewFlipper. I could attach proper sliding animations for it, but it's not exactly the same thing. On the home screen, the "amount of sliding" depends on how far you've dragged your finger on the screen. Animations are fire-and-forget things, I can't stop them midway. Any ideas? Here's a video about the desired behaviour: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGdWM2TQNSo&feature=player_detailpage#t=104s
