Migrating from Clearcase LT (UCM) to Subversion

I am sure this question has been asked hundreds of time and been responded equally. I am trying to get a clear picture of my effort before I embark on this. I want to know if SVNImporter or any other tool out there helps me migrate my UCM VOBs to Subversion repos. I dont mind losing some history. Also please share your strategies if there are no tools out there. I was told by someone that I would have to rebase my view with each baseline from oldest to the newest and incrementally commit that code into Subversion. While this seems to be plain and simple but considering the number of VOBs we have here, this would be a gigantic task for us to do manually. Is there any script out there that I can use to automate this process. Comments please!!! Thanks Gnan
