What is the difference between linear and non-linear regression?

In machine learning, I understand that Linear regression assumes that parameters or weights in equation should be linear. For Example: Y = W1*X1+W2*X2 is a linear equation where X1, X2 are feature variables and W1, W2 are parameters. also, Y = W1*(X1)^2 + W2*(X2)^2 is also linear as parameters (W1, W2) are linear with respect to Y. Now, I read some articles stating that in the equation like Y = Log(W1)*x1 + Log(W2)*x2 can also be made linear by considering other variables V1 and V2 as: V1 = Log(W1) V2 = Log(W2) thus, Y = V1*X1 + V2*X2 So, in this sense, any non-linear equation can be made linear then what is non-linear regression here. I think I am missing something important here. I am a beginner in the field of Machine Learning. Can somebody help me? PS - This is my first question here at StackOverflow so if there is an error in writing an effective question, please forgive me.
