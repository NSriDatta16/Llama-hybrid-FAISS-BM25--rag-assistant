Normal distribution_when most of the test show that it is not Normally distributed

I need to do PCA and Factor analysis. All of the authors of such study used normally distributed dataset for their study. But may Dataset of 173 samples with 17 variables show non-normal distribution. However, I have applied each of the square, square root, and Log transformation methods for the whole dataset but they do not show any reflection. Again, I applied these methods for each variable separately. But even after that most of the variables show non-normal distribution. Obviously, the data set has a bigger variation in the minimum and maximum values. Can anyone suggest what should I do in such cases? How can I normalize the dataset? Or is there any other way to do this? Thank you in advance.
