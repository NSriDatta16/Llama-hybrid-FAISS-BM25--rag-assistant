As Greg mentioned it is still important today (perhaps more so in some ways) and compilers usually take care of the alignment based on the target of the architecture. In managed environments, the JIT compiler can optimize the alignment based on the runtime architecture. You may see pragma directives (in C/C++) that change the alignment. This should only be used when very specific alignment is required. // For example, this changes the pack to 2 byte alignment. #pragma pack(2)
