You don't close an Android application. Leave that to the operating system. Processes stay active (although dormant) until the OS decides it needs more resources. Please don't try to outsmart that. Some apps do, and they suck. I don't understand what you mean with "the application still responds to the incoming SMS" - do you have a broadcast receiver? If so, the receiver is always active. This is by design. If you don't want it to run, store a flag somewhere ( SharedPreferences , for example) and set that to false whenever you want the broadcast receiver to ignore a broadcast. EDIT: This is actually a dupe. Check this answer for a more elegant solution: Set BroadcastReceiver to be inactive
