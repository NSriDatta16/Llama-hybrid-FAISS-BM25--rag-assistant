predict continuous variable over time for each row

I have many items with a start date, which produce continuous outputs over time for a few months after the start date. These outputs often follow a decay function but not always. So it is a bit like a survival analysis problem. But rather than predicting a probability over time I need to predict a continuous value over time (resolution month). Which (machine learning) modelling could I use for this please? Thanks!
