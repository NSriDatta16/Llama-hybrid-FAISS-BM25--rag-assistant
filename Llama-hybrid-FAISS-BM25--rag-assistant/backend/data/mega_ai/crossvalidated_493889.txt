Which of these descriptions match one-way ANOVA, factorial ANOVA, logistic regression (from a tutorial)

I've tried about 10 combinations of this, and none of them are correct. This is from an online tutorial hosted by a university. This is not graded. The interactive graphic associated with this only says whether your entire selection of choices is correct or not. (So I don't know what's wrong.) For 1-6, match with A-G. A-G can only be used once. (I reordered the items in graphic so they align with my answers, I didn't use G. I have 1: A, 2: B, 3: C, 4: D, 5: E, 6: F.) QUESTIONS Three-level factor moderated by two-level factor, continuous target. Three-level factor, interval target. Continuous independent variable, binary target. Two independent variables which are interval, continuous target. There is curvilinear relationship between two continuous variables. There is an interaction effect between two two-level factors, continuous target. ANSWERS A. Factorial ANOVA, with post-hocs. B. One-way ANOVA, no post-hocs. C. Logistic regression. D. Linear regression. E. None of the choices. F. Factorial ANOVA, without post-hocs. G. One-way ANOVA, with post-hocs.
