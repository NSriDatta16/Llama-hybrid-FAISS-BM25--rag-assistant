The zero-inflated negative binomial model accounts for "extra" zeros in over-dispersed count outcomes. In particular, it has two components, a negative binomial model and a logistic regression for the extra zeros. The syntax you used above translates to the following specific model, $$\left \{ \begin{array}{rcl} \log \{E(\texttt{violent_events}_{ij}) \} & = & \beta_0 + \beta_1 \texttt{sproject_sum}_{ij} + \beta_2 \texttt{gdp}_{ij} + \beta_3 \texttt{population_size}_{ij}\\&& + \beta_4 \texttt{education}_{ij} + b_{i0} + b_{i1} \texttt{time}_{ij}\\&&\\ \Pr\{\mbox{extra } \texttt{violent_events}_{ij} = 0\} & = & \gamma_0 + \gamma_1 \texttt{district_id}_{ij} \end{array} \right.$$ Some notes: The term $E(\texttt{violent_events}_{ij})$ denotes the average of the violent_events variable. When violent_events is zero, then this may be a zero from the negative binomial model or an extra zero with a probability specified by the logistic regression model. In the above specification, I do not know if some of the covariates you have are factors with multiple levels (e.g., district_id ). In this case, their specification expands to multiple coefficients using treatment contrasts. In the output, you get the estimated fixed-effects coefficients $\beta_0, \ldots, \beta_4$ , and $\gamma_0, \gamma_1$ reported separately. In the syntax, you need to include a ~ before the time variable in the specification of the random argument, i.e., random = ~ time | district_id Given that district_id is a grouping variable, you would need to put a random effect for it in the logistic regression part, i.e., zi_random = ~ 1 | district_id , and most probably you do not want to include it as a fixed effect, i.e., zi_fixed = ~ 1 . If you do that, then in the equation above, you will have an extra random effect $u_i$ in the logistic regression part, and the random effects $b_{0i}$ , $b_{1i}$ , and $u_{i}$ will be assumed to be correlated.
