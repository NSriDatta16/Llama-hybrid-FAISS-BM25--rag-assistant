I'd recommend PHPMailer, though I'm biased as I'm a maintainer. There are plenty of others though - SwiftMailer, Zend_Mail, eZ components, Alexandria and more. Swiftmailer is very elegant, Zend has great integration with the rest of their framework, eZc is fantastic if you need complicated MIME structures (e.g. for iCal, nested attachments etc), Alexandria has async sending (as does PHPMailer in svn right now).
