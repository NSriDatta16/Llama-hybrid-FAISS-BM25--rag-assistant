Simply loop the array of objects into a new array with the key being the category: $newArray = array(); foreach($array as $entity) { if(!isset($newArray[$entity->category])) { $newArray[$entity->category] = array(); } $newArray[$entity->category][] = $entity; } Is this what you was looking for ? Explanation of the code: /* * Create a new blank array, to store the organized data in. */ $newArray = array(); /* * Start looping your original dataset */ foreach($array as $entity) { /* * If the key in the new array does not exists, set it to a blank array. */ if(!isset($newArray[$entity->category])) { $newArray[$entity->category] = array(); } /* * Add a new item to the array, making shore it falls into the correct category / key */ $newArray[$entity->category][] = $entity; }
