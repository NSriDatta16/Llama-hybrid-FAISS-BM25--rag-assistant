Here's what I was trying to say in the comment, with a little bit more detail (though this might not be the answer to your question). First, get some data. x A plot with two columns would look something like this: par(mfrow = c(1,2)) plot(x) plot(y) with a graph like so: while a plot with two rows would look something like this: par(mfrow = c(2,1)) plot(x) plot(y) with a graph like so: And if you'd like to keep both series on the same axes then you could do like this: par(mfrow = c(1,1)) ts.plot(x, y) which would look something like this: I was trying to communicate that if you make the plot wider rather than taller then it helps to see what's happening inside the lengthy time series better. You can manually resize the graphics device to get the aspect you like, or if you use RStudio , when you export the image you can set whatever dimensions desired.
