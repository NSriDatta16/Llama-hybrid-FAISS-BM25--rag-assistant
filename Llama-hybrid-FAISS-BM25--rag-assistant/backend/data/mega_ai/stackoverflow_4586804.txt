Even if the destination is online, there is no guarantee, the UDP packet will arrive, arrive in the order sent, or not be fragmented. (I believe packets smaller than 532 bytes will not be fragmented) It is possible to have all three; fragmented, out of order and incomplete for the same packet. The simplicity and stability of your network will determine how robust UDP packet delivery is, but you have to assume it is unreliable at least some of the time. All you can do is minimise the loss. It is up to you to decide what to do if a packet is lost and how to detect it. If you want broadcast, reliable delivery of messages I suggest you look at JMS Topics or Queues, like ActiveMQ.
