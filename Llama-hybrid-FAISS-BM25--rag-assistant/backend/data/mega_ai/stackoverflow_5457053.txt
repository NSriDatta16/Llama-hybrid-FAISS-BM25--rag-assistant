There is no such a thing as a language-independent stemmer. In fact, whether stemming improves retrieval performance varies per language. The best you can do is language guessing on the documents and queries, then dispatch to the appropriate analyzer/stemmer. Language guessing on short queries is hard , though (as in state-of-the-art, not quick 'n' dirty). If your queries are short, you might want use a simple whitespace analyzer on the queries and not stem anything.
