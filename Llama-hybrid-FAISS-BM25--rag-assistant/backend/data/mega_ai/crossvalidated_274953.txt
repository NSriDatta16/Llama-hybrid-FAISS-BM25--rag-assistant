Constructing a transition probability from Q-learning

In Reinforcement learning, learning without the need for the transition probability matrix is 'model free learning'. Instead of having the transition probabilities, we learn the q-values (state/action functions), eventually getting the optimal strategy. Why there is no transition probability in Q-Learning (reinforcement learning)? Is it possible at all to make a transition probability matrix using the normalized Q values?
