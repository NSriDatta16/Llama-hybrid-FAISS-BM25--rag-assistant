You can write your own version of GetGlobalResourceObject to embed the exception handling and logging in that: public static Object MyGetGlobalResourceObject (string classKey, string resourceKey) { try { return GetGlobalResourceObject (classKey, resourceKey); } catch (MissingManifestResourceException ex) { // log error return null; } } This code is provided as an starting point You could even write it as an extension method on HttpContext . You will have to do a global search and replace to call this rather than the base method, which isn't the most elegant solution, but it will work.
