Per section 5.2.2 paragraph 5, when an argument to a function is of const reference type, a temporary variable is automatically introduced if needed. In your example, the rvalue result of X(99) has to be put into a temporary variable so that that variable can be passed by const reference to implicit_conversion_func .
