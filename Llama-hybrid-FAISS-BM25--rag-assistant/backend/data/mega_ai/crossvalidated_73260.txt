Why is the Dirichlet Process unsuitable for applications in Bayesian nonparametrics?

The discrete nature of the DP makes it unsuitable for general applications in Bayesian nonparametrics, but it is well suited for the problem of placing priors on mixture components in mixture modeling. This quote is from Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes (Teh, et al, (2006)$^{[1]}$) and I was looking for an explanation about what it means. Bayesian nonparametrics seems to be too vague a term for me to understand what the author is referring to. ${[1]}$ Teh, Y. W., Jordan, M. I., Beal, M. J., Blei, D. M.
