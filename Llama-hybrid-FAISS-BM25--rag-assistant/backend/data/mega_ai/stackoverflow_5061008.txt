why does this application delegate code work

Just starting up with iPhone development. I'm not sure why this code works. I've created a new UI controller, then added it's details to the application delegate *.h file and the *.m file, also then connected things up in IB. Things work when I run it, so that I do actually see my new view from the controller I added... However I see in the didFinishLaunchingWithOptions method in the application delegate I never actually created my controller? (i.e. alloc'ed it / created the object). How come things actually work? (A) *.m #import "windowsBasedAppDelegate.h" #import "gregsController.h" @implementation windowsBasedAppDelegate @synthesize window; @synthesize viewController; #pragma mark - #pragma mark Application lifecycle - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions { // Override point for customization after application launch. [self.window addSubview:viewController.view]; [self.window makeKeyAndVisible]; return YES; } (B) *.h #import @class gregsController; @interface windowsBasedAppDelegate : NSObject { UIWindow *window; gregsController *viewController; } @property (nonatomic, retain) IBOutlet UIWindow *window; @property (nonatomic, retain) IBOutlet gregsController *viewController; @end thanks
