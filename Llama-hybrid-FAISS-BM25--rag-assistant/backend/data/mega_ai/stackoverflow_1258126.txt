How do I make a Multidimensional Array for large data storage in Obj-c?

I am fairly new at object oriented programming (but am starting to pick up fairly quickly), and am working on an application for the iphone. I need to make a multidimensional array, (10,000 or more rows, 8 columns) ordered as such:3 columns should contain boolean values, one should contain an integer, two need to hold GPS coordinates (usually have a decimal, like 62.422342), one needs to hold a 30 character string. is there an easy way to create such an array, and if so, to define the array elements prior to user interation?
