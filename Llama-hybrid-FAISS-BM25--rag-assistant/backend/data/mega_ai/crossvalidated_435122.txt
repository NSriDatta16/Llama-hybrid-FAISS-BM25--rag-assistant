Time Series: Generic Model for Multiple Time Series

I currently have a sample of 75 participants that were tracked for a period of 160 days. I want to build a multivariate time series model to predict the number of hours they will exercise on days 150-160 using the data from 1-149. The two predictors I have are (1) the number of hours they exercised per day and (2) high temperature for the day. Do I need to build a separate model for each person? Is there a proper way to combine the data to be able to build one consensus model for forecasting? Thank you. I am very new to time series data and forecasting. I hope my objective is clear.
