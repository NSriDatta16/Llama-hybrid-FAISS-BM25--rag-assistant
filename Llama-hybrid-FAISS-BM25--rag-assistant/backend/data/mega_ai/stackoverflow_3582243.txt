how to implement mvc pagination view

Could you show me please the best methode to make pager fpr my asp.net mvc view? I have a typical table with posts, and they will be all showed at one time. If I have a 30 entries, i will preffer to show just 6 at the time. It will greate if I will have something like a menu to navigate ( like 1 - 2 - 3 ). It can be server side navigation i suppose. Thanks a lot and take care, Ragims
