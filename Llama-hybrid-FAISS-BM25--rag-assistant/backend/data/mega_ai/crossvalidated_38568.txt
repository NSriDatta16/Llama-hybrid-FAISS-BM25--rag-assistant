Newey West standard errors give me more significance

I had a time series model with 5 time series variables and it's a model that's reputed in the literature for having autocorrelation problems. Why when I use standard OLS var-covar matrix only 2 variables are (highly) significant but with Newey West varcovar matrix 4 of the variables are (highly) significant (1% level)?
