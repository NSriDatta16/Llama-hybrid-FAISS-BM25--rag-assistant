to write a new file to a folder on a networked drive in OSX: var targetDir:File = new File("/Volumes/Data/SomeFolder"); targetDir.createDirectory(); // ensure directory exists, create if not var targetFile:File = targetDir.resolvePath("newFile.ext"); var fileStream:FileStream = new FileStream(); try { fileStream.open(targetFile, FileMode.WRITE); fileStream.writeBytes(byteArray); // or what/however you want to write fileStream.close(); } catch (e:Error) { trace(e); } i assume for Windows you would just swap the network drive path in the first line. you should not specify a protocol (e.g. file://, smb://, etc); the format of the parameter for the File constructor is the native path (as it would appear in a terminal / command shell). to get the path in OSX, use the Finder to navigate to the target networked folder. begin dragging the folder somewhere else, hit apple+space to open Spotlight, and continue dragging the folder into Spotlight. alternately, open a Terminal window and drag the folder into the Terminal window.
