In order to rapidly deploy any application, you'll need two targets; once for the engine your hosted mode deploys on {Firefox / Linux, Safari / Mac, IE6 / Win}, and one for your agile browser that lets you build css in real-time {Firefox + Firebug}. Linux: Mac: ...etc... This is GWT >= 1.6 ONLY! For older gwt projects, you must super-source the com/google/gwt/user/UserAgent.gwt.xml file... Put it in a source location that is included BEFORE your gwt-*.jar on the classpath. Basically, you can copy that file into a new one in the same package as the original, and edit the CDATA javascript block that returns the actual user.agent value. Play with this all you like, but don't go getting too crazy with their user.agent property, as it WILL be changing for ie8 in a future build. To target ie browsers, make up your own ie.version property, and tweak a copy of the property-provider in UserAgent.gwt.xml to target different versions of ie. Just make sure that when you use the custom property for deferred binding you do: Or you'll get ie7 + gecko/safari builds and other silly junk that will never be used. Note: Any code in a property-provider is loaded in the .nocache.js, and can be useful to preload images / css whilst the .cache.js payload is being downloaded. Just add var __cached = new Image('Url To Compiled Image / Whatever you want to load');
