I have a DAL in which i'm using Entity Framework, a business logic layer which consumes the objects returned by the DAL and an app layer. That is a perversion, given that you are putting a complete object layer into your DAL. EF is a lot more than a DAL. a business logic layer which consumes the objects returned by the DAL and an app layer. The term you may want to look up for that is "anemic object model", and it is not a nice term. Is there a more elegant approach to this? Don't fight EF. if you dont like it, don't use it - there are a LOT better frameworks around.
