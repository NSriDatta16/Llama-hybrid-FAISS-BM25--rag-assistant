From my read, I agree with you. I'm almost positive that what Manski meant to write is that under the considered assumption, $E[Y_A|Z=B] \leq E[Y_B|Z=B]$ and $E[Y_B|Z=A] \leq E[Y_A|Z=A]$ , and since the RHSs are identified by the data, you can upper bound the LHSs. You can then construct bounds on the average treatment effect by combining this information with the bounded outcome assumption.
