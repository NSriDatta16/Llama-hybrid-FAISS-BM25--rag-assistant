Your options appear to be:- (i) command line parameters on msiexec as per the other answer - fragile, not really an option if they are downloading and running it (ii) attempt to hack the MSI file to insert the ID - a hack (iii) launch MSBUILD to create a new MSI file on-demand on the server after modifying a copy of the WIX file to include their ID (iv) pre-generate lots of MSI files with random IDs (GUIDs perhaps) in them and then associate those IDs with user IDs at download time in your database. Now provide a lookup service to map the random ID in the MSI file with the real user ID so that the program when it runs can find the user ID (or have a custom action that does this). (v) create a custom action and use MsiGetProperty to get the filename of the installer - simply append the userID to the MSI file name - fragile hack
