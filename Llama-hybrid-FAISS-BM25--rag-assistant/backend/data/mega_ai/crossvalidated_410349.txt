Logistic regression - what is being predicted?

R has more than one way to create logistic regressions to predict binary outcomes. Here's the code that I'm using that is giving strange answers. library(ElemStatLearn) data(SAheart) set.seed(8484) train Now, I can use two different packages to generate the logistic regression. Here's the first. modFit4 and here's the second. modFit4.1 When I run a "predict" function on each I find that the first gives many different numerical values. These range from -3.44 to +2.88. The second gives only 0 and 1 values (which, assuming I understand correctly, is the best sort of output for a binomial classification). 1.a.) Why are they different? 1.b.) Are there default parameters that are different in one than in the other? 2.) Is there a generally preferred package for use in real-world regression applications?
