Using @font-face slows load time. Can I force the client to cache the font?

Update: Looks like the header request information is the culprit. How would I change the max-age property of the request header? TIA. Hi, I'm using @font-face on a website and i'm experiencing delayed loading of the text (presumably due to the loading of the font every page). I understand the client has to download the font once to display properly, but every page? Is there a way I can force the browser to cache that file? Or is there another alternative to speed up the font's loading time? (Is this a question more appropriate to post on Server Fault ?) Thanks in advance. Worst case, I'll live with the delay, so I don't need any "take off @font-face" answers... ;) Additional Information: I've tested this in both Safari (4) and Firefox (3.5RC1) on both Mac and Windows (XP and 7) All the browsers I've tested on are currently set up to allow caching (it's on by default) The URL is not dynamic, it's simply "/fonts/font.otf" The font URL is correct, as the page loads the font and displays it correctly, albeit slower then normal Request Header : Cache-Control:max-age=0 If-Modified-Since:Wed, 24 Jun 2009 03:46:28 GMT If-None-Match:W/"484d9f2-a5ac-46d10ff2ebcc0" Referer: http://testurl.com/ User-Agent:Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_6; en-us) AppleWebKit/530.13 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0 Safari/530.15 Response headers: Connection:Keep-Alive Date:Thu, 25 Jun 2009 02:21:31 GMT Etag:"484d9f2-a5ac-46d10ff2ebcc0" Keep-Alive:timeout=10, max=29 Server:Apache/2.2.11 (Unix) mod_ssl/2.2.11 OpenSSL/0.9.8i DAV/2 mod_auth_passthrough/2.1 mod_bwlimited/1.4 FrontPage/5.0.2.2635
