Firth's Logistic regression - how many covariates are possible in a small sample size?

I am undertaking a pilot project using the first 62 data points I have manged to collect. Currently I have 26 cases (disease positive) to 36 controls (disease free). I have used Firth's Logistic regression to examine the relationship between several radiographic independent variables and the disease*. I've selected Firth's in light of the small sample size. However, now I want to test the variables of interest by adjusting them for the usual things; age, gender, kidney function etc... How many covariates can I add to my model? If I am understanding this paper correctly, it would seem, I can add quite a few! But what would be 'best' practice here? Would it be better to try creating a series of 2 variable models, testing my IV of interest with one covariate at a time? Or load up the maximum ? **I am only looking to identify significant relationships between the disease and radiographic IVs. I'm less interested about getting the most precise effect estimates, its more about which IVs are significant and their direction. Edit: just thought I would add some output. Confidence intervals are very large! coef std err [0.025 0.975] p-value --------- --------- --------- --------- -------- ----------- X-ray3 1.62881 0.450813 0.839258 2.63676 0.000003 Intercept -0.197515 0.303736 -0.801548 0.392597 0.4985 Log-Likelihood: -29.5737 conf-interval: Odds ratio X-ray3 [2.31 - 13.96] [5.255] Intercept [0.44 - 1.481] coef std err [0.025 0.975] p-value --------- ---------- --------- ---------- --------- ----------- X-ray3 1.65909 0.459325 0.859825 2.70772 0.000002 Weight -0.0529905 0.0585941 -0.177383 0.0537212 0.334079 Age -0.0289818 0.0271007 -0.0833444 0.0217849 0.258607 Sex -0.302079 0.65731 -1.60463 0.950265 0.531984 Intercept 3.12534 2.44046 -1.36478 8.22448 0.170023 Log-Likelihood: -21.5074 conf-interval: Odds ratio X-ray3 [2.36 - 14.9] [5.255] Weight [0.83 - 1.05] [0.948] Age [0.92 - 1.02] [0.971] Sex [0.20 - 2.58] [0.739] Intercept [0.25 - 3,731.17] ```
