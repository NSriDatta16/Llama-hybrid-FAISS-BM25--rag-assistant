SET NAMES UTF-8 does no mean the data are stored in UTF-8. That means that data is RECIEVED in UTF-8 from client and is SERVED in UTF-8 to client. Storage encoding is set when you create a db/table/row, for example CREATE TABLE{ ... }CHARSET=utf8; or CREATE DATABASE DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 Read here: Mysql: latin1-> utf8. Convert characters to their multibyte equivalents 2 Lyon mysql goes just fine. Please check once more the encodings of the tables and rows via, for example, phpMyAdmin. Remember that setting encoding to database doesn't automatically change the encoding of tables. It's just used for a default value if table encoding is not specified
