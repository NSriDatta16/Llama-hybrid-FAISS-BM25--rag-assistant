If you just want retrieval by an integer key, then a simple hash table is fastest. If the integers are consecutive (or almost consecutive) and unique, then a simple array (of pointers to records) is even faster. If using a hash table, you want to pre-allocate the hashtable for the expected final size so it doesn't to rehash.
