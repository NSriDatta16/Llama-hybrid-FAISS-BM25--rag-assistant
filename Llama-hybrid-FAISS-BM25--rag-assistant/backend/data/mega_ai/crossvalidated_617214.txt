Bayesian reparametrization are they equivalent?

Suppose that we are in a Bayesian context, we we have the following matrix $n,$ $K\times K,$ as parameter, and we assume that $$n_{ij}\sim Pois(w*w_{ij})$$ where $w\sim Gamma(N+1,1)$ and $w_{ij}$ is another parameter which follows a dirichlet distribution. Can the following be seen as a different parametrization for $n_{ij}$ ? Since the average of $w$ is $N+1$ , and $\mathbb{E}[n_{ij}]=(N+1)w_{ij}$ then $$n_{ij}\sim Mult(N+1,w_{ij})$$
