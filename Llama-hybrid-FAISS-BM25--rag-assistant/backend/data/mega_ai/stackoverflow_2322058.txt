Preventing cell reordering for particular cells in iPhone SDK

I have 2 sections in my UITableView. I want the 2nd section to be movable but the 1st section of cells not. Specifying canEditRowAtIndexPath and canMoveRowAtIndexPath doesn't help - the first section cells although not showing drag controls, they still change places if a cell from the 2nd section is dragged over. Is there a workaround for this?
