Logistic regression with very uneven weight of dependent (dummy) variable

I am analyzing survey data (n=60, regarding their risk/return expectations, which is my dummy variable in the model, the problem is that 95% of the sample are located in one group of the dummy variable. I ran this multiple logit model, where i control for other risk/return expectations (ESG and Mrisk both dummy variables) as well as for gender (dummy), age (continuous) and education (dummy). Now can I use these results for an interpretation? if not what can I do to control for the dependent variables? Many thanks in advance!
