Probability distribution for sms answer delays

I'm writing an app using sms as communication. I have chosen to subscribe to an sms-gateway, which provides me with an API for doing so. The API has functions for sending as well as pulling new messages. It does however not have any kind of push functionality. In order to do my queries most efficient, I'm seeking data on how long time people wait before they answer a text message - as a probability function. Extra info: The application is interactive (as can be), so I suppose the times will be pretty similar to real life human-human communication. I don't believe differences in personal style will play a big impact on the right times and frequencies to query, so average data should be fine. Update I'm impressed and honered by the many great answers recieved. I have concluded that my best shot will be a few adaptable heuristics, including exponential (or maybe polynomial) backoff. All along I will be gathering statistics for later analysis. Maybe something will show up. I think I will cheat start on the algorithm for generating poll-frquenzies from a probability distribution. That'll be fun. Thanks again many times.
