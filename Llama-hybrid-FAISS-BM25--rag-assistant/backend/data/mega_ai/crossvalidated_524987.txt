Hierarchical structures: fixed effects estimations - how to choose which fixed effects to include?

How to choose cross-sectional units when estimating fixed effects? I have flight delays as the dependent variable and my data consists of 15 airlines, thus, multiple aircraft. Initially, I thought to use aircraft or carriers as cross-sectional units and thus consider the aircraft's/carriers' fixed effect. Both estimations gave similar results. However, I also tried to consider itineraries as cross-sectional units: the estimates were considerably larger. So I was wondering what I should stick to: carrier, airline, or itineraries fixed effect. Particularities of dataset: 15 airlines (average number of time periods: 10000), 4000 aircraft (average number of time periods: 175), and 25000 itineraries (average number of time periods: 5).
