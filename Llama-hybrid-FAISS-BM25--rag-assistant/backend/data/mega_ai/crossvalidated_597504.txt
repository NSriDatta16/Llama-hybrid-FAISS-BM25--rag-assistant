Why does icenReg or survival's "interval2" not accept event indicator?

In "normal" survival analysis that I'm familiar with (probably because they're very common), such as logistic regression, Cox PH, decision trees, the time to event analysis always includes an indicator of the outcome variable. How come there is no implementation of interval-censored analysis (at least in R) that takes the outcome variable into account? And why does the survival 's "interval2" not take the outcome indicator into account? How can one implement icenReg's methods to a dataset that looks like this? Should the right side of the interval be replaced by Inf when the event didn't take place? In my dataset, the event occurs only 1.3% of all rows- that means 98.7% of intervals will end with Inf- that is surely a huge loss of information? I feel like I'm missing something very important!
