If you have something declared like this: int list[10]; there is no way to "delete" it. It is either a global variable, with statically allocated storage, or it is a local variable with storage on the stack. I don't know exactly what you are trying to accomplish, but maybe something like this will help you figure it out: int *list = new int[10]; // allocate a new array of 10 ints delete [] list; // deallocate that array list = new int[9]; // allocate new array with 9 ints As you suggest in your question, you will almost always be better off using std::vector , std::list , and the like rather than using raw C-style arrays.
