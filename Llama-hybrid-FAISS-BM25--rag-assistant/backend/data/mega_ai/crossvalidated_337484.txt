I want to just add three things about credible intervals that are not in the excellent post by Isabella Ghement. The first is that credible intervals do not need to be connected, the second is that there are an infinite number of possible ones as is also true with confidence intervals, the third is that the confidence interval and the credible interval need not overlap each other. You could have a case where the credible interval is $\{(-3,-1);(5,7)\}$. There are two principal causes for this. The first is that there is an omitted variable in the model and the data is clustering around two masses. To imagine this case, consider a business whose customers behave differently on rainy days and sunny days but your model did not include weather. The effect of the weather could possibly be seen in the disjoint interval. The second source would be a statistical run, where your sample is not representative of the answer. The above case then highlights the difference between a Bayesian solution and a Frequentist solution. The Frequentist confidence interval could be $(1,4)$ because the Frequentist solution would average the two cases. This would be the case even if no data actually was in the interval itself. You can have a Frequentist solution with no representation of the parameter supported by the data. The Frequentist interval need not overlap the Bayesian one. Finally, there is no such thing as a unique credible or unique confidence interval. Any function that covers the parameter in $1-\alpha$ percent of the time is a valid $1-\alpha$ percent confidence interval. On the Bayesian side, any sum of the area that adds to $1-\alpha$ percent is a valid credible interval. Usually, the credible region reported is the highest density credible region or the HDR. As it is almost always the HDR, it should be reported as the HDR as there are cases, though exceedingly uncommon, where it could be something else.
