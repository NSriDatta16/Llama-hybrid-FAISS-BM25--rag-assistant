Stepping back a moment, I'm guessing from the setup that the actual question is something like: what might the effect of changing price be on how much people tend to like a product. You seem to be thinking of the retrospective question: what sort of price and type do products that people like have. Perhaps the first version is more helpful. Certainly it's not quite the same question (and the second shouldn't be used for price changing decisions). So, in the first formulation product ids are the units of analysis and customer ratings are combined ordinal responses to them. A reasonable analysis might therefore treat x4 as an ordinal variable multiply observed and regress it on x1-3. Ordinal logistic regression might be a good start. You can read about that a lot of places on the web, although the wikipedia page is pretty thin. Practically, if you are an R user the package ordinal is comprehensive, or there's the polr function in MASS. For Stata, Rodriguez's notes usually come with code . Not sure how to do it in SPSS...
