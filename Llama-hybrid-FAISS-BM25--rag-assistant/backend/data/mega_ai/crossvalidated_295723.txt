Is there a relationship between RKHS and mixtures?

Reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) (see here or here ) seem to involve conic combinations of "kernel functions" (my understanding is very crude). (See pp. 34-35 of Behrends , unfortunately the only version is in German; let me know if you find a better reference.) Meanwhile, mixtures of (continuous) probability distributions seem to involve convex combinations of their density functions. Question: Is there any meaningful relationship between the theory of RKHS and mixture distributions, e.g. by taking probability densities as the kernel functions and then using linear combinations (while noting that every convex combination is also a linear combination)? Pointers to references will suffice for answers -- I am aware that this question as written is vague, reflecting the vagueness of my idea.
