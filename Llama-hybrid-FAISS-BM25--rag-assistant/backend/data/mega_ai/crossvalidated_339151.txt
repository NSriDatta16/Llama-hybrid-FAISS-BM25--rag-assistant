The way I answer this question is that frequentists compare the data they see to what they expected. That is, they have a mental model on how frequent something should happen, and then see data and how often it did happen. i.e. how likely is the data they have seen given the model they chose. Bayesian people, on the other hand, combine their mental models. That is, they have a model based on their previous experiences that tells them what they think the data should look like, and then they combine this with the data they observe to settle upon some `` posterior'' belief. i.e., they find the probability the model they seek to choose is valid given the data they have observed.
