How to use General Additive Model to impute missing data?

I am new to GAMs and R. I have a long lists of time series of different lengths. Many of them are incomplete. I have fitted a GAM and use the predict.gam function(mgcv package in R) to each time series with the hope to impute the response variables for years without records (NA). Nonetheless, when I run the code predict(gamobject, type = "response"). I am only able to obtain predicted values for the non NA records. I am trying to follow Spooner at al. (2018)to impute data. Here is the code she is using: https://github.com/spoonerf/LPI_rapid_warming/blob/master/LPI_rapid_warming_code.Rmd Nonetheless, I am using a different dataset. Is there any way to extract the fitted values of the response variable from a GAM? I hope I have made clear my problem and thank you in advance for your time and efforts.
