Microsoft provides a pretty decent VB.Net example in a KB article " How to access serial and parallel ports by using Visual Basic .NET ". I'm not sure what your phone returns, however, if you change the buffer loop in the example, you can at least print out the reply: MSComm1.Output = "AT" & Chr(13) Console.WriteLine("Send the attention command to the modem.") Console.WriteLine("Wait for the data to come back to the serial port...") ' Make sure that the modem responds with "OK". ' Wait for the data to come back to the serial port. Do Buffer = Buffer & MSComm1.Input Console.WriteLine("Found: {0}", Buffer) Loop Until InStr(Buffer, "OK" & vbCrLf)
