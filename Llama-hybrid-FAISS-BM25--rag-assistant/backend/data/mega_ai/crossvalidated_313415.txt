This book is quite well-reviewed, and has a bunch of interesting marketing case studies. Rossi, Peter E., Greg M. Allenby, and Rob McCulloch. Bayesian statistics and marketing. John Wiley & Sons, 2012. Two interesting papers I liked on online advertising and marketing which are a bit more statistical were: Brodersen KH, Gallusser F, Koehler J, Remy N, Scott SL. Inferring causal impact using Bayesian structural time-series models. Annals of Applied Statistics, 2015, Vol. 9, No. 1, 247-274. http://research.google.com/pubs/pub41854.html and Blake, Thomas, Chris Nosko, and Steven Tadelis. "Consumer heterogeneity and paid search effectiveness: A large‚Äêscale field experiment." Econometrica 83.1 (2015): 155-174. There's also some quite interesting research that comes out of Google and Facey on these topics, although again it's more focused on online stuff. See for instance: Wang, Yueqing, et al. "A Hierarchical Bayesian Approach to Improve Media Mix Models Using Category Data." (2017). or He, Xinran, et al. "Practical lessons from predicting clicks on ads at facebook." Proceedings of the Eighth International Workshop on Data Mining for Online Advertising. ACM, 2014.
