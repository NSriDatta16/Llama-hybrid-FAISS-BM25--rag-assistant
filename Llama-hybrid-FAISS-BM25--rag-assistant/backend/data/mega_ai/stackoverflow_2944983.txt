How to set up weekends in richfaces calendar?

I want to change next example: http://livedemo.exadel.com/richfaces-demo/richfaces/calendar.jsf?tab=organizer&cid=1157294 to have ability to set up weekends and hollydays. And I have q few questions: 1) why I could use data.shortDescription/data.description in the next code: Can I use something else to show the text in the current date? I want to add boolean isDayOff field to CalendarDataModelItemImpl, but I don't know, how I will retrieve it and show, and also save. How can I set up or cancel weekends using richfaces Calendar (maybe using dataModel maybe not) Could anyone give me some ideas or example? Also I need to show this new weekends with red color.
