Why margins and mfx yield different results in R?

When I run a simple logit regression between a binary variable $y$ over another binary variable $x$ , the average marginal effects obtained by the function logitmfx (from mfx package) are different from those obtained by the function margins (from the eponymous package). Because there is only one covariate ( $x$ ), this discrepancy cannot be linked to a difference in concepts between average marginal effects (AME) and marginal effects at mean (MEM), as both coincide in this case. Hence, what explains the gap?
