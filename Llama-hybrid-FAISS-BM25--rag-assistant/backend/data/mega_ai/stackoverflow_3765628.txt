If there is something you can do to solve the problem, do it in the catch, if there is nothing you can do, then it is better to use a logging framework to register the exception than to use e.printStackTrace(); or System.err.println(e); I personally recommend: http://www.slf4j.org/ , but if you have masochistic tendencies you can try the very bad (but official) Java Logging API: http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/guide/util/logging/ . One extra advantage of SLF4J is that it can redirect its logging to the awful Java Logging API (that way you can use an elegantly designed API and still comform to the awfully designed (de jure not de facto) "standard" SLF4J is easy to use, to log an exception all you have to do is write logger.error("some accompanying message", exception); , another of its advantages is that you can, for example, configure it to send you an email each time your application crashes (by using logback as the underlying logging engine)
