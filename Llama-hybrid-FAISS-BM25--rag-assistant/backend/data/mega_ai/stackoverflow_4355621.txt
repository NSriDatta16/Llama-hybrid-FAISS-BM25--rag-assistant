Just draw a rectangle with the rounded rectangle tool. Then use the pointer tool and select the rectangle you just created. You will see four diamonds. If you drag one of the diamonds you will see that you can alter the four corners simultaneously. If you press the alt (option) key while dragging you can alter one individual corner of the rectangle. Another possibility would be to create two rectangles. One with rounded corners and one without. Then use the punch paths command.
