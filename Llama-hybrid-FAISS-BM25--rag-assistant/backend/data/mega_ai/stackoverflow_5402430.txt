Feeding a UITableViewController calculated values

Very quick question. I need to feed a UITableViewController daily averages calculated from multiple objects with an NSNumber attribute (each object is timestamped, with 8-10 objects per day usually). Is there any straightforward way to calculate on the fly using my own version of lazy loading (I would average data in chronological order till I had a screenful of daily averages) or should I just take the easy way out and maintain an Averages entity pre-populated with averages for all possible days, which I present conventionally in my UITableViewController? Thanks.
