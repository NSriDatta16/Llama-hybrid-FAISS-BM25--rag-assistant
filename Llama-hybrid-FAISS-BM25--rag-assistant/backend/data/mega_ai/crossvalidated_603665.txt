If your only objective is to predict the explanand, then this is not a problem. However, if you want to interpret the regression coefficients, it is a problem. With these data, it is not possible to distinguish a causal role for cattle from a causal role for celt, opp, or size. The mathematical expression of this is that you are solving a set of equations that is nearly degenerate, so the coefficients you get are unstable. You can get a feel for this by drawing some random subsets of your data and calculating a regression for each - you will see that the coefficient for cattle varies a lot. If the contributions of these different factors matter, then I suggest making a random forest model. Its importance scores will be a bit more helpful than the regression coefficients in untangling the different contributions.
