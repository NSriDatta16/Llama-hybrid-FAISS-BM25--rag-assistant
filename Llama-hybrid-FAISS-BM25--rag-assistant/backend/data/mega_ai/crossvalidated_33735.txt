First, the interpretation of the plot from the page you linked to. Each point is a data point from iris data set, transformed by PCA to 2-dimensional representation. The colors refer to distinct classes of irises (setosa, versicolor, virginica), not to principal components. As Michael said, each principal component is a linear function of the variables. To see the coefficients of this function you can check the coefficients_ attribute in the PCA object from the tutorial you linked to. The general next step after getting the components (each one a different linear function) is to apply those functions to the data, and get new lower-dimensional representation of the data. If the data was 100-dimensional, and you chose 7 principal components which explain a satisfactory portion of variance, you can from now on work on 7-dimensional data instead, which is easier and faster. If you want to see a mathematical proof of PCA which uses only linear algebra, and which I hope will give you a good understanding of what PCA does, and how it does it, I have written one lately here : Making sense of principal component analysis, eigenvectors & eigenvalues
