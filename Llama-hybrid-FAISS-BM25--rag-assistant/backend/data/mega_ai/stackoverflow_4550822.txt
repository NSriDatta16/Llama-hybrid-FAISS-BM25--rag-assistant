Now what? Deploy. If you have an MVP that is. Other thoughts: You didn't mention anything about testing. Do you have unit tests? Do you feel that the test coverage is adequate? I'd recommend reading Karen M. Tracey's book Django 1.1 Testing and Debugging . Have you watched Jacob Kaplan-Moss's Deployment Workshop ? Have you done any usability testing? You can check out Joel Test article by Joel Spolsky, or you can read Rocket Surgery Made Easy or Don't Make Me Think both by Steve Krug. Speaking of Spolsky, how does your process rank on the Joel Test ? I know that your question was slanted toward performance, and it may seem that my thoughts aren't performance related. However, thinking about some of these seemingly unrelated items may lead you in a direction that will impact performance. For instance, usability testing may reveal that a certain feature could be reduced in scope yielding better performance due to less data being delivered to the end-user.
