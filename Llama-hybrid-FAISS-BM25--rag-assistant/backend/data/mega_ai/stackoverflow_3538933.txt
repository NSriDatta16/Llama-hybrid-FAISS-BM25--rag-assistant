So I hacked around this morning and it's pretty simple. One div is positioned at [0, 0] and has 100% width and height. Inside is another div, which is absolute positioned, initially at [0, 0] but this one will move as we drag. Also, everything is inside this one. You can't use jQuery's Draggable implementation. The thing is, you don't want to drag div number 2 itself, because you would drag it away :-) So I implemented my own drag-n-drop, which receives events on top div and moves underlying one. Checkout the source code !
