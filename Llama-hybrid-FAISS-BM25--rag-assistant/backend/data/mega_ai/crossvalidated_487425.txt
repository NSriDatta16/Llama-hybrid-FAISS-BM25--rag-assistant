ML Algorithm for Online Sequence Classification

I am writing a program to classify API call sequences at runtime. At the moment I am using pytorch as my ML framework. Initially I thought this could be accomplished with an LSTM network, but from reading this tutorial , it seems like LSTMs expect the sequence length to be fixed. My ideal solution would be able to process a sequence of unknown length incrementally, a single item at a time and compute a label for the sequence up until that point. Are there machine learning algorithms that can do this?
