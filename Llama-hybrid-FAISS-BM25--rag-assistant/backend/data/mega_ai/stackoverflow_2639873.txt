What are my best ASP.Net GridView replacement options?

We currently use a GridView to display 1000+ rows of data. Minimum requirement for replacement is a fixed header row, fixed footer and columns would be a plus. This would have to work across IE 6 and greater. I've heard good things about Infragistics, but the demo on their page is slow. So what are my best options? jQuery? YUI? other 3rd party?
