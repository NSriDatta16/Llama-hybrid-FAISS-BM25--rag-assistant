Bayes factor and hypothesis test in Bayesian inference

Let $$\pi_0=P(\theta\in\Theta_0)=\int_{\Theta_0}\pi(\theta)d\theta$$ $$\pi_1=P(\theta\in\Theta_1)=\int_{\Theta_1}\pi(\theta)d\theta$$ $$a_0=P(\theta\in \Theta_0|x)$$ $$a_1=P(\theta\in \Theta_1|x)$$ in this case for test $$H_0:\theta\in\Theta_0\space vs \space H_1:\theta\in\Theta_1$$ the decision rule is $$\text{Reject}\space H_0\space \text{if}\space a_0 I also know that Bayes factor is $$B=\frac{a_0\pi_1}{a_1\pi_0}$$ and that is as the likelihood ratio. But how is the decision rule using $B$ if I want to test things like i)$H_0:\theta=\theta_0$ vs $H_1:\theta>\theta_1$ ii)$H_0:\theta=\theta_0$ vs $H_1:\theta iii)$H_0:\theta=\theta_0$ vs $H_1:\theta\neq\theta_1$ ? It's not so clear to me how I use the Bayes factor in hyphotesis test.
