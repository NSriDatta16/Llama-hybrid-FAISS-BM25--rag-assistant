Using the mice package, you can conduct multiple imputation using random forest as the underlying modeling method. Modifying the example shown in the mice documentation: imp This would create 5 imputed datasets, with all missing data, whether continuous or categorical, filled-in via random forest. The problem is how to pool the gam objects with smoothed terms fitted on each imputed dataset. From scanning the mice documentation, it seems that package has functions to pool results from lm , glm , lme , and lmer objects. So for other objects such as gam , the pooling would have to be done by hand, if feasible. So no advantage in this case. It would be the same as generating 5 imputed datasets with missForest and pooling results by hand.
