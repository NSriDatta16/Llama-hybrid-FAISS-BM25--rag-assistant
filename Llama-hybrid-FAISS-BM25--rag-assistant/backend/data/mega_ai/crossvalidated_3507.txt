If you can assume that your rows of your data matrix are exchangeable then your modelling strategy should work well. Your method should be fine under the conditions stated by Gaetan Lion before. The reason why your method will work ( given the exchangeability assumption holds ) is that it be taken as a special case of parametric bootstrap in which you take re-sample N rows of big sample, fit a model and store the coefficients and repeat this M times (in traditional bootstrap terminology your M is equivalent to B ) and take average of the M coefficient estimates. You can also look at it from a permutation testing view point as well. But all these results are true if the ( hard to verify ) exchangeability assumption holds. If exchangeability assumption doesn't hold, the answer in that case becomes a bit complicated. Probably you need to take care of the subgroups in your data which are exchangeable and perform your process conditioned on these subgroups. Basically, hierarchical modeling.
