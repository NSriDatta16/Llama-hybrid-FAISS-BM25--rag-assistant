Yusri, I don't think that using multiple regression here makes sense and certainly not in this manner. The dummies for the treatments tell you the average difference between the tumor size in the control and the treatment over the entire period. I don't see why that's relevant. Wouldn't you be more interested in the effect of the treatment on the tumor size at the end of the treatment? In addition the model seems to be misspecified. The residuals will be increasing with time if I am not mistaken. I suspect that the errors are heteroscedastic due to the wrong functional form specification. I think that comparing the difference between treatment and control at the end plus this figure is all the evidence you need to convince the reader.
