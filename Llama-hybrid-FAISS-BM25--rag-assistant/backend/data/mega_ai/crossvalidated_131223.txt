Distribution of weighted data

I want to fit a distribution to weighted data, and I have some issues, starting with the parameter estimation. How can I perform the MLE with the WEIGHTED data? The histogram of the weighted data fits clearly a lognormal distribution, does it mean W*X ~ Log-Normal? Is it just perform the estimation with the set {W[i]*X[i]}? (W the weiths, X the data)? Or I should change the 'average'-like expressions for 'weighted average'-like others? Thanks
