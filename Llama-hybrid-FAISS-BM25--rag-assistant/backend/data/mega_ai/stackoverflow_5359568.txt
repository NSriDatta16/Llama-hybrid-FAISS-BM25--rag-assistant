I was about to delete this when I realized it will be valuable for others to learn what went wrong. So if you follow that tutorial to the tee you will do just fine. HOWEVER, if you use attr_accessible to protect the attributes of your model, you need to specify ALL of them in your model in order to make these images actually save to your S3 bucket. A hint will be if you see the following in your logs: WARNING: Can't mass-assign protected attributes: photo This lets you know that you have protected columns in your database that need to be exposed through attr_accessible Here's what the code would look like if you were to follow the example tutorial I provided in my question: class Product { :thumb => "100x100", :medium => "200x200", :large => "600x400" }, :storage => :s3, :s3_credentials => "#{RAILS_ROOT}/config/s3.yml", :path => ":attachment/:id/:style.:extension", :bucket => 'yourbucket' end
