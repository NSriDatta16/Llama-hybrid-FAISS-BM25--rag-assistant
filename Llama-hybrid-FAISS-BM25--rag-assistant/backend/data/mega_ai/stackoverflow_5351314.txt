I don't believe there is an in-built version of pop command available in memcached. According to the wiki only these commands available o Standard Protocol + No Reply o Storage Commands + set + add + replace + append + prepend + cas o Retrieval Commands + get + gets o delete o incr/decr o Statistics + stats + stats items + stats slabs + stats sizes o flush_all Update: If you are starting and looking for other options. i would highly recommend redis for your case. It provides higher set of commands over memcached. For example, you can pop the value from redis array in multiple ways. LPOP RPOP BLPOP BRPOP SPOP Check out the whole set of redis command s here.
