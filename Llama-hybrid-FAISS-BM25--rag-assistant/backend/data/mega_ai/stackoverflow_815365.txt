This doesn't exactly answer your question, but I imagine Linus and Guido have reasons for disliking keywords that don't apply to small-team corporate development. An $Id$ tag for instance, has what you could consider to be a global version number. Linux and I guess also Python development is fragmented enough that no number can be global. Lots of people have their own repositories all over the place that would fill in their own $Id$ values and then those patches might be sent to Linus or Guido's repositories where they don't make any sense. However, in your environment, you probably have one central repository which would assign these and it would be fine. Sounds like you're using git. I wonder if it's possible to configure the central git repository to do tag substitution while the local developer repositories don't. Or perhaps it's better to get the commit hash in the tag.
