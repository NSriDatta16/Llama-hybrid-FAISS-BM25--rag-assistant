How big a sample size do I need to say a player is performing below average on penalty shots?

An average ball player scores 20% of his penalties. How many penalty results would I need to receive before I can say that a player scores at a rate of 15% requires coaching on his penalty shots? How do I calculate this based on different population averages, statistical certainty etc.
