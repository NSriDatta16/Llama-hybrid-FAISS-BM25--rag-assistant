programing practices : how to choose a packet size for UDP datagrams?

Disclaimer : this is not a "how to" question. I would more like to know, as a background information what are the different actual practices actually used. We know that UDP does not have a PMTU discovery like TCP. So I see several approaches to avoid IP fragmentation with UDP : Sending 512 bytes packets max (the UDP approach) re-implementing some PMTU (using ICMP "needs fragmentation" message). Relying on local MTU (but how far is it reliable, as UDP isn't a connected protocol, how can it knows which interface its packets are going to go through ?) others... ? So what I would like is to have a "background" idea of which approaches are being used by current UDP programs/protocols, especially regarding streaming/VoIP common applications ? Thanks by advance, Jocelyn
