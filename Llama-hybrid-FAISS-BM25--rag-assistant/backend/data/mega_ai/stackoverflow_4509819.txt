How to create a UIButton matrix that behaves like a UIKeyboard (Numberpad)?

Creating a simple button matrix with UIButtons is straight forward. What I'm stuck with is the behavior of it. The multiple UIButtons behave differently. The Keys on a UIKeyboard loose their highlighted state when the touch leaves them, the custom ones keep their highlighted state for quite some time, even when the touch is outside. Furthermore on the UIKeyboard one can drag the touch and thereby activate a different key, how would one implement this behavior with UIButtons in a Matrix setup?
