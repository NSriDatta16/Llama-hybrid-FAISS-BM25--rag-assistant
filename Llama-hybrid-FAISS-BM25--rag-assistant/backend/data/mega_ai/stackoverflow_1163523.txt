You can approximate the width of a string as being the sum of the width of sub-strings. If your substrings are bounded by whitespace† it may even be a pretty good approximation. But you can't know until you ask exactly how wide any particular string will be, because the text rendering engine does things like kerning (altering the spacing between characters). † and you probably want them to be, at least in a European language, because it is much easier to read text broken only on whitespace than text broken mid-word, even if it results in the text looking slightly more ragged.
