Example of time series with constant variance+expected values but time-dependent covariance

I just started to learn about time series analysis and I want to understand stationarity. (Weak) Stationarity is defined as having constant expected values and variance and autocovariances that do not depend on time. I struggle a bit with the autocovariance. Can someone provide an example of a time series that has constant expected values as well as constant variance, but autocovariance that changes over time?
