Does the order of the libraries matter? In other words, if you run the 6th first and the 1st last, will it crash on the first or on the last? If it crashes on the first, then you library #6 has a problem If it crashes on the last, you may be filling up memory somehwere. Use clear classes before running your script, which should eliminate whatever Matlab is filling up in the memory. Alternatively, if the leak or fragmentation is really bad, you could try and restart Matlab after three libraries.
