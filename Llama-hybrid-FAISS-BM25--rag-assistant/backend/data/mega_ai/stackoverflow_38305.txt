How do I strip the fluff out of a third party library?

It may not be best practice but are there ways of removing unsused classes from a third party's jar files. Something that looks at the way in which my classes are using the library and does some kind of coverage analysis, then spits out another jar with all of the untouched classes removed. Obviously there are issues with this. Specifically, the usage scenario I put it though may not use all classes all the time. But neglecting these problems, can it be done in principle?
