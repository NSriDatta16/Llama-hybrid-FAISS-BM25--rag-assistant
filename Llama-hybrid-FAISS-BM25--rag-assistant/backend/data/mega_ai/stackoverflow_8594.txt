I'm a huge fan of organized sources, so I always create the following directory structure: /src - for your packages & classes /test - for unit tests /docs - for documentation, generated and manually edited /lib - 3rd party libraries /etc - unrelated stuff /bin (or /classes) - compiled classes, output of your compile /dist - for distribution packages, hopefully auto generated by a build system In /src I'm using the default Java patterns: Package names starting with your domain (org.yourdomain.yourprojectname) and class names reflecting the OOP aspect you're creating with the class (see the other commenters). Common package names like util , model , view , events are useful, too. I tend to put constants for a specific topic in an own class, like SessionConstants or ServiceConstants in the same package of the domain classes.
