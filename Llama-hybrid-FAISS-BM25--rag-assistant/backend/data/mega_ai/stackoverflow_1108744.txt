You could explore the statistical confidence in the rating perhaps based around the average rating received for all entries and the standard deviation of all votes. While an entry has an average rating of 5, if you only have a few votes then you may not be able to say with more than 90% confidence that the actual rating is above 4.7 say. You can then rate the entries based upon the rating for which you have 90% confidence. I'm not sure if this meets your requirement of being simple.
