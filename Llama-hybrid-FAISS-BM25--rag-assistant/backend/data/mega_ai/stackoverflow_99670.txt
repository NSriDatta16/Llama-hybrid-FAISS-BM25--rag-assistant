This is such an important concept and it saddens me that so few web developers understand it. Basically, start by building a site/framework in Plain Old HTML -- structural elements, links and forms. Then add on some style and then shiny stuff (Ajax or what have you). It's not very difficult. Like palehorse says, graceful degradation is more work. Websites should work in any user agent, not look the same (not even look but sound if your vision impaired), just work.
