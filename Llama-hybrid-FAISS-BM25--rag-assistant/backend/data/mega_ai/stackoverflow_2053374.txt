The shortest way to an answer is, as is so often the case, Ryan Bates' Railscasts . He has an episode on using jQuery with Rails . While he doesn't specifically cover it, a reasonably elegant solution can be crafted from the basics he shows. In my case, the edit link would be overridden to send an ajax request to the server, which returns javascript to build a partial with the form edit code. Easy, once you know how!
