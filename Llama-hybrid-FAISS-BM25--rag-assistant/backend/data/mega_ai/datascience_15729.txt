Fields list of YearPredictionMSD (identify year of music from Million Song Dataset)

The YearPredictionMSD dataset, is a machine learning practice dataset extracted from the Million Song Dataset and found in the UCI Machine Learning Repository. I couldn't find the field list that describes the features. Does anyone know where I can find them? Also, I'm confused why there are only 54 features in the original data from LabRosa but 90 in the subset of the data on UCI.
