Which is good Practice storing a uploaded File in DB or storing it in Filesystem

I have a File Uploader in my ASP.NET application Using C#, we can upload any type like images, documents, pdf etc. I m storing it in the Filesystem and having only the Name of the File in DB. My doubt is can we store the entire file, images in DB. State me Which is good practice and why we need to use it. Either file System Storage or SQL DB Storage.
