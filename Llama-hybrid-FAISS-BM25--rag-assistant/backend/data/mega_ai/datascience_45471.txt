xgboost or lightgbm to handle Binomial problems

I have a dataset containing a column of trials, a column of successes and other features; and, obviously, I can generate a probability column. I would like to use gradient boosting methods (like xgboost or lightgbm) to model the success probability. Which parameter shall I set to handle this in lightgbm or xgboost?
