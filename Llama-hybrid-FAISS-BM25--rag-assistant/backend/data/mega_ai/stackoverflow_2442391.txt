Computer graphics: programatically create duotone (or separations)

There are special kind of images called "duotone" which have just two channels. It is mostly used when you want to achive higher quality reproduction - have a printing press with two colors (black , gray). My question is, I have normal gray-scale image, how to convert it to duotone? I know I can tweak the curves in Photoshop - this is not what I'm asking, rather than how to do it programmatically? Perhaps there is a library which can do just that? What about "dot gain compensation"? "Total ink coverage"? Or, what are te algorithms for creating "separations"?
