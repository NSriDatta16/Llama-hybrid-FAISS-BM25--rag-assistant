Another approach would be to "manually" shrink the response rate to the sample mean using a quadratic penalty for deviating from the mean. If one uses quadratic loss function (with weighting each list by numberPromoted to take into account the amount of data in each list) then this becomes a modified version of weighted ridge regression with shrinking to the mean as opposed to shrinking to zero (aka "poor man's bayesian") The penalty coefficient can be tuned using cross-validation.
