Put multiple data in one cell ASP.NET, VB.NET

How can i put multiple data in one datagrid cell? For example, a user can be a member of different organisations. But i dont want the table to create a new datagrid row for the same user that is a member of multiple organisations. This is how the code looks like right now: Dim dSourceMemberOf As New SqlDataAdapter("QUERY", dbConn) This fills the datagrid, but for some users there are more then 5 rows. So i'd like to put for one particular column all data in one cell. How can this be done? Edit: This is how it woud look like right now: username memberof user1 dft user1 kbo user2 test And this is how i want it to looke like: username memberof user1 dft kbo user2 test
