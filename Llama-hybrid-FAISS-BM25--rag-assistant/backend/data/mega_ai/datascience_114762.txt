Predicting temperature is often framed as a time series problem. Given the seasonal effects, a simplifying assumption is that each month can be predicted separately. You can start with a baseline model like taking all previous years for a single month and predict the average temperature. From there, you can try more advanced models like fitting a line for year-over-year change for a given month.
