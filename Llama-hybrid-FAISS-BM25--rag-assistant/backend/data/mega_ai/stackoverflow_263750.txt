Nobody seems to have mentioned Stroustup's The C++ Programming Language which is a great book that every C++ programmer should read. I also think that Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change should be read by every programmer and manager. Many of the ideas in the book are common knowledge now but the book gives an intelligent and inspiring account of the pursuit of quality in software engineering. I would second the recommendations for Knuth and Gang of Four which are classics.
