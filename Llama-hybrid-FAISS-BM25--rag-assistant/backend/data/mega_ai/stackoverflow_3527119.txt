Sync Two ScrollView

Situation: I have two ScrollView inside of each of two HorizontalScrollView of a TableRow. Goal: When I touch drag one of ScrollView, another ScrollView must scroll as much. For instance, if I have a list of name on left ScrollView and corresponding phone numbers in right ScrollView, scrolling one ScrollView should not destroy the original bounding between the names and phone numbers. Can it be implemented by onTouchEvent? If so, how should I implement this(on both or one of the ScrollView)? Please help me out Android Gurus!
