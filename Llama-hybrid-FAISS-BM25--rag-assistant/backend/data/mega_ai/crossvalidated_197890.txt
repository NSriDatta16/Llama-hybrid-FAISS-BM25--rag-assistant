There is no direct analogue of $R^2$ in the circular case, because the connection between $R^2$ as the proportion explained variance and the correlation coefficient $R$ does not exist in the circular case as in the linear case. Tests of goodness-of-fit for circular data generally involves transforming data to circular uniform data according to the model, then testing the circular uniformity of the data. More formally, say we have data $\boldsymbol\theta = \theta_1, \dots, \theta_n$, and our model produces distribution function $F(\theta)$. Then, $2 \pi F(\theta_1), \dots, 2 \pi F(\theta_n)$ should have a circular uniform distribution. To test circular uniformity, also called isotropy, various methods are available. The most common ones are Watson's $U^2$, Kuiper, Rayleigh and Rao spacing tests. On the website for Circular Statistics in R , there is an R data file that implements this method of goodness of fit for several basic situations. The book itself provides a bit more information on this method of goodness of fit, in paragraph 6.2.3, p. 103.
