Indeed, a Rasch model is a special case of mixed effects logistic regression with a random effect per person and a fixed effect per item. In the psychometrics literature there have been three main estimation procedures developed to estimate its parameters. Marginal maximum likelihood in which the random effects are integrated out, conditional maximum in which estimation proceeds by conditioning on sufficient statistics of the random effects, and joint maximum likelihood that simultaneously estimates the fixed and random effects.
