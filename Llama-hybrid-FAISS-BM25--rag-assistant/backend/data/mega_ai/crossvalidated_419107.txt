Here's a rough and ready approach using bootstrapping, borrowing a method from Guillame Rousselet . First I'll replicate your data, modifying P1 slightly such that it will have a strong relationship with the Rating just to illustrate. I'm using the the cor function from the default stats package with the method = "kendall" argument throughout. set.seed(6000) Rating So far so good. Now we'll want to iteratively resample observations in the dataset, calculate the three overlapping Kendall's $\tau$ values, and take the differences between each pair ( $\tau_i-\tau_j)$ . Determining whether the bootstrapped distributions of these differences overlap zero provides your test. library(boot) library(broom) #Create Bootstrap Function compKendall # 1 0.480 0.00102 0.0533 0.378 0.591 # 2 0.419 -0.00308 0.0525 0.312 0.518 # 3 -0.0610 -0.00410 0.0694 -0.205 0.0720 The dataframe shows the estimated differences between Kendall's $\tau$ values, organised as $\tau$ number 1 - 2, 1 - 3, and 2 - 3. As expected, the first correlation ( $\tau_1 = .65$ ) appears larger than the other two - CI's for the differences exceed zero. However we couldn't conclude there is a significant difference between the second ( $\tau_2 = .17$ ) and third ( $\tau_3 = .23$ ) overlapping correlations.
