Need machine learning algorithm to fill in time-series data

I am currently dealing with a time-series data set with cyclical gaps every 30 minutes (30 minutes of data, 30 minutes of no data). Is there a relatively simple way of using scikit-learn (or some other Python library) to predict the missing data using the available data to train it? I assume this would involve a 'supervised training' approach? I have provided a graph for visual reference, the orange line is a 20-minute centralized moving average of the gap data set, and I want to fill in the data to look more like the green 60-minute centralized moving average from a separate complete data set. Thanks!
