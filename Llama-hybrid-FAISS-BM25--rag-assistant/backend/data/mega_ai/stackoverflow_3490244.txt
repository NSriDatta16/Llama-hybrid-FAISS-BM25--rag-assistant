WinPCAP can only monitor network traffic, not actually receive packets Monitoring network traffic is equivalent to receiving packets. That's exactly what tools such as Wireshark do: read off your network card and reconstruct packet boundaries. I need something that can receive complete packets including any IP, UDP, TCP headers, etc. This is very much possible using the Winsock API. Have a look at the WSAIoctl function, specifically the SIO_RCVALL option - enabling this option will deliver ALL packets received on an interface to your socket. And these are raw IP packets starting with the IP header.
