You need to edit the build working directory of your Build Agent so that the begging path is a little smaller. To edit the build agent, right click on the "Builds" node and select "Manage Build Agents..." I personally use something like c:\bw\$(BuildDefinitionId). $(BuildDefinitionId) translates into the id of the build definition (hence the name :-) ), which means you get a build path starting with something like c:\bw\36 rather than c:\Documents and Settings\tfsbuild\Local Settings\Temp\BuildDefinitionName Good luck, Martin.
