Using a GridView (XtraGridView) to display contents of a Hashtable

I have many kinds of objects - the design is such that is not practical to create a subclass for every conceivable combination of attributes. Instead, I have a Hashtable called Attributes that holds the data for each one. I'm trying to display the contents of Attributes in an XtraGridView/GridView. I'd like each of the key/value pairs to appear in a subview. Like so: +-----------------------------------------+ | Attributes | | Key1 | Value1 | | Key2 | Value2 | | Key3 | Value3 | +-----------------------------------------+ Any way to do this?
