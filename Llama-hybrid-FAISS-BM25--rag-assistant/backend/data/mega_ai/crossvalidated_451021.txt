Introduction to Statistical Learning with R Equation 2.7

I'm really confused about equation 2.7 on page 34 in the Introduction to Statistical Learning with R text book found here: http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/ISLR%20Seventh%20Printing.pdf . The book states: "Here the notation E(y0 - f_hat(x0))^2 defines the expected test MSE, and refers to the average test MSE that we would obtain if we repeatedly estimated f using a large number of training sets, and tested each at x0. I'm confused about exactly what is meant by x0 in this context. Is this a common identical individual observation row that is shared among all the various test data sets? Or, is x0 the collection of all x in each test set - like the observations in the test data associated with k-fold cross validation? Or is it something else? I have similar confusion about y0.
