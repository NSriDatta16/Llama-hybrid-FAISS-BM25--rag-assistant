Using baseline categorical response as a predictor

I have a longitudinal data where the categorical response is collected at two-time points. I was wondering if it's possible to adjust my categorical response at baseline as a predictor and run a logistic regression model. The variables I have are Y1=response at time 1; Y2=response at time 2; X1= age; X2=a derived variable. Therefore the model will look like ` Y2=a+b Y1+c X1+d*X2. Could you please tell me if using this model will be mathematically correct at all? Thanks in advance.
