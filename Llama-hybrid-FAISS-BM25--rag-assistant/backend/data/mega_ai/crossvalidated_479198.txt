Comparing random slopes from LME and individual linear models

I want to know what is the difference between using linear mixed effect models or using a two sept approach where I first calculate linear stopes within each treatment and then calculate the average between them. Below an example comparing random slopes from lm slopes. In the example above the outcome is very similar but when I compare results from these two approaches using my data I get very different results, with lm having much steeper slopes when compared to random effects from lme. library(lme4) data(sleepstudy) fml $Subject == reaction.trend$ subject[i]),] reaction.trend [i,2] $Reaction ~ a$ Days))[2] } beta$subject $slope.lm, comp$ slope.lme) abline (lm (comp $slope.lme ~ comp$ slope.lm))
