SQLServer Calculate Average of Multiple Columns

I have generated a table using PIVOT and the ouput of columns are dynamic. One of the output is as given below: user test1 test2 test3 -------------------------------- A1 10 20 30 A2 90 87 75 A3 78 12 34 The output of above table represents a list of users attending tests. The tests will be added dynamically, so the columns are dynamic in nature. Now, I want to find out average marks of each user as well as average marks of each test. I am able to calculate the average of each test, but got puzzled to find out the average of each user. Is there a way to do this?? Please help. Mahesh
