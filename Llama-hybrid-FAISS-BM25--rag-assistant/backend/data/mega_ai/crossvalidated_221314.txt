You've got a pretty big challenge here. Kodiologist's points regarding causality are well taken. Next, measuring some of the constructs you tossed out is nontrivial, e.g., client "complexity." Do you have a working definition for this? One proxy for this might be to consider the diversity of possible structures from "pure play" (i.e., a single SIC code) vs conglomerates (e.g., GE or J&J both of which span multiple industries). If some of your client companies are private, obtaining this information could be a big deal involving hours of some hapless intern's sweat and blood. Not to mention that these relationships aren't fixed and will change over time as entities restructure. I would recommend considering leveraging a multi-level model of some kind with an individual auditor's records comprising one hierarchy, client companies within SIC codes might be another level, and so on. Good resources include Gelman and Hill's book Data Analysis and Regression Using Multi-Level/Hierarchical Models or Judith Singer's book Applied Longitudinal Data Analysis .
