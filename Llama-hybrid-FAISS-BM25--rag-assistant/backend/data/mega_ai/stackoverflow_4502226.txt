How do I get Wireshark to read header-less pcap files without a UDP/IP/Ethernet header?

Does Wireshark support a format that doesn't require TCP/UDP/Ethernet headers in every packet? Any other (non-pcap) formats wireshark supports would be appreciated. I need to get header-less data into wireshark for further examination.
