If computation time is not important why not go the whole 128 bits? Is there any real reason to choose 64 bits beside possible storage issues? (and then an extra 8 bytes is not going to kill you with storage so cheap) 64 bits vs 128 bits will cause no speed problems in SQLite, I'm not certain about mySQL.
