The event BeforeNavigate2 in Windows Internet Explorer 7 does not fire

I have a VB6 Application which creates an instance of the internet explorer and implements drag and drop for this instance. I am using the event BeforeNavigate2 so that when user drops a file or a folder on the explorer, the event will return the path. ...... Public WithEvents myIExplorer as new SHDocvW.InternetExplorer ...... Private Sub myIExplorer_BeforeNavigate2(ByVal pDisp As Object, URL As Variant, Flags As Variant, TargetFrameName As Variant, PostData As Variant, Headers As Variant, Cancel As Boolean) If IsFile(URL) Then 'Process file Else 'Process folder End if End Sub It works great with Internet Explorer 6. However, it does not work properly with Windows Internet Explorer 7. When I drop a file it works but when I drop a folder it just opens the folder and it does not fire the event. What has changed in IE7? Is there any setting? Is there any security issue? Thanks
