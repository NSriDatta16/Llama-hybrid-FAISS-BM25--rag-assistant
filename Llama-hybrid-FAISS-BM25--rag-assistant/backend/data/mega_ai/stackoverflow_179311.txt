Is O/R Mapping worth it?

The expressiveness of the query languages (QL) provided with ORMs can be very powerful. Unfortunately, once you have a fleet of complex queries, and then some puzzling schema or data problem arises, it is very difficult to enlist the DBA help that you need? Here they are, part of the team that is evolving the database, yet they can't read the application QL, much less suggest modifications. I generally end up grabbing generated SQL out of the log for them. But then when they recommend changes to it, how does that relate to the original QL? The process is not round-trip. So after a decade of promoting the value of ORMs, I am now wondering if I should be writing my SQL manually. And maybe all that I really want the framework to do is automate the data marshaling as much as possible. Question : Have you found a way to deal with the round-trip issue in your organization? Is there a SQL-marshaling framework that scales well, and maintains easily? (Yes, I know that pure SQL might bind me to the database vendor. But it is possible to write standards-compliant SQL.)
