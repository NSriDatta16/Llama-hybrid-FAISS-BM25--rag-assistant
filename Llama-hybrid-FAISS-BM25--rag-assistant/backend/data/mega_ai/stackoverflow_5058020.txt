Using file aliases inside an Android APK?

Is it possible to us file aliases within an Android APK? For example, I have the same file that I wish to reference using R.drawable.icon_name, and I am using the same icon for hdpi, ldpi, and mdpi. Is it possible to use file aliases/ symlinks to have the icon in /res/hdpi/ and create aliases in /res/mdpi/ and /res/ldpi/ pointing to that file, or is there a better approach altogether?
