will this work as an alternative to http cookie?

I'm using php for my site and was wondeirng if it would be a good idea to use the $_SERVER md5($_SERVER['remote_addr'] + $_SERVER['http_user_agent'])) into a cookie_auth field in the user table. When the user logs in, php will use the above key to re-check the current user and compare it to the stored key and if matched get credintials for the user. The problems are, the user agent can change and IP can change. I guess my main concern is the user user agent. IP addresses typically stay around for a month or two and my primary user base has static ip addresses (companies) so this shouldn't be issue. Are there any other php $_SERVER variablies that I could concatinate that would be less volitile... but still dynamic? I have the php manual infront of me but I don't see any usefull... Maybe I'm missing something. Do other developers implement anything similar to this? Thoughts? Is there a better way to go about this?
