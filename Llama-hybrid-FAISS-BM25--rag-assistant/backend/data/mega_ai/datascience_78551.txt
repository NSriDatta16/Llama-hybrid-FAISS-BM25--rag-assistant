How to use historic data (granularity at day level) for ML modeling?

There is a scenario where I have to use historic data which is at the day level for the past 5 years. Actually it is water flow data, what quantity of water was flown on that particular day. I have to use this feature along with a few other features like material, coating, etc,. for EDA and prediction. I tried averaging it out but not useful. Data is like this flow1,flow2, and flow3 (including other features not shown here) for each day on that particular route id. This continues for 5 years for many routes. I am not able to figure out how to consolidate this data so that I can feed it to the model. I am trying to predict the corrosion in the pipeline. Any guidance will be helpful. Thanks
