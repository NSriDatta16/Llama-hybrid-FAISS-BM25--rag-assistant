Since 1.2, Django has a new messages framework-- django.contrib.messages --that is now completely detached from the auth module and offers much more functionality. For instance, it provides a basic way of handling the expiration of messages . You can also take a look at the django-cnotes application that provides a simple cookie based user notification system. Setting constant CNOTES_AUTO_CLEAR to False prevents clearing the notes automatically. And there is django-notices , yet another replacement for the built-in message notification system. It does no magic but provides an elegant and simple API.
