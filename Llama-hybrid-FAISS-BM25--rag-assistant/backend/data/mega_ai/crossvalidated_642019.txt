Does pattern in random seed for Pseudo random functions cause bias

I am using random forest in R, and for different test sets I'm using patterned seeds in the sample function. For one test set I use 1234, for the next 2345, the next 3456. I suspect it is unlikely, but could this introduce bias of some sort?
