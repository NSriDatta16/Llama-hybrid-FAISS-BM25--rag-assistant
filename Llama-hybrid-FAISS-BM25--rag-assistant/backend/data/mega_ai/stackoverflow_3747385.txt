The URL-click part should be as straightforward as any other embedded img link, as long as your blob is publicly accessible. I don't know what your entity looks like, but let's just pretend you have a table called ImageDetails, and you have an entity called ImageDetail with a property called ThumbnailURL. You could query the table with something like this (you'd probably want to subclass TableServiceContext - this is a simple example): var imageDetailQuery = CloudStorageAccount.DevelopmentStorageAccount .CreateCloudTableClient() .GetDataServiceContext() .CreateQuery ("ImageDetails"); var imageDetail = (from d in imageDetailQuery where ... select d).FirstOrDefault(); At this point, assuming you have an ImageDetail object, you can just access: imageDetail.ThumbnailURL And build up your tag, either inline or in code: var imgTag = String.Format(" ", imageDetail.ThumbnailURL);
