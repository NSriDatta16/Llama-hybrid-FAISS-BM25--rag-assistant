I've had this problem too. The best way to avoid it is to create a new version of your control, e.g. SimpleKeyboard3, then make sure to remove the old one from your form, and then replace it with the new one. Otherwise the form might be making reference to properties or other things that can no longer be referenced. Or, you can delete the control from your form, then modify the control, then add it back to your toolbar and then drag it back into your form. Even if it's trashed, you can still fix it by choosing the "ignore and continue .. this may make the designer unstable" option so that you can delete the control.
