Reinforcement Learning techniques to use if there is a direct connecction between (state, action) and reward

I want to build a model. The input state is a combination of different numbers in sequence (Their orders matter to the final result). The effectiveness of such number combination can be computed into a real numbers through continuous and differentiable math formulas. This result is also used to compute a reward for each action. My actions for each state (number combination) is to select a specific number at a position and change that number to any element from a finite list of numbers. Are there any suggestions for a good reinforcement technique to solve this problem? Any bits of help is appreciated!
