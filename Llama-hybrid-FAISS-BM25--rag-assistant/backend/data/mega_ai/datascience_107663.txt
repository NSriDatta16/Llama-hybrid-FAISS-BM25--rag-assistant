Where can i learn time series data forcasting/analysis?

I would like to learn time series data analysis and forecasting. I am knowledgeable in machine learning and have a good knowledge of deep learning (including RNN's, LSTM). I came to know that time series is a lot different from normal data and hence most of the preprocessing, feature extraction methods cannot be used for time series data and also that the working of time series algorithm is a little different than the normal machine learning algorithms. Even though I read a lot of articles was still left confused about time series analysis and forecasting (like in cases of removing making data stationery I couldn't fully understand why and if it meant only for some simple time series algorithms). Where can I learn time series forecasting (preprocessing, feature extracting, and ml/dl for time series data).
