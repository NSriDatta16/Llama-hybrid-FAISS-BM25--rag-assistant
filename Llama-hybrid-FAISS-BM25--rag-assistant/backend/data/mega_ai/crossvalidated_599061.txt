The legend in the plot shows that the curves correspond to specific time points. Survival models (Cox PH, parametric regression, etc.) can give predictions of the probability of surviving at a given time. So I expect for that plot they computed the predicted survival for each subject at times 50 days and 250 days, then used those probabilities (compared to actual outcome at that time) to compute the ROC curves just like if the probabilities had come from a logistic regression or other classification tool.
