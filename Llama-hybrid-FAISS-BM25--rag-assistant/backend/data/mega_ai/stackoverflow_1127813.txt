Well in the cmMetadata_Click handler, you can just query the lvResources.SelectedItem property, since lvResources will be accessible from the code-behind file that the click handler is located in. It's not elegant, but it will work. If you want to be a little more elegant, you could change where you set up your ContextMenu. For example, you could try something like this: One Item Another item What this does is plug in a template for your ListViewItem, and then you can use the handy TemplatedParent shortcut to assign the ListViewItem to the DataContext of your menu item. Now your code-behind looks like this: private void cmMetadata_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e) { MenuItem menu = sender as MenuItem; ListViewItem item = menu.DataContext as ListViewItem; } Obviously the downside is you will now need to complete the template for a ListViewItem, but I'm sure you can find one that will suit your needs pretty quickly.
