DJE gave a great answer, but I would just add some clarification about which states we can and can't accept. When you measure the typist's speed, you are really measuring the marginal expected value. For simplicity, let's consider the typist's speed to be in one of two states (fast =1, slow=0) and say we are trying to estimate the probability that this is a fast typist. So, when you measure the speed over several time points and average these, you are estimating Pr(fast). But by selecting time points at random, you are estimating this via the contributions to the marginal probability by the probability that the typist is fast given those states that occur for the typist: Pr(fast) = Pr(fast|headache)Pr(headache) + Pr(fast|tired)Pr(tired) + Pr(fast|hungry)Pr(hungry) + Pr(fast|deadline)Pr(deadline)+... etc. If you select your time points randomly, then the states that occur in your dataset should be representative of the distribution of states that occur in the population of this typist's time. Very rare states may be missed, but unless they have a large effect on typing speed this will not cause much bias. If your typist ever spends time with her hand tied behind her back while typing, then Pr(hand tied) >0 and it will be represented in your data with probability = Pr(hand tied). The reason we don't accept 'having one hand tied behind the typist's back' as a state is because this is not a normal variation in the typist's state - i.e. we believe that Pr(hand tied) = 0. Similarly, if Pr(typist A = typist B) = 0, then we don't accept switching typists as a state to which our marginal probability applies.
