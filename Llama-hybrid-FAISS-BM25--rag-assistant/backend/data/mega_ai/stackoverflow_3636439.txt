Building from a comment Vince made on my previous answer (since deleted since it was more of an explanation of how long and how much effort a feature like this would take rather than an attempt at answering the question). You could store the index path of a cell when it becomes selected, and then as the cell is about to scroll offscreen (you'll need some trickery to detect this) you could retrieve the cell view returned from cellForRowAtIndexPath and set a section header view to use this cell view. This would be a pretty monstrous hack though, and you'd need to find a way to elegantly split the table into sections in order to use the section header. I wouldn't recommend this approach, although its a step in the right direction.
