RubyonRails is web application framework - it is running on server and user observer the result of application built on RubyOnRails inside browser(or Browser component), despite the fact that you can process on server just "M" from "MVC", and implement "V" and "C" fully on client side( in mobile browser). In theory, you can fully deploy RubyOnRails application on client side( even RubyOnRails server and etc), but it will be rather expensive and hard, but it is could not be require in any rational project. assuming: There are two way you can choose: Organize RubyonRails application on the server(process there Model), and process "V" and "C" on client side with any proper js libraries. You can develop Ruby(not RubyOnRails application) - at least it is possible to develop for Android with JRuby.
