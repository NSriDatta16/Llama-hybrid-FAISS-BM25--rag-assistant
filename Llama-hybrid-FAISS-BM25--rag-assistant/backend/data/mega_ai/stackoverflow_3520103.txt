Would implementing files (all types: audio, video, text, etc.) as database tables and their content as their rows be worthwile?

Consider I modify the way files are stored in a system, where every file name would actually be the table name in a database and each line in the file would actually be the rows of that table. Would that increase overall system speed? would it be worthwhile? what are the tradeoffs? To further clarify the distinction between this and the normal use of a database, consider the files not to simply be text files, but also audio, video, binary, etc. where they are stored in the manner mentioned in the previous paragraph. Immediate benefits that I can see from this is that i can read/write any line from/to a file without having to repeatedly read/write the previous lines until reaching the desired line. Another benefit would be simultaneous reading/writing of files. Please do not confuse this with a database file system, this is a file implementation
