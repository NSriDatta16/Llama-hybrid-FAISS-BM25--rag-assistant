What is the 'fundamental' idea of machine learning for estimating parameters?

The 'fundamental' idea of statistics for estimating parameters is maximum likelihood . I am wondering what is the corresponding idea in machine learning. Qn 1. Would it be fair to say that the 'fundamental' idea in machine learning for estimating parameters is: 'Loss Functions' [Note: It is my impression that machine learning algorithms often optimize a loss function and hence the above question.] Qn 2: Is there any literature that attempts to bridge the gap between statistics and machine learning? [Note: Perhaps, by way of relating loss functions to maximum likelihood. (e.g., OLS is equivalent to maximum likelihood for normally distributed errors etc)]
