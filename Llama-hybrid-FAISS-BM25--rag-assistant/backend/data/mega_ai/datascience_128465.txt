Which model and embedding to use for portuguese chat with docs

I would like to have a model to read all my personal documents, meeting notes and things like that, all text based, and then be able to ask questions like: what was decided about the feature x? what was proposed about y? I have tried some examples that I have seen online and they seem to do what I want. The thing is my documents are not in english. I tried some models like maritaca-ai/sabia-7b, llama-2, mistral and some embeddings like sentence-transformers/paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2. The results are not good at all. Is it the model? Or the embedding type I am using? Can somebody suggest some resource for me to learn more about how to solve this problem?
