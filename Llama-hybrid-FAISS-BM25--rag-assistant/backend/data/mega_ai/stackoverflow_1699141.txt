Donald Knuth says (The Art of Computer Programming, Third Ed., Vol. 1, p. 435): Several authors began about 1975 to call the pool of available memory a "heap." He doesn't say which authors and doesn't give references to any specific papers, but does say that the use of the term "heap" in relation to priority queues is the traditional sense of the word.
