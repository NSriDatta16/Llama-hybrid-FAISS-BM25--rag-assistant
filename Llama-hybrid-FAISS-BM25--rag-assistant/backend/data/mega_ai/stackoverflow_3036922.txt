It's dangerous. Scanf will write integer sized value over the character-sized variable. In your example (most probably) nothing will happen unless you reorganize your stack variables (scanf will partially overwrite len when trying to write integer sized "dest", but then it returns correct "len" and overwrites it with "right" value). Instead, do the "correct thing" rather than relying on compiler mood: char source[] = "x32"; char separator; unsigned char dest; int temp; int len; len = sscanf(source,"%c%d",&separator,&temp); // validate and proceed... if (temp>=YOUR_MIN_VALUE && temp
