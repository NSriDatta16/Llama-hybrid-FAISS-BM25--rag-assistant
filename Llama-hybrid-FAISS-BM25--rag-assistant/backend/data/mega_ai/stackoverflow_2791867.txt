Configuring Cruise Control Net with sourcesafe - Unable to load array item 'executable'

I'm trying to create a continuous integration environment. To do so, I've used a guide that can be found at http://www.15seconds.com/issue/040621.htm . In this step by step, the goal is to create a CI with CCNet, NAnt, NUni, NDoc, FxCop and source safe. I've been able to create my build by using the command prompt (despite the the different versions issues). The problem has come with the configuration of ccnet.config I've made some changes because of the new versions, but I'm still getting errors when starting the CCNet server. Can anyone help me to fix this issue or point where to find a guide with this scenario? The error that I'm getting: Unable to instantiate CruiseControl projects from configuration document. Configuration document is likely missing Xml nodes required for properly populating CruiseControl configuration. Unable to load array item 'executable' - Cannot convert from type System.String to ThoughtWorks.CruiseControl.Core.ITask for object with value: "\DevTools\nant\bin\NAnt.exe" Xml: E:\DevTools\nant\bin\NAnt.exe My CCNet config file below: http://localhost/ccnet 10 E:\VSS\ C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual SourceSafe\SS.EXE $/CCNet/slnCCNet.root/slnCCNet Albert E:\DevTools\nant\bin\NAnt.exe E:\Builds\buildingsolution\WebForm.build NAnt.Core.XmlLogger 300 E:\DevTools\nant\bin\nant.exe true E:\Builds\buildingsolution\WebForm.build NAnt.Core.XmlLogger build 6000 E:\Builds\buildingsolution\latest\*-results.xml enter code here
