Can sampling be difficult even with access to the normalized version of the distribution?

There is a vast wealth of literature on (approximate) sampling from computationally difficult distributions. Generally, the techniques I have seen assume that we only have queries to a proportional version of the distribution. That is, if we wish to sample from $p(x)$ , we can query $\pi(x)$ , where $p(x) = \frac{\pi(x)}{\int \pi(x) dx}$ . In applications, this is often sensible (for instance, we can usually compute the proportional version of a Bayesian posterior, but not its normalizing constant). However, are there cases where sampling is difficult even when we have exact query access to the distribution itself? (I.e., we know the normalizing constant $\int \pi(x) dx$ ). Or would there be some general method to allow us to accurately sample in that case. And broadly, is there literature on this topic? I've seen endless papers about sampling from unnormalized distributions, but rarely seen this case mentioned (making me wonder if there's some easy way to sample from a distribution as long as you know the normalizing constant exactly).
