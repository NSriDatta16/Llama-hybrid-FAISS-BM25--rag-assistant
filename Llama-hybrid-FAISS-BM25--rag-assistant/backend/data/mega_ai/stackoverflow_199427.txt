At first I was thinking that most previous answers were not responsive to the question. After further thought, I think the author is probably not asking the right question. If you're writing an application, you don't usually think of "building packets". you just open sockets, format up the data payload, and it's the protocol stack that builds packets with your data. OK, if you're using datagrams, you do need to define, generate and parse your payloads. But you typically let the kernel encapsulate it at the network level (e.g. add IP header) or link layer (e.g. add Ethernet framing). You usually don't use pcap. Sometimes just pack and unpack and maybe vec is enough. If you're writing an unusual packet processor such as an active hostile attack tool, a man-in-the-middle process, or a traffic shaping device, then would be more likely to be "building packets" and using pcap. Maybe Net::Packet is for you also.
