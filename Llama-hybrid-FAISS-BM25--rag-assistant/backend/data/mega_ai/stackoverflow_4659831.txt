Get dragged / saved items state back from Sql Server

Ok i saw many post's on how to serialize the value of dragged items to get hash and they tell how to save them. Now the question is how do i persist the dragged items the next time when user log's in using the has value that i got eg: which on serialize will give "id[]=1&id[]=2&id[]=3&id[]=4" Now think that i saved it to Sql server database in a single field called SortOrder. Now how do i get the items to these order again ? the code to make these sort is below,without which people didn't know which library i had used to sort and serialize $(document).ready(function() { $(".list li").css("cursor", "move"); $(".list").sortable(); });
