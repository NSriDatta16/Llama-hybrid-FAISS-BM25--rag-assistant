Yes, plus some meta-data, like a start and end index (because that char array can be shared across strings, for example, when you create substrings). Looking at the source for java.lang.String , you see the following instance fields: /** The value is used for character storage. */ private final char value[]; /** The offset is the first index of the storage that is used. */ private final int offset; /** The count is the number of characters in the String. */ private final int count; /** Cache the hash code for the string */ private int hash; // Default to 0
