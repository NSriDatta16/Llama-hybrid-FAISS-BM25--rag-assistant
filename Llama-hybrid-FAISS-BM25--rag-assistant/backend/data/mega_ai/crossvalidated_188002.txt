If we have a stochastic process $X_1, X_2, ...$ on $(\Omega, \mathscr F, \mathbb P)$, then $\frac{X_t}{X_{t-1}}$ for $t = 2, 3, ...$ is a random variable in $(\Omega, \mathscr F, \mathbb P)$ that shows that ratio of a random variable in the sto process to the previous random variable. '$E[\frac{X_t}{X_{t-1}}] = 1$' means that throughout the whole sto process, on average the ratio between one random variable and the one before it is 1. So the stochastic process $\frac{X_2}{X_1}, \frac{X_3}{X_2}, ...$ has the same mean. If the $\frac{X_n}{X_{n-1}}$'s are integrable, then If we have $E[\frac{X_n}{X_{n-1}} | \mathscr F_m] = \frac{X_m}{X_{m-1}}$ for some m
