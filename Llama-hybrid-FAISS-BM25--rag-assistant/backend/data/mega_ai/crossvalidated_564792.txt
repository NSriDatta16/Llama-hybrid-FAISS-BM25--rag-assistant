Dawn Iacobucci * suggests a general approach for mediation analysis involving combinations of categorical and continuous variables. Use ordinary least squares (OLS) or logistic regression (LR) as appropriate for each of the individual regressions. Although the coefficients are in different types of scales, if you standardize each coefficient by its estimated standard error and the estimates are close enough to normally distributed, then the coefficients can be combined as needed to evaluate whether mediation is significant. The suggested steps are: First, to estimate the strength of the "direct path" from predictor(s) $X$ to outcome $Y$ , model: $$\hat Y = b_{01} + c X.$$ That would be OLS in your situation with an effectively continuous outcome. Then for the influence of $X$ on $M$ , fit: $$\hat M = b_{02} + a X.$$ With binary mediator $M$ that would be logistic regression. For the model with both $M$ and $X$ as predictors of $Y$ $$\hat Y = b_{03} + c' X + b M$$ you would use OLS in your situation. Standardize the coefficient estimates $\hat a$ and $\hat b$ by their corresponding standard errors $\hat s_a$ and $\hat s_b$ : $z_a = \hat a/\hat s_a$ and $z_b = \hat b/\hat s_b$ . The standard error of the product $z_a z_b$ , assuming normality, is $\hat \sigma_{z_{ab}}=\sqrt{z_a^2 + z_b^2 +1}$ . The test for mediation is then comparing $$z_{\text{mediation}} = \frac{z_a z_b}{\hat \sigma_{z_{ab}}}$$ against a standard normal. Two warnings. First, I haven't tried this myself, so read the paper to make sure that this approach will work in your situation. Second, you will have to consider how to handle the 2 coefficients associated with your 3-level predictor $X$ in each of the regressions. The simplest would be comparisons of each of middle and hard against soft , as they correspond to the reported coefficients if soft is the reference level. You might consider coding it as an ordinal rather than a nominal predictor, or find that the differences between successive levels of $X$ are close enough to linearly spaced with respect to outcomes that you can code it as continuous. * Mediation analysis and categorical variables: The final frontier, Journal of Consumer Psychology 22: 582-594, 2012.
