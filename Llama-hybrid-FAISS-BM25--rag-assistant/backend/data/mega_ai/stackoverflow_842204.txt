It also makes sense for storage medium, such as hard drives and optical disks, where you can't just go back to the source to get the uncorrupted data. In fact, both hard drives and optical disks use forward error correction quite extensively. Forward error correction is also used extensively in wireless communications, where errors tend to knock out just a few bits at a time. Rather than lose the whole packet to a single bit error, forward error correction is used to fix the corrupted bits.
