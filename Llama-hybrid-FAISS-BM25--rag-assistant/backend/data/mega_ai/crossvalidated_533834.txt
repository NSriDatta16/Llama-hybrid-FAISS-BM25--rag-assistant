Interpretation of Logistic Regression output in Credit Scoring

Currently I'm working on a project involving loan data where I am trying to build a model that will predict a probability of an individual defaulting on a loan. I have binary dependent variable where defaulted loans are denoted with 1. I decided to use logistic regression for this task, but However, I have difficulty interpreting the results of the regression and would greatly appreciate some clarification. Namely, I would like to know, whether the probabilities calculated by logistic regression should be interpreted as a probability of default? For example, if for some observation, the predicted value is 0.8, should I assume that according to the model, this individual has 80% chance of default?
