Based on the code fragment you posted i presume you are looking at a *.class file and not a *.java file? If so, the "compiled code" and //compiled code are there because of your IDE trying to give you some readable representation of those compiled *.java classes, so you can at least take a look at what methods are available in that class. The "compiled code" is in no manner the correct error message that is given when the RunTimeException is thrown. The presentation of the *.class files is different in every IDE (eclipse, intelliJ, ..) If you want to be able to take a look at the code that is executed, you will need the uncompiled *.java files.
