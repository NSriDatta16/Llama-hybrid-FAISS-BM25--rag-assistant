find /dir/ -perm /0020 is also a good solution. Check the man page for find. My version in Debian (find (GNU findutils) 4.4.0) has the argument by Sorpigal as deprecated. -perm mode File's permission bits are exactly mode (octal or symbolic). Since an exact match is required, if you want to use this form for symbolic modes, you may have to specify a rather complex mode string. For example -perm g=w will only match files which have mode 0020 (that is, ones for which group write permission is the only permission set). It is more likely that you will want to use the `/' or `-' forms, for example -perm -g=w, which matches any file with group write permission. See the EXAMPLES section for some illustrative examples. -perm -mode All of the permission bits mode are set for the file. Symbolic modes are accepted in this form, and this is usually the way in which would want to use them. You must specify `u', `g' or `o' if you use a symbolic mode. See the EXAMPLES section for some illustrative examples. -perm /mode Any of the permission bits mode are set for the file. Symbolic modes are accepted in this form. You must specify `u', `g' or `o' if you use a symbolic mode. See the EXAMPLES section for some illustrative examples. If no permission bits in mode are set, this test currently matches no files. However, it will soon be changed to match any file (the idea is to be more con- sistent with the behaviour of -perm -000). -perm +mode Deprecated, old way of searching for files with any of the per- mission bits in mode set. You should use -perm /mode instead. Trying to use the `+' syntax with symbolic modes will yield sur- prising results. For example, `+u+x' is a valid symbolic mode (equivalent to +u,+x, i.e. 0111) and will therefore not be eval- uated as -perm +mode but instead as the exact mode specifier -perm mode and so it matches files with exact permissions 0111 instead of files with any execute bit set. If you found this paragraph confusing, you're not alone - just use -perm /mode. This form of the -perm test is deprecated because the POSIX specification requires the interpretation of a leading `+' as being part of a symbolic mode, and so we switched to using `/' instead.
