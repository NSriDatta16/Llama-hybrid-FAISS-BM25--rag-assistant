Learning Python for Machine learning for mathematical student

I am familiar with mathematics but not with Python for machine learning. I have been reading books to code, but they tend to avoid talking about maths to speak to larger audience. They are well written indeed, but I would like to take advantage of my interest for mathematics to begin to learn python for machine learning. Do you know a book which provides it? For example I'm okay to use stochastic gradient descent function of scikit-learn but if at least they give us a mathematical explanation about it (it's just an example, it's the same for relatively advances statistical concepts). Or it's also nice to code the mathematical concept you just learnt.
