The only reason this works at all is because of a coding error in IE that allows a position CSS rule to apply to TD elements. According to W3C conventions, inner table elements must always be rendered with position: static. In order for draggable to function, the draggable element must be able to be removed from document flow with a non-static position. This is not possible for TD elements. Consider switching to an unordered list and making your list items selectable and draggable.
