Assumptions/Limitations of Random Forest Models

What are the general assumptions of a Random Forest Model? I could not find by searching online. For example, in a linear regression model, limitations/assumptions are: It may not work well when there are non-linear relationship between dependent and independent variables. It may not work if the dependent variables considered in the model are linearly related. Therefore one has to remove correlated variable by some other technique. It assumes that model errors are uncorrelated and uniform (No hetroscedasticity). Are there any assumptions/limitations on similar lines.
