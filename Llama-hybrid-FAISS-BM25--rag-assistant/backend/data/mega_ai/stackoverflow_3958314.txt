Returning the average amount of a column

I have a table which represents the scores and id's of users who have played a flash game. I want to return the amount of times the average user has tried the game- every time they complete a "try" the score and id of the user is input into the mysql table. The structure is - id int(11) score int(11) fb_id int(25) This gives me the amount of tries for every user SELECT count(score) AS counted FROM `ifa_scores` GROUP BY `fb_id` but i want something like this i would like the average amount of times played overall- ie the average amount of rows with the same FB_ID
