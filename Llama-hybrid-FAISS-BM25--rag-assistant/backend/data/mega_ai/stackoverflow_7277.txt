Is it "bad practice" to be sensitive to linebreaks in XML documents?

I'm generating some XML documents and when it comes to the address part I have fragments that look like this: 15 Sample St Example Bay Some Country The XSLT that I have for converting this to XHTML has some funky recursive template to convert newline characters within strings to tags. This is all working fine; but is it considered "bad practice" to rely on linebreaks within XML documents? If so, is it recommended that I do this instead? 15 Sample St Example Bay Some Country Seems like it'd be really awkward to wrap every place where my text may be multiple lines with tags like that..
