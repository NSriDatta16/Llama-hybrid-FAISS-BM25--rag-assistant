like any of these problems you need to first calculate the moving average representation; this will give you the steady state joint distribution, then you integrate out k-1 variables to get the marginal distribution,however, if the errors are multivariate normal(MVN) then the joint will be MVN(some regularity conditions apply) and hence you only need to know the mean and variance to specify the marginal distribution these also come off the MA representation
