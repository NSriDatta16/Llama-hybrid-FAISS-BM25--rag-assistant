The correlations appear to be measuring the wrong quantity in the first place, so the question may be asking about how to summarize something that doesn't and can't perform as desired. As I understand it, the correlations are measured for each engineer's reports as one variable and some independently obtained value for the true or correct roughness for the other variable. I don't gather from the question whether non-integers are allowed for either variable. But a strong correlation could arise if an engineer were biased but otherwise reliable, e.g. if John's grades are given exactly by true $-\ 0.5$ or Helen's by true $+\ 0.5$ then their correlations would be $+1$. Conversely, any engineer for who there was deviation from engineer's $=$ true could not score a perfect correlation, even if they were on average unbiased. Otherwise put, correlation measures linearity of relationship, not agreement of values. The fallacy is seen most starkly by realising that $y$ and $by$ have perfect correlation for any positive value of $b$. This may not bite very hard for your data, but if you desire a measure of agreement, then correlation can at best only be such a measure by accident. Concordance correlation is such a measure, although over-reliance on any single-valued reduction of any data is likely to miss important structure. The forum contains various other threads mentioning concordance correlation, e.g. Does the concordance correlation coefficient make linearity or monotone assumptions? In general, averaging correlations makes most sense when they encapsulate all the information of interest. Here that seems unlikely at best.
