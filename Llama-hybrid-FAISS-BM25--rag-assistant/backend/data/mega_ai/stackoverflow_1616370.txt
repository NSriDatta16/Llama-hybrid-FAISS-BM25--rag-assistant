Don't forget Erlang's Mnesia . Mnesia gives you stuff like transactions that you're used to in a normal DB, but provides real-time operations and fault-tolerance. Plus you can reconfigure things without downtime. Downside is that it's a memory resident database, so you have to fragment really large tables. Largest table size is 4Gb.
