Interpretation of odds ratio

Can anyone help me interpret the results on the attached figure (drivers of preterm birth in Missouri)? This is the result of a multivariate logistic regression analysis. What can be inferred from these ORs? Is it fair to say that the greater the OR the greater the contribution of that factor will be? Would be great to be able to discuss it further.
