All the machine learning problems are same. You have some train data, learn a model that represent this data and have ability to generalize this knowledge in that way you cluster,classify, learn with different algorithms. In Image recognition you have again a set of images you want to to learn about. These images firstly processed and some features are extracted from images (lots of possible image feature schemes like SIFT, Bag of WORDS) like you use pixels and their values. Give these images with corresponding feature vectors to your ML algorithm (Neural Net, SVM or others). Learn a model Use this model to recognize objects that are seen sufficiently on training data. If you want to recognize more than one thing, use multiple classifier for each.
