The most Pythonic way to check the type of an object is... not to check it. Since Python encourages Duck Typing , you should just try...except to use the object's methods the way you want to use them. So if your function is looking for a writable file object, don't check that it's a subclass of file , just try to use its .write() method! Of course, sometimes these nice abstractions break down and isinstance(obj, cls) is what you need. But use sparingly.
