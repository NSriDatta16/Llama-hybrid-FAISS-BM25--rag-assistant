Medical NER for French language

I'm currently exploring the options to extract medical NER specifically for French language. I tried SpaCy 's general French NER but it wasn't helpful to the cause (mainly because of the domain-specific requirements). I assume we cannot use Med7 or other English-language specific NER's for this purpose. I'd like to know the options and suggestions on how to proceed. I'd also like to know if BioBERT could come handy for this purpose, particularly by combining it with camemBERT or any other French language models. If there're no readymade options available, I'm planning to translate French to English and then run the NER. I hope there's some potential for this approach.
