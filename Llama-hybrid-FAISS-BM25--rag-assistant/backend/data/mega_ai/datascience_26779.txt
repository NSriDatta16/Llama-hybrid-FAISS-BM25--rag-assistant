Is there any ongoing research on known patterns ML algorithms can not mine?

I have been doing ML for sometimes and have explored and implemented Deep Learning as for some projects. ML algorithms assume a certain pattern (Geometric/Bayesian/Distribution) in the data .This can usually be referred as Hypothesis Space in the literature, then we design a solution to best fit that hypothesis to our data. I wanted to know are there some patterns (Hypothesis spaces), which do not yet have a reliable algorithm to be mined? Like Decision Trees used the Information Theory to assume that Information Gain from a variable can help us better classify the data. This was a new approach than SVM which assumes a geometrical space to where a plane can classify the data. I hope there must me some new theories which are being worked on. Let me know if I can improve this question.
