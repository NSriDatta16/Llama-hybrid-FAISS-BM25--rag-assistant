The combined forecast would be (35+50+40)/3 = 41.67 This is known as Simpson's paradox, a very dangerous approach to share values. The items you work with are probability estimations derived on samples of different sizes, and by averaging the share you will get a confusing result if the actual numbers of right / wrong answers are really different across groups. It is better to make counts of right answers and divide them by total counts.
