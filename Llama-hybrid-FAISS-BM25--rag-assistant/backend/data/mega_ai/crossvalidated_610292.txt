Inequality relating expected value and tail probability

I am currently working through Scornet2015 - Consistency of Random Forests . I'm having trouble understanding a specific inequality that is used in the proofs without further explanation. I am assuming it is something rather general and not immediately related to the topic at hand. As far as I can see, the inequality boils down to the following (I'll quote the full statements below). $$ \mathbb{E}[X] \leq \xi + u \mathbb{P}[X > \xi] $$ where $u$ such that $X \leq u$ . Why is that? I've looked at various basic tools such as Markov or Chebyshev inequalities as well as inequalities for tail probabilities but none seems to apply here. First application This considers (something like) the estimation error of a truncated estimate. $$\begin{aligned} & \left.\mathbb{E}\left[\sup _{\substack{f \in \mathcal{F}_n(\Theta) \\ \|f\|_{\infty} \leq \beta_n}} \mid \frac{1}{a_n} \sum_{i=1}^{a_n}\left[f\left(\mathbf{X}_i\right)-Y_{i, L}\right]^2-\mathbb{E}\left[f(\mathbf{X})-Y_L\right]^2\right]\right] \\ & \quad \leq \xi+2\left(\beta_n+L\right)^2 \mathbb{P}\left[\sup _{\substack{f \in \mathcal{F}_n(\Theta) \\ \|f\|_{\infty} \leq \beta_n}}\left|\frac{1}{a_n} \sum_{i=1}^{a_n}\left[f\left(\mathbf{X}_i\right)-Y_{i, L}\right]^2-\mathbb{E}\left[f(\mathbf{X})-Y_L\right]^2\right|>\xi\right] \end{aligned} $$ Earlier, it is established that $$\sup _{\substack{f \in \mathcal{F}_n(\Theta) \\\|f\|_{\infty} \leq \beta_n}}\left|\frac{1}{a_n} \sum_{i \in \mathcal{I}_{n, \Theta}}\left[f\left(\mathbf{X}_i\right)-Y_{i, L}\right]^2-\mathbb{E}\left[f(\mathbf{X})-Y_L\right]^2\right| \leq 2\left(\beta_n+L\right)^2$$ Second application This considers the variation of the estimate $m$ in cells $A_{n}(\mathbf{X}, \Theta)$ of the random forest. The variation is defined as $\Delta(m, A)=\sup _{\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x}^{\prime} \in A}\left|m(\mathbf{x})-m\left(\mathbf{x}^{\prime}\right)\right|$ and thus upper-bounded by the supremum norm $\|f\|_{\infty}:=\sup _{x \in[0,1]}|f(x)|$ . $$ \begin{aligned} \mathbb{E}\left[\Delta\left(m, A_n(\mathbf{X}, \Theta)\right)\right]^2 & \leq \xi^2+4\|m\|_{\infty}^2 \mathbb{P}\left[\Delta\left(m, A_n(\mathbf{X}, \Theta)\right)>\xi\right] \end{aligned} $$
