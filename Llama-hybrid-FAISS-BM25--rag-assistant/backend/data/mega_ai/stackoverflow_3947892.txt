c# Drag and drop functionality

In short, I want to make an application in which users can drag a file form their finder (mac), or their computer explorer (PC) to a location on my application, and then have that dragged file be loaded into the application. I don't have any kind of access to any drag and drop events (Supposedly), as I am using a rendering engine for all the GUI. (This is being made in Unity3D, to be exact) Anyways, what I REALLY need to know, is how to get the file path of whatever file the user happens to be dragging at any particular time. I can take care of detection of where the file was dragged, loading the file into the app, etc. Any help? P.S: Even though I may not have access to drag and drop events, classnames, and etc, it is still helpful to hear about them!
