Disable Shadowbox.JS on certain Wordpress themes

I am trying to set up two versions to my Wordpress website: Full website, for computers, and Mobile version, for smartphones. I achieve this by means of a user-agent detection script included in the header.php of the full theme (path is whatevercorp.net/wordpress/wp-content/themes/moneyblog/mobiledetect.php ). If it detects a mobile browser, then it redirects to the mobile theme. I use the Theme Switcher plugin for this. if($mobile_browser>0) { header( 'Location: http://whatevercorp.net/?wptheme=mobiblog' ); ("mobiblog" is the name of my mobile theme) My questions is this: I use Shadowbox for photos in the full version, but I want to prevent loading it altogether as soon as a mobile browser is detected . I don't want users to view photos with shadowbox when on the mobile version. If the plugin is disabled the links work just fine and *whatevercorp.net/photosfromevent/img_001.jpg* is opened no problem. Ideally I'd like to introduce something in the if statement from mobiledetect.php. Someone suggested this add_filter('shadowbox-js', '__return_false'); but it doesn't do the trick. How can I condition the loading of the Shadowbox plugin? Thanks!
