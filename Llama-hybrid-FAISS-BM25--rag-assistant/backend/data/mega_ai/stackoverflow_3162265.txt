Sue 'em. Seriously: If you have some money, talk to a good, nice, young lawyer who knows their way around the Internets. You could really be able to do something here. Depending on where the sites are based, you could have a lawyer write up a cease & desist or its equivalent in your country. You may be able to at least scare the bastards. Document the insertion of your dummy values. Insert dummy values that clearly (but obscurely) point to you. I think this is common practice with phone book companies, and here in Germany, I think there have been several instances when copycats got busted through fake entries they copied 1:1. It would be a shame if this would drive you into messing up your HTML code, dragging down SEO, validity and other things (even though a templating system that uses a slightly different HTML structure on each request for identical pages might already help a lot against scrapers that always rely on HTML structures and class/ID names to get the content out.) Cases like this are what copyright laws are good for. Ripping off other people's honest work to make money with is something that you should be able to fight against.
