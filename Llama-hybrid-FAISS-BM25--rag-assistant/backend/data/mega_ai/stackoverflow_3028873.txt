Language restrictions on iPhone partially lifted?

Apparently Apple has changed some term in the agreement again. From http://www.appleoutsider.com/2010/06/10/hello-lua/ section 3.3.2 is now Unless otherwise approved by Apple in writing, no interpreted code may be downloaded or used in an Application except for code that is interpreted and run by Apple’s Documented APIs and built-in interpreter(s). Notwithstanding the foregoing, with Apple’s prior written consent, an Application may use embedded interpreted code in a limited way if such use is solely for providing minor features or functionality that are consistent with the intended and advertised purpose of the Application. instead of the original No interpreted code may be downloaded or used in an Application except for code that is interpreted and run by Apple’s Documented APIs and built-in interpreter(s). I am more interested in embedding Lua, but other people have other embeddings they want to make. I am wondering how you ask for permission, and what they mean by the terms "minor features" and "consistent" and how will Apple interpret this section? It seems to have enough loopholes to drive a real firetruck through. (BTW this is a terribly important question for me an my product.)
