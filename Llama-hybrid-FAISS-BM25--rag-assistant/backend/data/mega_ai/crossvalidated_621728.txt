Bayesian linear model vs classical linear model

My question is a quite general and simple question. I was wondering what is the advantage of a bayesian linear model over a classical linear model if, for the bayesian model, only non-informative priors are used? Shouldn't be more or less the same? What I mean by linear model is the well-known model that links an observation vector of dependent variables $\mathbf{Y}$ of size $n$ and a matrix $\mathbf{X}$ (design matrix) containing the information about independent variable of size $n\times p$ , $p\leq n$ , such that $$ \mathbf{Y} = \mathbf{X}\theta, $$ where $\theta$ is the parameter to be optimized.
