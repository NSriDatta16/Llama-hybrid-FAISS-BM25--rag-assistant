You could use a package called structural change which checks for breaks or level shifts in the data. I have had some success in automatically detecting level shifts for non-seasonal time series. I converted your "value" into a time series data. and used the following code to check for level shifts or change points or break points. The package also has nice features such as chow test to do chow test to test for structural breaks: require(strucchange) value.ts Following is the summary from the breakpont function: Breakpoints at observation number: m = 1 36 m = 2 16 31 m = 3 16 36 46 m = 4 16 24 36 46 m = 5 8 16 24 36 46 m = 6 8 16 24 33 41 49 Corresponding to breakdates: m = 1 1991 m = 2 1971 1986 m = 3 1971 1991 2001 m = 4 1971 1979 1991 2001 m = 5 1963 1971 1979 1991 2001 m = 6 1963 1971 1979 1988 1996 2004 Fit: m 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 RSS 0.8599316 0.7865981 0.5843395 0.5742085 0.5578739 0.5559645 0.5772778 BIC -71.5402819 -68.5892480 -77.7080112 -70.6015129 -64.1544916 -56.2324540 -45.9296608 As you can see the function identified possible breaks in your data and selected two structural breaks at 1971 and 1986 as shown in the plot below based on BIC criterion. The function also provided other alternative break points as listed in the output above. Hope this is helpful
