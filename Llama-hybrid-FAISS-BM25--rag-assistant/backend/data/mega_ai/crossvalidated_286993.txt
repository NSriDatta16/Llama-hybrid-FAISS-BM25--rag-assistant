Alternative to MDS plot for random forest visualisation

I'm using R and 'randomForest' package for binary classification. I can MDS plot (from the same package) the initial (more or less) class separation based on training set. However, this doesn't allow me to show the newly classified data and doesn't have the most intuitive meaning. Is there some alternative to MDS plot for random forest visualisation? Ideally one I could use to show new data as well.
