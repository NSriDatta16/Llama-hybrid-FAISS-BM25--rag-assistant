Fitting ARIMA to time series with missing values

I have a stationary time series object (e.g.: xts) consisting of weekly continuous data. Values are missing for several weeks, sometimes randomly but often in chunks of 4-5 weeks. I want to fit a time series model to the data for forecasting using the "arima" function. Does the function "arima" take into account the missing weeks? Looks like it does not use the time index at all! Here's my code: o.time.pos I expect ar1 and ar2 to be same but they are not. summary(ar1) Call: arima(x = y.ts.na, order = c(2, 1, 2), method = "ML") Coefficients: ar1 ar2 ma1 ma2 0.4367 0.1801 -0.6410 -0.3319 summary(ar2) Call: arima(x = y.ts.na1, order = c(2, 1, 2), method = "ML") Coefficients: ar1 ar2 ma1 ma2 0.5302 0.1231 -0.7473 -0.2298 It seems in the second method, even though the xts object has information on the missing weeks, the "arima" method does not seem to use this and instead treat the time as contiguous. In the above example, it seems to treat the data for 2010-11-12 as the data for the week after 2010-09-24 and so on. This is clearly wrong. I understand that putting together the likelihood with missing data is not possible. What are my options to fit a time series model to data with missing data? I know one method is to impute the data (using, for example, How to use auto.arima to impute missing values or How do I handle nonexistent or missing data? ) and then fit but is it possible to fit without imputation?
