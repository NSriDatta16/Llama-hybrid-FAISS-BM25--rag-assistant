Do (javascript) cookies work when outside of a webserver context?

Say i have a file test.html that uses javascript cookies. (a) When i access the file like this: http://mydomain.com/test.html cookies work fine. (b) But if i just double click the file to directly open it in a browser (with a url like: file:///folder_path/test.html) then cookies do not work. Is this the way it should be or am i doing something wrong? Is there a solution for persistent storage in case (b) when you want to just open an html file and read some data from a previous session?
