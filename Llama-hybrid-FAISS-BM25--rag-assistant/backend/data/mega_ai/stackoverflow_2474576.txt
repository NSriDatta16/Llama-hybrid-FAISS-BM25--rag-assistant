You are correct there is some weirdness with the "checked" attribute. It seems that it takes effect only after it is actually rendered by the browser. (And not while just in a fragment.) For example, using your code, var obj = $(' '); obj.attr('disabled', 'disabled'); obj.attr('type', 'checkbox'); obj.attr('checked', 'checked'); var wrapper = $(' ').append(obj); alert(wrapper.html()); // notice, no checked attr in this string... $('body').prepend(obj); // but now notice, it IS checked when it's drawn! I know this isn't really an "answer" per se, but wanted to let you know you're not going nuts. I'd be curious also to know why this is the case. Best of luck!
