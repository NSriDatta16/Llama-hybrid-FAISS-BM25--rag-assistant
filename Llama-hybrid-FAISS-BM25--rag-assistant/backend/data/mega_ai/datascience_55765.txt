Classification problem using features with unequal sizes

I am relatively new to Machine Learning/ Deep Learning and currently I am working on a classification problem. I have many 2D images and each of them is a cross section of a specimen showing the deformation after applying a load. The images show the edges of the specimen with the same color and the deformed edges are shown with different colors. I want to use the values of pixels as one of the feature to my classification problem. At the same time I also want to use the load value, the co-ordinates of the position of impact as features. Therefore my problem would look something like this Feature 1 Feature 2 Feature 3 Class Vector of size N*1 Vector of size 3*1 Scalar value m1 Class A Vector of size N*1 Vector of size 3*1 Scalar value m2 Class B and so on.. I would like to know if there is a way to deal with this kind of problem or if there are any papers which focus on approaches to deal something similar to this. Any kind of help is really appreciated. If any clarification is needed from my side, do let me know. Thank you.
