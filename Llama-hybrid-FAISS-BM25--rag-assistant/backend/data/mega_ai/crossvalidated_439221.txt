What are the best ways to generate Bayesian prior estimates using beliefs of non-statisticians?

I work with a lot of qualitative researchers and designers. Many of whom interact with users and develop strong, often accurate intuitions about how the data should look. I frequently try to quantify their intuitions so that we can integrate their beliefs with new data. Asking the right question is tough and the way I ask the question changes what the priors look like. I have a few different methods (mostly for proportions): make wagers on the probability of different hypotheses and then turn that into Bayes factor how many people out of X would do Y? I go reverse and ask people what their posterior beliefs are following running into fake new data (you can estimate their prior from that) Clearly this isn't an academic exercise, but one to create engagement over new data. What questions would you ask someone who doesn't know much about stats to accurately quantify their beliefs into a Bayesian prior and how do you go from their answer to a prior (R code would be nice)?
