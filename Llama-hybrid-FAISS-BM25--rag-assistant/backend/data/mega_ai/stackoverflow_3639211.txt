No, To create a Vector of initial capacity max you should Vector v = new Vector (max) Note two things: Usage of Integer and not int. In Java, Integer is an object, while int is a primitive type. Collections can't use primitive types, they use objects. The capacity of the v is not limited to max elements. It will grow if you insert more than max Integers. But let the API page do the talking The Vector class implements a growable array of objects. Like an array, it contains components that can be accessed using an integer index. However, the size of a Vector can grow or shrink as needed to accommodate adding and removing items after the Vector has been created. Each vector tries to optimize storage management by maintaining a capacity and a capacityIncrement. The capacity is always at least as large as the vector size; it is usually larger because as components are added to the vector, the vector's storage increases in chunks the size of capacityIncrement. An application can increase the capacity of a vector before inserting a large number of components; this reduces the amount of incremental reallocation.
