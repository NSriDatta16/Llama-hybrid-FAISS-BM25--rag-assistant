Bootstrapping time series data: Circular block bootstrap

I have some very basic questions on circular block bootstrap applied to time series (dependent data). Let's suppose, I have a time series data like the one below. I know it's non stationary, but for demonstration purpose let's assume this to be an index of time series data: x Applying a Moving block bootstrap I get the following results with the block length of 3 with replacement of size 10: [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] [,9] [,10] [1,] 3 4 5 1 2 3 2 3 4 2 [2,] 7 8 9 2 3 4 4 5 6 8 [3,] 3 4 5 2 3 4 7 8 9 5 [4,] 7 8 9 6 7 8 4 5 6 8 [5,] 4 5 6 8 9 10 3 4 5 8 [6,] 7 8 9 3 4 5 1 2 3 7 [7,] 8 9 10 3 4 5 2 3 4 6 [8,] 6 7 8 4 5 6 2 3 4 6 [9,] 8 9 10 6 7 8 8 9 10 6 [10,] 8 9 10 5 6 7 7 8 9 2 In order for us to avoid edge effects (both 1 and 10 will always start or end respectively) a variant of the moving block bootstrap is circular block boot strap: Below are my questions: Should I just create a new vector by just appending the x with x as below and then apply block bootstrapping? Is this circular block bootstrapping ? x.circle 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 If I apply block bootstrap with same size block size 3 and 10 replicates I get the following results, How should I trim the data to reduce it to length 10? should I pick the first 10 elements or should I start some where in the middle and pick 10 elements : What are the benefits of Circular block bootstrapping ? I intuitively understand what an edge effect is, can you someone please explain why it is important ?
