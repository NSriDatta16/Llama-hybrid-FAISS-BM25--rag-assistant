The recommended solution is to use the .jspCap to add space above or below the track rather than padding or borders. I've implemented this here: http://jsfiddle.net/Mfest/6/ Note that I set the top and bottom caps to different sizes to make things appear to line up equally - I think that the rounded corners/ borders may be confusing the jScrollPane calculations a little bit. Another demo of the caps in action: http://jscrollpane.kelvinluck.com/caps.html
