What's your idea of "a lot of data"? The only reason that you'd need to split this across multiple databases is if you are trying to save some money with shared hosting (i.e. getting cheap shared hosts and splitting it across servers), or if you feel each database will be in the 500GB+ range and do not have access to appropriate storage. Note that both of these reasons have nothing to do with architecture, and entirely based on monetary concerns during scaling. But since you haven't created the site yet, you're putting the cart before the horse. It is very unlikely that a brand new site would use anywhere near this level of storage, so just create 1 database. Some companies have single databases in the 1,000+ TB range ... there is basically no upper bound on database size.
