Unsupervised VAE model?

I would like to use VAE model in unsupervised learning to generate new feature. Most of the examples are supervised and semi-supervised learning. Where can I find for unsupervised learning or can it be possible in unsupervised learning for generative model? Edit: I use my training data ( 1,42 ) features with no label. Most of the example for VAE (i.e MNIST data) used images. But in my case, I only use 2D coordinates to train VAE. My data are (x1,y1,x2,y2,...., x42,y42), (1,42) dimension. Sample data: `[297.425 341.30002 280.1 295.625 275.375 240.5 287.975 213.725 294.275 186.95 332.07498 254.675 355.69998 215.3 380.9 201.125 402.94998 188.52501 357.275 268.85 391.925 234.20001 412.4 215.3 432.875 202.7 380.9 287.75 410.82498 259.4 432.875 238.925 450.2 224.75 391.925 306.65 428.15 290.9 448.625 272 469.1 254.675]` And train and predict. But, when I predict, my reconstruction is not good even I get good training accuracy. I want to get back true or nearly x1,y1,x2,y2,...,x42,y42 reconstruction coordinates. That is why I used VAE model to generate new features based on training features. I will use this in noisy reconstruction.
