Interpret GLM Output (Gaussian - identity) with B0 close to zero

I am doing a GLM (guassian - identity) using R. I am modeling different variables (8) to try to understand what creates brand value in an organization. Some extracts from the output are: Null deviance: 74.343 on 81 degrees of freedom Residual deviance: 32.870 on 69 degrees of freedom (19 observations deleted due to missingness) AIC: 185.75 I get that one of the coefficients is not significant (B0): Intercept: Estimate Std.Err. t value Pr(>|t|) 0.005959 0.109103 0.055 0.956602 However, some of the other variables are significant. For example: Consumer_attitude_1: Estimate StdErr. t value Pr(>|t|) 0.512708 0.115864 4.425 3.52e-05 Consumer_attitute_2: Estimate StdErr. t value Pr(>|t|) -0.385588 0.152224 -2.533 0.013585 Based on these results, Would it be valid to say that the variables shown as significant in the model may have an impact on brand value even when B0 is close to zero? Thanks very much!
