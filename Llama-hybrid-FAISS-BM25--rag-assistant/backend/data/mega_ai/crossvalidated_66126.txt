That example can give some intuition of the problem, but is actually not a rigorous proof at all: that's only an example where many samples are needed to get a "good" space coverage. There could be (and there are indeed, e.g. hexagons in 2D already) much more efficient coverages than a regular grid... (the sophisticated area of low discrepancy sequences is devoted to this) ...and proving that even with such better coverings there is still some curse of dimensionality is quite another issue. Actually in certain function spaces there are even ways to circumvent this apparent problem.
