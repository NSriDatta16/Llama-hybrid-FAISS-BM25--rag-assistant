How does one use Reinforcement Learning (RL) to solve a unconstrained optimization problem?

I want to solve the a standard unconstrained optimization problem: $$ \min_{x \in R^D} f(x) $$ and I want to solve it using RL (Reinforcement Learning). One reason is that $f$ might be anything so it might be non-differentiable (so gradient descent tools are not obviously applicable). How does one go about doing this using RL? What would be the formulation as an MDP? What would be the policy and what would be the best algorithm to find the minimizer?
