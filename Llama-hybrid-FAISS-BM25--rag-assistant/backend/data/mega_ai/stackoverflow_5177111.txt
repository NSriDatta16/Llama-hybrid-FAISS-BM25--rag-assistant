How to use JQuery AJAX with Cloud9 IDE?

I'm using Cloud9 IDE. My goal is to be able to develop applications that use JQuery AJAX. I have these 2 files: test.htm the result $.get('test.php', function(data) { $('.result').html(data); alert('Load was performed.'); }); `2. test.php echo "hello world"; ?> The problem is that the paragarph with class "result" should read "hello world". Instead, the entire contents of the php file are being added. How do I get the php file to just echo "hello world" as expected?
