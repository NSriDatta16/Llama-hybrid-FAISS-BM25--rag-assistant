It is a common a mistake to misplace assertions. If you want to use lookahead, the pattern is something like this: ^(?!.*paragraph$).*$ This matches ( as seen on rubular.com ): something something para paragraph something something But doesn't match: something paragraph So the key difference here is that we start looking ahead at the beginning of the string, before we match .* (or .{0,1000} in your case). Of course, what we're looking for isn't simply paragraph$ , but rather .*paragraph$ . That said, to check that a string doesn't end with something of finite length, lookbehind when supported is the most natural solution. ^.*$(?
