Should I train my classifier with examples that are outside my classes of interest? And should I create an "others" class to handle them?

This is a 2 part question regarding a multi-class classifier based on a neural network that is expected to predict whether the input image has a cat or a dog. If shown something different (like a man), it shouldn't predict either cat or dog. Q#1: Should I train the model with examples that don't contain cat or dog so as to make it able to handle such cases? Q#2: How many output nodes (2 or 3) do I need in the output layer of a neural network? 2 node output layer: 1st output node: Cat, yes/no 2nd output node: Dog, yes/no Expected predictions Cat -> [1, 0] Dog -> [0, 1] Man -> [0, 0] 3 node output layer: 1st output node: Cat, yes/no 2nd output node: Dog, yes/no 3rd output node: Others, yes/no Expected predictions Cat -> [1, 0, 0] Dog -> [0, 1, 0] Man -> [0, 0, 1]
