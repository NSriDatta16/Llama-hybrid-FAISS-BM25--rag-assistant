Dreamweaver allows you to move the elements around to any part of the page, without being constrained. When you drag elements around the page, it automatically creates CSS code for absolute positioning and custom coordinates. If you're already using Visual Studio, you can define a CSS style for an element, then give it absolute positioning and custom coordinates (e.g., positioning: position: absolute; left: 100px; top: 100px). After you do that, Visual Studio allows you to drag elements all around the page in its design mode, instead of elements being constrained to hugging the left side of the page. I hope that helps.
