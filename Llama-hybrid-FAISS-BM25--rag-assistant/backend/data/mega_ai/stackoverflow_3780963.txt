Dynamically create classes in Java

I would like to create a class in Java based on the fields defined in my XML config file: For example: if the XML file contains (the syntax has been maligned for posting): then internally it will create a class Event such as Event(String agentHost, String subSystem) that the client can instantiate. Note: the client always knows that this class will be called "Event" but does not know how many "mandatory parameters" it needs to pass. On the other hand if I have a XML file with: then it will create Event(String eventHost) that the client can use for instantiation.
