Actually many of the things mentioned by you are already discussed by the major Bayesian handbooks. In many cases those handbooks are written for frequentists by training, so they discuss many similarities and try translating the frequentist methods into Bayesian ground. One example is the Doing Bayesian Data Analysis book by John K. Kruschke or his paper translating $t$-test into Bayesian ground. There is also another psychologist, Eric-Jan Wagenmakers who with his team talked a lot about translating frequentist concepts into Bayesian ground. Decision-theoretic concepts like loss functions, unbiassness etc. are discussed in the The Bayesian Choice book by Christian P. Robert. Moreover, some of the concepts mentioned by you are not really Bayesian. For example, loss function is a general concept and only if you combine it with prior distribution you get a Bayes risk. It is also worth mentioning that even if you are self-declared Bayesian, then you probably already use a lot of frequentist methods. For example, if you use MCMC for estimation and then calculate mean of the MCMC chain as your point estimate, then you are using a frequentist estimator, since you are not using any Bayesian model and priors to get the estimate of the mean of the MCMC chain. Finally, some frequentist concepts and tools are not easily translatable to Bayesian setting, or the proposed "equivalents" are rather proofs of concept, then something that you'd use in real life. In many cases the approaches are simply different and looking for parallels is a waste of time.
