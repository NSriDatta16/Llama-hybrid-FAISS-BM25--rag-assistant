Averaging vector images to get in-between images

I am looking for an algorithm that takes vector image data (e.g. sets of edges) and interpolate another set of edges which is the "average" of the two (or more) sets. To put it in another way, it is just like Adobe Flash where you "tween" two vector images and the software automatically computes the in-between images. Therefore you only specify the starting image and end image, then Flash takes care of all the in-between images. Is there any established algorithm to do this? Especially in cases like different number of edges?
