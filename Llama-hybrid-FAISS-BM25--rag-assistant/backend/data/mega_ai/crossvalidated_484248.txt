How to see two time series following same distribution easily?

This is related to Stoeffer's Time Series book Chapter 3, Example 3.6 Let $w_t\sim iid Normal(0,25),v_t\sim idd Normal(0,1)$ where $25,1$ are variances. It is not hard to check the following two time series have the same distribution at any $t$ by normality and MGF. $x_t=w_t+1/5 w_{t-1}$ $y_t=v_t+5v_{t-1}$ Why $x_t,y_t$ have the same distribution obvious or intuitive? It will take at least 2 lines to check same distribution by MGF though it is easy. However, the book seems finding this fact obvious without arguing the case.
