The PCA process identifies the directions with the greatest variance. Since the variance of a variable is measured in its own units squared, if all the variables are not standardized to have zero mean and standard deviation of one before calculating the components, those variables whose scale is larger will dominate the rest. Therefore, it is not necessary to scale the variable Y, simply scale the variables of the matrix X so that all the vectors have the "same distance".
