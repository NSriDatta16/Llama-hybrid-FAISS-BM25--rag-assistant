How to setup my Ubuntu PC for these Deep Learning frameworks?

I need to use both NVIDIA Digits and tensorflow Object Detection API for different deep learning purposes. I am a bit lost with the compatibility issues, especially for what concerns CUDA. So which version should I choose for DIGITS, Tensorflow-gpu, CUDA and Object Detection API in order to make everything work?
