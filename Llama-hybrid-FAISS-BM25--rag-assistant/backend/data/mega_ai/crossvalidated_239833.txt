The paper explaining MCMCglmm indicates the sense in which Hadfield used the term "trait," which isn't quite the same as that recommended by the Wikipedia page . In my experience, I think that in common usage Hadfield's usage is generally accepted. In biology, a trait is some characteristic of an organism. The distinction in usage is whether the "trait" is the name of the characteristic or the actual value of the characteristic. The Wikipedia page says: For example, eye color is a character of an organism, while blue, brown and hazel are traits . (Original emphasis). In the MCMCglmm paper, Hadfield uses names of characteristics ( tarsus and back ) as examples of "traits" rather than their actual values. In practice, I would also tend to use "trait" for the name of the characteristic rather than the value.
