Divide a string into smaller parts & organize a structure (C-programming)

I am still learning C and I'm having some trouble figuring out how to handle this. Well, I have two structs: struct myStruct { ... struct myString *text[5]; ... } allStructs; struct myString { char part[100]; }; The objective is to have allStruct[n] point to 5 different parts of a text divided into lines of 100 chars each. So I allocate the space: allStructs = calloc(n, sizeof(allStructs)); Then, assume that I have a filled char text[500] that I want to divide into 5 parts, and have allStructs[n].text[n].part point at a given part of the text. Can anyone help me with how I proceed?
