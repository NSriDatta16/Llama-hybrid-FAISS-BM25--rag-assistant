Why are there large coefficents for higher-order polynomial

In Bishop's book on machine learning, it discusses the problem of curve-fitting a polynomial function to a set of data points. Let M be the order of the polynomial fitted. It states as that We see that, as M increases, the magnitude of the coefficients typically gets larger. In particular for the M = 9 polynomial, the coefficients have become finely tuned to the data by developing large positive and negative values so that the corresponding polynomial function matches each of the data points exactly, but between data points (particularly near the ends of the range) the function exhibits the large oscillations. I don't understand why large values implies more closely fitting the data points. I would think the values would become more precise after the decimal instead for better fitting.
