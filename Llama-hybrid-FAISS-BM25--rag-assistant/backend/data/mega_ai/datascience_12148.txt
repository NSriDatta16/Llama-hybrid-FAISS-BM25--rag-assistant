feature importance via random forest and linear regression are different

Applied Lasso to rank the features and got the following results: rank feature prob. ================================== 1 a 0.1825477951589229 2 b 0.07858498115577893 3 c 0.07041793111843796 Note that the data set has 3 labels. The ranking of the features for the different labels are same. Then applied random forest to the same data set: rank feature score =================================== 1 b 0.17504808300002753 6 a 0.05132699243632827 8 c 0.041690685195283385 Notice that ranking are very different from the one produced by Lasso. How to interpret the difference? Does it imply the underlying model is inherently nonlinear?
