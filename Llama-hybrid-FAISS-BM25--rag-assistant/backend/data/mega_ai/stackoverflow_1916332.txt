Most of the code coverage tools I've encountered do not seem to have a way to combine test results from different or overlapping subsystems. As you have pointed out, this is a very useful ability. Our SD Test Coverage tools do have this ability and are available for Java, C, C++, C#, PHP and COBOL. In fact, the SD test coverage tools can combine test coverage data from multiple languages into a single monolithic result, so that you can get an overview of test coverage for your multi-lingual applications. It is able to show the coverage on all the source langauges involved, as well as provide summary reports.
