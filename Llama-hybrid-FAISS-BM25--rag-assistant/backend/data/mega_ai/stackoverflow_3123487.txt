Simple visualizations/drawings in ASP.NET

I want to generate simple drawings in my asp.net website based on some data I deal with in this application (I want to represent structure of Neural Networks). I know about existing System.Drawing namespace but Im curious if there are solutions more appropriate for asp.net. It would be great if such visualization could be interactive (e.g. mouseover on some element displays extra infromation) but this is not necessay at the momment. And idea or hints?
