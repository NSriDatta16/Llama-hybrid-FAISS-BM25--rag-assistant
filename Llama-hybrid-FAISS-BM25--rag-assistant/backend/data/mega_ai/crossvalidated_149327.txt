Automatic keyword extraction: using cosine similarities as features

I've got a document-term matrix $M$, and now I would like to extract keywords for each documents with a supervised learning method (SVM, Naive Bayes, ...). In this model, I already use Tf-idf, Pos tag, ... But now I'm wondering about nexts. I've got a matrix $C$ with the cosine similarities between the terms. Is there a possibility to use this similarities as a feature for my model? My idea was for term $i$ in document $d$, to use the average of the cosine similarities of all the terms in document $d$ with term $i$. Is this useful?
