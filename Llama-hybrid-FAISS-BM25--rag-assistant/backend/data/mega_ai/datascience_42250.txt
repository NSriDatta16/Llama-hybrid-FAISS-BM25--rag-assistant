Automatic legal document reviewing advice

I am lawyer from SK. I also like programming and Maths. Which technology should i use for this task? Automatic legal document reviewing. I have a big data set of specific contracts in slovak. Now I want to build my model. Model will tell good/bad contract + bold probable errors based on data set. I don´t know much about NLP, so I´am just asking for advice. Which tech should I study for this task? Word2Vec, keywords extraction algos etc. Thank you guys for your time.
