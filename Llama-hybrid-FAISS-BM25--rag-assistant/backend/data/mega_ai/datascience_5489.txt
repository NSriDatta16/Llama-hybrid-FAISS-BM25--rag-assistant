Extracting model equation and other data from 'glm' function in R

I've made a logistic regression to combine two independent variables in R , using pROC package and I obtain this: summary(fit) Call: glm(formula = Case ~ X + Y, family = "binomial", data = data) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.5751 -0.8277 -0.6095 1.0701 2.3080 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -0.153731 0.538511 -0.285 0.775281 X -0.048843 0.012856 -3.799 0.000145 *** Y 0.028364 0.009077 3.125 0.001780 ** --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 (Dispersion parameter for binomial family taken to be 1) Null deviance: 287.44 on 241 degrees of freedom Residual deviance: 260.34 on 239 degrees of freedom AIC: 266.34 Number of Fisher Scoring iterations: 4 > fit Call: glm(formula = Case ~ X + Y, family = "binomial", data = data) Coefficients: (Intercept) X Y -0.15373 -0.04884 0.02836 Degrees of Freedom: 241 Total (i.e. Null); 239 Residual Null Deviance: 287.4 Residual Deviance: 260.3 AIC: 266.3 Now I need to extract some information from this data and I'm not sure about how to do it. First, I need the model equation: suppose that fit is a combined predictor called CP ; could it be CP=-0.15-0.05X+0.03Y ? Then, the resulting combined predictor from the regression should present a median value, so that I can compare median from the two groups Case and Controls which I used to make the regression (in other words, my X and Y variables are N-dimensional with N = N1+N2 , where N1 = Number of Controls , for which Case=0 , and N2 = Number of Cases , for which Case=1 ).
