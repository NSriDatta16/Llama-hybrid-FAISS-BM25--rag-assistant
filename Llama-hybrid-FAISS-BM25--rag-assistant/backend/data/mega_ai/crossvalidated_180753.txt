Having worked on any number of projects where factor analysis (or PCA) was used as a dimension reducing step, I would answer your first question with a resounding yes , these methods are quite useful in making a sprawling set of survey items more manageable or tractable for further analysis. That said, I've known teams to literally spend weeks deciding on the "right" set of factors. As far as I'm concerned, this is a waste of time. Get in and get out...that's the best way to deal with exploratory PCA since, as a consequence of having done a PCA, you are not permanently obliged to retain and use these dimensions in interpreting the results of your analysis. It simply means that PCAs are a very useful and ultimately disposable intermediate step -- e.g., they are particularly useful in running any additional multivariate analyses such as clustering or segmentation. You would want to retain and focus on the granularity of the specific question items for later insight and interpretation in favor of the factor dimensions which, since they are composite variables summarizing every input feature can deliver counterintuitive findings. Of course, if your goal is to create new, scaled dimensions in the psychometric sense of that term, then this exploratory work would naturally evolve into a later confirmatory phase with the contingent tests of reliability, discriminant and convergent validity of the resulting scaled domains. That's a different and more rigorous objective from the typical applied use of PCAs. Wrt question #2, you would want to do the work of PCA on the full sample, breaking out the control group from others as part of the post-hoc profiling of the results. Since your data is unbalanced (control group after you have developed a PCA not while developing the dimensions. This is a general "best" practice or rule of thumb for which I do not have a good reference. Question #3 concerns the validity of judgment versus statistically driven domains. In my experience, it's not all that common for "judgment" driven factors to be confirmed (with a high degree of precision) by a statistically driven PCA but it definitely does occur. That said, whether one does one approach or the other is entirely a subjective team decision -- both can be motivated or justified and neither one would be "wrong" in any strategically important sense of that word. Usually decisions like these are a function of the culture in which the work is being done and the most senior people usually determine that, not the analyst crunching the numbers. If there's an upside to exploratory PCA it lies in the possibility for "serendipitous" findings and insights that the a priori , theoretically driven domains or factors might have missed.
