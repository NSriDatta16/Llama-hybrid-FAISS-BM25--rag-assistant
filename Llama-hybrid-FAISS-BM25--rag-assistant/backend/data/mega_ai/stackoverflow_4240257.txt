With C99, you can perform the check as: #define I_AM_LITTLE (((union { unsigned x; unsigned char c; }){1}).c) Conditionals like if (I_AM_LITTLE) will be evaluated at compile-time and allow the compiler to optimize out whole blocks. I don't have the reference right off for whether this is strictly speaking a constant expression in C99 (which would allow it to be used in initializers for static-storage-duration data), but if not, it's the next best thing.
