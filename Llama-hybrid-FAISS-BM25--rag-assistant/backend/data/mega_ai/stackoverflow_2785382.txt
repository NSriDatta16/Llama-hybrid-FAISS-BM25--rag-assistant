Probability and Neural Networks

Is it a good practice to use sigmoid or tanh output layers in Neural networks directly to estimate probabilities? i.e the probability of given input to occur is the output of sigmoid function in the NN EDIT I wanted to use neural network to learn and predict the probability of a given input to occur.. You may consider the input as State1-Action-State2 tuple. Hence the output of NN is the probability that State2 happens when applying Action on State1.. I Hope that does clear things.. EDIT When training NN, I do random Action on State1 and observe resultant State2; then teach NN that input State1-Action-State2 should result in output 1.0
