I often take source code with me home If I think I'll need to use it again some day. I have a nice library of code snippits that I take with me from job to job so don't be supprised if those same developers bring code to your company that they've written elsewhere and save you time by doing that. Keep in mind that I only keep code that won't violate IP. I'm talking about basic routines, nothing ground breaking. To answer your question, you can try an approach that Microsoft takes with its windows kernel developers. Sit them down on work stations that are disconnected from the internet, no email allowed and screen them for portable storage devices when they leave work :-)
