If you want to remove all traces of the pull form your history then you need to use an extension as Bert F suggests (the philosophy in mercurial is to never change history) if you dont mind history containing your mistake you have two slightly different options hg update -C -r which will create a new branch at the version you specify or hg revert -r which will stay on the same branch but create a new uncommited change undoing everything.
