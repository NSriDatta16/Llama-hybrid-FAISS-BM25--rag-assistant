All the crackers and spammers on the globe want to know the same thing :-) The most simple solution is to write a small command server and install that on all Windows clients. The command server should wait for connections from the main server, save the commands in a batch file and execute them. That should be just a couple of lines of code in any modern language. If you want something bottled, you can try rexec by MKS . Just be aware of the security risks. If you want to do this without installing anything on the Windows client, Google for malware sites or talk to someone with connections to organized crime.
