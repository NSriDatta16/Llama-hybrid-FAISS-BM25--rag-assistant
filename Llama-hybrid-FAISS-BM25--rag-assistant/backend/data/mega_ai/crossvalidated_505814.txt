How to test if the influence of changing a parameter is larger than the influence of random noise?

I have an algorithm under test that generates a vector of results, influenced by an underlying RNG. I want to test whether, when I change parameter a , the results change 'more' then when changing the seed of the RNG. My current method is: generate 10 result vectors using different seeds perform KS test between each of them to get their average difference generate 1 result vector with a fixed seed, changing parameter a perform a KS test between this result vector and the 10 ones from before compare results between first and second KS test I feel like there must be a better way out there.
