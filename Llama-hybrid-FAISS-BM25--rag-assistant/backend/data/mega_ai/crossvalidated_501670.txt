Discrete Time Logistic

I'm trying to use panel survey data to determine married event in life using discrete logistic regression. However, some observations enter the survey not the same time as other i.e. some enter in 1990 and others in 1995. Does everyone think it's fine if I use the duration that they enter the survey as t or period variable? Any comments will be much appreciated Thank you so much!
