The answer by John Kruschke is the right one. And is also explained on page 102 of "Bayesian Analysis with Python" (BAP). Since the explanation in BAP is very brief, and probably not clear enough (sorry about that!) I will give here a little bit more detail: We get $x'$, the centered version of $x$ by doing: $$x' = x - \bar x$$ Then we can write the linear model as: $$y = \alpha' + \beta' x' + \epsilon$$ if we replace $x'$ with $x - \bar x$, we get: $$y = \alpha' + \beta' (x - \bar x) + \epsilon$$ reordering we get: $$y = \alpha' - \beta' \bar x + \beta' x + \epsilon$$ Notice that this last equation is equivalent to $$y = \alpha + \beta x + \epsilon$$ where: $$\alpha = \alpha' - \beta' x$$ and $$\beta = \beta' $$
