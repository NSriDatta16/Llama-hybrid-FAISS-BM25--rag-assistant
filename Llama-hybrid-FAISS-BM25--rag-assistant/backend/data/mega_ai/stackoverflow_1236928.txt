Using locking in this way is often discouraged, with the recommendation being to use a dedicated lock field (class member variable). A dedicated lock field is of type Object and usually looks like this: private object _pendingTransactionLock = new object(); If the object itself has some threading awareness, this lock variable might belong in _pendingTransaction 's implementation class. Otherwise, it might belong alongside _pendingTransaction in the field's declaring class. You don't say what type _pendingTransaction is. If this is a built-in collection class that provides a SyncRoot property, that might be a good choice to lock on. See Jon Skeet's Choosing What to Lock On.
