Categorical variable that is both nominal and ordinal

In a dataset with house prices I encountered the variable BsmtCond that describes the general condition of the basement. It takes 6 values: Ex Excellent Gd Good TA Typical Fa Fair Po Poor NA No Basement I would like to find the best representation of this data to feed it into machine learning algorithm(s). It is not ordinal, since there is no consistent way to assign a number to 'NA' (where do you put it on "Excellent -- Poor" scale?). On the other hand, one hot encoding loses some information (like the fact that "Excellent > Good > Typical > Fair > Poor") that might be useful for developing a proper model.
