I've heard good things about ObjectListView but I haven't used it. It seems to have a very rich feature set. In the past when I used Windows Forms I would have killed for some of the issues it solves as compared to ListView. Note that it's not a DataGrid however. Not to sound like a shill but although you said free alternative, I still should mention the best Windows Forms datagrid I've ever used was Developer Express's XtraGrid. I've yet to see any grid in any UI technology come close to it in terms of usability and features.
