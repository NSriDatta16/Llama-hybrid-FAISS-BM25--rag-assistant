If you want users to pay attention to warnings, use them in moderation! The big problem with the UAC in Vista is that people are getting so many notifications, that they stop reading who is exactly requesting access to what , they just give permission without thinking. Another example is the delete confirmation in explorer when sending files to the recycle bin. I got so used to just hitting 'Ok' immediately after pressing 'delete', that I missed the fact that the dialog was telling me that the file would not be moved to the bin, but deleted immediately, for whatever reason. My personal fix: I disabled the delete confirmation for the recycle bin. If something can not be moved to the bin, I still get a message, and this time I know that it might be important, so I pay attention. Conclusion: Don't spam the user with messages, or the important warnings will get lost in the noise.
