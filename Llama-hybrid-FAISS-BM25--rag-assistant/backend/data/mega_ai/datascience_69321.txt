A Python library to convert text into character-level embedding and LSTM

I'm trying to recreate an experiment described in a paper where each character in a URL is converted to a 128-dimension embedding. My dataset looks like below. I'm having trouble figuring out how to do the conversion process in Python. Can anyone suggest a library and function that will allow me to convert the domain column in my dataframe? The paper describes the process in the diagram shown below. Bahnsen, Alejandro Correa, et al.
