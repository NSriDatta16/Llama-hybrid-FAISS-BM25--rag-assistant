You can use sonar without Maven. you just have to tell it where the rport files are with properties: sonar.cobertura.reportPath, sonar.clover.reportPath, sonar.surefire.reportsPathâ€¦ See here: http://sonar.codehaus.org/tag/ant/ There's a tick box to set these values when configuring the build in hudson - it is called "Check if this project is NOT built with maven2"
