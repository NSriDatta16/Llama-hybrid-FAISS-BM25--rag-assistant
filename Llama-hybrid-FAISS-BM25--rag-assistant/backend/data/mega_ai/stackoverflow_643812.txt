VM Additions for ubuntu 8.10?

I know that VPC does not officially support Linux, but I was wondering if there are any ways to get things similar to the VM additions so that I can get: 1) A higher screen resoultion than 800x600 2) Faster graphics, no jerkey movements 3) Drag and Drop support Number 3 really isn't that important but it would be nice.
