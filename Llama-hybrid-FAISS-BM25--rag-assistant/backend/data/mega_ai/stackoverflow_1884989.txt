There's something wrong with the hinting in this font file. In Linux (which tends to ignore TTF hinting) it renders beautifully, but on Windows it seems to come out with extremely poor hinting and no ClearType, regardless of which browser is in use. It even displays wrong in Notepad, so it's not a web-embedding problem as such. I can't immediately see the cause... I thought adding a TTF ‘gasp’ table might fix it, but it seems not to help.
