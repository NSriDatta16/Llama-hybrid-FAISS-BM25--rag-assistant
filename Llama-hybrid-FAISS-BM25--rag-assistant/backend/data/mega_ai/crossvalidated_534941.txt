Interpretation of Multinomial Logistic Regression model fit in R

I have fitted a multinomial logistic regression model in R. The data has 35 independent variables and the dependent variable has 3 levels. I do not find information on how to interpret the outcome of the model. Here is the plot of the model after cross validation. How do I assess the multinomial deviance and how far is it from saturated model? The summary of the fit is as follows: Call: cv.glmnet(x = xtr, y = ytr, alpha = 0, family = "multinomial", type.multinomial = "ungrouped") Measure: Multinomial Deviance Lambda Measure SE Nonzero min 0.004034 0.8741 0.003612 35 1se 0.028460 0.8775 0.003510 35
