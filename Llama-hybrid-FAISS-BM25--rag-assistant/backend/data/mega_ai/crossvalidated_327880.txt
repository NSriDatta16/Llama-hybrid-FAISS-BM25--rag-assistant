Why sigmoid function in logistic regresion can make good estimations on non-linear data?

If I understood correctly, then in the logistic regression we select the parameters of the sigmoid function so that it maximally approximates the input data. I can understand why logistic regression works fine when data distributed like in this photo. But why it still works fine with data like in this photo? How to approximate it correctly? I'm sorry for bad quality of photoes.
