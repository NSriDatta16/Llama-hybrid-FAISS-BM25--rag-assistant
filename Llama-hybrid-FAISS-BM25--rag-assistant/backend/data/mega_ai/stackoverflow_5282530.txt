Javascript is initially the programming language that interacts with User Interface on a HTML document. Javascript on DOM / HTML can: Apply, change, unset CSS styles of an element in the document Addition, modification, removal of document elements UI event handling (such as onclick, onchange, etc.) AJAX, JSON, etc. After years of development and expansion, the language is now dependent on the platform's ability. For example on Adobe AIR, Javascript's features can be as wide as an average C# application (meaning to say that you can write Javascript to read/write files, web cam, JSON parsing, socket etc.) Basically my point is, Javascript is ultimately just a language. You can run the same language on multiple platforms, and the objects pre-defined by the platform is accessed by you as the developer using Javascript.
