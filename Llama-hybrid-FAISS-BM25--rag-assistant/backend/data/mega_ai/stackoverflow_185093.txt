You can't do this in XML Schema 1.0. In XML Schema 1.1 you will be able to use the element to do it, but I'm guessing you want something that you can use now. You can use Schematron as a second layer of validation that will allow you to test arbitrary XPath assertions about your XML document. There's a fairly old article about embedding Schematron in XSD that you might find helpful. You'd do something like: This element's attribute is 'foo' but it holds an element that isn't a bar. This element's attribute is 'hello' but it holds an element that isn't a world. Or of course you can switch to RELAX NG , which does this in its sleep: foo hello
