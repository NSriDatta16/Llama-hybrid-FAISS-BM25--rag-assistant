Implementation varies by platform, but here are a few general cross-platform considerations: It is good to have an established overall layout into which visual elements can be "plugged." It's harder (but still possible) to support completely different general layouts through skinning. Develop a well-documented naming convention for the assets (images, HTML fragments, etc.) that comprise a skin. Design a clean way to "discover" existing skins and add new ones. For example: Winamp uses a ZIP file format to store all the images for its skins. All the skin files reside in a well-known folder off the application folder. Be aware of scaling issues. Not everyone uses the same screen resolution. Are you going to allow third-party skin development? This will affect your design. Architecturally, the Model-View-Controller pattern lends itself to skinning. These are just a few things to be aware of. Your implementation will vary between web and fat client, and by your feature requirements. HTH.
