Regarding your second question (other models for time series analysis and forecasting), you can consider structural time series models . These models consist of building blocks defining a model for different unobserved or latent components such as trend, cycle or seasonal component. They are usually represented in state-space form, so that the Kalman filter and smoother can be employed to evaluate the likelihood function and to extract an estimate of the components. The textbooks referenced below are good sources to study these models. For an introduction, you may check this online document and this post , which gives an example of the forecasts obtained for the components and for the overall series based on the basic structural time series model (level, trend plus seasonal component).
