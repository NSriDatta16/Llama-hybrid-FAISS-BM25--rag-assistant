Use object's method in a jstl page

I have a model with this method: public List getPriviledgeNames() I'm trying to display a list of checkbox in my jstl page, and I'd like to checked only the ones which their name is in the list returned from my model. So I have something like: Clickthrough Details I'd like to add the checked="checked" only their name is in the list provided by my model's method. Is there a way to do this WITHOUT using scriptlet? I'd like to have no java code inside my pages... Thanks for any helps! Roberto
