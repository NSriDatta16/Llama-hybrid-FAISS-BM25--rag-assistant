Efficient minimal spanning tree in metric space

I have a large set of points (n > 10000 in number) in some metric space (e.g. equipped with Jaccard Distance ). I want to connect them with a minimal spanning tree, using the metric as the weight on the edges. Is there an algorithm that runs in less than O(n 2 ) time? If not, is there an algorithm that runs in less than O(n 2 ) average time (possibly using randomization)? If not, is there an algorithm that runs in less than O(n 2 ) time and gives a good approximation of the minimum spanning tree? If not, is there a reason why such algorithm can't exist? Thank you in advance! Edit for the posters below: Classical algorithms for finding minimal spanning tree don't work here. They have an E factor in their running time, but in my case E = n 2 since I actually consider the complete graph. I also don't have enough memory to store all the >49995000 possible edges.
