It looks like this was caused by a bug (or a feature?) in Protege. When I exported the inferred ontology with a new name, Protege changed the definitions of xmlns(blank) and xml:base to the name of the new file, but it did not change the definition of the actual namespace. xmlns="http://xyz.com/helloOwl.owl" => xmlns="http://xyz.com/helloOwlInferred.owl" xml:base="http://xyz.com/helloOwl.owl" => xml:base="http://xyz.com/helloOwlInferred.owl" xmlns:helloOwl="http://xyz.com/helloOwl.owl" => xml:base="http://xyz.com/helloOwl.owl" => Since I fixed that it seems to work. My fault not having examined the the actual source with the necessary attention.
