What is the meaning of these subscripts in iid random variables?

I've been studying statistics on my own and I'm having a hard time understanding some notations. On this page: http://scipp.ucsc.edu/~haber/ph116C/iid.pdf , specifically on the second paragraph, the author writes: $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n$ are iid random variables. My question is: Are $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n$ numbers? I mean, there is a random variable $X$ and $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n$ are just outcomes of $X$ ? If not, how come can I take an average of $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n$ if they are not numbers?
