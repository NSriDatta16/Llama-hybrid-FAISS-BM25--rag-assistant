At the risk of being prosaic, the reason for the error function is that the standard interpretation is that the x is given and one is trying to best describe (or predict) the y component. So there is no error in the 'x'. For example you might try and understand (or predict) the closing price of a stock tomorrow based on today's closing price . Similarly one could try and understand the average temperature tomorrow in terms of today's average temperature. Obviously these examples are simple minded, but that is the idea. Incidentally something most people don't realize, but I think is clear from your examples, is that if one regresses y against x the regression line doesn't have to have any particular resemblance to the regression of x against y. Orthogonal regression is the term for a regression where one tries to find the line that minimizes the distance of points from a line. For example if one was trying to understand the relationship between the price of IBM stock and the price of AAPL stock, that would be the appropriate method.
