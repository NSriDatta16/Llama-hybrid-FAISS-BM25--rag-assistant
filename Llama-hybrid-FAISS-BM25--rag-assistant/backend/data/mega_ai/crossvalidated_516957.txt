Signs of eigenvectors : Dual PCA

I'm trying to perform a DUAL PCA with numpy, this is are the steps I'm following: 0 - Standardize X, where X is for instance (m,n) 1 - Find eigenvalues, eigenvectors of X.T dot X Plot the projections (2D in this case) In this is case the projections are points ... 2 - Find eigenvalues, eigenvectors of X dot X.T Plot the projections (2D in this case) In this case I'm projecting the arrows. The problem I'm facing the graph obtained doesn't make sense, I think the problem is that the eigenvectors of X dot X.T & X.T dot X should have the same sign which isn't the case. Is there a way to detect if the eigenvectors of X dot X.T & X.T dot X are pointing in opposite direction or insure that they point in the same direction ? Thank you
