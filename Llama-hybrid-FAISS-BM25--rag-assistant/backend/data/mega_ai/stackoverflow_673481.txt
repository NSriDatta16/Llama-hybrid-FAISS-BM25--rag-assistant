Thanks for all the help & attention but i finally discovered the problem. The problem was the issue of the win service running locally with the web service. This problem was specific to the Windows server 2003 operating system. to resolve the problem i had to create a New Value in the registry editor called DisableLoopbackCheck, and set it to 1.
