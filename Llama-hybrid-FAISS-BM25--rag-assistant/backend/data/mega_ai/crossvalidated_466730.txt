The coefficient estimates the effect of the corresponding IV on the DV; the standard error of that coefficient estimates the average error in that coefficient's estimates; the t-test tells you how many times larger the coefficient itself is than the average error of the values it estimates. If y'=30x, but the observed values also vary on average by 30x from the predicted values, then the coefficient would only be consistent with wholly random differences between the predicted and observed values. The t-test tells us how many times larger the coefficient is from that error. This is consistent with other applications of a t-test; a t-test of two samples of data tells you how many times larger the difference between the sample groups' means are than the variation within the samples.
