Using GIT to merge folders?

I have a Magento installation that is using GIT to maintain the code revisions for our theme design changes etc. Once in a while we use third party plugins that are provided in a zip file. As an example, the file structure would be something similar to the following: /app - /code - /design /skin - /frontend - /m The directories only include files that need adding to the Magento installation,however if I simply drag and drop on my Mac - it replaces the directories, losing any files that aren't included in the new plugin files. Is there a better/easier way to pull a plugin into the installation using GIT?
