Android image drag and move from one layout to another

Is it possible to move a ImageView from one layout to another. If i move an image from one layout to another i get an exception "java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Given view not a child of xyz layout" If i long press on a application icon, the app is moved from app list view to workspace. How does the launcher do this. How is it able to move the app icon from one layout to another layout ?
