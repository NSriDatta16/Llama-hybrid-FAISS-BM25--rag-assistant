Assessing P-values in linear regression when the purpose is prediction

I have a question regarding p-values in the linear regression.The purpose of using the linear regression model is mainly to predict future values with accuracy. As I read, when the purpose is prediction, I can somehow not may too much attention to multicollinearity and the assumption of the linear model. Some of my predictors are categorical variables: can I include the levels having non-significant p-values when I am only interested in prediction? The output is as follows: lm(formula = log(cost1) ~ log(cost2) + program + location+ month + type, data=data) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -0.88768 -0.10647 0.00169 0.09248 0.91612 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 0.1526869 0.1186113 1.287 0.19858 log(cost2) 0.9812236 0.0072015 136.253 This model gave me the best prediction among other combination of predictors. Can I still use this model even though not all p-values are significant or no?
