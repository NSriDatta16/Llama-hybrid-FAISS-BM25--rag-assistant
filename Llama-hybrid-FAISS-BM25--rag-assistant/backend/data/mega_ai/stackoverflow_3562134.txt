My view - it's unsurprising if your reaction is an emotional one, but that probably isn't the best reaction to have. Just because the pirate version is out there doesn't mean you'll lose all your income. If you give up straight off, you're probably just cutting off your nose to spite your face - certainly the pirates won't feel sorry because of it. You may lose some income, but anger/frustration/depression are most likely to do even more damage to your business. People will generally bare disproportionate costs to keep/protect something they percieve as theirs. This is used in lots of sales tricks and cons, and it may be affecting you here. It's easy to see each pirate copy as a lost sale (and some of them no doubt are), but trying to protect your software from the pirates may not be the pragmatic thing to do. The pragmatic thing to do is whatever builds your business, your income and your wellbeing. In general, I'll bet positive/constructive measures will leave you better off overall than defensive ones - though of course defense has its role to play. Too much anger/frustration/worry/etc will certainly count against the wellbeing bit (though I'm not advocating suppressing your feelings). One idea is to be in touch with your customers as much as possible (without spamming them). The better that people know you, the less likely they are to rip you off. Even the pirates (other than the hoarding non-users) are likely to read your online support archive - it might be a good place to "make eye contact" (I think O'Reilly use that term for a style of writing). Just don't complain too much - that'll only convince people you deserve to be ripped off.
