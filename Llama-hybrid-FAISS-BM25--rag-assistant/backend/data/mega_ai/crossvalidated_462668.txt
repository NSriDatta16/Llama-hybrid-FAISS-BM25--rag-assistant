I think the best way to know whether we should scale the output is to try both way, using scaler.inverse_transform in sklearn. Neural network is not robust to transformation, in general. Therefore, if you scale the output variables, train,then the MSE produced is for the scaled version. However, if you use that model to predict and use scaler.inverse_transform, and recompute MSE, it may be a different scence.
