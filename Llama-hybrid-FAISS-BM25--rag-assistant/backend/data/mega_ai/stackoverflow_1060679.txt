Cross Platform Flash Player Embedding

I need to embed the Flash player in a native application (C++) in a cross platform way (at least Windows and Mac OSX). I need to allow the Flash gui to make calls back to the native application to do things that Flash normally can’t do (e.g. write to the file system, talk to devices, loading native image processing libraries, etc). The Adobe AIR runtime is too restrictive so it is unfortunately not an option. I’ve used ActiveX hosting in Windows previously, but is there a cross platform gui toolkit that solves this problem for both Windows and OSX? If not what are my options for embedding Flash on OSX? EDIT: Must support Actionscript 3.0
