Sproutcore is an html 5 javascript application framework that is very strongly mvc. There is a learning curve, but once you get it you get very good separation of concerns between models, views, controllers. Coupled with SC's binding magic, you write very little glue code; i.e. when you load your models from the store the views update automagically. The only work you do is to create the bindings from views -> controllers -> models. It really is very elegant. I agree with you, as web applications get more and more complicated, MVC is only a good thing.
