What does vanishing gradient problem exactly mean?

I'm currently doing some stuff with ML, and I created a LSTM model to recognize activities such as walking or running. I have read that LSTM has advantages over traditional RNNs due to addressing the vanishing gradient problem. Could you please explain it to me with a simple example?
