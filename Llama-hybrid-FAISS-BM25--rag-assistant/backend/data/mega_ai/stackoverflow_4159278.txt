If by pickle you mean generically serialize you can always use the pcap import/export methods: rdpcap and wrpcap . wrpcap("pkt.pcap",pkt) pkt = rdpcap("pkt.pcap") Or you could start up your process and grab the packets in another process. If there is some pattern you can match, say a known port or source IP tcpdump will work: tcpdump -i eth0 -w FOO.pcap host 172.20.33.12 and \(udp or arp\) You can then read the generated pcap in as above: pkts = rdpcap('FOO.pcap')
