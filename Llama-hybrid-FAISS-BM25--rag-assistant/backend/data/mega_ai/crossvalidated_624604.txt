What statistical test should I use for my dataset - Pearson's or Spearman's?

I'm not quite sure what statistical test I should be conducting for my dataset. I am aiming to find the correlation between two variables (concentration of copper vs concentration of chlorophyll). My original graph used the averages of my data (chlorophyll concentration) with standard deviation at each copper concentration, but I was told that every data point had to be used when calculating a PMCC, as opposed to just averages... This new graph looks incorrect to me though. (Images attached below) ORIGINAL GRAPH: NEW GRAPH WITH ALL DATA (rough): Additionally, I am aware that my data is non-linear. However, the "anomalous" point at 5 mg/L can be scientifically explained, so I have opted to keep it in my graph. Does this mean I should be using Spearman's Rank instead? I am not really sure what that test is used for but would it tell me the degree of correlation between the two variables and would I use my averaged values or the whole dataset?
