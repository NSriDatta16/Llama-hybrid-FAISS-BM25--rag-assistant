With your data on monthly revenue and other related indicators, you can consider using a time series forecasting model like ARIMA or SARIMA to project the next month's revenue. You can also try using more advanced models like Prophet or LSTM if you have a large amount of data. Additionally, you can perform feature selection to identify the most important variables that influence your revenue and use those variables to train a regression model like Linear Regression or Random Forest.
