I faced the same problem of not knowing how to weigh the reconstruction and KL terms, and here I want to add an answer with some concrete values of $\beta$ (the weight of KL term) for future reference. In the $\beta$ -VAE paper , they seem to use the values of $\beta_{norm}$ ranging between $0.001$ and $10$ (Fig. 6 from the paper). They calculate $\beta_{norm}$ as follows: $$\beta_{norm} = \frac{\beta M}{N},$$ where $M$ is the size of latent space (e.g. $10$ ) and $N$ is the input size (e.g. $64 \cdot 64 \cdot 1 = 4096$ ).
