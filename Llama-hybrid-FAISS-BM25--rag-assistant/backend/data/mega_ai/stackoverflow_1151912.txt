methods to store binary files in SVN

Are There different methods to store binary files in SVN? if so, what are they, and how I modify the storage options? I read that there are 4 ways to store binary files in SVN: Compressed tar - import - export. Tar - import - export. import - export. Efficient check-in. Which of those are the most useful for time efficiancy? and how do I set the SVN to use any of those methods? Thanks, Oded. I have many small-sized binary files and a few large-sized ones. All are changed frequently. I'm currently working on CVS and switching to SVN soon and I wanted to know about ways to store binaries. I read Performance tuning Subversion (mentioned above) and found it useful but no examples made so I didn't exactly understand how to do each of the 4 ways he suggested. My basic question is weather or not the defaults are good (and what are they?) My first consideration is time-efficient and then space. Thanks :)
