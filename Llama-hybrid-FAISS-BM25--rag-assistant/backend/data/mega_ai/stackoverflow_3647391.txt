To address the globbing part of your question, the odd man out in your list is really supporting Windows. The UNIX way, and also a good way, to do it is to let the shell handle the globbing. You just get a list of files. I know no UNIX tool what does its own globbing (in basic cases like this). I'd suggest you don't do it yourself either, but rely on the shell. On Windows, you could refer people to using a shell with Cygwin, or something like that. Of course, Windows users usually eschew the command line, so if you build a GUI they'll be happy too. That doesn't cover your -r switch. But it gets difficult there. Do you want to provide to users the ability to specify "all files in subdirectories that have the extension .txt"? Note that modern shells like ZSH can do globs that recurse into directories, like: rm **/*.tmp and, as you say, you can always use find instead. So a recommendation here really needs to factor in the specifics of your tool. rsync benefits from implementing its own -r switch, but an hypothetical flipcase probably wouldn't.
