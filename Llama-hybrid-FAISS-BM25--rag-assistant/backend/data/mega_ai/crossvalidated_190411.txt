Maybe first try to encode your features, then try to find a solution for denoising? Have a look at here it might help. Once you encoded the features, you can apply denoising techniques which is common with numerical data in machine learning. For example, a simple linear regression or a neural network as an unsupervised feature learning can be useful. Although, encoding a noisy categorical data might not be easy.
