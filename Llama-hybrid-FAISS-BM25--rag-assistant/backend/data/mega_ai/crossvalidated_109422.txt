Assuming equal $n$s [but see note 2 below] for each treatment in a one-way layout, and that the pooled SD from all the groups is used in the $t$ tests (as is done in usual post hoc comparisons), the maximum possible $p$ value for a $t$ test is $2\Phi(-\sqrt{2}) \approx .1573$ (here, $\Phi$ denotes the $N(0,1)$ cdf). Thus, no $p_t$ can be as high as $0.5$. Interestingly (and rather bizarrely), the $.1573$ bound holds not just for $p_F=.05$, but for any significance level we require for $F$. The justification is as follows: For a given range of sample means, $\max_{i,j}|\bar y_i - \bar y_j| = 2a$, the largest possible $F$ statistic is achieved when half the $\bar y_i$ are at one extreme and the other half are at the other. This represents the case where $F$ looks the most significant given that two means differ by at most $2a$. So, without loss of generality, suppose that $\bar y_.=0$ so that $\bar y_i=\pm a$ in this boundary case. And again, without loss of generality, suppose that $MS_E=1$, as we can always rescale the data to this value. Now consider $k$ means (where $k$ is even for simplicity [but see note 1 below]), we have $F=\frac{\sum n\bar y^2/(k-1)}{MS_E}= \frac{kna^2}{k-1}$. Setting $p_F=\alpha$ so that $F=F_\alpha=F_{\alpha,k-1,k(n-1)}$, we obtain $a =\sqrt{\frac{(k-1)F_\alpha}{kn}}$. When all the $\bar y_i$ are $\pm a$ (and still $MS_E=1$), each nonzero $t$ statistic is thus $t=\frac{2a}{1\sqrt{2/n}} = \sqrt{\frac{2(k-1)F_\alpha}{k}}$. This is the smallest maximum $t$ value possible when $F=F_\alpha$. So you can just try different cases of $k$ and $n$, compute $t$, and its associated $p_t$. But notice that for given $k$, $F_\alpha$ is decreasing in $n$ [but see note 3 below]; moreover, as $n\rightarrow\infty$, $(k-1)F_{\alpha,k-1,k(n-1)} \rightarrow \chi^2_{\alpha,k-1}$; so $t \ge t_{min} =\sqrt{2\chi^2_{\alpha,k-1}/k}$. Note that $\chi^2/k=\frac{k-1}k \chi^2/(k-1)$ has mean $\frac{k-1}k$ and SD$\frac{k-1}k\cdot\sqrt{\frac2{k-1}}$. So $\lim_{k\rightarrow\infty}t_{min} = \sqrt{2}$, regardless of $\alpha$, and the result I stated in the first paragraph above is obtained from asymptotic normality. It takes a long time to reach that limit, though. Here are the results (computed using R ) for various values of $k$, using $\alpha=.05$: k t_min max p_t [ Really I mean min(max|t|) and max(min p_t)) ] 2 1.960 .0500 4 1.977 .0481 A few loose ends... When k is odd: The maximum $F$ statistic still occurs when the $\bar y_i$ are all $\pm a$; however, we will have one more at one end of the range than the other, making the mean $\pm a/k$, and you can show that the factor $k$ in the $F$ statistic is replaced by $k-\frac 1k$. This also replaces the denominator of $t$, making it slightly larger and hence decreasing $p_t$. Unequal $n$s: The maximum $F$ is still achieved with the $\bar y_i = \pm a$, with the signs arranged to balance the sample sizes as nearly equally as possible. Then the $F$ statistic for the same total sample size $N = \sum n_i$ will be the same or smaller than it is for balanced data. Moreover, the maximum $t$ statistic will be larger because it will be the one with the largest $n_i$. So we can't obtain larger $p_t$ values by looking at unbalanced cases. A slight correction: I was so focused on trying to find the minimum $t$ that I overlooked the fact that we are trying to maximize $p_t$, and it is less obvious that a larger $t$ with fewer df won't be less significant than a smaller one with more df. However, I verified that this is the case by computing the values for $n=2,3,4,\ldots$ until the df are high enough to make little difference. For the case $\alpha=.05, k\ge 3$ I did not see any cases where the $p_t$ values did not increase with $n$. Note that the $df=k(n-1)$ so the possible df are $k,2k,3k,\ldots$ which get large fast when $k$ is large. So I'm still on safe ground with the claim above. I also tested $\alpha=.25$, and the only case I observed where the $.1573$ threshold was exceeded was $k=3,n=2$.
