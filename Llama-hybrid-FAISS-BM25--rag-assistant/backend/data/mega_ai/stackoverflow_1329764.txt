I think the time command is wonderful. It's not exactly hidden but that doesn't stop people from asking "which function is faster" once in a while in comp.lang.tcl. Anytime you want to know "how long does this take?" or "which method is faster?" you just call it via the "time" command. No creating of objects, no math, no overhead, exceptionally simple. Other languages have a similar feature, though some are a bit less elegant.
