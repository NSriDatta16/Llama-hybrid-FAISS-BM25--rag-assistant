TFS 2010 - The server returned content type text/html, which is not supported error, solution?

I have a setup a new TFS 2010 build definition. When I run the build for this build definition I get the following error during a "GET" operation: "The server returned content type text/html, which is not supported" 13:48 Overall Build Process 00:00 Update Build Number 00:00 Create the Drop Location 13:46 Run On Agent (reserved build agent [Test] Agent - xyzbuild) 00:00 Delete Test Results Directory 00:00 Delete Binaries Directory 03:24 Delete Workspace 00:00 Delete Sources Directory 00:01 Create Workspace 10:11 Get Workspace C:\Builds\7\xyz\[Test] TFS 2010 xyzbuild\Sources\Source Code\xyz\Help\Help.aspx: The server returned content type text/html, which is not supported. The TFS 2008 builds which have been migrated to the new TFS 2010 server work fine, the problem is with only the new TFS 2010 build definition. Has anyone else faced a similar problem? Any solutions?
