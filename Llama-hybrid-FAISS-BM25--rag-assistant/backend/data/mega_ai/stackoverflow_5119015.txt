Unable to retrieve, modify an image element within a form

I'm having some trouble changing an image being displayed on a page by way of a dropdown menu ( select element) selection. Getting the dropdown menu to give me an alert when I make a selection works fine: function imageSelect() { var index = document.getElementById("myForm").availableImages.selectedIndex; var value = document.getElementById("myForm").availableImages.options[index].value; alert("test " + value); // alert box pops up upon list item selection } Even though the select element is embedded within a division, paragraph, and label tag, it still works. ("availableImages" is the name of this element) However, within the same function I am having an issue with changing the source of my image tag... Any ideas? Relevant markup My attempt to change the src in the same JavaScript function: document.getElementById["myForm"].getElementById["centreDiv"].getElementById["pics"].pic.src = "wolves.jpg"; This is a no go. Conclusion Perfect, Adarshr. Thank you for your help! I have a sneaking suspicion that my square brackets were the main cause of my issue; none the less, I very much appreciate your help!
