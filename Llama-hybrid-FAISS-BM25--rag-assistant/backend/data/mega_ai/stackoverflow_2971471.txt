Q3: Is there any easy way to use IronPython/IronRuby functions from C# or F#? You might have a look at Embedding IronPython into a C# application Basically, what it does (simplified code): var engine = Python.CreateEngine(); var scriptSource = engine.CreateScriptSourceFromString(@" def foo(s): print s", SourceCodeKind.Statements); var scope = engine.CreateScope(); scriptSource.Execute(scope); //Get a reference to the function Func foo = scope.GetVariable >("foo"); //Execute it Console.WriteLine(foo("a"));
