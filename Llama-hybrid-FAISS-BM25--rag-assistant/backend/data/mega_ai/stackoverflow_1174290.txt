Problem displaying the mysql content in Paragraphs

I insert questions(which might be a few paragraphs) in a sql table using php and than i diplay them on a webpage. but when i display the question it loses its formatting. I mean it will just show the whole question in one paragraph, even thou there were many paragraphs before. Question : ".$row2['Question']." $row2['Question'] --> is my question that i am getting from my sql table by running the SELECT query. So if i post something like : a s d f into my input box. the output looks like : asdf How should i resolve this? Best Zeeshan
