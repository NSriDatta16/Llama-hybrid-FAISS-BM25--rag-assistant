Converting logistic regression coefficient and confidence interval from log-odds scale to probability scale

I am trying to figure out whether exp or expit should be used when converting the regression coefficient from logistic regression. This paper said that: the exponential function of the regression coefficient (e^b1) is the odds ratio associated with a one-unit increase in the exposure. While this webpage said that: We can also transform the log of the odds back to a probability: $p = \exp(-1.12546)/(1+\exp(-1.12546)) = .245$, if we like. The webpage used the inverse of logit function (i.e. expit) but not the exponential function for converting the log-odds. Which one is correct? Or which one is better?
