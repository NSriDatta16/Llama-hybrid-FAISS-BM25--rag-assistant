Using base class methods to initialize derived class members

Is it legal? If so, do you consider it as good coding practice? I want to do something like this (nonessential details are not shown): class ItemStorage { int size() const; }; class SpecialStorage : public ItemStorage { public: SpecialStorage (...) : ItemStorage(...), items(ItemStorage::size()) {...} private: int items; }; I am pretty sure that it is OK if the method size is not virtual. What if it is virtual and the derived class doesn't overwrite it?
