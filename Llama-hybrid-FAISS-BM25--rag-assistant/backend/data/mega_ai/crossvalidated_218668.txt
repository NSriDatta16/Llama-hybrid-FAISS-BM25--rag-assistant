You could correlate the data for each participant thus ending up with $k$ estimates of the within person $r$ where there are $k$ participants. You could then average them either by taking the median or by converting using Fisher's hyperbolic arc-tangent transformation, averaging them, back transforming. That would be fine if you have equal numbers of sessions per participant, if not you would need to weight them. Alternatively you could average each participant giving two scores per participant which you could then correlate to give you the between subjects correlation. Each of these would be an answer to a possible scientific question.
