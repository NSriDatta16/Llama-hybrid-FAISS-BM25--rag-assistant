You can diff a submitted changelist against the depot at a previous state. In your history tab, (View -> History in Menu Bar), select the changelist of interest. Drag the changelist onto the previous changelist number (be sure you have the top level of your depot/workspace selected, or at least a high enough point to include all your changes). This will open up a dialog which will be a type of directory diff which will show all the changed files. Use the arrows in the toolbar to move between changed files. Use the drag and drop and drag the old file onto the new one to see the changes between the files. With the command line you can also do this: let's pretend your changelist is 1300 p4 diff2 ...@1299 ...@1300 but this uses the text-only 'diff'.
