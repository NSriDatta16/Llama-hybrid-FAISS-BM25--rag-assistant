iams additionally credit Vladimir Lenin with recognizing capitalist progress as important in the subsequent functioning of socialism: Socialism is inconceivable without large-scale capitalist engineering based on the latest discoveries of modern science. It is inconceivable without planned state organisation which keeps tens of millions of people to the strictest observance of a unified standard in production and distribution. We Marxists have always spoken of this, and it is not worth while wasting two seconds talking to people who do not understand even this (anarchists and a good half of the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries). Accelerationism was also influenced by science fiction (particularly cyberpunk) and electronic dance music (particularly jungle), with Fisher and Mackay noting Terminator, Predator, and Blade Runner as particular sci-fi works. Mackay and Avanessian also note the Neuromancer trilogy, with Iain Hamilton Grant stating "Neuromancer got into the philosophy department, and it went viral. You'd find worn-out paperbacks all over the common room." Fisher states of Land's "theory-fictions" from the 1990s, "They weren't distanced readings of French theory so much as cybergothic remixes which put Deleuze and Guattari on the same plane as films such as Apocalypse Now and fictions such as Gibson's Neuromancer." Mackay also notes Russian cosmism and Erewhon as influences, while Noys notes Donna Haraway's work on cyborgs. Cybernetic Culture Research Unit The Cybernetic Culture Research Unit (CCRU), a philosophy collective at the University of Warwick which included Land, Mackay, Fisher, and Grant, further developed accelerationism in the 1990s. Fisher described the CCRU's accelerationism as "a kind of exuberant anti-politics, a 'technihilo' celebration of the irrelevance of human agency, partly inspired by the pro-markets, anti-capitalism line developed by Manuel DeLanda out of Braudel, and from the section of Anti-Oedipus that talks about marketization as the 'revolutionary path'." The group stood in stark opposition to the University of Warwick and traditional left-wing academia, with Mackay stating "I don't think Land has ever pretended to be left-wing! He's a serious philosopher and an intelligent thinker, but one who has always loved to bait the left by presenting the 'worst' possible scenario with great delight...!" As Land became a stronger influence on the group and left the University of Warwick, they would shift to more unorthodox and occult ideas. Land suffered a breakdown from his amphetamine abuse and disappeared in the early 2000s, with the CCRU vanishing along with him. Works The Guardian has referred to #Accelerate: The Accelerationist Reader, a 2014 anthology edited by Robin Mackay and Armen Avanessian, as "the only proper guide to the movement in existence." They also described Fanged Noumena, a 2011 anthology of Land's work, as "contain[ing] some of accelerationism's most darkly fascinating passages." Mackay credits the publishing of Fanged Noumena with an emergence of new accelerationist thinking. In 2015, Urbanomic and Time Spiral Press published Writings 1997-2003 as a complete collection of known texts published under the CCRU name, besides those that have been irrecoverably lost or attributed to a specific member. However, some works under the CCRU name are not included, such as those in #Accelerate: The Accelerationist Reader. Concepts Accelerationism consists of various and often contradictory ideas, with Noys stating "part of the difficulty of understanding accelerationism is grasping these shifting meanings and the stakes of particular interventions". Avanessian stated "any accelerationist thought is based on the assessment that contradictions (of capitalism) must be countered by their own aggravation", while Mackay considered a Marxist "acceleration of contradictions" to be a misconception and stated that no accelerationist authors have advocated such a thing.
