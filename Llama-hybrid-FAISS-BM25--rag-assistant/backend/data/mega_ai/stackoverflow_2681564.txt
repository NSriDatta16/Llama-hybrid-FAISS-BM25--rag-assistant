I would test: Do you see http://yourapp.appspot.com/images/title.gif ? Are you sure that images folder is on your app root? Title.gif is a "working" image? I would recommend you to use a static folder to store your static contents organized in subfolders: Root static images stylesheets javascripts app.yaml and Mapping a url /images like this. - url: /images static_dir: static/images mime_type: image/png mime_type: image/png is optional; if not specified, the MIME type for a file will be derived from the file's filename extension.
