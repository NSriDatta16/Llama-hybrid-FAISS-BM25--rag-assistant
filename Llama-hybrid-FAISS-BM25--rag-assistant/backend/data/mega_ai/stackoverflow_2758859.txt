Organise the data as a tree? That way you can easily check if the next letter along works ... Edit: thinking about this more. If you set up a tree that has an array of pointers that is every supported input character you can easily jump to the right place in the array at that point in the tree to see whether there is another level to the tree there. It'll cost ya a fair bit more in memory usage but will be very quick ... A further edit: If you want to save a tonne of memory then you could easily set up a file that would be incredibly quick to scan through. If you take into account the fact that at every level node in the tree there is a fixed number of possible items then you can easily seek very quickly to the location you want in the file. This is O(1) for each character you enter. Therefore you have a search in O(n) for everything the user types.
