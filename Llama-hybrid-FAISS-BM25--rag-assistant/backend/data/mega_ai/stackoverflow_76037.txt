Pretty much any external drive can be used here, provided it has the space to hold your backups and enough performance to get the backups there. The specifics depend on your exact requirements. In my experience, FireWire tends to outperform USB for disk activity, regardless of their theoretical maximum transfer rates. And FireWire 800 will perform even better yet. I have found poor performance from FireWire and USB drives when you have multiple concurrent reads/writes going on, but with backups, it's generally more large sequential reads and writes. Another option that is a little bit more complex to setup and manage, but can provide you with greater flexibility and performance is external SATA (eSATA). You can even get Hot Swappable external SATA enclosures for even greater convenience, and ease of taking your backups offsite. However, another related option that I've had excellent success with is to setup a separate server to act as your backup server. You can use whatever disk options you choose (FireWire, SATA, eSATA, SCSI, FiberChannel, iSCSI, etc), and share out that disk storage as a network share (I use NFS and Samba on a Linux box, but for a Windows oriented network, a Windows share will work fine). You can then access the shares across the network and backup multiple machines to it. Also, the separation of backup server from your production machines will give you greater flexibility if you need to take it offline for maintenance, adding/removing storage, etc.
