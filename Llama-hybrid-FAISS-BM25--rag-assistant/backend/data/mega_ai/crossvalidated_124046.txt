I recently had to use ARIMA (simular to ARMA) and NN to do some time series prediction myself. I can't answer your question fully but I can give you some places to start. I should say I'm no expert. First tools There is a great NN library called FANN http://leenissen.dk/fann/wp/ its nice and mature and easy to use. Its a C / c++ library. As for ARMA / ARIMA I used the Forecast package for R http://robjhyndman.com/software/forecast/ it also contains many other forecasting tools (but not NNs). It contains nice features which try to optimise the ARIMA models for you (which is great if you are new to the topic). Form of data It wants to be a series of evenly spaced (in time) values. For instance whether the door was open or closed each second. Other issues The fact its binary data might be interesting... But its worth a go :) Good luck
