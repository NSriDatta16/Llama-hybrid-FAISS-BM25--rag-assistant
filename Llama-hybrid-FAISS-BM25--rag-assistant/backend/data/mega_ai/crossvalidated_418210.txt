Forecasting Sharp Peaks in a Time Series using Convolutional Neural Networks

I am having with me a time series data. Occurrences of sharp peaks in the variable value can possibly mean the onset of an undesired event. We thought of using a deep convolutional neural network to predict the values of this variable ahead in time using the methodology described in the paper here . We achieved decent results. In the figure below, I show the actual value of differential pressure from the plant in blue and the predicted values using CNN in orange. In here, you can see the zoomed in section around a peak. As you can see, apart from the sharp peaks, we are able to predict the values reasonably well. However, as mentioned earlier, to capture these peaks is our main interest here. I am sure this problem would have been faced by many who has worked on time series predictions using machine learning. I would be keen to know if someone has worked on a similar problem before and was able to approximate the sharp peaks. Any suggestion or reference towards a source for reading to get around this problem would also be greatly appreciated.
