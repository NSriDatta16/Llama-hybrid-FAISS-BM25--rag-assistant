You can use the method touchesBegan in UIView to detect the tap, so you will have to have a custom subclass of UIView for the viewcontroller's view that you would like to detect taps on. Then you'll have to use the delegate to message your view's controller so it can hide the navigationBar . - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { NSUInteger numTaps = [[touches anyObject] tapCount]; if (numTaps == 1) { [delegateController tapDidOccur]; } }
