Your understanding is mostly right, with the caveat that your MCMC sampler is able to converge to sampling from the distribution of interest in a reasonable time. Lets say for your MCMC sampler it takes 100,000 iterations before the sampler has converged to sampling from the proper distribution. It would be better in this case to have 1 chain run for 150,000 iterations than having two chains run for 75,000 iterations. Also, many convergence diagnostics require multiple chains to be run anyway. Finally, if the distribution you are sampling from is highly multi-modal you may want several chains with different initial configurations so that you are able to traverse the sample space rather then getting stuck in a few modes.
