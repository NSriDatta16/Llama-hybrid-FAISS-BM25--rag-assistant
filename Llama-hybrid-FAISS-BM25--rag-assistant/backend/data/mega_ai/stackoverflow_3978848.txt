TDD is certainly one set of bests practices. When retrofitting tests, I aim for two things code coverage and boundary condition coverage. Basically you should pick inputs to functions such that A) All code paths are tested and better if all permutations of all code paths are tested(sometimes that can be a large number of cases and not really be necessary if path differences are superficially different) and B) That all boundary conditions(those are conditions that cause variation in code path selection) are tested if your code has an if x > 5 in it you test with x = 5, and x = 6 to get both sides of the boundary.
