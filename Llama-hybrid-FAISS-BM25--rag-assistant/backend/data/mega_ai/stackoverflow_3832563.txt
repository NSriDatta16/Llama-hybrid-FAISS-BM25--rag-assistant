The methods of the Math class are static. So, in doing Math.round(average) the Math class itself is unchanged by what you've done - it only returns a value or acts upon the value you pass. So - static methods are useful for utilities. Things like StringUtils.removeWhitespaceFrom(textContent:String):String or BrowserUtils.openInNewWindow(url:String):void It's very unusual that you'd use a static method for anything else. Don't use statics like 'getInstance()' to create Singletons - look into a framework for dependency injection instead.
