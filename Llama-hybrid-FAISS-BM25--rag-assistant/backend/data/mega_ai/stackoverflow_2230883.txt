I have also thought about the same thing many times. After reading your questions and looking into your link I made small modifications to the custom python Sweave driver, that you link to. I modified it to also keep the source code and produce the output as well the same way that Sweave does for R. I posted the modified version and an example here: http://mpastell.com/2010/02/09/python-in-sweave-document/ Granted, it is not optimal but I'm quite happy with the output and I like the ability to include both R and Python in the same document. Edit about PyLit : I also like PyLit and contrary to my original answer you can catch ouput with it as well, although it not as elegant as Sweave! Here is a small example how to do it: import sys # Catch PyLit output a = range(3) sys.stdout = open('output.txt', 'w') print a sys.stdout = sys.__stdout__ # .. include:: output.txt
