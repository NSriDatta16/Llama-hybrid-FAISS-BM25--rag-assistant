Is SQL Server Express' 4GB limit affected by FILESTREAM enabled columns?

I have read some conflicting reports on the net about whether the 4GB limit of SQL Server Express takes into account the contents of FILESTREAM. Can anyone say for certain citing official documentation whether SQL Server Express storage limit is affected by FILESTREAM contents?
