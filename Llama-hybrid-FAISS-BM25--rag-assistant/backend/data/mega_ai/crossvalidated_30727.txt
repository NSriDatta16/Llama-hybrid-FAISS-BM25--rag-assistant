First of all, you must ask yourself if your problem is multilabel (i.e. a single URL can belong to several classes) or not (i.e. a single URL can belong to only one class). If you are in the former situation, go with a battery of binary classifiers, because this is a default way of doing multilabel problems. If the latter, the answer depends on a combination of shape of your data, the aim of your analysis and the method are you using -- probably you should just try both and select the best. Only note that some methods (like SVM) can't actually do multiclass classification because of how they are defined and thus internally use a battery of binary classifiers.
