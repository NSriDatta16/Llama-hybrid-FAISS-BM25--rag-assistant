Maintaining a Programmer Wiki

I was recently put in charge of the wiki for the development team. The wiki is still in its infancy, so I have a lot of room to work with. It goal is to house internal to the development team. Currently, the main piece of information that the wiki holds is Coding Standards. What are some best practices your dev team uses for its internal wiki? What information is important to have on a dev wiki? If you were to go to the wiki for your dev team what information would you expect to see? Is there some information that shouldn't go on the wiki even though it seems like a good idea? -- edit -- Also, is there a good way to organize the information? ( such as by layer ( data, ui), by porject, or other)
