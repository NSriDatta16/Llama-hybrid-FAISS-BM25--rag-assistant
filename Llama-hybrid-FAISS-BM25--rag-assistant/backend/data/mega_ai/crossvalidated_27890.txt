If you have, say, an autoregressive process, and you look at what is called the characteristic polynomial, that polynomial has complex roots (maybe some or all are real roots). If all the roots are inside the unit circle the process is stationary otherwise it is non-stationary. A test for unit roots is looking to see if the specific process is stationary based on the observed data (parameters unknown). A test for serial correlation is entirely different. It looks at the autocorrelation function, testing to see whether or not all correlations are zero (sometimes referred to as a test for white noise). The answer to the second question is that different problems require different tests. I don't understand what your book is describing. I see these tests as tests on individual time series. I don't see where independent and dependent variables enter into it.
