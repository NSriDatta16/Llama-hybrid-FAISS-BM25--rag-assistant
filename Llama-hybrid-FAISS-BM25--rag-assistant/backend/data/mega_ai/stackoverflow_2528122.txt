I use the single file method. I find it somewhat easier to organize the code when it consists of a single file, and cell titles make it very easy to jump around between methods. Also, if I create a new @-class, I might need to recreate the path before being able to use it, and I don't have the patience for that. Having said all that, I do not think that the single-file style is much better than the multi-file style; having lots of small, easy-to-look-through files might be very useful as well.
