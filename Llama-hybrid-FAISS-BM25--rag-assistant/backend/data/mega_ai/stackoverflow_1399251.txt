Plugin similar to dashboard

I'm looking for a plugin that will aggregate various reports from our maven project (which consists of many modules). I was using dashboard maven plugin but it doesn't seem to be updated lately and I have troubles with the reports it generates (mainly it makes only surefire reports, no pmd, findbugs, cobertura as it should). So I'm looking for replacement, are there any similar plugins for maven2?
