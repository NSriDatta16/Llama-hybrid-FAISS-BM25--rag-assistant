What are the limitations to SQL Server Compact? (Or - how does one choose a database to use on MS platforms?)

The application I want to build using MS Visual C# Express (I'm willing to upgrade to Standard if that becomes required) that needs a database. I was all psyched about the SQL Server Compact - because I don't want the folks who would be installing my application on their computers to have to install the whole of SQL Server or something like that. I want this to be as easy as possible for the end user to install. So I was all psyched until it seems that there are limitations to what I can do with the columns in my tables. I created a new database, created a table and when I went to create columns it seems that there isn't a "text" datatype - just something called "ntext" that seems to be limited to 255 characters. "int" seems to be limited to 4 (I wanted 11). And there doesn't seem to be an "auto_increment" feature. Are these the real limitations I would have to live with? (Or is it because I'm using "Express" and not "Standard"). If these are the real limitations, what are my other database options that meet my requirements? (easy installation for user being the biggie - I'm assuming that my end user is just an average user of computers and if it's complicated would get frustrated with my application) -Adeena PS: I also want my database data to be encrypted to the end user. I don't want them to be able to access the database tables directly. PPS. I did read: http://www.microsoft.com/Sqlserver/2005/en/us/compact.aspx and didn't see a discussion on these particular limitations
