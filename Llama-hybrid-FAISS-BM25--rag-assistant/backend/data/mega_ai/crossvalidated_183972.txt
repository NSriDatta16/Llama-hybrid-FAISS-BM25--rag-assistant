Determining the validity of ROC curves

ROC curves were generated using ROCR package using only actual and predicted labels(from a SVM) as input. Script: A1_prd Input: >head(A1) # Similar for A2 Original Predicted 1 -1 1 2 -1 -1 3 -1 1 4 -1 1 5 -1 1 6 -1 -1 Generally ROC curves have typical staircase/curve style appearance, but the plot generated by ROCR doesn't resemble it. I wonder if it is a valid ROC to infer. Please clarify.
