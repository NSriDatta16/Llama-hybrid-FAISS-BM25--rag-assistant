What kind of regression to use for multiple independent variables and multiple treatments

I am brand new to stats and trying to run my first regression based on an existing dataset I've been given at work, and I need some help being pointed in the right direction. I'm self taught, so apologies in advances as my knowledge and vocab on the topic is very patchy! In the survey participants have been tested on a topic, and we'd like to look at how their 1) age, 2) preexisting familiarity with the topic, and 3) daily news consumption habits have effected their performance. Participants were asked yes/no questions, so their responses have been recorded as either 0 (incorrect) or 1 (correct). We want to asertain the impact of participants' overall performance based on the three independent variables and controlling for the other two variables when examining each one. There are also four subtopics (treatments?) within the test we'd also like to individually assess the impact of the three independent variables against as well. I think should be running a multinomial logistic regression because two of the independent variables are categorical and because I can make age categorical by bucketing it into four age groups. But how do I analyze three independent variables across multiple 'treatments'/subtopics in one regression? Can I? I just don't know enough vocabulary to understand what to look up regarding the regression model type and multiple 'treatments' requirement, so I'm a bit stuck. Any insights or advice on which direct to go would be greatly appreciated!
