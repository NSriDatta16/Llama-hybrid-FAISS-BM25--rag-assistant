Your code looks good in terms of the data that is written. Are you absolutely sure that you're passing in the right src pointer? What happens when you run the code with a debugger such as gdb? It should halt on the segfault, and then you can print out the values of _storage.size() , src , and cnt . I'm sure you'll find that (at least) one of those is not at all what you're expecting. You might have passed an invalid src ; you might have passed an absurdly large cnt .
