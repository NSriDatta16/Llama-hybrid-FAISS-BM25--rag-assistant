A reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) is a Hilbert space - a complete, possibly infinite dimensional inner-product space, with some other conditions - which can be defined by reproducing kernels. They arise in various statistical and machine learning applications. Reference: Wikipedia: Reproducing kernel Hilbert space
