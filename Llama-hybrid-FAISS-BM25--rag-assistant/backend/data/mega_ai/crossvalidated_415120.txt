How to deal with the categorical variables with few data for prediction

The image below shows how the rating for the heating quality will affect sale price.The data is about apartments and it's properties.

Do we remove category or do we proceed? Second Question: What if the data we are trying to predict has a rating of "Very excellent" which do not belong in the testing data? Note: I have not built a model yet
