You are talking about "ordinal classification". It can be done modified using SVM (as already mentioned, it is also implemented in libSVM), using logistic regression , and even using decision trees , or artificial neural networks. You can even continuize your labels, perform regression analysis of your choice, and then descretize the output. Most of the methods I have mentioned above do that behind the scenes. Good luck
