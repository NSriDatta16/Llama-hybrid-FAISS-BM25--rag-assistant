GEE logit / Poisson versus mixed effects Poisson / logit

There's a way to do Poisson or logit mixed effects and Poisson or logit GEE in R. What's the difference between GEE and the mixed effects models for Poisson / logistic regression? I heard its the difference between estimating the population level numbers and the individual numbers (public health versus individual patient treatment), that is: GEE is like what if we gave everyone the treatment in the population including the non-sick, and mixed effects is like what if we gave individuals (sick and non-sick) the treatment. Is that right? (I'm sure lme4 , geeglm , glmm has a way to do these.) I heard GEE is a robust estimator that guards against covariance pattern misspecification, but mixed effects is better for missing data. Can someone explain that?
