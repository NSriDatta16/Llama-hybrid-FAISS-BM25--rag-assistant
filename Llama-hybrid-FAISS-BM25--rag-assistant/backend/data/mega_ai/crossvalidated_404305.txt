Understanding regression to mean

As far as I can understand regression to mean is that if I make a measurement, say the mean of the test scores of some students, when the measurement is repeated with the same student with same conditions, the mean of the test scores will be shifted toward the mean. Ideally, the mean in here is the case where the #of student goes to $\infty$ . Since each measurement can be seen as independent random variable, by the central limit theorem, the average of those measurements should be the mentioned mean in the limit, so that is why different measurement in a sense "shift" toward the mean in each time. Is my understand correct ? If not, how can one understand this phenomena in an intuitive way ?
