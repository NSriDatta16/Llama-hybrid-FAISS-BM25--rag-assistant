Just a comment to clear some of this up. Mac applications normally dont have installers. At all. They dont have a registry and normally you just drag the icon (which is actually a folder with the executables in a specific folder structure) into the applications folder. Thats it. Thats why if you have an executable with a nice icon and you put it in a .dmg image file nobody is gonna know the difference.
