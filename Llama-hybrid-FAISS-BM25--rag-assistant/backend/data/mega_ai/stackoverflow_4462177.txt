Magento - Simple Configurable Products Extension question?

Has anyone had any experience of using the Simple Configurable Products extension on Magento - http://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/Matt+Dean/extension/596/simple-configurable-products If so how would I set up a product to be priced on height x width dynamically? Or if anyone knows of a way that we can achieve the same outcome tha would be great. p.s. I'm running Magento 1.4.2.0. Thanks in advance
