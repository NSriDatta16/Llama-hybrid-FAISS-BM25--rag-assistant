Confusion on units for the Poisson distribution when it is used to model variables with units

This question stems from the comment section of this question: Bus wait time under Poisson distribution , where it seems that The properties of the Poisson don't make sense for times because the units don't match up. Standard deviation of times should be in minutes but the Poisson has variance = mean. Change the units to seconds or hours and you lose variance=mean, so it can't be Poisson. However, my response was that Wouldn't this imply the Poisson distribution cannot be model anything that has units? If the number of policies an insurance agent sells per week follows a Poisson distribution with mean of 3, the standard deviation would be $\sqrt{3}$ policies, and variance would be 3 policy squared, which seems legitimate? Furthermore, in the original question, I inquired about what would happen if we discretize time, rounding to the nearest minute, so that it is at least a discrete distribution taking on non-negative values - falling into the domain of Poisson distribution. My question is: what is preventing modeling of wait time in that problem with the Poisson model?
