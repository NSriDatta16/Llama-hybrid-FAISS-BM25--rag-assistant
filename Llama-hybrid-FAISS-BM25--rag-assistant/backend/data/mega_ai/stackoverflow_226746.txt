Is this problem more or less language specific (can non-JS people learn lessons here?) No. You could run into this kind of code in any language with branches and comparisons. Are there legitimate reasons code ended up this way? What approaches should be used to find/address the problem (code coverage, code review, blackbox testing, etc.) No, not really. I'd guess that code started out with something other than a Boolean comparison; maybe it was empty, numeric, or non-numeric, or empty, 1-5 chars, or more than 5 chars, something like that. When the logic was changed to empty or non-empty, the third block should have been removed - this would normally be caught in a peer review or something like that. Depending on the language, some compilers may even catch this. A review would catch it; black-box testing would not, because you wouldn't be checking the code, but white-box testing would (although you should also notice it as soon as you see the code, before any testing is actually done).
