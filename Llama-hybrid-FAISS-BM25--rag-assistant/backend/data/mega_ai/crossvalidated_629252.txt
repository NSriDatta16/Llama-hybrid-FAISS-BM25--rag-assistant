Is the average of N linear regression coefficients equivalent to the regression coefficients for the entire dataset?

There have been some questions that are a bit similar to this one. However, I do not feel like the answers given truly answer the following question. Suppose I have a large dataset of $nN$ points. I fit a simple linear regression model to it and obtain $\hat{\beta}_0$ and $\hat{\beta}_1$ . Are these coefficients equivalent to the average of the $N$ coefficients obtained by fitting to the $N$ sub-samples of size $n$ ? For this to be true I would need (taking $\beta_1$ as an example) $$ \beta_1 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{nN}(x_i-\bar{x})(y_i-\bar{y})}{\sum_{i=1}^{nN}(x_i-\bar{x})^2} $$ to be identical to $$ \frac{1}{N}\sum_{k=1}^N\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i^{(k)}-\bar{x}^{(k)})(y_i^{(k)}-\bar{y}^{(k)})}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i^{(k)}-\bar{x}^{(k)})^2} $$ where $k$ refers to the individual partitions of size $n$ . I already suspect that they are not equivalent from numerical testing. If they are not equivalent, is it possible to say that one produces more accurate estimates than the other?
