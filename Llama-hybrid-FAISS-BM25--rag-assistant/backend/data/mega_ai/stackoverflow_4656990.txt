How to move from untyped DataSets to POCO\LINQ2SQL in legacy application

Good day! I've a legacy application where data access layer consists of classes where queries are done using SqlConnection / SqlCommand and results are passed to upper layers wrapped in untyped DataSets/DataTable. Now I'm working on integrating this application into newer one where written in ASP.NET MVC 2 where LINQ2SQL is used for data access. I don't want to rewrite fancy logic of generating complex queries that are passed to SqlConnection / SqlCommand in LINQ2SQL (and don't have permission to do this), but I'd like to have result of these queries as strong-typed objects collection instead of untyped DataSets/DataTable. The basic idea is to wrap old data access code in a nice-looking from ASP.NET MVC "Model". What is the fast\easy way of doing this? Additionally to the answer below here is a nice solution based on AutoMapper: http://elegantcode.com/2009/10/16/mapping-from-idatareaderidatarecord-with-automapper/
