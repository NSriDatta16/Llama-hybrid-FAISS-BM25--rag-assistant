I'm not sure about X68C11, but my University of Michigan - Dearborn curriculum required me to program a 68HC11 using a cross-assembler called AsmIDE, which you can download at http://support.technologicalarts.ca/docs/HC12-related/ThirdParty/AsmIDE/ . That seems to be the only link to it I can find on the Internet, since the developer died and his websites were all shut down. If you want to use C, the same guy wrote a handy GCC IDE called EmbeddedGNU available at http://www.evbplus.com/hcs12_9s12/EmbeddedGNU_hcs12.html .
