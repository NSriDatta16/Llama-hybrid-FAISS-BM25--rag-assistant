Hot deployment (or fastswap as it's called in Weblogic) (redeploying your application without restarting the application server) is always a bit sticky. I haven't worked much with Weblogic, but for example JBoss supports hot deployment but discourages any reliance on it. According to this cite therd are a limited number of changes that a fastswap can handle. I think you're running into a similar problem. I suspect that you simply need to get used to restarting your application server every once in a while.
