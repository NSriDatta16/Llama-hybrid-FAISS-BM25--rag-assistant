Assuming the required width is bound to width , then you can do this: (format t "~{|~{ ~Vd~}|~%~}" width '((1 23 2 312) (23 456 1 7890))) 5 has been replaced by V and width has been added as an argument to FORMAT / edit: original answer did not correctly account for the nested directives In a format control string V may be used in place of any constant value, indicating that the corresponding value is to be taken from the argument list instead. You can try this: (setf width 5) (setf data '((1 23 2 312) (23 456 1 7890))) (format t "~{|~{ ~{~Vd~}~}|~%~}" (mapcar #'(lambda (r) (mapcar #'(lambda (v) (list width v)) r)) data) ) This format string requires the desired width to precede each value. The (mapcar ...) expression accomplishes this.
