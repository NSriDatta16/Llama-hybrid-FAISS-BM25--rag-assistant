If you are prepared to outlay a little cash, then The Pragmatic Programmers website has an excellent screencast series on the Ruby Object Model and metaprogramming. It's not very expensive and is a very comprehensive series that goes over a lot of cool stuff and worth every cent. I need to watch it again to try and get my head around some of the concepts, then I can be one of the cool meta crowd :)
