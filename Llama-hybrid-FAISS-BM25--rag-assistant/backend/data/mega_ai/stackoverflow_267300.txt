If your x & y points topologically lie on a grid, then you can use MESH. They don't need to have even spacing; they just need to be organized so that x(r:r+1,c:c+1) and y(r:r+1,c:c+1) define a quadrilateral on your mesh, for each row r and column c. If your data do not lie on a grid, but you know what the faces should be, look at the PATCH function. If you only have points and you don't know anything about the surface, you need to first solve the surface reconstruction problem. I've used cocone; there are other good packages there too. Once you have the reconstructed surface, then you can use PATCH to display it.
