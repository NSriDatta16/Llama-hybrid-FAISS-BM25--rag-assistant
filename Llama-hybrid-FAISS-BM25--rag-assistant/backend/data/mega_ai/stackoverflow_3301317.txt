There is a System.Diagnostics.Stopwatch class that can be used. Whatever code you test, run the test once to remove JIT costs and then run it again for the final timings. Most individual timing counts could be unrepresentative due to other factors on the PC - so run many iterations and then calculate the average runtime from that.
