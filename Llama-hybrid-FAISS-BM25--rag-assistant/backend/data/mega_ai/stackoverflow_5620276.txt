Cursor over WinForm control (c#, WinForm 4.0)

What is the easiest way to determine if my current cursor position is over a particular (WinForm) control? I can - of course - calculate the control's position and then check whether the cursor position is within this rectangel. But maybe there is something already existing for this.... I cannot use OnMouseOver event for this, because the decisions must take place within (another) event. In order to further explain here is what I do (in pseudo code). The problem is, when I start the drag event, then move to another control (outside this), release the mouse to finish the drop, the context menu is displayed on the "wrong" control (the drop target). This is what I want to avoid.... private void TableControlMouseDown(object sender, MouseEventArgs e) { ... // this is a User control with some sub controls // when selected start drag and drop if (SOMEConditions) { // start drag and drop operation DragAndDropWrapper dragAndDropWrapper = new DragAndDropWrapper(this.ObjectsToDrag, this); this._subControl.DoDragDrop(dragAndDropWrapper, DragDropEffects.Copy); } // context menu // check should go here // something like "is pt still over "this" or over the drag target ... Point pt = this._subControl.PointToClient(Control.MousePosition); this._myContextMenu.Show(this._subControl, pt); } -- as of today -- See below for the extension method I am using at the moment ...
