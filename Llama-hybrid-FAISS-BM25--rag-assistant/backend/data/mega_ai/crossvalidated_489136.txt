Can binomial logistic regression be used with repeated measure predictors?

I was reading about binomial logistic regression assumptions and a basic requirement seems to be : independence of observations. So I was wondering if predictors could be repeated measures (pre-post treatment) in a binomial logistic regression? I have a dichotomous dependent variable (categories are mutually exclusive and exhaustive; yes or no) and I have several predictors (pre-post treatment). I want to know if results at T0 and/or T1 predicts the outcome yes or no (e.g. does T0 performance status and/or T1 performance status are good predictors outcome?). Thank you very much for your help!
