The only thing that even comes close that I can think of is when you want to test your code for handling out-of-memory conditions. This is important on embedded systems that don't have swap space, where an out-of-memory is a fatal condition. If you want to get close to 100% code coverage with automated unit testing, you will have to figure out some way to make a specific allocation request fail from an automated unit test (which is easier said than done). Once you have that, you need to write a unit test for each allocation request to make sure you have the out-of-memory failure is handled correctly for that allocation (a lot of work).
