Technically, your example has unequal variances, which is a special, more complex case of the Stein estimation problem. See Stein Estimator with unequal variances or Stein Estimator with unequal variances - Part 2 for more details. However, given that n is rather large in your example and the underlying variances should not be so different, using the averages may be a practical although not entirely correct path.
