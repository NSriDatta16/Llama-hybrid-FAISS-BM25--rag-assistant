If you have your mail server set up already, then I would recommend using a library like Zend_Mail_Storage_Imap to read and parse your incoming messages. Parsing mail can be really complicated, and Zend takes a lot of the pain out of implementing tools to read incoming mail. If retrieving mail is slow, then I would also recommend processing mail with a cron on a regular basis, depending on how often you need to reference the information sent via email. http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.mail.read.html
