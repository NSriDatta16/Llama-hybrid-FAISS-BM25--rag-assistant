Computing confidence intervals for non-independent data

I am using the survey package in R to t-test data that not independent (it is a time series) by creating a survey object and identifying different months as "clusters" and then t-testing to see if the mean (over a whole year) is different from 0. The data looks something like this: ID Y month 1 .5 1 2 .24 1 3 .36 1 ... 200 .44 12 I create a survey object with the following line: clusterdat then t-test ($H_a: \mu \neq 0$) svyttest(y~0, design=mydata) The output contains a t-statistic, corresponding p-value, degrees of freedom, and the sample mean, but there is no option to calculate a confidence interval. Am I missing something? If not, how might I compute one myself? Is the $t^*$ for 95% confidence in this case the same as for a regular t-test (i.e. could I look it up by df in a regular $t$ table)? How would I compute the sample standard deviation for this data?
