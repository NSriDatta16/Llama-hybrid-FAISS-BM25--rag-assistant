This data is very similar to passenger data on the Paris subways that I had previously studied. Hourly activity (aside from the lead and lag effects of holidays) is somwehat consistent for weekdays but quite different patterns emerge on the weekends. Trends and level shifts along with significant changes in day-of-the-week patterns also are opportunities for good software analytics. One needs to incorporate not only hour-of-the-day BUT day-of-the-week structure and sometimes week-of-the-month and month-of-the-year patterns. Simple minded techniques which include separate and totally independent analyses of data like this just don't work. I suggest that you contact the folks at Automatic Forecasting Systems who have developed very sophisticated approaches to this thorny but very common time series problem. You can get them via http://www.autobox.com/cms/ . I was one of the developers of this system. In closing one also has to deal with anomalies, possible changes in parameters over time and changes in error variance over time. AUTOBOX routinely deals with these vexing problems/opportunities. If you would like to share your data , I would be happy to show you the art of the possible.
