Probability doubt

Im working on a problem that goes as -- There is a an initially unordered set of numbers. and the goal is to sort it. the sorting should be done by shuffling the numbers until they fall into their correct places(Yeah, Bogosort'ish :)) The shuffling has one optimization that if after a shuffling, any elements towards the beginning or towards the end of the list fall in their correct places, these elements will be fixed and the remaining elements will be shuffled using the above same logic. The problem is to calculate the average number f shuffles required to sort an initially unordered set of numbers, say 6. I know its a distribution sequence along the line of probability but am not able to completely zero in on it. Any suggestions/advise in the correct direction or approach would be greatly appreciated. Thanks
