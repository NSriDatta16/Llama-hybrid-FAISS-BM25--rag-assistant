Your understanding of logistic regression has some errors. The logistic regression equation is $$ \operatorname{logit}(E(Y))=\beta_0+\beta_1 x $$ Notice, there is no random part of the model on the right hand side. The linear part estimates the logit of the expected value of $Y$ exactly. The randomness comes from how $Y$ disperses around it's expectation. To write the model explicitly in your style, you would have to write something like $$ Y \mid x = \operatorname{Bernoulli}\left(p = \operatorname{logit}^{-1}(\beta_0+\beta_1 x) \right) $$ As a consequence, you cannot use OLS technology to fit a logistic regression. Logistic regressions are fit using iterative optimization, usually based off Newton's method.
