Can I put a table in a list item?

I am trying to fix a horrid nested table layout for a site. The page will have a variable number of elements that leverage Google charts. Instead of complex spaghetti code that tries to lay things out inside of table cells I want to use a horizontal UL so the content blocks will lay out cleanly regardless of the charts involved. The problem I am having is the Google charts components leverage tables. When a table element exists anywhere inside a LI the LI gets moved to the next line (assuming because table elements by default have a newline before and after). I have tried the various display modes for the table with no luck. Is this a lost cause? Example HTML code to illustrate the issue: #navlist li{ display:inline; list-style-type:none; } TEST TEST2 TEST TEST3 TEST TEST
