I know this answer is a litle (maybe a lot) late but you can also use the PartialView method if you mean to render an HTML fragment instead of the full page. Relevant Spark documentation An Application.spark file in the Views/Layouts folder or Views/Shared folder This is the most general-purpose way to have a site-wide master template. It will not be used if the controller returns a PartialView() .
