TeamCity - multiple agents on ONE MACHINE? Possible?

Coming "from" TFS and using TeamCity in a customer project.... ...is there a way to install multiple agent instances on one computer? I could easily do that with TFS. The reason is that we have build scripts that are linear in execution for some (large) part and take a significant amount of time. Basically with a a modern server (4, 6, 8, 12 cores) there is nothing stopping the server from actually efficiently running multiple builds AT THE SAME TIME - except there seems to be no way to install multiple agent instances on one machine.
