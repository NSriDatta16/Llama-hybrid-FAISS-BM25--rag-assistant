How to prevent creating intermediate objects in cascading operators?

I use a custom Matrix class in my application, and I frequently add multiple matrices: Matrix result = a + b + c + d; // a, b, c and d are also Matrices However, this creates an intermediate matrix for each addition operation. Since this is simple addition, it is possible to avoid the intermediate objects and create the result by adding the elements of all 4 matrices at once. How can I accomplish this? NOTE: I know I can define multiple functions like Add3Matrices(a, b, c) , Add4Matrices(a, b, c, d) , etc. but I want to keep the elegancy of result = a + b + c + d .
