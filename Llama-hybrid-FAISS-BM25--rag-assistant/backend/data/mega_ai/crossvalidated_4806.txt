You might try to find the correlation of the series of differences with the moving average of the series of differences using some scale for the moving average (for example, use a 10 point moving average as the scale). This way you can get an idea about how "wiggly" the series is at different scales. This tells you whether the series has a tendency to move back and forth or keep moving in the same direction. If the correlation is reasonably negative that implies that it is wiggly, it goes one way then comes back near where it was before. If the correlation is zero then it's not wiggly, if it moves in one direction, it has no tendency to move back where it came from. If it's positive then you might call it "anti-wiggly", it has a tendency to keep moving in the same direction it has been moving in (it has lots of trends). Repeat this at several different scales, say 2, 4, 8, 16, 24 ... data points, and then you can look at the graph.
