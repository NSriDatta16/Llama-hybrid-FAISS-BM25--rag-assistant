how to use Firefox but pretend that I am using iPhone (to use Firebug to examine the page design)

Is there a way to use Firefox and Firebug but pretend it is iPhone's Safari by faking the User Agent string? I want to use Firefox to examine the Amazon or Gmail sites and see how the page is laid out for iPhone... just for fun and for experiment. Is there a way? thanks?
