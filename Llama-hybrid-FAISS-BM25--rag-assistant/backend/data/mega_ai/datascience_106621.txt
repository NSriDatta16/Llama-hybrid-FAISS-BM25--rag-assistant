What is leaking rate?

I am implementing an echo state network using TensorFlow and am studying the parameters, one of which is called "leaky". The documented definition is as follows: Float between 0 and 1. Leaking rate of the reservoir. If you pass 1, it's the special case the model does not have leaky integration. Default: 1. I searched the internet but could not find a definition, in the context of neural networks and machine learning, as to what this parameter does, or what leaky integration is. https://www.tensorflow.org/addons/api_docs/python/tfa/layers/ESN
