Dummying a dataset in R in a vectorized manner

I'm working with a 'weighted' adjacency matrix to a graph. It represents connections or relationships between entities. Since it's weighted it has different values, 0 being no relationship and goes up adding connection between the entities. I've been thinking about how to make a new dataset, similar to this one but only with 0s and 1s. So this: A B C D E A B C D E A 0 2 5 1 9 A 0 1 1 1 1 B 3 0 1 0 0 goes into this: B 1 0 1 0 0 C 0 0 0 3 4 C 0 0 0 1 1 D 0 4 5 0 2 D 0 1 1 0 1 E 0 1 2 3 0 E 0 1 1 1 0 I've been wondering how to do it, and only came up with a for-loop-solution that seems far from optimal and non-vectorized. I would appreciate any insight from an R enlightened one in order to come up with a more elegant answer. Cheers
