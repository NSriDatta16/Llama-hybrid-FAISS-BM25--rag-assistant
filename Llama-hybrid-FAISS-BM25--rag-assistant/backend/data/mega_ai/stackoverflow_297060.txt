I think the biggest difference is Spring-WS is only 'contract-first' whilst I believe CXF is normally 'contract-last'. http://static.springsource.org/spring-ws/sites/1.5/reference/html/why-contract-first.html Contract-last starts with Java code, so it is usually easier to get started with. However, the WSDL it creates tends to be more fragile.
