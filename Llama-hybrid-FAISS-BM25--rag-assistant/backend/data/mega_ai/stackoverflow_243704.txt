The challenge here is the WinMo shell itself. What's not apparent is that the caption on the form (at the top of the screen) is actually not the caption of the Form you see - it's a completely different application. So to get your Form to "float" requires subverting the way the shell handles Form display. A quick and dirty way is to set the Form BorderStyle to none, but then you lose your caption bar. An option then is to manually draw it in with a FillRect and DrawString in OnPaint. Not too difficult and doesn't require any P/Invoke shenanigans, but it does require that you take the new header into consideration when you layout your controls. Another option is to use P/Invoke and manipulate the Form's style bits yourself. This works well, but take care that you do it in the right location in code, as some bits have to be set on Window creation. Also beware the shell, as it might want to change the bits back on you - so this mechanism requires more testing and attention to detail. IMO this is a better route, and I've blogged about it in more detail here . That blog entry isn't specifically about floating forms, but it covers style manipulation well. For more specifically on non-fullscreen Forms, see my other blog entry here .
