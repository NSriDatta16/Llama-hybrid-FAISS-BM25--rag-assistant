SVM Loss Function

I have learned that the hypothesis function for SVMs is predicting y=1 if transpose(w)xi + b>=0 and y=-1 otherwise. However, according to the loss function above, it implies that transpose(w)xi + b has to be greater or equal to 1 (>=1) if label y=1 and smaller than -1 ( to have 0 penalties . So I am confused here... So does this mean that if transpose(w)xi + b =0.6>=0 (thus producing h(x)=1) and indeed label y=1, but according to the loss function there will still be penalty (because max(0, 1-0.6) = 0.4)??? Why? Didn't the model correctly classify? Could someone please clarify for me? Thanks a lot!
