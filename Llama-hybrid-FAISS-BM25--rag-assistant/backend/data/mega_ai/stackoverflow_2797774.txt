Redmine & Git integration

I am considering moving from svn and Trac to git and Redmine. I'm just wondering what everyone's experience is of this. How well does git integrate with Redmine? I'm pretty set on my decision to change from svn to git - our distributed work, and need to frequently branch and merge would make life considerably easier with git. But we would possibly need to split things into multiple projects for this. From what I have been reading, git and multiple projects don't integrate too smoothly with Trac. That aside, in my investigations into git, Redmine has also caught my attention, and some of the features look very useful. However, I haven't found as many user experiences of git and Redmine as what I'd like (possibly due to my lack of searching skills...) and so would like to hear your opinions and examples.
