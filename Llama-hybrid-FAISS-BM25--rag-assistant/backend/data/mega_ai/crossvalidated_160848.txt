Gaussian Process for periodic data?

Assuming that I have data with repeated measures (or, in other words, multiple time series of different realizations of the same process), can I train a Gaussian Process on this data? In fact, is there a good way of achieving this, e.g. by training a GP for each day and averaging the parameters or something like that? Thank you in advance!
