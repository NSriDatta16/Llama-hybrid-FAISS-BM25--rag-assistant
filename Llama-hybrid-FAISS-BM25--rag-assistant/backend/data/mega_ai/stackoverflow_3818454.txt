With limited information you have given here: Potential Problem 1 - First Level UIViewController is not linked If you open NIB file in interface builder where you have drag and dropped NavigationViewController, you will see small disclosure triangle. If you expand that you will see NavigationBar and UIViewController. Select the UIViewController and change it to name of the TableViewController. The NIB file will change and say View Loaded from YourTableViewController. Potential Problem 2 - You have to do addSubView or insertSubView and pass in [navigationController view] If you post some code it may be helpful. Hope this Helps!
