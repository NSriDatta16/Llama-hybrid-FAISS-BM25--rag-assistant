How to choose the "Key" for inter-processes communication in Linux?

Good Day... I am doing a homework which states that I have 5 processes; a server and the rest are clients. Each process is supposed to be sparked from a different executable . I am going to implement a two-way message passing solution, but the question is not about message passing per se. Is there an elegant way to communicate the key between those different executables. i.e. when I call the following function: int msgget(key_t key, int msgflg); How are other processes supposed to know the key? It is OK for my homework to use a predetermined key, but I would like to know how it could be done in a real program. Because What "I understand" is there could happen a conflict if an unrelated process asks for the my key in some user's machine.
