Now that I've finished a grad-level Time Series course, I can provide an answer. This is essentially exercise 2.8 in Brockwell and Davis' Introduction to Time Series and Forecasting , 3rd edition. For the $\text{AR}(1)$ model indicated above, we have $$x_t = \phi x_{t-1} + w_t\tag{*}$$ Using (*) above, for $n$ finite, we have $$\begin{align} x_t &= \phi x_{t-1} + w_t \\ &= \phi(\phi x_{t-2}+w_{t-1})+w_t \\ &= \phi^2 x_{t-2}+\phi w_{t-1}+w_t \\ &= \phi^2(\phi x_{t-3}+w_{t-2})+\phi w_{t-1}+w_t \\ &= \phi^3x_{t-3}+\phi^2w_{t-2}+\phi w_{t-1} + w_t \\ &\vdots \\ &= \phi^{n+1}x_{t-(n+1)}+\sum_{k=0}^{n}\phi^{k}w_{t-k}\text{.} \end{align}$$ This yields the equation $$x_t - \phi^{n+1}x_{t-(n+1)} = \sum_{k=0}^{n}\phi^kw_{t-k}\text{.}$$ With $w_t \overset{\text{iid}}{\sim}\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2_w)$ , then $$\text{Var}\left(\sum_{k=0}^{n}\phi^kw_{t-k} \right) = \sum_{k=0}^{n}\phi^{2k}\sigma^2_w=(n+1)\sigma^2_w$$ with the assumption that $\phi = 1$ . Assume by contradiction that the $x_t$ are stationary. Because the $x_t$ are stationary, the covariances $\text{Cov}(x_t, x_{t+h})$ are independent of $t$ ; in particular, $\text{Cov}(x_t, x_{t}) = \text{Var}(x_t)$ is independent of $t$ . Write $\sigma^2_{X} = \text{Var}(x_t)$ . Then $$\begin{align} \text{Var}(x_t - \phi^{n+1}x_{t-(n+1)}) &= \sigma^2_X + \phi^{2(n+1)}\sigma^2_X +2\cdot \text{Cov}(x_t, - \phi^{n+1}x_{t-(n+1)}) \\ &= \sigma^2_X + \phi^{2(n+1)}\sigma^2_X -2\phi^{n+1}\cdot\text{Cov}(x_t, x_{t-(n+1)}) \\ &\leq \sigma^2_X[1+\phi^{2(n+1)}] \tag{**} \\ &= 2\sigma^2_X \end{align}$$ hence for any $n$ , $$(n+1)\sigma^2_w \leq 2\sigma^2_X\text{.}$$ Taking the limit as $n \to \infty$ , it follows that $\sigma^2_X > \infty$ , hence contradicting that $\sup_t \text{Var}(x_t) by stationarity. In (**), I made an assumption that $\text{Cov}(x_t, x_{t-(n+1)}) \geq 0$ . To see why this is the case, write $$\begin{align} \text{Cov}(x_t, x_{t-(n+1)}) &= \text{Cov}\left(x_t, \dfrac{x_t - \sum_{k=0}^{n}\phi^k w_{t-k}}{\phi^{n+1}}\right) \\ &= \dfrac{1}{\phi^{n+1}}\text{Cov}\left(x_t, x_t-w_t \right) \\ &= \dfrac{\sigma^2_X}{\phi^{n+1}} \\ &\geq 0 \end{align}$$ due to independence of the $w_t$ from the $x_t$ .
