A first cut logistic regression would be model where browser is a dummy variable, (a factor in R), and enrollers and visitors are counts within some set of time periods. Use predict to get predicted probability of a particular browser user enrolling once they have visited. This model treats enrolled as a binomially distributed count with trial length visitors with shifts in enrollment probability due to browser choice (only). Since this is probably not quite true you might think of other things to put on the right hand side. Here's a worked example with two browser types 'IE' and 'FF' ## Assume: IE has .3 chance of enrolling, FF has .6 chance of enrolling, ## 3/4 of browsers are IE, ## visits in each of 200 time periods are Poisson distributed. N The difference between these two probabilities is one possible measure of the effect of switching browsers. Alternatively you could compute it in proportional increase in probability going from IE to FF with a division... If the rate of enrollment is very small relative to visits you might be better doing model or some over-dispersed variant. Here the probabilities are gotten by exponentiating the constant term (for FF) and then the constant term plus the coefficient for IE. That should also get you about 0.6 and 0.3 We can be a bit more statistical about the effect size by generating a probability distribution for it. Here's a sampling-based approach for the Poisson model above. (We can often do the math in closed form, but who cares when we can always sample...) ## get the distribution of differences in enrollment rates for, say 20 visits ## simulate from the sampling distribution of the parameters library(MASS) sim.param The latter should be between 4.7 and 7 for 20 visits. For other definitions of effect size, you'd just change the eff function to compute them and rerun.
