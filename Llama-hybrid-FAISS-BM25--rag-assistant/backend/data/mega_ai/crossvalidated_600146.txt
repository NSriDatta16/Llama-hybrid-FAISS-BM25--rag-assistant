If you're not using informative priors, you're not being philosophically Bayesian. If the prior doesn't represent your uncertainty before seeing the data, then your posterior doesn't represent your uncertainty after seeing the data. So all interpretational advantages, such credible intervals vs confidence intervals, are lost. In fact, you're being a frequentist ("these methods have good parameter coverage") but using tools that have traditionally been associated with Bayesian methods.
