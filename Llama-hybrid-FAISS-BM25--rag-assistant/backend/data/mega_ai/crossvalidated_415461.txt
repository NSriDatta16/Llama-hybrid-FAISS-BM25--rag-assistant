Remember, models are deployed to learn rules from data, and the ultimate question for you (since I am not a medical researcher) is that, does the kind of data that you are feeding into your network contain sufficient information that hints at the rules (e.g. of how body tissues evolve) ? In other words, if you were to predict the next frame yourself instead of using the model, is it possible? In my experience, it is very difficult to predict the data at time $t+1$ using only the data at time $t$ . For example, it is not a trivial task (even for humans) to predict the $t+1$ th word in a book given only the $t$ th word. However, this task could be made slightly easier if $t-1, t-2, ... t-100$ th words are also provided. This is the underlying idea of recurrent neural networks, in which the output at a time-step depends on the input of many previous time-steps. My suggestion is to look through papers of recurrent neural networks and watch for some hybrid models between recurrent neural networks (for learning time dependencies) and convolutional neural network (for image processing).
