Some thoughts: Don't use accuracy. It's virtually guaranteed to pick the wrong model. Look at ROC AUC, Brier score or another proper scoring rule . Reference: " The Case Against Accuracy " Foster Provost, Tom Fawcett, Ron Kohavi. It is generally true that the best hyperparameters are poorly identified, and there will tend to be some sort of correspondence between $\gamma,C$. Smaller sample sizes tend to exacerbate this. Applying the 1 standard error rule can help hedge against the over-fitting that would occur by fixing hyperparameters at the maximum. Grid search is a slow, unintelligent way to go about tuning hyperparameters, in the sense that you spend lots of time exploring areas that are plausibly terrible, like the upper-left region of your plot. Bayesian Optimizaton and Particle Swarm Optimization are both faster, more intelligent ways to search the hyperparameter space. Standard ranges for $C$ and $\gamma$ are $C\in [2^{-5}, 2^{15}]$ and $\gamma\in[2^{-15}, 2^{3}], $ but there's nothing sacrosanct about those values, except the observation that larger $C$ tends towards overfitting.
