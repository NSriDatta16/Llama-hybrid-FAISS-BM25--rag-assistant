Path MTU Discovery

I am developing an application which processes (video processing, etc) and sends large files (up to tens of gigabytes) over a network. I am sending the files using FTP. To improve the performance/memory consumption of the application, I would like optimize the buffers so that i dont send packets which are too large and get fragmented. The problem i have is that i dont have much RAM to hold the file data whilst sending. Basically, i read just enough bytes from disk, process it and immediately send to the destination. Currently i am looking to implement MTU path discovery. I am familiar with the basic concept of how to do it. I would like to know if there is any .NET API in windows which keeps track of the MTU to a destination ? I am guessing there is no such thing, but a friend of mine told me windows vista keeps track. I am developing this application for windows XP, but i would like to learn if there is such a network tracking API in windows.
