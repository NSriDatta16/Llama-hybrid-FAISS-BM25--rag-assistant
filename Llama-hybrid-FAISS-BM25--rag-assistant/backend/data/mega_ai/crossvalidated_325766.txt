Single in this context refers to single shot object detector. I don't think people typically talk about single deep neural networks. Single shot object detectors are to be contrasted with region proposal object detectors. The original RCNN region proposal network was trained essentially like this: Take a pre-trained imagenet cnn (e.g. Alexnet) Re-train the last fully-connected layer with the objects that need to be detected + "no-object" class Get all proposals(=~2000 p/image), resize them to match the cnn input, then save to disk. Train SVM to classify between object and background (One binary SVM for each class) BB Regression: Train a linear regression classifier that will output some correction factor (source) Notice there are multiple models. Another variant, Faster RCNN had multiple networks for the various subtasks which were trained separately. In contrast, single shot detectors estimate a label and a bounding box essentially at the same time using a single network.
