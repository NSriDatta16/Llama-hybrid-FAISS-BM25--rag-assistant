Validity of grand mean intra-rater Kappa or ICC

For 5 raters, I have calculated intra-rater Cohen's Kappa statistics for the test-retest nominal ratings, intra-rater Kendall's tau-b statistics for the test-retest ordinal ratings, and intra-rater ICCs for the test-retest scale ratings. Is it valid to calculate overall mean intra-rater reliability coefficients (Kappa, Kendall's tau-b, ICC, as appropriate) across all raters for each of these variables? If so, can I simply average the individual raters' reliability coefficients for overall means?
