People often sort stacks of documents using a recursive method. For example, imagine you are sorting 100 documents with names on them. First place documents into piles by the first letter, then sort each pile. Looking up words in the dictionary is often performed by a binary-search-like technique, which is recursive. In organizations, bosses often give commands to department heads, who in turn give commands to managers, and so on.
