It's not elegant, but one way to never see the middle views is to have a transition view (some sort of default view or splash screen) under everything. Then have all views that you want to be swappable dismiss themselves back to the transition view and have that transition view controller present the next modal view to be shown, based on some sort of next-state logic. You'll never be more than 1 view deep, so there won't be any middle views to be seen.
