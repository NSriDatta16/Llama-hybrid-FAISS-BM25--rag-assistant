Do you have the option of embedding a resource to this DLL? That way, it doesn't really matter where the DLL is located on disk, because the XML file will follow it. You can then do something like this: Stream s = Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().GetManifestResourceStream("MyProject.MyXmlFile.xml"); XmlDocument d = new XmlDocument(); using (StreamReader r = new StreamReader(s)) { d.LoadXml(r.ReadToEnd()); }
