How big of a configuration file are we talking here? 1k lines? 10k? 1m lines? If the line you want to edit is the last line, just seek to the start of the line, truncate the file there and write the new one. If it's not... you will need to read it whole and write it again. Oh, and the 2 options you mention are actually the same (read/edit/write). On the third hand, I think it's irrelevant (unless you have weird constraints, like a flash storage device which takes too long to write, and has limited write cycles), given the sizes of most config files.
