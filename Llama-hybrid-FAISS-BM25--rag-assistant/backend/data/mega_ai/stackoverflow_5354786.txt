A better and more organized way of overriding Devise controllers and views using namespaces: Create the following folders: app/controllers/my_devise app/views/my_devise Put all controllers that you want to override into app/controllers/my_devise and add MyDevise namespace to controller class names. Registrations example: # app/controllers/my_devise/registrations_controller.rb class MyDevise::RegistrationsController Change your routes accordingly: devise_for :users, :controllers => { :registrations => 'my_devise/registrations', # ... } Copy all required views into app/views/my_devise from Devise gem folder or use rails generate devise:views , delete the views you are not overriding and rename devise folder to my_devise . This way you will have everything neatly organized in two folders.
