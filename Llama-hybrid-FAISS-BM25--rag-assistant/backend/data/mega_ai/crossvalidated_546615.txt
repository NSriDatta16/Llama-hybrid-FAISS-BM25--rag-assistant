Clustering points in time series

I have time-series data - Temperature Vs Time. The temperature raises during regular intervals and stays high for some time before returning to a normal value as shown below. I would like to identify each cluster of points (high temperature) and compute the median temperature for each cluster. What would be an effective algorithm to do this? I am using python. Thanks.
