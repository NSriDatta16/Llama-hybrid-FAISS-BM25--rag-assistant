How to test main effects of categorical variables in a binary logistic regression including an interaction?

I measure two binary responses from each participant (ChoiceVA = V or A, AestheticOnly = 0 or 1). There are two experiments (between-participant). I want to test the following hypotheses: AestheticOnly depends on Experiment (main effect) AestheticOnly depends on ChoiceVA (main effect) The way AestheticOnly depends on Experiment depends on ChoiceVA (interaction) Here is my data. The first number in each cell is the proportion of participants scoring 1 for AestheticOnly, and the second number is the n for participants in that cell. ChoiceVA A V All Experiment 1 0.1463 0.3939 0.2568 41 33 74 2 0.4545 0.2619 0.3281 22 42 64 All 0.2540 0.3200 0.2899 63 75 138 Just from looking at the data it is pretty obvious that neither main effect is significant (e.g. for ChoiceVA, bottom row, .25 of 63 participants is not significantly different from .32 of 75 participants). In my naivity I thought perhaps I could test these hypotheses with a straightforward binary logistic regression: > mod summary(mod) Call: glm(formula = AestheticOnly ~ Experiment + ChoiceVA + Experiment * ChoiceVA, family = binomial, data = d) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.1010 -0.7793 -0.5625 1.2557 1.9605 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -1.7636 0.4419 -3.991 6.57e-05 *** Experiment2 1.5813 0.6153 2.570 0.01017 * ChoiceVAV 1.3328 0.5676 2.348 0.01887 * Experiment2:ChoiceVAV -2.1866 0.7929 -2.758 0.00582 ** --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 (Dispersion parameter for binomial family taken to be 1) Null deviance: 166.16 on 137 degrees of freedom Residual deviance: 157.01 on 134 degrees of freedom AIC: 165.01 Number of Fisher Scoring iterations: 4 Clearly, the main effects are not being tested here in the way I hoped. I believe that this model, in testing main effects, rather than testing e.g. ChoiceVA=A against ChoiceVA=V across both levels of Experiment, is confining itself to that comparison only when Experiment=1. Can a model be constructed that instead tests the main effects in the way I would like? This is related to a previous question ( Logistic regression gives very different result to Fisher's exact test - why? ), but when I asked it I understand this even worse than I do now and consequently the question was so unclear that I need to start again.
