Theano vs Tensorflow for building Neural Networks for NLP tasks

I am trying to learn Theano and TensorFlow for building neural networks for NLP based tasks. Any suggestions as to when one should choose one over the other or what works better and when or is it just a personal choice of what one is comfortable with?
