Well, the greatest part can be automated (and already is) : Fitting (cross validating) the model Many R packages or Python's sk-learn do it quite well. Encoding the variables The factors (per example) can be viewed as dummy variables / integers / mean response of the target and sent to a cross validated model. Thus allowing to choose the best encoding of the features (with respect to the CV score) Selecting the best subset of variables Is really easy to automate as well. But... Given the current time needed to train the models (the process presented above is really time consuming), some opinion based choices are necessary The metric to optimize is a human decision Feature engineering is hard to automate (and often needs a domain knowledge) And this second part is usually the one that takes most time...
