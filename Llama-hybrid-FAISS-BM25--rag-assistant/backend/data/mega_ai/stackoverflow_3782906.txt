Showing Cocoa app's preferences on clicking app icon again

For a background app (LSUIElement=1), what's the most elegant way to make its 'preferences' or 'configuration' window pop up if a user double-clicks the app icon while it's already running? This is assuming the user cannot access the app's prefs from anywhere else (such as menu bar status item menus). I would suppose the ideal method would prevent the prefs window from showing on initial start, but is smart enough to show it on subsequent double-clicks on the app's icon. Thanks
