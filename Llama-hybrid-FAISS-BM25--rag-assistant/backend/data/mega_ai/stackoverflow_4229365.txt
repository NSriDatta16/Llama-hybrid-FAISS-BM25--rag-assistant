In quite a few cases, you propably could do something very similar by subclassing... except that decorators are defined once and can be applied to several classes, as opposed to writing a new subclass yourself in every case. Every solution to this inevitably would end up being equivalent to or very similar to decorators. As robert points out in a comment, if you had an example, the answers could be more specific...
