I'm pretty sure its not a hardware problem. You did not provide any of the code etc and but from the file path in your error syntac I can see it's Hudson who executes the tests and you will run into problem when there are several instances of Selenium RC started from Hudson as they are not thread safe then. You need to look into using this class: ThreadSafeSeleniumSessionStorage Update Have a look on this one: http://old.nabble.com/Problem,-Selenium-RC--sessionId--doesn't-exist--perhaps-this-session-was-already-stopped--td17633858.html
