Is it better to sample more time points or more replicates at constant sample size?

I would like to analyze my data with a linear regression: t*k = x x is my measurement with some error t is time I want to fit k as best as I can with the best estimate of the standard error for k possible. Question: For a fixed N, is it better (in terms of quality of fit and minimization of the standard error) to sample at different time points or N/k time points with k replicates at each time point ? Details in case they are relevant: These are physical measurements: someone comes in at time t and takes a measurement for each sample. The measurements are destructive so N replicates are prepared ahead of time. Both the replicates and the measurement process are "expensive" so we cannot have a large N (6 to 10 is typical). People in my field like to see error bars on everything so N/k time points with error bars and then a linear fit to those N/k averages is the most intuitively pleasing to them, but I cannot help but feeling like we are loosing something doing it this way.
