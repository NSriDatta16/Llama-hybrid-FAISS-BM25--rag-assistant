How do I strip the comma from the end of a string in Python?

How do I strip comma from the end of a string? I tried awk = subprocess.Popen([r"awk", "{print $10}"], stdin=subprocess.PIPE) awk_stdin = awk.communicate(uptime_stdout)[0] print awk_stdin temp = awk_stdin t = temp.strip(",") also tried t = temp.rstrip(",") , both don't work. This is the code: uptime = subprocess.Popen([r"uptime"], stdout=subprocess.PIPE) uptime_stdout = uptime.communicate()[0] print uptime_stdout awk = subprocess.Popen([r"awk", "{print $11}"], stdin=subprocess.PIPE) awk_stdin = awk.communicate(uptime_stdout)[0] print repr(awk_stdin) temp = awk_stdin tem = temp.rstrip("\n") logfile = open('/usr/src/python/uptime.log', 'a') logfile.write(tem + "\n") logfile.close() This is the output: 17:07:32 up 27 days, 37 min, 2 users, load average: 5.23, 5.09, 4.79 5.23, None Traceback (most recent call last): File "uptime.py", line 21, in ? tem = temp.rstrip("\n") AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'rstrip'
