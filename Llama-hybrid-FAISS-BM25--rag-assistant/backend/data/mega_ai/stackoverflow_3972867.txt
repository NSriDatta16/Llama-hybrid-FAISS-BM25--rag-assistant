From what I could investigate from the, very verbose, output using the Test button on the "Compiler Options" none for these option are defined: FPCAPACHE_1_3 FPCAPACHE_2_0 So this means that in: /etc/fpc.cfg #IFDEF FPCAPACHE_1_3 -Fu/usr/lib/fpc/$fpcversion/units/$fpctarget/httpd13/ #ELSE #IFDEF FPCAPACHE_2_0 -Fu/usr/lib/fpc/$fpcversion/units/$fpctarget/httpd20/ #ELSE -Fu/usr/lib/fpc/$fpcversion/units/$fpctarget/httpd22/ #ENDIF #ENDIF The test will revert to httpd22 by default. None the less, having: /usr/lib/fpc/2.4.0/units/x86_64-linux/httpd20 /usr/lib/fpc/2.4.0/units/x86_64-linux/httpd22 in the compiler's path to compiled units it means that it will find httpd20 first. This means it will try to load the 2.0 version and not the 2.2 version of the compiled units. So the first solution is to delete/move the 1. folder from the system. This will let you compile, but alas it will not link on a 64 bit system (I'm testing on a AMD64 system so I'm not going to presume it works elsewhere). The process ends with a hint, to add -fPIC to the compiler options. If you go to Project->Compiler Options...->Other on the lower TextBox you can add it. Voila, it's working.
