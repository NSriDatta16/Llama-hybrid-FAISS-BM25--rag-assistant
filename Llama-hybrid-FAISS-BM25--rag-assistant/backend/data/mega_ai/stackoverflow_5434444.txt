C# Generics - Can I make this class into a generic?

I have a class repeated many times. My boss ask me to make to generic but I'm not sure what this means. Can anyone out help or suggest how? Sorry for bad English. I hope it make sense. public class CapacityServiceContext : TableServiceContext { public CapacityServiceContext(string baseAddress, StorageCredentials credentials) : base(baseAddress, credentials) { } public const string TableName = "Capacity"; public IQueryable CapacityTable { get { return this.CreateQuery (TableName); } } } thank you in advance.
