Silverlight graph control

I need to include a graph editor (users should be able to place elements from a list in the graph and link them with other ones, much like an organizational chart) in my Silverlight application but have no idea how to do so. None of the controls in the SDK or the Toolkit seem to be made for such a scenario and using one of the various third party controls is not an option. Could someone please suggest me how to proceed?
