You can have a ViewModel OrderCheckoutViewModel { public Address ShippingAddress{get;set;} public Address BillingAddress{get;set;} } The values of formelements are mapped to the right Member of the ViewModel if they have the form There is no easy and elegant way to come from StreetAddress1 to ShippingAddress.StreetAddress1. My address model has the form: public class Address { String StreetAddress1 { get; set } String StreetAddress2 { get; set } String City { get; set } String State { get; set } String Zip { get; set } String InstanceName{ get; set } } I set the InstanceName to the Name of the property (ShippingAddress). Then the form elements are defined in this form .StreetAddress1"> The place of the ascx looks uncommon. Any reason why you dont put it in Shared and access it by ?
