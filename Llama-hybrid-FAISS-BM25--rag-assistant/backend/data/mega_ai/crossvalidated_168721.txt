This problem is tackled by the Dearden paper on Bayesian Q-Learning . He considers a normal model for "returns" (future rewards) like @yair's solution. He also considers another term called the "value of information": "the expected improvement in future decision quality that might arise from the information acquired by exploration." Also, FYI Beta(0, 0) is not "uninformative". The Jeffreys prior is Beta(0.5, 0.5). Dearden, Richard, Nir Friedman, and Stuart Russell. "Bayesian Q-learning." AAAI/IAAI. 1998.
