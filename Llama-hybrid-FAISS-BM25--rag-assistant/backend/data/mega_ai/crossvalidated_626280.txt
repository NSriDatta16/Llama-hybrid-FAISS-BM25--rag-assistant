I recently had a similar experience where the standard error was far, far smaller than what I obtained without random effects, and the result of ordinal did not at all match a Bayesian random effects ordinal model. I concluded that the many approximations that are made in frequentist mixed effects models just don't work with this many random effects and this few subjects. Bayesian random effects models are extremely easy to interpret and don't make approximations. Random effects are not necessarily a well-fitting way to model within-person correlation.
