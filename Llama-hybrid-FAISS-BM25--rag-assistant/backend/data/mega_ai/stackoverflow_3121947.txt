You want the view to float above all other views but not respond to user input. You could make a new UIWindow to put the UIView in. Set the windowLevel of the window high enough to order it above other windows. Or you could add the view to the superview or window of the navigation controller. [theNavController.view.window addSubview:theMessageView]; You could add it directly to the navigation controller view, but I think that is discouraged.
