Hyndman & Athanasopoulos "Forecasting: Principles and Practice" (3rd edition) suggests AIC for short time series . Section 13.7 states: However, with short series, there is not enough data to allow some observations to be withheld for testing purposes, and even time series cross validation can be difficult to apply. The AICc is particularly useful here, because it is a proxy for the one-step forecast out-of-sample MSE. Choosing the model with the minimum AICc value allows both the number of parameters and the amount of noise to be taken into account.
