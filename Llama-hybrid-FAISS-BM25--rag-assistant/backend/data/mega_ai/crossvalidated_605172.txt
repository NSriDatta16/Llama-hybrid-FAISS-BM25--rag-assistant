Time series - stability

I'm studying time series from the Hamilton's book. I have the following question: Consider a 2nd order difference equation: $y_t=\phi_1 y_{t-1}+\phi_2 y_{t-2}+w_t$ By using the lag-operator, I write: $(1-\phi_1L-\phi_2L^2)y_t=w_t$ I can factorize my polynomial in the lag operator as $(1-\phi_1 L -\phi_2 L^2)=(1-\lambda_1 L)(1- \lambda_2 L)=[1- (\lambda_1+\lambda_2)L+(\lambda_1 \lambda_2)L^2]$ $~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ [1]$ with: $\lambda_1 +\lambda_2=\phi_1$ , and $\lambda_1 \lambda_2=-\phi_2$ I want to find the values for $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ such that the left hand side of $[1]$ is equal to the right hand side. Then, the book says to replace the values of $L$ , with a scalar $z$ as follows $(1-\phi_1 z -\phi_2 z^2)=(1-\lambda_1 z)(1- \lambda_2 z) $ $~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ [2]$ Then the values making the right hand side of $[2]$ equal to zero are $z=\lambda_1^{-1}$ or $z=\lambda_2^{-1}$ . The question is why the right hand side of $[2]$ should be zero? Is that because $(1-\phi_1 z -\phi_2 z^2)=0$ is the characteristic equation of the my polynomial in the lag operator and by construction it is zero? Indeed, $z$ should be the roots of the characteristic equation. Am I right?
