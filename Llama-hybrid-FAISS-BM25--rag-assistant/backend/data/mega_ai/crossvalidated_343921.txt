Average treatment effect for binary outcome

I have got data from a randomized control trial experiment with outcome whether the individual made a purchase or not. How do I estimate the average treatment effect if my outcome is binary? In this case is average treatment effect the difference in the percentage of users who purchase a product between the two groups? In other words, some kind of contingency table? Related question, How would you calculate if the results are statistically significant? calculate p-value for binomial distribution?
