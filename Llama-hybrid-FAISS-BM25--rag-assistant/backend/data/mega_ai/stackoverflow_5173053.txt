iOS button to webpage with uiwebview

For a current project I am embedding a mobile site into an iOS app. I've taken use of the goback() and goforward() functions, with UIWebView. But how would I make a custom function that onClick (or onTouch which ever is the correct term) Sends the UIWebView back to the page initially loaded? Any Help would be much appreciated as I have bene unable to find anything on the web thus far.
