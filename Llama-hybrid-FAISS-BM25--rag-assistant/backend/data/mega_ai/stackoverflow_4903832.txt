Freebase just stores a portion of the Wikipedia description but there is usually more than what's given by the topic API. To get the "full" text for a Wikipedia blurb associated with a Freebase topic you first need to query the Read API for a list of related articles like this: { "id": "/en/jimi_hendrix", "/common/topic/article": [{}] }â€‹ Try it in the Query Editor Then choose one or more of the articles that it returns and feed its ID into the /trans/raw API like this: http://api.freebase.com/api/trans/raw/m/043dz You'll notice that the blurb of text that gets returned is a bit longer (1200 chars) and doesn't have the "..." but its still chopped off at the end. When I display Freebase topic descriptions in a web page I have some code to clean it up before hand. I split it apart into paragraphs by looking for newlines and then if the last paragraph doesn't end with a period, exclamation mark or question mark I just throw away that paragraph. The way the Wikipedia blurbs are written, you usually only need the first paragraph anyways.
