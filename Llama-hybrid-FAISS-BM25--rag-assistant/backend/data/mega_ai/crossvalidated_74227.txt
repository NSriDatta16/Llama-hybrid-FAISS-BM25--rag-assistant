Logistic Regression: wald chi-square

I am running a logistic regression with a binary dependent variable and 5 class independent variables. One information the software I use returns, is the following: Effect / DF / Wald / Pr > ChiSq Var1 / 1 / 150 / Var2 / 3 / 119 / Var3 / 8 / 157 / Var4 / 6 / 1553 / Var5 / 4 / 15975 / Concerning the data above I have two questions: I) How can I interpret the fact that for var5 the value of the wald chi-square is so much higher than the values of the remaining variables? And is it a bad indicator of the regression quality? II) I saw the impact of a regression variable calculated as the division between the wald chi-square value of the variable and the total sum of all the variables wald chi-square values (shown in percentageâ€¦.is this example var5 would represent 88.9% of the probability resulting from the logistic regression), but found no statistical grounds for this methodology. Anyone knows this methodology or others? Any guidance will be helpful
