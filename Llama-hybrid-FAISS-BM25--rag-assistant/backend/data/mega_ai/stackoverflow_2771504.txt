I understand implicitly that you do not want the JDBC connection to have a single gigantic resultset which you keep open for a very long time and navigate when required. The usual approach is to add the SQL needed to only get a subset of the full request, which unfortunately is different from database to database, and will make your SQL statements vendor specific. If I recall correctly, LIMIT is used with MySQL. Ask for the appropriate range for every request. I also believe that Hibernate contains functionality which allows you to do this for HQL, but I am unfamiliar with it.
