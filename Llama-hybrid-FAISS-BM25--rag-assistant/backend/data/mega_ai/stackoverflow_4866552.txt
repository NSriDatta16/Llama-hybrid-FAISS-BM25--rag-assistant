You have two problems: Your data source keeps getting blown away and you're not using the ... objectValue ... method properly. Data Source: You're blowing away your data source in your -numberOfRowsInTableView: method and replacing it every time the table needs to do a refresh. You'll want to cache (a mutable copy of) your dictionary only when you need to (like at application launch) then only refer to it from the table data source methods. Perhaps you should move it to an instance variable and use proper accessors. Also, the documentation mentions that, because the data source methods are called very frequently, they should be fast, so from a performance viewpoint alone this is not a good idea. You should only do what it takes to answer the question the delegate method is posing to keep the table responsive with large data sets. Object Value: You should ONLY be returning the object value from this method (usually an NSNumber object containing the state the checkbox is meant to toggle. You should set your table column's -dataCell when the view is loaded or at application launch. Even easier: drag a check box cell into the table column in Interface Builder to set that as the data cell without code. Additional Observation: If you plan to persist the changes to this information in any way, note that you must never rely on the application bundle being writable and should never attempt to overwrite resource files like the one you're loading from your bundle. You'll need to save the information elsewhere, using your bundle copy as a template copy only .
