That perldoc you linked says there's some issues with the angle-bracket syntax: One level of double-quote interpretation is done first, but you can't say because that's an indirect filehandle as explained in the previous paragraph. (In older versions of Perl, programmers would insert curly brackets to force interpretation as a filename glob: . These days, it's considered cleaner to call the internal function directly as glob($foo) , which is probably the right way to have done it in the first place. ) I mostly use File::Find and its ilk myself.
