How to create a search engine with filters?

I'm trying to create an online search for a particular set of literature/quotes/etc from a spiritual organization, and while the number of items (mostly PDF, HTML, or plain text) that can be searched is limited, I wanted to provide comprehensive search filters (Kayak.com style). That means my data will need to be organized in such a way that it's easy to filter by author name, source type (whether it's a book, speech, quote, etc), when, and where, and other filters. That means, each literature item will have to have this "additional information" tied with it. My question is, how do I go about building this search engine? I have heard of Lucerine, and also recently discovered Searcharoo, a .NET library for searching, which will index all my PDF files located in a local directory. What I'm wondering is if I should use Searcharoo, or if I should simply create my own database which stores the filepath, and query a column that contains the text of the PDF file. Or can I use Searcharoo, or something similar, and still be able to tag each indexed file with additional information stored in the DB? Or should I take a completely different approach? I'd appreciate any input on this... Thanks!
