If you have the PCM data you can just take an average of a few samples and if it's below a threshold consider it silence. I assume if you're playing the audio you have access to the uncompressed data. Unfortunately I don't know the details of the WMA codec, but I think the easiest way would be to just take the average of a few samples.
