Assuming you can target 10.5 and later, launchd would let you easily launch your application periodically. Then you could make the application that gets user information as normal, without worrying about keeping it running yourself. If you are targeting 10.4 though, don't use launchd for this, as launch agents were very broken until 10.5.
