So after some more experimenting, a solution was found, though not well explained or documented. The problem was related to how the GetListItems function was being called, here is the code that was not working correctly: System.Xml.XmlNode ndListView = listProxy.GetListAndView("Pictures", ""); string strListID = ndListView.ChildNodes[0].Attributes["Name"].Value; XmlNode returnNode = listProxy.GetListItems(strListID, strViewID, queryNode, viewNode, _maxFolders, optionNode, null); This was not working as expected for the situation explained above, however, it was working for every other folder and file. The solution was to send GetListItems the list name, "Pictures" instead of the list GUID, like so: XmlNode returnNode = listProxy.GetListItems("Pictures", strViewID, queryNode, viewNode, _maxFolders, optionNode, null);
