To completely disable the warning in the file you can add the following to the top of the file #pragma warning(disable:2400) If you want some more flexibility other than a blanket disable for the file, the following page lists several other more fine grained options. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/2c8f766e(VS.80).aspx It's unclear based on your information as to whether or not it's a bug in the compiler or a configuration issue. I would lean towards a configuration issue, specifically conflicting compiler options that is making it difficult to suppress the warning. EDIT OP mentioned they can't control the generated code so they can't directly include the pragma. If that's the case then try this trick. Say the file name is Generated.cpp. No longer include Generated.cpp as one of the files to compile. Instead create a new file called Example.cpp with the following contents #pragma warning(disable:2400) #include "Generated.cpp" Now you'll get the text of Generated.cpp with the disabled warning by only compiling Example.cpp.
