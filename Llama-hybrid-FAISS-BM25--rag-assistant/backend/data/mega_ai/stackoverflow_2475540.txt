Delphi - form within form

For aesthetic reasons, I want to show a form on top of another form, just as if it were a component, say like a TPanel. It should resize with the parent, move around as the parent is dragged by its title bar, etc. ----------------------------- | main form component 1 | ----------------------------- | main | the 'embedded' | | form | form goes here | |comp 2| | ----------------------------- can I do that? If so how? I am now leaning towards MDI...
