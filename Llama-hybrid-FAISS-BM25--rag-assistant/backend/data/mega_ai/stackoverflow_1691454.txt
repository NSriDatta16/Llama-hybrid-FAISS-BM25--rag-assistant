You will need /MT on your code and all its dependencies to statically link to MSVC runtime (MSVCP90.dll/MSVCR90.dll). That is because PocoNetmt.lib seems to be build with /MT. If with /MT you still get msvcprt.lib, turn on /verbose and find out which other library drags it. Then recompile/find static build of that. Another option is to find static PocoNet lib that is built with /MD (so you link statically to it, but dynamically to runtime) and switch everything to /MD. EDIT: When Poco dll is linked with /MT that does not affect you. But since you want to get rid of it, you (and all your other dependencies) will have to use same /MT flag.
