PHP, include with parameters

I have a PHP-file which will be called from a form. So it gets parameters over $_GET. Now I need the exact same functionality of this file, but not in such a form-call. I will include it in normal code with fixed parameters (which normally come from the form). So my file can work with the form AND without it. I know only the way with include and setting the $_GET in front of it. But I am not sure this is the most elegant way (I dont like the idea of setting things like $_GET). any other ways of doing this? br, chris
