I would suggest you try support vector machines. A polynomial kernel could capture the interacting features in your example without you having to explicitly enumerate them. LibSVM is probably the most widely used implementation. There may be better choices depending on the distribution of your data points. There is a helpful illustration of different classifiers on three different datasets this page .
