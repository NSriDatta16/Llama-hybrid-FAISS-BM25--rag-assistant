Rotating image using objective C

I am trying to rotate an image. This I am succeeding in doing. The problem is that when I am clicking down and dragging slightly, the image rotates completely to reach the point where I have clicked and then rotates slowly as I drag the image clockwise. I am concerned to why it is rotating completely to the place that I am dragging. I want the dragging to start from the position it is found and NOT to rotate to the place my finger is down on and then starts from there. This is my code: - (void) touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { } -(void) touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { NSSet *allTouches = [event allTouches]; int len = [allTouches count]-1; UITouch *touch =[[allTouches allObjects] objectAtIndex:len]; CGPoint location = [touch locationInView:[self superview]]; float theAngle = atan2( location.y-self.center.y, location.x-self.center.x ); totalRadians = theAngle; [self rotateImage:theAngle]; } - (void)touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { } -(void) rotateImage:(float)angleRadians{ self.transform = CGAffineTransformMakeRotation(angleRadians); CATransform3D rotatedTransform = self.layer.transform; self.layer.transform = rotatedTransform; } Am I doing anything wrong? Thanks!
