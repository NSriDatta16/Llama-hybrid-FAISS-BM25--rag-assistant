Generally, in observational data it is difficult to distinguish the trend-stationary series from random walk. You called them deterministic and stochastic. The trend-stationary process is $x_t=\beta_0+\beta_tt+\varepsilon_t$, while RW is $x_t=x_{t-1}+\beta_0+\varepsilon_t$. Consider a very well researched time series such as GDP . The economists are still debating whether it's trend-stationary or RW, e.g. see this paper on German GDP . You can also see how they try to determine if the series is RW or not.
