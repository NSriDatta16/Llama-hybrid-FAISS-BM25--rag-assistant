It all depends what resources and effort you want to expend on it. At 1 row per second that table would still be less than 0.5GB per sensor per year, which is very small. If you have thousands of sensors then you might want to consider whether to create summary tables to help with the reporting and analysis of the data. Sensor data like this is often very repetetive. There are more convenient ways to store repeated values - for example by storing one row with a range of times rather than multiple rows with different times. There are many software packages that can help with storing and managing this kind of time series data. There is also a significant body of research and literature on the subject, which might help you. If you aren't already familiar with it then Google for terms like "Process Historian", "Complex Event Processing" and "SCADA".
