The examples and sample code on apache's site are pretty good. I recommend you start there. http://poi.apache.org/hwpf/quick-guide.html To get specific bits of text, first create a org.apache.poi.hwpf.HWPFDocument. Fetch the range with getRange(), then get paragraphs from that. You can then get text and other properties. Here for an example of extracting an image. Here for the latest revision as of this writing. And of course, the Javadocs Note that, according to the POI site, HWPF is still in early development.
