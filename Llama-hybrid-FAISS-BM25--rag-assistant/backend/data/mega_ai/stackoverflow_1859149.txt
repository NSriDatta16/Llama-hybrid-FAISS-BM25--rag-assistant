Easiest way would be to check for the Referer header in HTTP request. Basically if that header does not have URL from your site, then this could be hot linking. This has following problems: Referrer header can be forged -> hot linking works All user agents do not necessarily send the Referrer header -> legitimate user might not get the content. You could also set a cookie when user is browsing your site, and check for existence of that cookie when user is accessing the streaming content.
