Based on my experience of automating tests for a web-based application with AJAX calls I suggest you to consider the following. QTP's Object Recognition mechanism is looking for GUI objects with Windows Handle. So whenever possible, use GUI objects only. Testing manually you won't reach XmlHttpRequest object either but it wouldn't prevent you from functional testing. You can still synchronize on a variety of events based on the change of properties of GUI objects. For example. "loading..." image or text appeared/disappeared. Dropdown list stopped adding new items. Button becomes enabled/disabled. If this is your in-house application you can develop a more friendly support for QTP, and here you can use guides from extensibility toolkit. Additionally, as a test build option you may include a GUI object (invisible image or text element) and use it to indicate states of AJAX transactions. Finally, you can still access DOM directly to reach non-GUI objects although I don't have information on using XmlHttpRequest object this way. Thank you, Albert Gareev
