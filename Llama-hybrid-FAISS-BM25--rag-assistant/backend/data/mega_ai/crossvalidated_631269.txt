My dataset includes multiple variable and all of these variables have sub-variables. How to visualise & test which segment is significant?

So, I have survey responses from users. Just to make it clear, if you select an issue like Poor UI then you are prompted with 4-5 specific issues about the UI to select from. Poor UI is the main variable and then we have 4-5 sub-issues related to the poor UI. For example, Q1. What do you have a problem with? Poor UI - Select Yes or NO. If yes, you are shown specific issues about Poor UI to select from. Out of 9 variables, the user can select 3 only, and then they are shown sub-issues related to each of the selected issues. I am new to data visualisation and transformation so I was thinking about using a dimension-reduction technique like PCA or MFA but I would like to know if there's anything else that I can do to have better visualisation and analysis. I also want to test the variables across the different user segments. I need to know which user segment faces statistically significant issues as compared to others. I will be using R for it. Thank you.
