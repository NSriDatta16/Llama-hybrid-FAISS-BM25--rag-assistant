Yahoo Messenger API is not public, so you will not get an oficial API from them for sure. Having said that, I don't know if there is an API available for FLEX. But I know one for C and one for Java . Both of the open source. So you can try to implement Yahoo Messenger's protocol in FLEX. Other thing you can try (although I don't know if it will meet your quality standards) is embedding a WebPage supporting Yahoo chat. Good luck.
