There's an excellent typology and discussion of different types of input to PCA as well as Matlab routines for PCA with extreme valued information in this paper by Xie and Xeng, Cauchy Principal Component Analysis . Basically, their approach involves shifting to probabilistic assumptions. They explicitly compare the location-scale family of distributions including Gaussian, Laplace, Logistic and Cauchy distributional fits to the same, simulated information. Having done it, their algorithm is also pretty easily programmed into languages other than Matlab.
