In a Bayesian context, one does not use frequentist definitions of confidence intervals. That is, the notion of being a certain distance away from the mean times some amount of the standard deviation does not really make sense. Rather a 95% credible interval contains 95% of the value of the posterior distribution. Suppose we wanted a central 95% credible interval. Find theta such that the for the CDF, the lower interval point has at least 2.5% of data less than it and the upper interval has at least 97.5% below it (2.5% above). Check out https://hilbertthm90.wordpress.com/2013/11/04/bayesian-statistics-worked-example-part-2/ for an example. Essentially the point is that when you are using your data to account for the randomness in your parameter theta, we can then assume that the posterior represents the mix of our views (prior) and the data (y). Hence we know that if we find the points such that 75% or 95% or 99% or any percent really lies underneath the probability mass function of the posterior, we can find the interval.
