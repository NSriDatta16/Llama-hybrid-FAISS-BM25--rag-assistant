The short answer is it looks like it's techincally possible. The easiest way would be to create your own RatingBar based on the RatingBar sourcecode (more elegant would be to extend the orignal RatingBar into your own). From there you would also need to create your own RatingBar style using the original RatingBar source xml as an example (or inheriting and extending the original RatingBar style). Source is available wtih git at developer.android.com. I suspect making your own rating bar is discouraged since it goes against the consistent look and feel of the OS.
