So you have a bunch of text chunks that you want to classify into different categories. The problem is identical to spam filtering. Except a spam filter only classifies emails into two categories, but you have several, but the same principles ( Bayes' theorem ) still applies. A Naive Bayes classifier is one of the simplest and least computationally demanding methods to tackle the problem. Then you can build on that knowledge and use more complicated methods such as neural networks to make more accurate classifications. A great book on the topic is Programming Collective Intelligence . See also dANN which is a Java library that has a Naive Bayes classifier implementation and many other tools for predictive analysis. And this video about Google Predict which shows how to categorize sentences into languages. The same method could be used for classifying descriptions almost verbatim.
