The generalized idea of what you're looking for is called Graph Drawing : [The] drawing of a graph is basically a pictorial representation of an embedding of the graph in the plane, usually aimed at a convenient visualization of certain properties of the graph in question or of the object modeled by the graph. Exposé would use an algorithm out of this, or a similar family to derive it's window layout functions. You can also have a look at the source code for the Graphviz project . It has algorithms for laying out graph nodes much the same way Exposé would. As to shuffling windows off to the side. It's likely a "dumb" algorithm that takes the windows position and moves it to the closest side.
