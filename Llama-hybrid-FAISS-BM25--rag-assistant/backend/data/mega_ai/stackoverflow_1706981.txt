Before addition, the IntPtr is cast to a uint , then the offset is applied. This will work correctly, but the result is a long . As far as I know, addition of ulong and an int is not possible, so the 64-bit pointer part is incorrect. Indeed it doesn't even compile. I can't really think of an elegant solution, but just using a long instead would probably be safe. That's half of a sh*tload of memory you could use*, 8 exabytes :) Memory address mapping could theoretically be a problem there though. *: well, if the current .NET Framework implementation wouldn't stop you from doing so long before that of course :)
