model output without correlation to input variable

let's assume that a,b,c,d,t,u,v,w,x,y,z and o are all correlated to one another. I want to make a prediction for outcome variable "o". However, I don't want my prediction to be to correlated to variables t,u,v,w,x,y, or z. I can't simply limit my model to only use a,b,c,d as inputs because the correlation between the variables would still cause my prediction of o to be correlated to t,u,v,w,x,y,z. What I need is a function that transforms a variable to remove any correlation to a different set of variables. for example f(a;t,u,v,w,x,y,z) would produce a' such that a' is not correlated to t,u,v,w,x,y,z. I realize that a' would be an inferior predictor of o than "a" and I am ok with that. I would like this solution to work with both continuous and categorical variables for a,b,c,d,t,u,v,w,x,y,z and o. I would also like the solution to work for larger numbers of variables. I am open to both statistical and machine learning solutions Any ideas?
