Although this is an old post, I came across it and have an interpretation of the results to share. The expected revenue given that the number of subscribers is zero implies that the business is paying money rather than receiving it. Consider that at the core of this data exist some fundamental economics. Theoretically, negative revenue suggests a business could be issuing returns beyond their receivables, or they could be paying a subscriber (that doesn’t actually exist because the OP is discussing the intercept, which we are interpreting when the number of subscribers equals zero). Corporations have reported negative revenues in the past, most notably after the global crisis in 2020. The mathematics here make sense because of the economics and accounting. Sometimes these results are attributable to accounting practices, but recall that the data from which we are making our inferences is derived from those same accounting methods. The coefficients and intercept of the OP’s model are a direct result of those inputs. Each scenario in one’s data exploration and analyses will come with its own unique set of considerations. It’s normal to question our results and I encourage it. For anyone who lands on this page sometime in the future, I hope you find these comments helpful to think about. Edit: In response to the comments about mixing revenues and profits, beware that these concepts have different meanings and my post may have not made that clear. In fact, the word revenue is perhaps the most misleading on a balance sheet because the numbers strictly depend on how a business decides to structure its books. Depending on the type of firm, companies may be reporting net revenue, which is the value after returns, discounts, cost of goods sold (COGS), etcetera. Net revenue is also not profit because it does not deduct all expenses, rather only revenue expenses. By strict definitions, if a business has no sales or goods/services being rendered as a result of having no customers we might say revenues should equal zero. However, revenue can come from activities not related to the original business, such as leasing a building or machinery, known as “other revenue”. The reality is that accounting practices allow for counterintuitive manipulations of the numbers. If working with real-world data, thinking about such nuances can assist in identifying the sources of discrepancies to clarify our otherwise unintuitive results. For corporate projects, someone in the organisation should be able to answer questions or provide insights about your findings, so by all means ask questions and seek input from the source.
