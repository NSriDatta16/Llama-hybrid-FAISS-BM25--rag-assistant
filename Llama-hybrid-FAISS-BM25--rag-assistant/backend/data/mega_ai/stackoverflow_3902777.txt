rails user-ip from within the model?

I'm wondering if there's a more direct way to get and record a users IP in the model itself. I've been doing it from the controller but I noticed using the rakismet gem it mentions doing everything from within the model, but not the IP specifically. http://github.com/joshfrench/rakismet Currently I'm doing this, just before I save from the controller. It works fine. @notification = Notification.new(params[:notification].merge(:user_ip => request.remote_ip, :user_agent => request.user_agent, :referrer => request.referrer))
