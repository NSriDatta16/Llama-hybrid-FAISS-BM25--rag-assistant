You should learn and try time series forecasting with leading indicator The easiest way to start is perhaps to replicate the example in Box and Jenkings book, mentioned in the link as the source of the data. If you need a good reference for formal writings, check out this one . Note that when your purpose is forecasting you just don't care about causation. There are two different worlds. If you want to learn more on this, read Galit Shmueli's To Explain or To Predict? in Statistical Science. I do not know how that comment on causation adds to your question, which is in my view neither too broad nor unclear. I can even upvote it as a good question.
