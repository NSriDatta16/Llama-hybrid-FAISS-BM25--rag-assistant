Here's a 20-minute video demonstration. 10-4 Episode 37: Leveraging Model Metadata and Validation with ASP.NET MVC2 Posted By: Jonathan Carter | Jan 7th @ 11:21 AM In this episode of 10-4, we discuss a new feature coming in the next release of ASP.NET MVC: model metadata and validation.

In addition, you can also have JavaScript emitted that will provide client-side validation as well, making it dead simple to achieve a rich client and server validation experience with any web application.
