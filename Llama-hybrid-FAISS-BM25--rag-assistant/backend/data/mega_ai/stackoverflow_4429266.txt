For the sake of completeness, there are OTHER, non-standard ways to store/transmit session information than the 3 methods you listed (although I seriously doubt any of them are used in your SMS). Among them: Sending the cookie data as part of the DOM (e.g. in HTML) and having on-page JavaScript access it from DOM Or, just store the cookied data as JavaScript's data in the first place. AJAX calls. E.g. the session-enabled logic is all handled in AJAX URLs and not the main URLs. Yes, I know that's completely screwy. But doable. Don't store the cookie in main cookie database (so you can't find it using standard cookie viewing methods). For details on how that's done, please google "evercookie" for a VERY cool method of persistently storing cookie info by utilizing up to 10 redundant storage options - one good intro is http://blog.depthsecurity.com/2010/09/super-persistent-cookies-evercookie.html All that said, I completely agree with Dave's answer - just use PHP's best practices mechanism to implement the functionality instead of cloning possibly-perl-specific and possibly-weird implementation in the webapp.
