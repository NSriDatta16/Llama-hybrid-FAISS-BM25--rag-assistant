The setting you are looking for is named Best Arm Identification . In this setting, you have no notion of regret but you just aim at identifying the best arm as fast as possible (say in $\tau$ steps) and with a probability at least equal to $1-\delta$ , for $\delta\in(0,1)$ . There are many algorithms that have been proposed to solve this problem. A provably (asymptotically for $\delta \to 0$ ) optimal algorithm is proposed by Garivier and Kaufmann , but there are plenty of other algorithms (see Audibert et al. or Jamieson et al. ).
