Retrieve browser and OS in PHP

I need to retrieve the browser and OS through php coding. I had used $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] , but its shows the following Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; IEMB3) How can I separate the browser and OS from the above received value? Please guide me.. Thanks in advance.
