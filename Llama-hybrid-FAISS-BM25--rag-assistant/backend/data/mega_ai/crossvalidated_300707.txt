You are correct that you cannot use data from observations born 4 days ago to measure whether they died after 5 days - that wouldn't make any sense. The concept you explained is called censoring (as you perhaps already know). The situation you describe to me sounds like a standard discrete survival model for which a simpler logistic regression could do the job. Or is there any particular reason why you try to fit a Weilbul function?
