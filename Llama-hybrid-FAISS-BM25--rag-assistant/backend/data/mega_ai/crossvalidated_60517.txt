The main problem about choosing a right classier is that, by definition, you cannot know which one will behave the best. However, there are general hints. kNN, SVM, NB,... etc work really well with large number of features. In your case you have only three variables and they seem to be possible to be classified accurately by rules (e.g., speed > 20 implies NOT walking). For this reason, I would recommend to you to check any rule-based classifier such as decision trees . You can see benefits/drawbacks and how to apply them with scikit-learn in here .
