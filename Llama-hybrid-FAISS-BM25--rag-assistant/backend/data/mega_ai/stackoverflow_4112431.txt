Hello C++ new programmer! Welcome to the awesomeness of coding in C/C++. I know you just started C++. But to fix your problem, we have to touch a bit of C. C++ so happens to be a superset of C. Meaning everything that can be done in C will work in a C++ program. Ok enough words, code time. Replace the code you use to get input from your input file with this: char tmp[256]; memset(tmp, '\0', sizeof tmp); inFile.getline(tmp, EMP_NUM, '*'); nameAr[i] = tmp; inFile >> hoursAr[i] >> hrateAr[i]; Let's walk through it. char tmp[256]; will create a temporary array for reading in the values. The size of this array may vary with the average length of names you receive. Strings in C are like high maintenance chics. You have to specify a NULL character '\0' at the end or they may crash your program with not-so-obvious Segmentation faults. However, Memset is a little man that works down in the mines of a computer; he's gonna help us fix this. When called in this form memset(tmp, '\0', sizeof tmp) , memset starts at the address of tmp , walks through all the bits of the array - the size id specified as sizeof tmp - and sets these bits to the character specified - in this case NULL. This way we would not have to remember to append the NULL character every-time we read in a C string; provided the size of tmp is sufficiently large. Convenient! inFile.getline(tmp, EMP_NUM, '*'); reads the input [string] from your file as expected and stores it in tmp. nameAr[i] = tmp; puts the input read into the names array. and finally, inFile >> hoursAr[i] >> hrateAr[i]; reads the hours and hourly rates as before. Hope this helps. Cheers! Happy Learning.
