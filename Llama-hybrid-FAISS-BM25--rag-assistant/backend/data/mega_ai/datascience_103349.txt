Do I have to remove features with pairwise correlation even if I am doing a regularized logistic regression?

Normally we would remove features that have high pairwise correlation with another feature before performing regression. But is this step necessary if I am applying L2 regularized logistic regression (since the regularization algorithm would shrink the "irrelevant" feature coefficients to zero anyway)?
