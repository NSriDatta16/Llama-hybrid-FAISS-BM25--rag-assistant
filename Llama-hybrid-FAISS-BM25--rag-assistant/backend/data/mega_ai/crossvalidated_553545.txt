When are latent analyses useful?

As far as I understand, latent profile analysis, clustering or similar latent analyses are about finding something hidden in the data. Are there any guidelines or thoughts on when these techniques are useful? I have seen principal component analysis (PCA) being used for simplifying image data. There it was useful since the learned "structure" could at least be visually verified. In most other applications, I feel that latent analyses don't provide much information. For example, I could ask a class of 100 students various questions to get, let's say, 6 variables. So, $n = 100$ and $p = 6$ . Now, I could do very sophisticated latent analyses to figure out what lies "underneath" those students. However, I would say that most latent things that I would find are just random noise. In other words, I could ask the same questions to very many classes and probably I would find 300 different latent profiles, but only a few of them would be theoretically meaningful.
