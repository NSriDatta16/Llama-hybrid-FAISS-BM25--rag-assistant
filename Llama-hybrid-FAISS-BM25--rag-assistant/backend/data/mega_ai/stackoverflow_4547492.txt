I'm still unsure why the original solution does not work, so if anyone has any insights please do enlighten. I have however worked out a slightly inelegant work around using NSUserDefaults latestLocation = newLocation;//Make latest location the same as NewLocation //Use NSUser Defaults to save the CLLocation instance NSUserDefaults *location = [NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults]; [location setDouble:latestLocation.coordinate.latitude forKey:@"lat"]; [location setDouble:latestLocation.coordinate.longitude forKey:@"longd"]; I needed to break out the lat and long as NSUserDefaults will not store CLLocation objects (NSCoding compatability), the reconstruct them in the captures class; NSUserDefaults *location = [NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults];//Get a handle to the user defaults CLLocationDegrees lat = [location doubleForKey:@"lat"]; CLLocationDegrees longd = [location doubleForKey:@"longd"]; CLLocation *currentLocation = [[CLLocation alloc] initWithLatitude:lat longitude:longd]; mp = [[MapPoint alloc]initWithCoordinate:[currentLocation coordinate]];//get the location from the coords from appDelegate
