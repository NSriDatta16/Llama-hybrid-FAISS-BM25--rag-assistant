If you are using the clustering algorithm correctly, it should already discover something like this. Other than that, it sounds more like decision trees to me than clustering! Maybe you'll want to build a decision tree with early pruning, and then use the leaves as "clusters"? As your data probably is discrete , k-means will have a systematic error. K-means is best for truly continuous vector data, where each dimension should have the same value range and semantic scale. Definitely pay attention to your cluster sizes. If you are seeing empty or near-empty clusters, your data is not working for k-means!
