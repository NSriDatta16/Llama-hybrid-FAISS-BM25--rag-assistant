Imputation in monthly univariate time series

I have a time series of the amount of apples sold in a specific Region. The time series include monthly values of 10 years (2006-2016). However two months are missing (February 2009 and July 2014). After imputing the data my foremost aim is a forecast for the upcoming months. The imputeTS package in R includes various methods for my case, e.g. linear, spline, Stineman Interpolation or Kalman Smoothing. Which is the most appropriate imputation method in my case? How can I make an appropriate forecast although I have missing data? Would you recommend another R package or function? The time series has a Unit root in July 2014 and the data in July 2014 is missing. How can I deal with this issue? Unfortunately most linear about the topic focuses on multivariate time series (Have a look at the Links below). What is the intuitive difference between imputation methods for univariate and for multivariate time series? How do I have to take this into account when looking at my "apple time series"?
