Asp.Net resource manager always returns neutral culture resources

I am using embedded .resx to localize an asp.net application. It seems that no matter what the current culture is, the neutral culture resource is always returned. The code I am using to retrieve the value is as follows: protected string GetResource(string name) { return Localization.ResCore.ResourceManager.GetString(name, System.Threading.Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentCulture); } I've specified in one page that the culture is "es-PE" (Peru). When I break in the GetResource function, I can verify that CurrentCulture is "es-PE" and that the ResourceManager contains a ResourceSet corresponding this culture. However, the string returned is always from the neutral culture set. The files I am embedding are named as follows: ResCore.resx ResCore.es.resx ResCore.es-PE.resx Any help is appreciated.
