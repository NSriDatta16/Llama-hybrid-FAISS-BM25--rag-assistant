possible to constrain jQuery resize to x or y axis, like drag constrain?

This jQuery lets you constrain drag movement so it occurs only on the axis specified: $("#draggable2").draggable({ axis: 'x' }); See: http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/#constrain-movement This is not legal jQuery but I wish it were: $("#Container").resizable({ minHeight: 150, containment: {axis:'y' } }); Is it possible to prevent the user from making #Container wider while allowing her to make it taller? Thanks
