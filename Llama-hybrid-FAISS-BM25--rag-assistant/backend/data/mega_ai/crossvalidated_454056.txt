I don't think the paper you cited applies since your outcome is neither logged, nor are you are using a non-linear model. The margins, eydx(x) is calculating the average, calculated across all time periods and observations, in your estimation sample of: $$\frac{\partial E[y \vert x]}{\partial x} \cdot \frac{1}{E[y \vert x]}=\beta_{x} \cdot \frac{1}{\hat y} \approx \frac{\frac{\Delta \hat y}{\hat y}}{\Delta x}. $$ In your case, $\Delta x =1$ since the interaction is dummy, so you have $$\frac{\Delta \hat y}{\hat y}=-1.31.$$ The numerator is change in $\hat y$ over $\hat y$ , so it does make sense to multiply that by 100 to put it into percent like you did. This makes the semi-elasticity -131%. Mathematically, that could be possible, unless you outcome is bounded. For example, profits could become losses. Arrests or wages, on the other hand, are bounded below by zero, so -131% may not make much sense in that setting.
