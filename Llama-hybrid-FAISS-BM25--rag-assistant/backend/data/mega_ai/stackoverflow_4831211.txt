Interesting. My first question would be: what happens without the #pragma pack? What is the native alignement for this struct. The operator new has no means of knowing what options you might have set with the pragma, so its presence or absense has no effect here. And formally, there's no violation of the standard, since Intel doesn't require any alignment for anything (but maintaining proper alignment sure helps performance). All in all, it doesn't seem like a desirable "feature", but it's a QoI issue, and not a standard conformance one.
