I just had the same error while I began learning Git . Some of the other answers are clearly not for someone new to Git! I am going to use non technical terms to get the idea across. Anyway, what is happening is that you have two repositories, one is the original you first made, and the other the work one you just made. Right now you are in your work repository and are using the master branch. But you also happen to be "logged in" in your original repository to the same master branch. Now since you're "logged in" in the original, Git fears you might mess up because you might be working on the original and screw things up. So you need to return to the original repository and do git checkout someotherbranch , and now you can push with no problems.
