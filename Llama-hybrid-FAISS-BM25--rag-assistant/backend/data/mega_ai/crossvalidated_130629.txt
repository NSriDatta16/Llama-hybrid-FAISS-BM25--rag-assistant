There are numerous ways how to deal with this: The pie/bar chart might consider not original $n$ categories, but all $2^n$ combinations. To consider the Carnaugh maps where the color intensity shows the number of answers for given combination of categories. Under some conditions, you can use some kind of 2D map where each category has a region (Venn diagram) and you put a marker per record in to the categories (intersections). The assigmenent to the categories can be considered as a usual vector and then self-organizing maps can be employed. This will be most likely related to some information loss, but it can cope with complex data approximately.
