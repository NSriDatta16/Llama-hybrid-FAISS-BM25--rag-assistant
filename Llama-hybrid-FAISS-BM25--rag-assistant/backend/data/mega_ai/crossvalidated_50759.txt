Artificial neural networks (ANN), are composed of neurons --- programming constructs that mimic the properties of biological neurons. A set of weighted connections between the neurons allows information to propagate through the network to adapt to specific tasks automatically, without the designer hand-crafting inputs and features. Neural networks have a wide variety of uses and flavors. Some prominent artificial neural network types are perceptron , conv-neural-network , rnn (e.g. lstm ). Modern feedforward neural networks are often comprised of many "layers", and often termed "deep networks" (a.k.a. "deep learning"), in contrast to so-called "shallow" networks comprised of a single hidden layer. Sometimes neural networks are used to train computers to learn strategies, e.g. in chess, Go, or video games; these models use reinforcement-learning approaches, e.g. q-learning . Among freely available, high-quality resources on neural networks, the Deep Learning book by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville can be mentioned.
