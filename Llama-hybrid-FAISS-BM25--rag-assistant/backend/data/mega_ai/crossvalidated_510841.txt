How to formalize or calculate parameters that maximize the likelihood without numerical method?

I am trying to understand how can we manually calculate the parameter with highest likelihoods. I don't want to use Maximum likelihood or any numerical method and want to understand the proccess. My explanation might be wrong, kindly let me know if I haven't explained it right. If I have heights observations $X= [45,55]$ and have first parameter values of $\mu = [40,60]$ and $\sigma = [1,2]$ Likelihood can be given as $P(X|\theta) = N(X;\theta)$ in this case. If we assume the observations i.i.d, what I understand is that we will have: $$L(\theta|X) = \prod_{i=1}^{N} N(x_i;\theta) $$ Do I need to loop (product/summation) for each combination of $\mu$ and $sigma$ and argmax ? How can I formulate this? What I understand is, I will will take all combinations of these parameters and evaluate for X and see which give maximum likelihood, but I am not sure about two values of X, should I take average of that ? Other thing that confuses me is regarding my other question , if I need to go through each combination of $\mu$ and $\sigma$ than isn't it same that we do for marginal likelihood $P(X)$ of Bayes rule, so aren't nominator(likelihood*prior) and marginal likelihood (denominator) in Bayes equally difficult to compute? Update : I know how to derivate and know that it is effecient to estimate this with MLE, I just wanted make sense of difficulty as I need to compare it with marginal likelihood/evidence and see why they both arent same. I have just written the code to show what i mean by manual/brute-force approach here. import numpy as np import scipy.stats as stats import math arr = [] max_l = max_m = max_s = 0 for m in [40,60]: for s in [1,2]: if stats.norm.pdf(55,m,s)>max_l: print('max is ',m,s) max_m = m max_s = s max_l = stats.norm.pdf(55,m,s) print(f"mu:{max_m},sigma:{max_s},max_likilihood:{max_l}") This produces mu:60,sigma:2,max_likilihood:0.00876415024678427 I am not sure, how to integrate different $X= [45,55]$ in this loop. Maybe multiple the two evaulation inside second loop stats.norm.pdf(55,m,s)*stats.norm.pdf(45,m,s) ?
