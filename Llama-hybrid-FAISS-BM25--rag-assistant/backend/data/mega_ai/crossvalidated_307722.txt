Rule between Inputs and Outputs

I have a set of 5 binary inputs and for each there are a set of 5 binary outputs. I would like to know what technique one could use to find the rule between them..? I've used Machine Learning in then past where the output (Response) is a single 1, or 0 in this case a simple classifier does the trick. I have never done this however when we have multiple outputs.. I1 I2 I3 I4 I5 O1 O2 O3 O4 O5 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 etc etc.... For maybe 100 rows Any help would be appreciated. Paul.
