Android: "java-lang-outofmemoryerror-bitmap-size-exceeds-vm-budget-android" While loading bitmaps from sdcard?

In my application I have to display an image which is about 10000 x 5000 , using small images of 500x500 px. I.e;thru tiling images. In order to tile all images to one initially am collecting all bitmaps from sdcard in order to draw on canvas. But while am loading images from extenal storage using BitmapFactory.decodeFile(path) i encounterd with error java-lang-outofmemoryerror-bitmap-size-exceeds-vm-budget-android can any one how to avoid this error and gimme an idea how to tile lot of images in to a single image . Thanking you, Srinivas
