Maximum likelihood in Naive Bayes classifier

With regards to the Naive Bayes classificator, I have read the following in Wikipedia and wanted to know why it is like that: "In many practical applications, parameter estimation for naive Bayes models uses the method of maximum likelihood; in other words, one can work with the naive Bayes model without accepting Bayesian probability or using any Bayesian methods." Therefore, if this is the case, I will be ignoring the probability that goes in the denominator: P(A|B) = P(B|A)*P(A) Can someone explain me in simple words what it means, please?
