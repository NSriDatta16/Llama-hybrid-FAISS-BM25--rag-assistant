gzipping server responses worse off

Following yahoos performance teams advice, I decided to enable mod_deflate on Apache. In checking the results (using HTTPWatch), the gzipped responses took on average a 100 milliseconds more than the non-gzipped? The server is on average load using have you guys experienced results as such or read about it? I very much appreciate any input. Thanks.
