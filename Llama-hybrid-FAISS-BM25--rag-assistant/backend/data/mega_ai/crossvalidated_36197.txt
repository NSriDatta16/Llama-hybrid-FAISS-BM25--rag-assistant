In a probit model with one binary predictor, you can interpret $F(\hat\alpha)$ as the probability of success (or whatever $Y=1$ means) for the baseline group. $F()$ is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal. If you also have continuous covariates, then it's the probability of success with them at zero (which is not really useful most of the time unless you centered the continuous variables by subtracting the mean, which gives you the probability for a baseline observation with the average characteristics). If you have two or more sets of dummies, it's the probability of success for the baseline observation for each set (female and single, for example). Each baseline effect is not identified separately. Dummies in non-linear models are explained very well in this Stata Journal paper by Tam√°s Bartus.
