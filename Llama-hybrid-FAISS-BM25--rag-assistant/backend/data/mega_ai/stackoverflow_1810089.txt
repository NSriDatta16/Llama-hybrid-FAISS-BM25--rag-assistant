COUNT() is an aggregate function, it aggregates against the results of the rest of your query. If you want to count all distinct names, and not just the distinct names associated with the id and address that you are selecting, then yes, you will have to run two queries. That's just how SQL works. Note that you should also have a group by clause when aggregating. I think the fact that MySQL doesn't require it is horrible, and it encourages really bad habits.
