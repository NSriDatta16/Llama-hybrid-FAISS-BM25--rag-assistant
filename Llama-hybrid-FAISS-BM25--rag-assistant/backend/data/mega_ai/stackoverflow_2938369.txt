I believe that yes, you can mix the two: however if you allocate an object with the normal allocator that holds a reference to an object you allocate with the garbage collecting one, then that reference will not be visible to the GC so that object may be prematurely deallocated. Have a look at the GC_MALLOC_UNCOLLECTABLE function specification if you need the GC to take account of references in memory that shouldn't be collected. In summary, yes, but here be dragons if you aren't careful!
