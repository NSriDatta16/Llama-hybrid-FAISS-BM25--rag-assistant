Combining ItemsControl with draggable items - Element.parent always null

I'm binding an ItemsControl with Canvas as ItemsPanelTemplate to an ObservableCollection. I want to make the items draggable using the DraggableExtender as posted in Dragging an image in WPF (I don't want to use transforms - I need to use the Canvas Left and Top properties) It's defined as : The DraggableExtender needs the parent of the element to be the Canvas, but the parent of my element (contentpresenter) is null, so the dragging doesn't work. So the obvious question is - what am I doing wrong ?
