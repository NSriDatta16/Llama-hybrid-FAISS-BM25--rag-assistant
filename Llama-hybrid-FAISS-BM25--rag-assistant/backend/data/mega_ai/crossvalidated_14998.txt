Proper test for time series

I have monthly precipitation for one site over a 35 year period. I would like to test if the total precipitation for a specific year is equal to the mean total precipitation for the rest of the period of record. In addition, I would also like to split the data into wet season [Nov-April] vs dry season [May-Oct]. I realize there are likely issues to take into account regarding auto-correlation, but I am yet analyze these types of data personally. Would someone please be kind enough to point me in the right direction? Thanks ahead of time. EDIT: IrishStat, The data is below, I use R, so below was created using dput(). I could figure this out, but it would take me a while and I would feel more confident if I were shown once. PPT
