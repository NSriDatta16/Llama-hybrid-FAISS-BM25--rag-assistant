Accuracy failure example

I am trying to understand the functioning of accuracy and I need a practical example . This is what I understood: it gets the average correctness of the predictions and in some cases its result can be different from reality. This is what I need to understand: Is it right to say that since accuracy averages, the real result could be composed by both half very distant and half very close values from reality? Is it right to say that accuracy might suggest a good result is achieved, while in reality the result is a disaster?" If my thinking is right, can you help me and provide a practical example of predictions which are correct on average but super wrong "alone"?
