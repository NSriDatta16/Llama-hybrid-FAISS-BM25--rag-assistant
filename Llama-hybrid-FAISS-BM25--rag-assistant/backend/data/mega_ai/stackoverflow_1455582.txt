I guess basically you would create multiple processes each of which creates a window/form. One of the processes has the master window in which every child window is embedded. That is as simple as calling SetParent . The windows in different processes would talk to each other using an IPC (Inter Process Communication) mechanism like named pipes or window messages. See this question for an embedding example of using SetParent in Delphi. See this question for an example of using named pipes in Delphi.
