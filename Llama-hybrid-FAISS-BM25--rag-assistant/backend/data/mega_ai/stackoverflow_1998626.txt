How much time does the average Open Source developer spend on projects?

This may be a little bit of a hard one to pin down exactly, but does anyone know have statistics on what the average amount of time a typical open source developer spends on a project?. I've heard figures of 2 hours on a weekend. I'm talking about unpaid work here which developers do in their spare time. Anyone know of any surveys that have been done etc? Thanks!
