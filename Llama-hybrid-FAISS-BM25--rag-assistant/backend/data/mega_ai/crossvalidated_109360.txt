The problem with your approach is that you start assuming that your data is normally distributed, when you already know it is not. Some outlier detection techniques are similar (it is sound) but make the same assumption. Rather than using the mean and the standard deviation, you may prefer the MAD (median absolute deviation) estimate, because is a more robust estimate of the deviation to use for thresholding your data. Another possibility is Tukey's outlier detection algorithm. Still, most importantly, you point out that your data may be bimodal (users and bots). I am mostly familiar with the standard unimodal approach. For such case, you may need some technique like GMM or kernel density estimation. I googled a bit, and came across this paper which seems really interesting and fit your problem quite well. Finally there are techniques for outlier detection, like SVMs which are distribution agnostic, and may work "out of the box", provided enough data.
