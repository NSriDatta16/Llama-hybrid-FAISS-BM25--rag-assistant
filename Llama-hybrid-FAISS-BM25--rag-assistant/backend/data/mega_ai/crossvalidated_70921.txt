EDIT: This answer was directed at the original question: Why does logistic regression require a clearly defined dichotomous variable as response/dependent variable? It is likely to read very strangely as an answer to the question which is currently Why do we need clearly defined variables as response/dependent variables? One could always define logit or logistic regression as requiring the response to be a binary or dichotomous variable, conventionally coded 0 or 1. Some software embodies such a definition in so far as data not satisfying such a definition will not be accepted as input or will be coerced to that form (e.g. all nonzero values are mapped on the fly to 1). But such a definition would be perverse, or at least narrow-minded. A main point about logit regression even for such input is that we can think of the response as being, or as representing, an underlying probability that varies continuously in a particular way, at least for continuous predictors. Consider, for example, precipitation falling as solid (snow) or liquid (rain) as temperature varies. As the temperature gets colder, the probability of snow goes to 1, and as it gets warmer it goes to 0: it's the probability that we are modelling and the 0 and 1 observed values are just grist for the mill. Furthermore, it also makes sense to apply such a model to a proportion that is inherently (or practically) a continuous response (e.g. the fraction or proportion of forest cover in a set of small areas). Historically, such interpretation came first! Logit or logistic treatments of responses came before the idea of using the logit as link function for binary responses. A minor classic dataset of this kind includes data on the incidence of Rhynchosporium secalis (leaf blotch) on the leaves of 10 varieties of barley grown at 9 sites in 1965 from Wedderburn, R.W.M. 1974. Quasilikelihood functions, generalized linear models and the Gauss-Newton method. Biometrika 61: 439â€“47. Blotch incidence is measured as a percent cover. Naturally, the usual assumptions of binomial distribution don't carry over, which is why a different approach is needed. Pedagogically, there is often a minor problem in so far as logit models for continuous responses often fall between texts or courses on categorical data analysis on the one hand and regression on the other hand. That said, your examples are puzzling. In a particular, a Yes-No question would seem to be another example of a clearly defined dichotomous variable.
