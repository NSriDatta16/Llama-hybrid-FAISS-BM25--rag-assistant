Using NSWindow or NSPanel as "CardLayout"

How guys. I'm not top dev in java, but what I`m really not is cocoa top dev :P I would like to have your assistance to produce a layout with cocoa and IB to work just like the CardLayout in Java. Do you have some idea of how to do it? Thanks for the attention! EDIT: CardLayout: A set of panels ("cards") are designed to compose a "deck of cards".It works like a queue of panels, in which only the first "card" is shown on the interface.I can easily interchange between cards if I want so to modify the interface to the user. I hope I could help you to help me. =)
