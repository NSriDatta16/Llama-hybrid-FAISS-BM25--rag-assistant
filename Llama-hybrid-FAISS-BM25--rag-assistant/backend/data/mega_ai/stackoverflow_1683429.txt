Shingle search could do the trick. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W-shingling For example, if you use 3-character shingles, you can split "Roisonic" to: "roi", "son", "ic ", and store all three values, associating them with original entry. When searching for "oison", you first will search for "ois", "iso", "son". First you fuzzy-match all entries by shingles (finding the one with "son"), and then you can refine the search by using exact string matching. Note that 3-character shingle require the fragment in query to be at least 5 characters long, 4-char shingle requires 7-char query and so on.
