This answer is a pretty long time after you asked the question, so not sure if it's of any use to you. DSpace currently does not support storing different parts of the data on different partitions, although your asset store can be located on its own partition separate from the database and the application. You may get want you need from the new DuraSpace application which deals with synchronising your data to the cloud. In terms of Java APIs, DSpace supports SWORD 1.3 which is a deposit-only protocol, and a lightweight implementation of WebDAV with SOAP. Other than that, it's somewhat lacking. If you are looking for a real back-end repository with good web services you might look at Fedora which is a pure back end, with no native UI, and probably more suited to your needs. DSpace and Fedora are both part of the DuraSpace organisation so you can probably benefit from that also. I'm not knowledgeable enough about the way that Fedora stores data to say whether you can physically separate the storage, though. Hope that helps.
