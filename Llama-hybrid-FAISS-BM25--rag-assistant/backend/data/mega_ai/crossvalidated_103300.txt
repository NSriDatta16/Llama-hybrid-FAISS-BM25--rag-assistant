The main reason why using ordinary least squares regression is frowned upon in modeling time series data is that the error terms are correlated with each other (this is called autocorrelation). If this is the case, then your standard errors from OLS will be incorrect, which affects hypothesis testing. There are several ways that you can use specialized techiniques to account for autocorrelation, such as autoregressive models with lags, generalized least squares, and HAC (heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent) standard errors.
