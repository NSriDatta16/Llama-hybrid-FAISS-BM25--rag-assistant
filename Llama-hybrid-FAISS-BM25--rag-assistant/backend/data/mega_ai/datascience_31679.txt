If I wanted to build a classifier that takes short time to be trained, I would rather simplify the classifier than the data. In this case, I would rather train a logistic regression model (probably with Ridge or Lasso regularization), than a very complex architecture with few of the data I have. If I had to simplify the data, I would take the average of the three channels, thus having a black and white image as input. I would not simplify it further (I am very confident that 4 points won't give decent accuracies). I don't really know your circumstances, but Lasso in logistic regression is a method that might allow you to select some pixels. As the coefficients obtained by Lasso are sparse ( see this answer ), Lasso will select the pixels that are relevant towards the prediction of the class. You can then train a bigger network with those pixels that allows you to capture nonlinearities and more complexity.
