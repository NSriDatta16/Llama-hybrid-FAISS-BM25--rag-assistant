How to remove all tags except for some using Nokogiri

How do I remove all tags below a certain node except for some elements using Nokogiri? For example, using this setup: src = Hello world ! This is another line. And a paragraph with a heading. Third line. EOS doc = Nokogiri::HTML(src) para = doc.at('//p') How can I remove all elements in the paragraph (while preserving their content) except and elements? So the result would be: Hello world ! This is another line. And a paragraph with a heading. Third line.
