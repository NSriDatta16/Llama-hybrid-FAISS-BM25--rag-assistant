How to document a Random Forest result (final model)?

Using Random Forest to predict dichotomous variables (for classification) I encountered the problem how to best document this model, i.e. I want the user to reproduce/use the final model I created on my computer. E.g. let's assume I want to proliferate the model (which I created in R) in a publication or to others how would you do this? MWE: If I want to document this model how am I able to do this (without including the data): data(iris) iris.rf How can I include the model iris.rf in a publication so that others can use it to predict Species with new data? I am looking for a way to make a forest reproducible for the reader/user (without having the data which was used for creating the forest necessarily). I was asking myself if there are other ways of publishing a RF without adding the source data.
