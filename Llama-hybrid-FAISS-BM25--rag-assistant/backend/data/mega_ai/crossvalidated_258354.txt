Random forest validation worse than one of its variables by itself

I am running a random forest in SAS using 6 variables, one of them being a score that works very well on its own. When I train the forest and validate on a test set, I'm seeing the following in terms of rank ordering the dependent var: RANDOM FOREST VALIDATION scorerank Bads Total BadRate 0 288 3878 0.0742650851 1 407 3879 0.1049239495 2 520 3878 0.134089737 3 602 3879 0.1551946378 4 729 3878 0.1879834966 So there is a clear separation in the 5 groups of rank ordered probabilities. However, when I use just the score on the same validation set I see this. SCORE VALIDATION scorerank Bads Total BadRate 0 789 3891 0.2027756361 1 616 3806 0.161849711 2 488 3766 0.1295804567 3 397 4213 0.0942321386 4 256 3716 0.0688912809 The direction of the ranking is reversed but not my concern as that is expected since a lower score is worse than a higher score. What is concerning is that the gap between the best and worst group is higher, indicating better separation. So conceptually how can a single variable in a random forest outperform the forest? Is this to be expected sometimes? Is there something I can tune in the model? I am using proc hpforest in SAS.
