Yes, there are reasons to adjust alpha. The simplest way to explain these is to note what Type I and Type II errors are, and that sometimes a Type II error is much worse than a Type I. (And to realize that by increasing the chance of one, you decrease the chance of the other). Suppose, for example, that you develop a drug that treats a previously incurable and terminal disease. Now a Type I error would mean saying the drug works when it doesn't and a Type II error would be saying it doesn't work when it does. In the first case, we give a useless drug to people who are dying; in the second, we fail to treat people who are dying. I'd say the second is much worse. Of course, sometimes it's the other way around. The blind acceptance of 0.05 and 0.20 for type I and type II errors is one of the hardest things to get PHBs to give up. (PHB = Pointy Haired Boss from Dilbert and could be a journal editor, a boss, a PhD committee or whatever).
