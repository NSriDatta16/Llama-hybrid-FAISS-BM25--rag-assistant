The normality that matters most in regressions is normality of residuals, as standard tests of significance are derived based on that assumption. Even then its importance can be overstated, as some deviations from normality aren't large enough to matter. See this page for extensive discussion about normality. As you sense, normality tests with just a few data points aren't going to be very reliable. One approach is to start with the overall plot of normality of residuals, which include all of your data points. If there are big problems with your model they might be expected to show up there. Also examine other standard quality-control plots for regressions , scale-location plots and plots of of residuals versus fitted values , versus leverage. If there are problems that are likely to invalidate your modeling approach, they should show up in those plots without your having to do strict normality testing.
