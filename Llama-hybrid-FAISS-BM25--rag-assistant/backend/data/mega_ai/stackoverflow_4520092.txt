Is it okay to use an id for tags?

My coworker is telling me I shouldn't use id's for paragraph tags... I think it's the way to go if you know you're only using that kind of paragraph once on the page. He also says that all elements on a page should only use class and not id, unless you are defining a header, container, or footer. I am fresh out of college and I learned to use id for things that will only show once on a page, while using class for things that will show multiple times on a page. Which way is proper?
