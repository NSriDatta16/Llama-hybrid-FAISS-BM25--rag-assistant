Test how much randomness is in the dataset

Given a labeled dataset, is there a way to quantify what percentage of the labels can be explained through the features? (I guess I'm trying to see what is the best theoretical performance get be obtained using a machine learning model) EDIT: For example, given the iris dataset , is it possible to tell what the highest possible classification accuracy is achievable? If a model classifies 80% of the test dataset correctly, is there a way to tell if further model improvements are possible?
