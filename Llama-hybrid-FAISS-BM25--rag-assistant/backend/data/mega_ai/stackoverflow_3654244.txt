This is ASCII code, the solution is "t" (116). However, we should pay attention to his helps, because he probably planned them. "This is not a mathematical question" Of course it is, we have to interpret the numbers as characters and find the number which can be used to fill the blank character, so, at the end of the task you could tell him that this is very much mathematical, because you had to complete a pattern using a function. "The sequence is important" Yes, 32 helps you to realize that he's talking about characters. "He believed only programmers would understand this" Some non programmers also understand this, but mostly programmers understand this. He tried to point out that you can meet these numbers when you work on program codes/debugging. "Think of the numbers as replacement for some sort of Alphabet." I'm sure you knew now the answer. He wanted to test your inventiveness and willpower. I've met this kind of questions at IQ tests (OK, in the IQ tests they didn't appeal on ASCII characters because most of the people haven't heard of ASCII). EDIT: Surely, this question was planned in advance, all the helps were further clues and they were interested how much time and how many clues will be needed to decipher the sequence. However, this is a mathematical question.
