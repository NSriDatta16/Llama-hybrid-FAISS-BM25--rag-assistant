Implementing Business Logic in 3 Tier Architecture

I have a web application I am working on and so far I have the data access layer finished. Each table has its own class that creates objects of rows of that table, so each object represents a row of a table. The functions each object has is basically CRUD operations. The question I have is, what is the best way to implement the business logic for the application? I am doing this in PHP so I could just have a file I include that has a bunch of functions but I want to have this organized better. The data access layer is already taking an OO approach so I would like to continue this.
