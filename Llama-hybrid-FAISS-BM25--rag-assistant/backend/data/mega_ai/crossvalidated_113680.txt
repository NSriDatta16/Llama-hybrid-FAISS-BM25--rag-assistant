Find linear subsets in a 2D point (xy) data

My problem is the very idea of how to start the analysis of 2D point patterns, specifically how to find linear trends within their spatial pattern. I have XY data points which are organized like in the plot, which I have manually marked with red lines in order to highlight what should be determined: This post suggests the use of kernel density estimation (which is the usual method I guess), but I would like to find out if there is any simpler way of doing this, avoiding the use of spatial statistics. R solution is preferred. UPDATE: When using the solution suggested by whuber (Hough transform) I get these lines as the most frequent ones in my scatterplot: Obviously these are not the lines I was searching for, but nevertheless it would be interesting to determine the very points that lie on the red line, for example.
