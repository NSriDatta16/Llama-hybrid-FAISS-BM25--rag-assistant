Don't know with ggplot , but with base graphics you can use identify : plot(length,coverage,type='p') identify(length,coverage) Now you can use your mouse to click on points and R will show which observation they correspond to. Clicking a mouse button other than the first ends the process and identify returns the observation numbers as its value.
