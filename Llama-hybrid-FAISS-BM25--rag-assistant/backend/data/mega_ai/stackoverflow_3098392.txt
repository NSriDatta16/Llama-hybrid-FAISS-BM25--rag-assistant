The elegant solution is namespaces introduced in C++. The solution, if there are few calls to func_name is take one, rename it and recompile. Something hackerous but quick solution might be this: //In one of the two source files and any file that calls it //if your functions is something like this //void func_name(int) { ... } //Add the following line #define func_name SOME_UNIQUE_FUNC_NAME
