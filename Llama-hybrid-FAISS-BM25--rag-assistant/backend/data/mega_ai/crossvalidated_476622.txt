Econometrics originally came from statistics. In general statistics is more general than econometrics, since while econometrics focuses in Statistical Inference, Statistics also deals with other important fields such as Design of Experiments and Sampling techiniques. However, today I may undoubtedly assert that Econometrics has also largely contributed to statistics as well. 1) The kind of statistical problem in economics: The first time I heard about linear regression was in the Physics lab when I was still a student of chemical engineering. I am not sure the specific class I was really having, but we may consider here that my class was a experiment to estimate the elasticity coefficient of a spring ... Easy! Even if your knowledge of physics is very limited, you can understand this experiment. Consider that one end of the spring is attached to the ceiling and the other end that is free, you want to attach a mass $m$ . Soon, the spring will expand and knowing Hooke's Law , the equilibrium position of the mass will be that in which the weight is equal to the force generated by the deformation of the spring. We can equate this idea as follows: $mg = kd$ , where $g$ is gravity, $k$ is the spring deformation constant and $d$ is how much the spring is expanded when you put the dough on its end. If you put different masses, you will have different deformations. Then you can build a data matrix where the dependent variable is $d$ (known exactly) and the independent variable is $mg$ (which is known), you can estimate the value of $1 / k$ from linear regression $$d = \alpha + \beta mg + u, $$ where $ \beta $ is an estimate of $1/k$ and $u$ is a possible error associated with the model. Note that: Cause : Higher weight Effect : Greater spring distension This effect is very clear. This situation is very rare in econometrics. In economics, few people know but the intention is to study/understand the choices of the government/families/companies… When we try to model choice situations, the cause-effect relationship is not explicit such as in above. Consider the following social-economic problem that comes from the field of Economics of Crime where cities would like to know how much they would need to increase the number of policemen to reduce crime. Therefore, the model of interest could take the following form: $$crimes = \alpha_1 + \beta_1 policemen + ... + u_1 $$ This model suggests that the number of crimes decreases with the number of policemen . Interpretation : If the number of policemen increase, the incentive to commit crimes reduce. Question: Does this equation answer the question above? Can we write cause = police $\Rightarrow$ effect = crimes ? No, why? Simply, because the number of policemen can be associated with the following model $$policemen = \alpha_2 + \beta_2 crimes + ... + u_2 $$ This model says that mayors respond to the number of crimes, increasing the number of policemen or a higher number of policemen is associated with areas of greater crime. Interpretation : If the crime in a given area increases and the mayor wants to get reelected, then she/he want to solve the problem and she/he increases the number of policemen. The cause and effect in this situation is not clear. This problem is called endogeneity and it is the rule in economics. In this case, the error term is not exogenous (it is easy to prove that) and we know that this is the most important assumption that we have to consider to ensure that the estimated parameters of our model are not biased. [This happens because if we use the ols estimator, it will force the error to be orthogonal to the regressors and in the case of this regression model, this does not happen.] Disclaimer: This is a classical model (that is very easy to explain) in economics. I am not suggesting or not suggesting that the number of policemen should be increased or not given the recent events that took place in USA. I am just talking about simple models to point some ideas. Most events in economics comes from equilibrium relations such as: A) Equilibrium models of Offer and Demand a) The demand decreses with the price of a given product b) The offer increases with the price of a given product. And we have in equilibrium Demand=Offer. tHow do we separate these effects in economics? B) Inflation and interest rate a) If the basic interest rate of the economy decreases, the economic activity increases and it is likely to increase the inflation. (here, the low interest rate seems to be causing the inflation) b) However, if the inflation is higher, central bank decision makers may decide to increase the interest rate to control the inflation. (here the high inflation seems to be causing the high interest rate) In fact, we have got another equilibrium relation. 2) The data we have in econometrics In many field in statistics, we are able to create experiments to generate the data we need. For instance, we want to test the effect of a drug. We divide the population in two parts and the first part receives the treatment and the second part does not receive it (receives the placebo). In many situations in economics is not possible to generate the “perfect” data to test a phenomenon. For instance, we may not play with the interest rate to estimate its effect on inflation. If we do that many people may lose their jobs due to a recession or may cause an hyper-inflation or a scape of international capital. Having said that in many situations in economics we have to leave with the data is out there, that is subject to lots of problems. So, the focus of econometrics is to arrive to relations as Cause-Effect as we found in the example with a spring above with an imperfect data. 3) The role of economic theory In econometrics the role of theory is very important. Usually economists want to test hypothesys. So the model is build in order to test these hypothesis. For instance, what is the effect of additional years of study in the wage of people? This is the kind of question that arise in the field of labor economics. 4) Models Models in econometrics focus in creating the cause-effect relationship in the situations discussed (for instance) above. The classical idea to deal endogeneity is to find instrumental variables that replace the endogeneous variables and we recover the exogeneity of the error term. An extension of this idea is the so-called two stage least square and also the generalized methods of moments. However, this is just a general overview of the field. If you realy want to have a general perspective of the field of econometrics I strongly suggest the book "Mostly Harmless Econometrics -- Joshua D. Angrist and Jörn-Steffen Pischke" or its simplified version "Mastering Metrics: The Path from Cause to Effect -- Joshua D. Angrist and Jörn-Steffen Pischke". Now the main contributions of the field are related to mix ideas of Econometrics with machine learning . It is worth mentioning that some ideas of this answer came from previous answers I gave to a Brazilian site: Endogeneity and Econometrics versus Statistics .
