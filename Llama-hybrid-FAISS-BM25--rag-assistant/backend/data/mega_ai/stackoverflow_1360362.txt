jrista is right on. I just want to add that you should seriously consider LINQ to SQL. From both a simplicity and a performance standpoint it is the better technology (for now). It is very fast and reasonably capable out-of-the-box. If you want to further improve LINQ to SQL, check out the PLINQO framework . PLINQO is a framework that sits around standard LINQ to SQL and adds a ton of features including some very elegant bulk operations and caching features. Best of all PLINQO adapts to changes in your database schema but preserves your custom code. Which is VERY slick and, in my opinion, the most valuable aspect.
