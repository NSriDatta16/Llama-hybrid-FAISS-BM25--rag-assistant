LSTM and Time series: My statements are corrects about those concepts?

I'm having some problems to understand LSTM theory and how exactly works a time series data in a Deep learning. To see if my thoughts are correct, I will make some statements (explanation) about how I think it's works and if I'm made mistakes, please corrects me! After that I will make some questions: Let's say that I want to create a time series regression based on this data: To evaluate my model, after the yellow line will be my validation set , which means that my training set will be the sequence before that line. To train my model, I will follow the same steps as in DNN (Dense Neural Network) model: Feed the data in B batchs >> Evaluate the loss >> apply Backpropagation But, to do this in a sequential data I need to create my samples, following the image bellow: Where X is in red and Y is in green . Basically I will feed [X1, X2, X3] and evaluate my loss in Y . Considering a time step equals to one , my training set will become something like this: (([X1, X2, X3], Y) ([X2, X3, X4], Y) ... ) Where X4 in the first row was Y , X5 will be Y in the second row and so on... Now I get stuck: 1 - let's say that I just have one LSTM layer with just one cell and considering the ([X1, X2, X3], Y) I will insert X1 , process (gates magic), insert X2 , process, insert X3 , process and then compare Yprediction to Y , take my loss and apply backpropagation? or I just insert [X1, X2, X3] at the same time as a vector(because as I discovered each LSTM gate is a small DNN) and then evaluate my loss? 2 - As I said earlier, each gate is indeed a DNN? Their architectures are defined or I just need to specify (how many layers and so on)? 3 - Following DNN model, the so called LSTM cells are fully connected? lets say that I have two LSTM layers, they will follow this same structure where every cell from first layer is connected to each cell from the second one? PS : Yes, I read colah post , but I did not figure out those points.
