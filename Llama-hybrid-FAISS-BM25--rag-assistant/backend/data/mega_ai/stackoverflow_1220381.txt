Adding attribute to entity in Core Data

I've created all of my Managed Objects after mapping out all entities/attributes/relationships in the data model. Now I have the problem of needing to add additional attributes/relationships I haven't thought of when I first designed one of my entities/classes. Is there a way to modify my existing NSManagedObject class with Core Data short of wiping all of my models and re-creating them based on the new xcdatamodel? Will adding the attribute in the xcdatamodel update the underlying storage mechanism also? Say if I'm using SQLite3 as my persistent storage, will it add the column accordingly?
