It can be a balancing act. I've been bitten by "improving" some code that was working, but I thought was ugly, and introduced some stupid new bug. On the other hand, on several occasions in my career, I've struggled with some badly designed piece of crap code (written by me or someone else) - sometimes for weeks - because I didn't think I had time to fix it. In each case, I finally bit the bullet and did it over again properly, and the problems went away almost immediately. Then I wished I'd fixed it sooner - would have been faster in the long run. Focus your efforts on the sections that are giving you actual grief - the sections that you need to work on (new features, bug fixes), but you're afraid to touch because they're so fragile, or hideous. That's probably a good indicator - the more you're afraid of it, the more it needs to be fixed. -Tom Bushell
