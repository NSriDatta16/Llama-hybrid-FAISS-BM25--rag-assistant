How to apply a random forest model to a new dataset without a response variable in R?

I am trying to predict the species abundance on a new data set using my random forest model. The RF regression model was built using a training dataset 70% and validated using 30% of the initial data set aside at the beginning. The model worked great and I got the results I wanted. Now I want to use that model to calculate the predictions of a species abundance on a new data set which does not contain the response variable, is this possible? My current RF model is: RF where the 'Count' of manatees is the response variable, the season, month, seagrass, wwrefuge, bathymetry, salinity, and wtemp are the predictor variables The new dataset I have contains the same predictor variables but does not have a Count value associated with it. I have tried running the predict function in randomforest but keep getting the error " Type of predictors in new data do not match the training data. " RF.pred I have also tried adding a column to the new dataset called Count with NA values but this also returned the same error. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!
