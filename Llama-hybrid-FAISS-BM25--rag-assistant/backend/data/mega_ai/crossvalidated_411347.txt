Analysing and Reporting ordinal logistic regression in R

was wondering if anyone could help. Sorry if this question has been asked before - cannot find it anywhere I am running multiple ordinal logistic regressions using R, using the "ordinal" package, and CLM function. It produces and output table like this one: Output wihtout the interaction: From this, and a few additional follow up tests, this is how I have interpreted this: There was no main effects of timing on juror confidence in their verdicts (p= 0.740) (before, M=6.31 , SD= 2.08) (after, M= 6.45 , SD= 2.15) or complexity of the expert testimony (p= 0.329) (standard: m=6.10, SD=2.22) (scientific: m=6.70, SD =2.01). However, there was an interaction between complexity and timing (p= 0.018). Further analysis found that confidence would go up by 1.306 if the expert testimony was presented before the eyewitness account, regardless of the complexity of the testimony. However, I am unsure how to report this results for a statistical paper, using this output. For example, I do not have any degrees of freedom? Any help would be much appreciated.
