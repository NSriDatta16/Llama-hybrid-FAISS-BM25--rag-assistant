What does neural network learn? function, parameter or distribution?

I've learned that a neural network provides a great function approximation. But in some books, it's said that a neural network outputs a "parameter", for example, mean when Gaussian distribution is assumed. I'm confused with these two facts since in the first view a neural network is just a big function while the second view says that it just provides a parameter, which is a fixed value. How can I harmonize these two ideas?
