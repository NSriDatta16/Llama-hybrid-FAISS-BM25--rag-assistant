If you go with the multilevel model approach you need random intercept of participant in any case because that takes care of the non-independence of your data points. About the random slope: there's a relatively recent simulation study suggesting that you should always include random slope of the level 1 predictor if you include a cross-level interaction, otherwise you get inflated estimates. So there's that. (So you don't need to include the random slope of the interaction, just the random slope of the level 1 predictor in the interaction, and the interaction itself as a fixed effect). However with categorical level 1 predictors and so few level 1 observations a lmer model with a random slope is probably not going to converge. Not sure how to solve this. These are my intuitions, which may be off: You could try using some optimizers, or maybe a bayesian model, which are often considered to work better with sparse data. Also, I've seen glmmTMB function make models converge when lmer doesn't. You could also move to a single-level model using clustered standard errors to deal with the non-independence.
