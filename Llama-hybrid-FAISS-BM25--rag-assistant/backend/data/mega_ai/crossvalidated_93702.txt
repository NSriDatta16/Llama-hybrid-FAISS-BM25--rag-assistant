You might consider doing LD (Linkage Disequilibrium) SNP pruning to get your feature set down to a more manageable level. The idea is that lots of neighboring SNPs are very highly correlated. So often only SNPs that are in LD are considered. This probably won't get it down to 20,000 but its a good start that you will see in a lot of the GWAS literature. You might consider a penalized regression approach ( glmnet in R) which will do some automatic variable selection as well as multinomial regression. For SNP data I highly recommended Sean Purcell's PLINK program. As a side note, I would also do PCA on the SNPs and incorporate the first few leading PCs to control for ethnicity (called population stratification in the genetics literature).
