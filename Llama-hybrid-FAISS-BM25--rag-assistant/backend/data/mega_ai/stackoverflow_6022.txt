I am looking for many answers to learn about new tools and consolidate this knowledge in a one question/thread, so I doubt there will be 1 true answer to this question. My answer to my own question is that we use: Findbugs to look for common errors bad/coding - run from maven, and also integrates easily into Eclipse Cobertura for our coverage reports - run from maven Hudson also has a task-scanner plugin that will display a count of your TODO and FIXMEs, as well as show where they are in the source files. All are integrated with Maven 1.x in our case and tied into Hudson, which runs our builds on check-in as well as extra things nightly and weekly. Hudson trend graphs our JUnit tests, coverage, findbugs, as well as open tasks. There is also a Hudson plugin that reports and graphs our compile warnings. We also have several performance tests with their own graphs of performance and memory use over time using the Hudson plots plugin as well.
