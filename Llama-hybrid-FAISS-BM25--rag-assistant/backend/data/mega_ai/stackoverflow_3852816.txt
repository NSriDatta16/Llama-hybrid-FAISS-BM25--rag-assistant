Silverlight - How should I implement drag in canvas?

I am building a little app for the Windows Phone 7 (Silverlight 3) which allows the user to add objects to the screen and drag them around. My class is defined as the following: public class Frame { public double Height{ get; set; } public double Width { get; set; } public Uri Image { get; set; } public string Details { get; set; } public SolidColorBrush BgColor { get; set; } } My question is about my approach on how to implement this. I am fairly new to SilverLight (have experience in WPF) and am finding out the things in WPF that are missing in SL3 (commanding, for instance). As I see it I could: a) use a ListBox with a Canvas in the ItemsPanelTemplate and bind it to a ObservableCollection . In WPF would use commands in the DataTemplate for the events involved in the Drag/Drop. But there are no commands in SL3. b) As the user adds a new object, I could create an instance of Frame and then wire the necessary events. How can I apply a DataTemplate in this case? Which route should I take? How to overcome the challenges describe above? Any better suggestion? Thanks
