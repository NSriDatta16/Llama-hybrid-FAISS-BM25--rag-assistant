The only means I can think of is to use one (or potentially more) of the following css rules: img { page-break-before: auto; /* 'always,' 'avoid,' 'left,' 'inherit,' or 'right' */ page-break-after: auto; /* 'always,' 'avoid,' 'left,' 'inherit,' or 'right' */ page-break-inside: avoid; /* or 'auto' */ } I half-recall that these declarations only apply to block-level elements (so you'd also have to define display: block; on your image, or use some kind of wrapping container and apply the rules to that (whether it's in a paragraph, div, span, list, etc...). Some useful discussion here: " What are most usefule media="print" specific, cross-browser compatible CSS properties? " References: page-break-after . page-break-before . page-break-inside .
