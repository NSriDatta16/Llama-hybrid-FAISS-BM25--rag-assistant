I would just build a new MVC website that handles the administration. You have a more flexible solution as long as you've separated the data and the business logic in different assembly's. You could then publish your website to a subdomain, admin.yoursite.com for example. That way you don't have to mess with your routes and you can keep them in separate views which imho is the most elegant solution. Pro's and Con's would be nice to hear. I'm working on a project which will need the same administration site but haven't got that far yet so this question interests me a lot.
