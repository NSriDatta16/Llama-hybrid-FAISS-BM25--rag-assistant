I agree with Robert Munteanu. Basically you roll up your business logic that isn't inherent in your model into a middle tier. The middle tier is the business tier / business objects / business logic layer / etc, but is just referred to as a service tier. It doesn't have to be a webservice, its a broad use of the term service in that it aggregates functionality of a specific application area. You would basically have a CustomerService class that contains the repository reference. Your presentation layer would reference the service layer class. There is an additional distinction that can be made as a guess from your name you are using .net, and probably using LINQ to SQL as your repository as outlined in NerdDinner. The Repository typically returns IQueryable to the service layer, allowing the service layer chain together multiple queries to build different result sets. The Service then evaluates the expression using ToList or another similar method and returns that to the presentation layer.
