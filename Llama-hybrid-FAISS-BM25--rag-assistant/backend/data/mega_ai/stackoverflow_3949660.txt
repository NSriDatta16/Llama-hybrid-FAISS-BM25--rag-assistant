Yes, the filtered non clustered index will be used for: queries than scan very very few records, eg. have WHERE date ='20101016' (filter out a single day, few records from the 270M). queries than scan larger date ranges, but touch only the date field: SELECT COUNT(date) FROM ... WHERE date BETWEEN '20080101' AND '20090101' And that's about it. Any more complex query will not use the non-clustered index, filtered or not-filtered, because it will hit the index tipping point . So in conclusion, for general queries on this table that have a WHERE date > '200080101' clause your proposed filtered non-clustered index will help... nothing . Furthermore, even if you would move the date as the clustered index leftmost key (which is the typical organization of time range queries time series, like your table seems to be, and you should consider it yourself), filtering out 'only' 140M out of 270M is hardly an optimization. Proper indexing is a complex topic. I urge you to read everything in this MSDN link, including all the sub-chapters: Designing Indexes . This will give you the bare minimal knowledge to understand some more complicated articles and to be able to discern right from baloney on the plethora of misinformation available out there.
