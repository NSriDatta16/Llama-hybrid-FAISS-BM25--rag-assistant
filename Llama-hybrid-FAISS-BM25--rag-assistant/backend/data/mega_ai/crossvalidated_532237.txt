Statistical test - Time-series - Marketing

I want to compare to see if there is a statistically significant difference between the mean of times-series A and time-series B. Each time series represent the amount of daily revenue for each campaign. Both campaigns are targeting a different list of users. Each user can be in one of the lists but not in another. Both time series have lag 1 autocorrelation of > 0.5, so it seems t-test should not be used here. Is there a statistical test I can use to compare the means of the groups?
