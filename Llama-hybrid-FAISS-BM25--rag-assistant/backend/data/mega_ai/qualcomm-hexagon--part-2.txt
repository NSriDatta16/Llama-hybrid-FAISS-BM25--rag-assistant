ng and computer vision to be processed on the DSP instead of the CPU. In March 2015 Qualcomm announced their Snapdragon Neural Processing Engine SDK which allow AI acceleration using the CPU, GPU and Hexagon DSP. Qualcomm's Snapdragon 855 contains their 4th generation on-device AI engine, which includes the Hexagon 690 DSP and Hexagon Tensor Accelerator (HTA) for AI acceleration. Snapdragon 865 contains the 5th generation on-device AI engine based on the Hexagon 698 DSP capable of 15 trillion operations per second (TOPS). Snapdragon 888 contains the 6th generation on-device AI engine based on the Hexagon 780 DSP capable of 26 TOPS. Snapdragon 8 contains the 7th generation on-device AI engine based on the Hexagon DSP capable of 52 TOPS and up to 104 TOPS in some cases. Software support Operating systems The port of Linux for Hexagon runs under a hypervisor layer ("Hexagon Virtual Machine") and was merged with the 3.2 release of the kernel. The original hypervisor is closed-source, and in April 2013 a minimal open-source hypervisor implementation for QDSP6 V2 and V3, the "Hexagon MiniVM" was released by Qualcomm under a BSD-style license. Compilers Support for Hexagon was added in 3.1 release of LLVM by Tony Linthicum. Hexagon/HVX V66 ISA support was added in 8.0.0 release of LLVM. There is also a non-FSF maintained branch of GCC and binutils. Adoption of the SIP block Qualcomm Hexagon DSPs have been available in Qualcomm Snapdragon SoC since 2006. In Snapdragon S4 (MSM8960 and newer) there are three QDSP cores, two in the Modem subsystem and one Hexagon core in the Multimedia subsystem. Modem cores are programmed by Qualcomm only, and only Multimedia core is allowed to be programmed by user. They are also used in some femtocell processors of Qualcomm, including FSM98xx, FSM99xx and FSM90xx. Third-party integration In March 2016, it was announced that semiconductor company Conexant's AudioSmart audio processing software was being integrated into Qualcomm's Hexagon. In May 2018 wolfSSL added support for using Qualcomm Hexagon. This is support for running wolfSSL crypto operations on the DSP. In addition to use of crypto operations a specialized operation load management library was later added. Versions There are six versions of QDSP6 architecture released: V1 (2006), V2 (2007–2008), V3 (2009), V4 (2010–2011), QDSP6 V5 (2013, in Snapdragon 800), and QDSP6 V6 (2016, in Snapdragon 820) V4 has 20 DMIPS per milliwatt, operating at 500 MHz. Clock speed of Hexagon varies in 400–2000 MHz for QDSP6 and in 256–350 MHz for previous generation of the architecture, the QDSP5. Availability in Snapdragon products Both Hexagon (QDSP6) and pre-Hexagon (QDSP5) cores are used in modern Qualcomm SoCs, QDSP5 mostly in low-end products. Modem QDSPs (often pre-Hexagon) are not shown in the table. QDSP5 usage: QDSP6 (Hexagon) usage: Hardware codec supported The different video codecs supported by the Snapdragon SoCs. D - decode; E - encode FHD = FullHD = 1080p = 1920x1080px HD = 720p which can be 1366x768px or 1280x720px Snapdragon 200 series The different video codecs supported by the Snapdragon 200 series. Snapdragon 400 series The different video codecs supported by the Snapdragon 400 series. Snapdragon 600 series The different video codecs supported by the Snapdragon 600 series. Snapdragon 700 series The different video codecs supported by the Snapdragon 700 series. Snapdragon 800 series The different video codecs supported by the Snapdragon 800 series. Code sample This is a single instruction packet from the inner loop of a FFT: { R17:16 = MEMD(R0++M1) MEMD(R6++M1) = R25:24 R20 = CMPY(R20, R8):<<1:rnd:sat R11:10 = VADDH(R11:10, R13:12) }:endloop0 This packet is claimed by Qualcomm to be equal to 29 classic RISC operations; it includes vector add (4x 16-bit), complex multiply operation and hardware loop support. All instructions of the packet are done in the same cycle. See also Qualcomm Snapdragon List of Qualcomm Snapdragon processors Nvidia NVDE
