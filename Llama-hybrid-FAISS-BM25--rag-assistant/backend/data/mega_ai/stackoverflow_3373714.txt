Well, I did as many other did, I recreated the project and moved the content to the new project. Some lessons learned that may be valuable for others: First, I tried to create an empty project and then copied all content by just dragging the files (classes, sound files, xib files, etc.). That didn't work, complaints about that it couldn't load the files. May also have to do with that I changed name of the project earlier, that's actually when all problems started. I created a new project that's window-based. Could be my incompetence, but I didn't manage to get the first view loaded properly and, hence, ended up with a grey first view. I created all files and xibs and copied the code from to the newly created class files. I copied/pasted all graphical objects in my xib and configured everything as they're supposed to be (class associations, actions, outlets, etc). I created a new view-based application with exactly the name I was going to use for my app. By doing this I get the delegate AND controller file for free, and I was hoping that some of the assocations I failed to do was going to come for free now. Differently from 2 above, I now added my files by rigth-clicking on Classes/Other Resources/etc.->Add->Existing Files. The only thing I dragged from my old project was png-files. I cannot really explain why, but I guess that some associations happens behind the scenes when xCode creates the delegate and controller files which I couldn't controll when creating a windows based project, due to my incompetence or how xCode works.
