Accessing scrollbar in a group component Flex 4

This is the setup. I have created a timeline with a playhead. When my playhead is dragged I would like the timeline to scroll with the drag. So far, the only way I can do this is by setting clipAndEnableScrolling to true. But in this case I lose the scrollbars(not to mention the impact on my view). So what I would like is to set this property to false and dynamically affect the horizontal scrollbar's position, in other words enable scrolling without the clipping. Any ideas?
