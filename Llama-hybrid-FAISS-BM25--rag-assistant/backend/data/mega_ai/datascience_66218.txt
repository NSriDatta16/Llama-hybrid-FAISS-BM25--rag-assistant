Solution: Residual Plots What is R 2 The definition of R-squared is fairly straight-forward; it is the percentage of the response variable variation that is explained by a linear model. R 2 = Explained variation / Total variation R 2 is always between 0 and 100%: 0% indicates that the model explains none of the variability of the response data around its mean. 100% indicates that the model explains all the variability of the response data around its mean. Limitations R 2 value has limitations. You cannot use R 2 to determine whether the coefficient estimates and predictions are biased, which is why you must assess the residual plots. R 2 does not indicate if a regression model provides an adequate fit to your data. A good model can have a low R 2 value. On the other hand, a biased model can have a high R 2 value! Interpreting Residual Plots A residual is a difference between the observed y-value (from scatter plot) and the predicted y-value (from regression equation line). A residual plot is a graph that shows the residuals on the vertical axis and the independent variable on the horizontal axis. If the points in a residual plot are randomly dispersed around the horizontal axis, a linear regression model is appropriate for the data; otherwise, a non-linear model is more appropriate. Good Fit Bad Fit An unbiased model has residuals that are randomly scattered around zero. Non-random residual patterns indicate a bad fit despite a high R 2 . High R 2 and Bad Fit Example Refer fitted line plot and residual plot below. It displays the relationship between semiconductor electron mobility and the natural log of the density for real experimental data. Here R-squared is 98.5%. However, look closer to see how the regression line systematically over and under-predicts the data (bias) at different points along the curve. You can also see patterns in the Residuals versus Fits plot, rather than the randomness that you want to see. This indicates a bad fit. Always check residual plots!
