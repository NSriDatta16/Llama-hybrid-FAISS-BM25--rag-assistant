A great tutorial on the garbage collector is Tuning Garbage Collection (unfortunately the new oracle website has messed its formatting up quiet a lot). Your question is handled in chapter V. This basically explains which types of strategies you can use in the Java garbage collector and which are default. Most desktop applications will be interested in a stop that is as small as possible, because this is what the user might notice. Note that your question is not about defragmentation. Both will eventually compress the memory space.
