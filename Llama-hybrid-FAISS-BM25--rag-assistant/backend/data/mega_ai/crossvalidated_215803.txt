For SVM the objective is convex, which means you will have a unique solution for each problem setting. There are many SVM libraries available, why not compare your results with the libraries' output? For SVM your predictor is $$ f(\mathbf x)=\sum_i \alpha_iy_iK(x,x_i) $$ And you are trying to use algorithms to get all the $\alpha$. You can directly compare the $\alpha$ got from your algorithm with the $\alpha$ from the libraries. Also if your interest is trying to verify your gradient decent works well, you can use many optimization toolboxes to optimize your objective function and compare results. Your optimization problem should be $$ \max_\alpha \sum_i\alpha_i-\frac 1 2 \sum_i\sum_j \alpha_i \alpha_j y_i y_j K(\mathbf x_i,\mathbf x_j) $$ You can calculate the Kernel matrix and feed it into a solver to get all $\alpha$ Many R solver can detect if the problem is convex and if the result is converge. Please check this task view for details.
