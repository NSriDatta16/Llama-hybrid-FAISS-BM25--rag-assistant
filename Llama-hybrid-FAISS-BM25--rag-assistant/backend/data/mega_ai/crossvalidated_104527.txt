bayesian logistic regression - gaussian distribution on parameters?

I'm trying to read this article about Bayesian logistic regression. In general, to classify instances, they use: $p(y=+1 |\beta) = \sigma(\beta^TX) $ (where $\sigma$ is obviously the sigmoid function). Now they need to find the values of $\beta$. They then say that to avoid overfitting, they'll use a prior distribution on $\beta$ specifying that each value of $\beta$ is likely to be near 0. They then impose a univariate Gaussian prior with mean =0 and variance >0 on each parameter $\beta$. (Section 3). What I don't understand is: How does specifying $\beta$ to be near 0 help avoid overfitting? How could one assume a Gaussian distribution on a set of parameters that they're supposed to estimate ? Any kind of help would be greatly appreciated...
