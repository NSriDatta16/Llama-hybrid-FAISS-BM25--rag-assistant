The principal advantage of B+ trees over B trees is they allow you to pack in more pointers to other nodes by removing pointers to data, thus increasing the fanout and potentially decreasing the depth of the tree. The disadvantage is that there are no early outs when you might have found a match in an internal node. But since both data structures have huge fanouts, the vast majority of your matches will be on leaf nodes anyway, making on average the B+ tree more efficient.
