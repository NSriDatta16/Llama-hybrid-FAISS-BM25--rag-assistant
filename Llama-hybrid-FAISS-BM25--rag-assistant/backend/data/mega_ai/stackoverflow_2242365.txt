Like others here, I can't think of any general cases where a clear advantage exists, so my thinking turned to situational advantages -- are there any cases where there is an advantage in a particular scenario? Advantage: Leverage the C++ skill set of technical staff in a rapid prototyping scenario. Let me elaborate ... I have worked quite a bit with scientists and (non-software) engineers who aren't formally trained programmers. Many of these people use C++ for developing specific modules involving high-end physics/mathematics. If a pure .NET module is required in a rapid prototyping scenario and the skill set of the scientist/engineer responsible for the module is C++, I would teach them a small amount of additional syntax ( public ref , ^ and % and gcnew ) and get them to program up their module as a 100% managed C++/CLI DLL. I recognize there are a whole heap of possible "Yes, but ..." responses, but I think leveraging the C++ skill set of technical staff is a possible advantage of C++/CLI.
