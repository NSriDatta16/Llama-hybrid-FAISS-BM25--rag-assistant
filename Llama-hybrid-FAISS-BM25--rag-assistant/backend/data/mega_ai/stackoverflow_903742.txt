Is there an ORM that can dynamically generate a DAL from within a .Net WinForms app?

I'd greatly appreciate your advice on a strange specification. We have a requirement to create an application where users can drag/drop field types onto a form so that they can create their own "app". I have the front-end setup, but the back-end is a big problem. There are forward mapping ORMs and reverse mapping ORMs, yet I've not found one that can embed within the application and generate the tables, relationship, etc. when the user starts up the app. Of course, if a table, field or other entity already exists, it would not overwrite them (and overwrite the underlying data). ActiveRecord is the closest I've found, but it is web based and does not extend to a WinForm environment. I would SO prefer not have our crew write our own DAL, debug it, etc. when there might be an ORM out there that can do this. Does anyone know of an ORM that can do this? If not, how would you go about solving this nightmare in the making? Thank you so much for your help.
