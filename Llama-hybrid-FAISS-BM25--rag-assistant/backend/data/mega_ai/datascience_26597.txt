How to set the number of neurons and layers in neural networks

I am a beginner to neural networks and have had trouble grasping two concepts: How does one decide the number of middle layers a given neural network have? 1 vs. 10 or whatever. How does one decide the number of neurons in each middle layer? Is it recommended having an equal number of neurons in each middle layer or does it vary with the application?
