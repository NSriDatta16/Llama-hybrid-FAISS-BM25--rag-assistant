I think I would not even show the state selector, if neither US nor Canada has been selected from the country selector. This approach has two advantages, users from all other countries are not bothered by meaningless content, you don't have to deal with unwanted input. Now I would save the value of the country selector via AJAX and then send/activate the additional selector div with the response, if needed. After your edit: How flexible are you then? If you are stuck with some existing code then a cron job which eliminates unnecessary state entries might be another way. I mean you could also handle the state later on retrieval but I assume there is also preexisting code which creates addresses and that code doesn't check if the state makes sense...
