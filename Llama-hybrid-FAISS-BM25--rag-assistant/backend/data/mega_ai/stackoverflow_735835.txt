Problems closing tabs

I've a WPF app organized with tabs. I added a small button to each tabitem header that allow the user to close the tab. When the user click on the small button, I remove the tabItem from the tabControl. tabControl.Items.Remove(tabItem); As result of this the tabItem dissapears, and that is fine, but here comes the problem: The TabItem is not visible(good), but it still exists(bad). If I put a timer inside, the timer execucutes his Tick, and more important, if I've a datagrid with 200.000 records and I close the Tab, The garbage collector don't release the memory as I expected. I asked google about the problem and I've implemented some of the advices described. It didn't work. Can anyone help me? Thanks
