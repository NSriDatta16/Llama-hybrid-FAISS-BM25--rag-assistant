ValueError:Input 0 of layer sequential is incompatible with the layer

i represented each row in my dateset as a 15552 cell which is spectrogram colored image(72 72 3), that is represent the audio features, 72*72 is the size of spectrogram image and 3 referred to the 3 channels for RGB values. and each colored pixel is represented in 3 cells side by side and the next 3 cells referred to the next colored pixel and so on. and when i create my model i tried to make the input shape as following `input_shape=(72, 72, 3) to convert the input image to image so i can use it in CNN model. Here is the code: from google.colab import files uploaded = files.upload() #Letâ€™s treat the Readername column as the output (Y). y= dset.readear #Simultaneously we will have to drop the column from dataset to form the input vector. x=dset.drop('readear',axis=1) # define one hot encoding encoder = OneHotEncoder(sparse=False) # transform data y= encoder.fit_transform(y.values.reshape(-1,1)) #the split ratio of 80:20. The 20% testing data set is represented by the 0.2 at the end. x_train,x_test,y_train,y_test=train_test_split(x,y,test_size=0.2) class_names=['A','G','D','u','E','h','k','t','b','m','i','s','fa','n'] x_train = np.asarray(x_train).astype('float32') y_train = np.asarray(y_train).astype('float32') #the model model = models.Sequential() model.add(layers.Conv2D(72, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(72, 72, 3))) model.add(layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2))) model.add(layers.Conv2D(144, (3, 3), activation='relu')) model.add(layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2))) model.add(layers.Conv2D(144, (3, 3), activation='relu')) model.add(layers.Flatten()) model.add(layers.Dense(144, activation='relu')) model.add(layers.Dense(14)) model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True), metrics=['accuracy']) history = model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, validation_data=(x_test, y_test)) But always the fit function give my the following error: ValueError: Input 0 of layer sequential is incompatible with the layer: : expected min_ndim=4, found ndim=2. Full shape received: (None, 15552) can any one tell me how can i fix it?
