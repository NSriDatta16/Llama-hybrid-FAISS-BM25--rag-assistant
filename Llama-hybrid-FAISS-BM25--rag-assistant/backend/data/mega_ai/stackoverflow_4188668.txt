You can still use the old api's, but as you can probably imagine it is discouraged. Read more in the facebook developer documentation . EDIT Given your name, I assume that you know a bit of php. To get started just go to http://www.facebook.com/developers and create a new application. Facebook then presents you with the following tutorial, that I think you should be able to follow: Step 1: Download Facebook's PHP Library Extract this archive into a directory on your hosting server where you can host and run PHP code: $ curl -L http://github.com/facebook/php-sdk/tarball/master | tar xvz $ mv facebook-php-sdk-* facebook-php-sdk $ cp facebook-php-sdk/examples/example.php index.php Step 2: Replace the IDs in index.php to have your own app information It should look like this when you're done: 'CHANGE_TO_YOUR_OWN_APP_ID', 'secret' => 'CHANGE_TO_YOUR_OWN_SECRET', 'cookie' => true, ));
