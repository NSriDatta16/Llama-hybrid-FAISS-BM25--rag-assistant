What causes perfect prediction but no significant predictors in logistic regression?

I want to do a logistic regression with R. I have 18 continuous covariates and a sample consisting of 100 observations. When I enter all of the covariates into the glm() model, none of them are significant, but the model predicts the outcome perfectly on the test data! My questions are: Is the sample size large enough for running glm() with this many covariates? What might be other causes of the problem? How can I run such a model properly?
