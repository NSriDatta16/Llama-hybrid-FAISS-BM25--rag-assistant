Is it safe to assume that STL vector storage is always contiguous?

If you have an STL vector which has been resized, is it safe to take the address of element 0 and assume the rest of the vector will follow in memory? e.g. vector vc(100); // do some stuff with vc vc.resize(200); char* p = &vc[0]; // do stuff with *p
