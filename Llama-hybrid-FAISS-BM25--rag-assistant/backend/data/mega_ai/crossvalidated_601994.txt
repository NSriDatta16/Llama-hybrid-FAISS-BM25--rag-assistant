Interpreting regression coefficient for model with log(y+1) transformed outcome variable with small y

I have a model which is aiming to estimate the ATE (average treatment effect) of a binary treatment on a count data outcome variable. Since the outcome can sometimes take a 0 value, I use the transform log(y + 1) to cope with this. With log transformed outcome variables, you can interpret your ATE result as a percentage. However, I'm unsure how to reason about the marginal effects for my log(y+1) case given the treatment impact as a percentage fluctuates, especially at low levels of y. The below is as far as I've got with this. We can use $ \hat{ATE} $ to relate hypothetical outcomes without ( $ y_1 $ ) and with ( $ y_2 $ ) treatment using the following... $ log(y_2 + 1) - log(y_1 + 1) = \hat{ATE} $ $ \frac{y_2 + 1}{y_1 + 1} = exp(\hat{ATE}) $ $ y_2 = exp(\hat{ATE})(y_1 + 1) - 1 $ $ \frac{y_2}{y_1} = exp(\hat{ATE}) + \frac{exp(\hat{ATE}) - 1}{y_1} $ We can convert the $ y_2/y_1 $ ratio to a percentage $ (\hat{ATE}_{pct}) $ as below... $ \hat{ATE}_{pct} = (exp(\hat{ATE}) + \frac{exp(\hat{ATE}) - 1}{y_1} - 1) * 100 $ Given the median untransformed outcome in my dataset is 10, the differences in percentage impact of treatment are non-trivial for different levels of y. How would you recommend interpreting this so others can better understand my results? Any help would be appreciated, Thanks
