I've heard of Skip Graphs ( http://www.google.com/search?ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&sourceid=navclient&gfns=1&q=skip+graphs ), a probabilistic graph structure that is - as far as I know - already in use in some peer-to-peer applications. These graphs are kind of self-organizing and their goal is to achieve a good connectivity and a small diameter. There is a distributed algorithm that tries to achieve such graphs: http://www14.informatik.tu-muenchen.de/personen/jacob/Publications/podc09.pdf
