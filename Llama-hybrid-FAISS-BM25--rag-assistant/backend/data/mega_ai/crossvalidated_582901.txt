Unfortunately, people will tend to extrapolate if you slap a regression line on a time series, especially if it's about an intriguing topic. So I think your options are (from best to worst): Don't add a regression line at all. What is it intended to convey here, after all? We can see without it that salaries have been lower on average in the last couple of years. If anything, the regression line draws attention away from the possible return to previous salary levels in 2022. There's an interesting and possibly pandemic-related story to be told here, and the regression line hides that a bit. Use a different visual depiction that smoothes the line but is not a simple straight line. exponential-smoothing and moving-average s are both reasonable options that may incidentally highlight that increase in 2022. Add an explicit warning such as " The regression line is intended as a visual aid only and we do not advise using this to predict future salaries. Extrapolation of simple regression trends produces very poor results for most such time series ' Get more serious about modelling the time series and account for autocorrelation, nonlinear change and uncertainty appropriately. One would hope then that the confidence (or prediction) intervals would accurately reflect uncertainty, instead of being inappropriately narrow because of using a poor model.
