Structural complexity versus ontological complexity

From the article https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor : Another contentious aspect of the razor is that a theory can become more complex in terms of its structure (or syntax), while its ontology (or semantics) becomes simpler, or vice versa. Quine, in a discussion on definition, referred to these two different perspectives as "economy of practical expression" and "economy in grammar and vocabulary", respectively. Within statistics, are there some examples that can help understand where the above occurs or where this may be of importance? As a first example, which it would be good to have critiqued and improved, is Bayesian techniques. Adding uncertainty in the initial model and the running of simulations (if conjugate priors are not available) not only adds computational cost but adds checking in terms of whether the simulation had meaningful coverage. However, this extra syntactic complexity is often worth it with the easier interpretation and extensible semantic results that Bayesian statistics provides.
