Limit Google Maps V3 to 1 marker

I had code that was working for map V2 but have since upgraded to V3 and the constructors are different. I want to limit my map to 1 marker only. Here's the code to add a marker: myListener = google.maps.event.addListener(map, 'click', function(event) { placeMarker(event.latLng); }); .... function placeMarker(location) { var marker = new google.maps.Marker({ position: location, map: map, draggable: true }); map.setCenter(location); I need code that will remove myListener once a marker is placed. Thanks for any help you can provide.
