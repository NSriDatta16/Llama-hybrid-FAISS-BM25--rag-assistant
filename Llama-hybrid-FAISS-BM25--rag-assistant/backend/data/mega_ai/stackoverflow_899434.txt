I am guessing the designer creates you a tableAdapter when you drag the sp over. There is a Connection property on the adapter that you can set for the adapter to use to fill the datatable. I agree with the other guys that you will want that connection info in a configuration file or other place you store configuration. I am also not a fan of the drag and drop into the designer but this should work to manage the database connection.
