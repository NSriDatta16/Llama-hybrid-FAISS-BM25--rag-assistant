non-linear correlation or finding thresholds for changes with relatively few data points

I'm a novice at stats and thought I'd ask this question to those with much more experience than me. I've got temperature data and count data for number of animals hibernating in man-made boxes. The temperature data is very detailed (hourly) but there are relatively few counts (12 in total split between four sites) that fall within the recorded temperature range. Each of the four sites has 15 counts throughout the year but only 3 of them are within the winter period that we measured temperature for. The hypothesis we are working with is that the animals use the boxes more when temps are colder (i.e. generally within the winter months) but that at a certain temperature (to be determined) the boxes are not thermally stable enough and the animals move underground. This is currently only an observational trend. My question is in two parts: How can I go about looking for the lower threshold where the animals abandon the boxes and how can I tell whether this is a significant change. Currently what I've done is made some variables from the temperature data to provide the minimum temperature for the previous week and the average temp the previous week for each count date. I've also transformed the counts into proportions to attempt to control for the effect of the differing sites so the "count" element is now a proportion of the highest count recorded in that site. I thought about completing a blocked ANOVA where my block is site and then the groups being the counts split above and below a certain temperature. E.G. count when the temperature drops below 0oC and count when the temp was above 0oC and just putting it in a loop with possible values (maybe in increments of 0.5oC) but that doesn't seem very efficient and I'm wondering if I would lose information/oversimplify things. The other thing I considered was a non-linear correlation test that I saw on this post on stack overflow. I'm cautious of just choosing a test just because its what I found first if there might be a more robust option. I'm working in R if that makes a difference. The other option available (though I'd like to avoid if possible because I'm doing this as volunteering for a charity) is purchasing temp data online which would put all points (60 total) and mean that there were two winter seasons to compare. Please let me know if you have any suggestions or if you think one of the approaches I considered above would work.
