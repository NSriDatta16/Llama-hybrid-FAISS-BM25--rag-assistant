Collaborative Filtering: Match users to people with similar tastes â€“recommend what they like Commonly used in e-retail Avoids the issue of users only being recommended more of what they already like (allows serendipity) Example: Your Scenario. Methods: Euclidean Distance, Cosine Distance, Pearson Correlation Coefficient (most common). Content-Based Recommendation : Match users directly to products and content Recommend based on what you have bought or viewed in the past Commonly used for document recommendation: webpages, news articles, blogs etc. Examples: Which Movie(s) might our user like? Option1 : The user selects preferences for the various features using pull-down menus etc. We match against the movies using Vector-Space methods (described next) Methods: Vector-Space Method, K Nearest Neighbour(kNN) Option2 : The user rates a sample of the movies (explicitly or implicitly) as like/dislike. we then build a user profile model for that user using machine learning. Method: Decision Trees
