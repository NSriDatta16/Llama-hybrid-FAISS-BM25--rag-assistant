SQL Insert Query (syntax question)

I have an sql query which is working, it does insert the correct data, but the ID's are out of synch: Dim sql As String = ("INSERT INTO [CANRADcontacts]") & _ (" ([Title], [Initials], [FirstName], [LastName], [Organisation], [Department], [Address], [Code],") & _ (" [Telephone], [WorkTelephone], [Fax], [CellularTelephone],[Email], [ResearchFocus], [CollID], [ResearchFunders])") & _ (" VALUES (@Title, @Initials, @FirstName, @LastName, @Organisation, @Department, @Address, @Code, ") & _ ("@Telephone, @WorkTelephone, @Fax, @CellularTelephone, @Email, @ResearchFocus, @CollID, @ResearchFunders); ") & _ ("INSERT INTO [CANRADcollreg] ([CollID], [FlightDateArrive], [FlightNameArrive], [FlightTimeArrive], [FlightDateDepart], [FlightNameDepart], [FlightTimeDepart], [AttendingLaunch], [Accomodation], [DietaryRequirements], [SpecificDietaryRequirement]) ") & _ ("VALUES (@CollID, @FlightDateArrive, @FlightNameArrive, @FlightTimeArrive, @FlightDateDepart, @FlightNameDepart, @FlightTimeDepart, @AttendingLaunch, @Accomodation, @DietaryRequirements, @SpecificDietaryRequirement)") In the database I have two columns (ContactsID on CANRADcollreg and ID on CANRADcontacts) which I need to synch up and have the same ID inserted when a record is inserted. Please can you assist on how I would go about achieving this? Thanks and regards.
