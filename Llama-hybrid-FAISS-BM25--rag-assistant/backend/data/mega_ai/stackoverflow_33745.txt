WordPress MediaWiki integration

On the other end of the spectrum, I would be happy if I could install a wiki and share the login credentials between WordPress and the wiki. I hacked MediaWiki a while ago to share logins with another site (in ASP Classic ) via session cookies, and it was a pain to do and even worse to maintain. Ideally, I would like to find a plug-in or someone who knows a more elegant solution.
