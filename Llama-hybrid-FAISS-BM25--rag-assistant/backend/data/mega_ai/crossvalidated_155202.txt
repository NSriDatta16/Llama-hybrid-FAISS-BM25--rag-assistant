Observations censored within the interval under consideration are not at risk of death for the whole period. They don't count as a whole person-period of exposure, but only the fraction to which they were exposed. Under the uniformity assumption, on average they're exposed half a period. So on average each of the $c_j$ censored people will lose half a person-period of exposure. The text is a little awkwardly worded, but it's treating the $c_j$ people unexposed for on average half the period as equivalent to half of the $c_j$ people who were censored being unexposed to risk of death in the study (equivalently, not in the study) -- it's the same number of person-periods of exposure. In the diagram below, censored observations are marked with an " o " when censored and uncensored observations that died are marked with an " x at death". The uncensored ones count just as they would if there were no censoring at all, but the censored ones have reduced exposure: I've split the censored values off separately and then sorted them by exposure. If you took the censored values with shorter exposure times, you could (on average) use them to "fill up" the exposure time of the ones with longer exposure, leaving it as half the censored lives had full exposure and half had none. That is, you lose $c_j/2$ person-periods of exposure on average, but you could treat that as equivalent to simply losing half the censored people at the start of the period (and the other half being exposed for the entire period), reducing the count by $c_j/2$.
