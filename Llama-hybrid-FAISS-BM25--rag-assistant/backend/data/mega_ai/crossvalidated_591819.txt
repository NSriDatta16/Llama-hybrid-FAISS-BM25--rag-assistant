Answer from comments: Logistic regression is an option, but note that you would use only two of the dummy variables ( Urban , Peri-urban , Rural ). The values for Urban and Peri-urban perfectly predict the value for Rural . So you can't put all three of them in the model. This is sometimes called the "dummy variable trap". (Maybe see, SE link: stats.stackexchange.com/questions/590741/about-dummy-variable-trap ). You could also summarize the data into a table of counts (contingency table) with two dimensions: Bribe vs. Location , which would be a 2 x 3 table. You could then use a chi-square test of association or related test. Also note that your sample size is quite large. You will likely find a small p -value for a test of the coefficient from logistic regression or for a test of the contingency table. You will likely want to rely on some measure of effect size for interpretation. Maybe odds ratio. Or the proportion of Bribe Yes for each Location .
