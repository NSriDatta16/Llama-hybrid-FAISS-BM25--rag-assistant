MySQL truncation command - unicode characters

I am currently trying to adjust the values stored in a table in MySQL. The values stored contain a series of Unicode characters. I need to truncate to 40 bytes worth of storage, but when I try: UPDATE `MYTABLE` SET `MYCOLUMN` = LEFT(`MYCOLUMN`, 40); MySQL is overly helpful and retains 40 characters , rather than 40 bytes . Is there a way to get around this? Regards and with thanks, gaioshin
