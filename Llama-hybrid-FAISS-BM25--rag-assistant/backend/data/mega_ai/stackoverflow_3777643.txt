How can I get a compilation error on accidental construction?

Given 2 classes: ... class Grades{ public: Grades(int numExams) : _numExams(numExams){ _grdArr = new double[numExams]; } double GetAverage() const; ... private: // The only data members of the class int _numExams; double *_grdArr; }; class Student{ public: Student(Grades g) : _g(g){ } ... private: // The only data members of the class Grades _g; }; ... And, a short main program: int main(){ int n = 5; // number of students Grades g(3); // Initial grade for all students // ... Initialization of g â€“ assume that it's correct Student **s = new Student*[n]; // Assume allocation succeeded for (int it = 0 ; it This code works fine. But by typo mistake the line: Grades tempG = g; has changed to: Grades tempG = n; and still it passes the compilation. What simple change can i do in the code (the main() code) to get a compilation error by that typo mistake?
