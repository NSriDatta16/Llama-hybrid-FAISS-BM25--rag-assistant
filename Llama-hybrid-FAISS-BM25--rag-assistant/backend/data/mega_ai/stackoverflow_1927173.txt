Distributing/deploying JavaFX apps

I am just finishing up a little app in JavaFX and am starting to think about how to distribute it. I figured this would be a simple matter of hitting the build button and using one of the resulting files. For some reason build creates: Jar file which complains it can't find its main class when doubleclicked. A jnlp file which fails saying "unable to launch application". An html file which, when opened in my browser shows a spinning java logo forever. All of this leads me to believe that there is something wrong with my Java setup. How can I get this project packaged up and out the door? I would like to have a single file that can be downloaded/emailed, doubleclicked and run without a fuss. Short of that, whatever's easy. :) I am pretty sure you can do that with a Jar file but what I am getting with Netbeans and its build command is pretty ridiculous. Important details: I am running Ubuntu Karmic. I have switched over to Sun Java instead of OpenJDK (which seems to deal with JavaFX very badly) but I think firefox is still using OpenJDK.
