Vector autoregression, just like plain autoregression, applies to linear problems. Linearity is an assumption that barely applies to everyday scenarios, especially with disturbance sources, such as human sentiment, being nonlinear. Models that capture temporal nonlinearities, such as LSTM-RNNs, are much more useful in such problems. A business application of VAR that I can think of would be to forecast the sales of a product based on its past values.
