Acceptable/reasonable deviance explained for fitted GAM?

thanks to all for any help in advance. I have built a series of nested GAMs in mgcv to explain the presence/absence of antibodies in a population of animals and used AIC to select my best fitting model. Despite including all potentially biologically plausible explanatory variables I have access to, my best model based on AIC only explains 36.6% of the deviance in my data. My question is: what might one expect the value of deviance explained to be if my model fits my data well/reasonably well? Based on the little information provided, would you suggest this model fits my data well or not, why/why not? I have concerns about model fit (for example non-normality of residuals), but have no more predictors to include.... I understand that deviance explained is somewhat similar to R2 for a linear regression for example, see here . When using R2, different researchers use different rules of thumb in regards to the magnitude of the value that is generally indicative of a reasonable model fit - some researchers say R2>0.6 is good fit, others say R2>0.4 or even less is good fit, depending on the specific problem at hand. In logistic regression there is a similar value, McFadden R2, in general the magnitude of McFadden R2 that is indicative of a reasonable model fit is much lower than that of R2 for linear regression. What value/values may be indicative of a reasonable model fit for deviance explained? Are there any rules of thumb or references? This is my first time using GAMs so I have no previous experience to compare deviance explained values I have obtained on other data sets. Below I have provided summary of my gam and output from gam.check() for more background.
