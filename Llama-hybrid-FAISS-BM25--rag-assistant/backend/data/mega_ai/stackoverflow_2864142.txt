Why don't you just use the Windows version of git and call it using Process.Start() ? As for the storage, you could have the repository in a RAM disk (like Andrew suggested above), but I'm not sure how big the performance gain would be. I would think that having it on harddisk is perfectly fine, especially considering that if you use it often, it would be in cached in RAM anyway.
