I think I understand your problem. You are saying that the var i only has one element. This happens because the var i is newly instantiated every time you open a new tab. I'm guessing every tab is a new page or at least is a new context for var i . If you want to keep an instance of an object (like an array) in between different pages, take a look at jStorage , it allows you to keep data locally on the browser and it makes it easier to maintain context between page loads. If all tabs are on the same page then the solution is easier, you need to keep the array in a global variable for the page.
