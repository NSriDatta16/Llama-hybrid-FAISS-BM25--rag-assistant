Time Series Analysis: Univariate and Multivariate Methods by William Wei and David P. Reilly - is a very good book on time series and quite inexepnsive. There is am updated version but at a much higher price. It does not include R examples. It explicitely includes a great discussion/presentation of Intervention Detection procedures which are ignored in simplified solutions/introductory textbooks.
