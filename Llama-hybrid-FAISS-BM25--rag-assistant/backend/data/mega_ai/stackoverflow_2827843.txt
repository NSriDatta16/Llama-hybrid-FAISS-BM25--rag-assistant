Is this an app you have written? If so, from a maintenance standpoint this may turn into a nightmare. What happens when you alter the program and need to change the database? Unless you have a sweet migration tool to help you make changes to all your databases to the new schema you may find yourself in a world of hurt. I realize you may be too far into this project now, but if a little additional relation was added to the schema to differentiate between the domains (companies/users), you could run them all off one database with little additional overhead. If performance really becomes a problem ( Read this ) you can implement Clustering or another elegant solution, but at least you won't have 100+ databases to maintain.
