This paper reviews several methods for time series interpolation, and concludes that: na.interp from the forecast package and na.StructTS from the zoo package showed the best overall results. These functions are also very easy to use, just one line if your data is already stored as a time series. They're likely to outperform standard spline interpolation, as they can both detect and apply seasonal patterns.
