how to resize the size of a control automatically when the size of the form changes

I am drawing a rectangle on my form and on top of that I have a label that I dragged. Now I want to re-size the rectangle that contains label so that it changes automatically when the size of the form is changed(maximized and all). I tried using this.label1.Size = new Size(); but this causes my label or may be rectangle to disappeared from the form. I cannot see it in my form now. Anchor and Dock properties do not serve my purpose. I have to hard code it. Need help on how to solve this resizing problem.
