Why are cumulative residuals from regression on stock and index returns mean reverting

In the paper M. Avellaneda and J. H. Lee, Statistical arbitrage in the U.S. equities market , July 2008, in the Appendix on page 44, I have some questions. First he runs the regression of stock-return ($R_n^S$) with index/ETF-return ($R_n^I$). $R_n^S = \beta_0 + \beta R_n^I + \epsilon_n, ~~~~~n=1,2,...,60$ Then he defines an auxiliary process $X_n$ as sum of the residuals from regression of $R_n$, and estimates it to be a mean reverting process. $X_n = \sum_{j=1}^{n} \epsilon_j ~~~~~n=1,2,...,60$ I have two related questions? What is the significance of taking cumulative sum of residuals as opposed to taking just residuals as a mean reverting process? I have a basic intuition but lack a good understanding. Second, he says that the regression on stock-returns "forces" the residuals to have mean zero. Why is this? How does this imply that the sum of all residuals, $X_{60}=0$?
