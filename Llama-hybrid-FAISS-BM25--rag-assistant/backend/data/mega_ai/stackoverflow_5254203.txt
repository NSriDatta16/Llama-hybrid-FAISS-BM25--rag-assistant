This: aggregate(cbind(sex, wt, res, mt, ms, cr, rt) ~ dam, data=data, FUN=mean, na.rm=TRUE, na.action=na.pass) should do the trick for the averages. I assume you want to exclude the NAs from the means for the affected variables, but include the observation otherwise. The counts can be obtained with aggregate(pig ~ dam, data=data, FUN=length)
