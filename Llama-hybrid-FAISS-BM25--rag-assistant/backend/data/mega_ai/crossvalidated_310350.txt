Is decision tree regression comparable to locally weighted regression

I am new to decision tree method. For decision tree regression model, does it just fit a piece wise step function over data? When and why would people prefer it over some traditional regression like locally weighted (LOESS) regression? (Cross asked at Data Science stack exchange )
