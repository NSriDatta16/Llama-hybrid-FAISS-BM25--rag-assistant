What exactly do you call a "machine learning algorithm"? If you take a reasonably broad view of what MLA means, then there are many. Since you count linear regression as an MLA, you clearly take a broad view. You then have all sorts of variations on linear regression from generalized additive models to quantile regression to multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS). And what about factor analysis, cluster analysis, multi-dimensional scaling and so on and on? Of course, there are regression trees, just as there are classification trees, and each method has spawned offspring. But, if it somehow does turn out that you are right and there are more for classification, then I think one reason might be that people often wrongly turn continuous outcomes into categorical ones.
