Is it possible to simply compile an Emma instrumented APK using Android build.xml and not run any tests

I know of ant coverage However that does a few things, it compiles with emma instrumentation, installs, and runs the test apk. I don't want it to run the test suite through ant with coverage because I need to run it with some extra hooks, and I don't want to run the large test suite twice. So far I have tried this Target_Project/build.properties emma.enabled=true Test_Project/build.properties emma.enabled=true Then in in a shell I execute this. Target_Project$ ant debug Target_Project$ adb install bin/Target_Project-debug.apk Target_Project$ cd ../Test_Project/ Test_Project$ ant debug Test_Project$ adb install bin/Test_Project-debug.apk Test_Project$ adb shell am instrument -e coverage true -e coverageFile /sdcard/myFile.ec -w com.my_app.testproject/android.test.InstrumentationTestRunner The response is Error: Failed to generate emma coverage. Is emma jar on classpath? So is there a trick to getting the apk to build with the emma libs? I tried invoking the targets created in the sdk xml templates but they are "private." Is there something I am missing?
