Decision Tree for Time Series Anomaly Detection

I have learned recently to train decision trees in R with data. Now I have a problem in which the data is a time series and I would like to use the same approach to detect when the time series presents and anomalous pattern. Is it possible to train decision trees with times series data? I see that the main problem in is the labelling for informing the algorithm when the time series is anomalous.
