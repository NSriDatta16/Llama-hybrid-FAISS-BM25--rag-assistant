ListFragment Item Selected Background

So I have a ListFragment set up with a few selections that open new Fragments. Part of me is wanting to make each item in the ListFragment (I have around 6) have a different color set for when it is selected and I call my getListView().setItemChecked(index, true); Is it possible to set different backgrounds or do they all have to be the same? Thanks.
