"Basic" is a relative word, so I'm not sure what you mean by "I only know basic statistics." I'll assume that you don't know anything about modelling or regression and are simply able to create some additional statistics. Given that, you are fairly limited in what you could do. One thing you might do is form ratios such as #kills/# of deaths or #kills/$round played. This will give you a sense of the expected number kills for each life and the expected number of kills per round. If you wanted to do something predictive, you'd probably need to use more "advanced" statistics like logistic regression, which could give you the predicted probably that the player wins a round, given their historical statistics of number of matches played, number of kills, number of deaths, etc.
