K-class multinomial classification results for n cases (tries) is a nominal variable. Therefore it can be represented as a set of k binary dummy variables. Now, Jaccard similarity coefficient between two cases (row vectors) by a set of binary attributes is $\frac{a}{a+b+c}$; and accuracy score (I believe it is F1 score) is equal to Dice coefficient: $\frac{2a}{2a+b+c}$ (it will follow from the formula behind your link ). The terms come from the table: case Y 1 0 ------- 1 | a | b | case X ------- 0 | c | d | ------- a = number of variables on which both objects X and Y are 1 b = number of variables where object X is 1 and Y is 0 c = number of variables where object X is 0 and Y is 1 d = number of variables where both X and Y are 0 a+b+c+d = p, the number of variables. OK. Consider the example given in the documentation you link to: y_pred = [0, 2, 1, 3] y_true = [0, 1, 2, 3] where values are class labels; 4 classes in all These can be seen as 8 cases (trials) paired as 4 experiments (X cases) and 4 corresponding true outputs (Y cases). Stack all in one column and convert to dummy variables. In dummy variables, there is single 1 in each row: case data v_0 v_1 v_2 v_3 x1 0 1 0 0 0 x2 2 0 0 1 0 x3 1 0 1 0 0 x4 3 0 0 0 1 y1 0 1 0 0 0 y2 1 0 1 0 0 y3 2 0 0 1 0 y4 3 0 0 0 1 Compute the matrix of Jaccard coefficient between all 8 cases, pairwise, and likewise the matrix of Dice coefficient: Because we are interested in comparisons only between X and Y cases, we'll pay attention only to the yellow-highlighted portion of the matrices. We are going to sum or average coefficients within yellow area. Moreover, since data were paired we'll probably consider only the diagonal red values and average them. Your document said that their "Jaccard score" is the average of individual Jaccard indices. So here we are. You see that entries in two yellow squares are identical: Jaccard appears to be equal to Dice (for our situation with nominal data). And the average of the 4 diagonal values is (1+0+0+1) / 4 = 0.5 , the result given in your documentation. (As an example, showing computation of both coefficients of similarity between X1 and Y1 cases): v_0 v_1 v_2 v_3 x1 1 0 0 0 y1 1 0 0 0 Y1 1 0 ------- 1 | 1 | 0 | X1 ------- 0 | 0 | 3 | ------- Jaccard: 1/(1+0+0)=1; Dice: 2*1/(2*1+0+0)=1 Note that with a single set of dummy variables both coefficients can attain only values 0 or 1.
