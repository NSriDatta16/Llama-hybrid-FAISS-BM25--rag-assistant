C# Lists: How to copy elements from one list to another, but only certain properties

So I have a list of objects with a number of properties. Among these properties are name and id . Let's call this object ExtendedObject. I've also declared a new List of different objects that have only the properties name and id . Let's call this object BasicObject. What I'd like to do is convert or copy (for lack of better words) the List of ExtendedObject objects to a list of BasicObject objects. I know C# Lists have a lot of interesting methods that can be useful, so I wondered if there were an easy way to say something to the effect of: basicObjectList = extendedObjectList.SomeListMethod (some condition here); But I realize it may end up looking nothing like that. I also realize that I could just loop through the list of ExtendedObjects, create a new BasicObject from each ExtendedObject's name and id, and push it onto a list of BasicObjects. But I was hoping for something a little more elegant than that. Does anyone have any ideas? Thanks very much.
