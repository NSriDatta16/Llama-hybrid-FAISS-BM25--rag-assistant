Using non-parametric bootstrap to assess relative difference between means of two samples

Let's say we have 2 samples, A and B. I'd like to find out which distribution has a higher mean by using non-parametric bootstrap. My procedure goes like this: Calculate the mean of a resample 1 from sample A: $\bar{x}*$ Calculate the mean of a resample 1 from sample B: $\bar{y}*$ Calculate relative difference between $(\bar{x*}-\bar{y}*) / \bar{x*}$ . Repeat steps 1-3 1000 times to get a distribution of relative differences. Can interpret the results like that: If the 95% CI doesn't include 0, then the relative difference is significant (alpha=0.05)? To me, the procedure looks like we are interpreting non-parametric bootstrap as Bayesian model that has nothing to do with classical frequentist statistical significance since in that case we should bootstrap scenario in which null hypothesis holds (like here or here or permutation test) and then compare it to the actual relative difference.
