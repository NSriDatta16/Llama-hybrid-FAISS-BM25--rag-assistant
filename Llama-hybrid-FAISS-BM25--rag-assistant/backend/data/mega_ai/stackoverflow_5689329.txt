Many of the major content providers provide a oembed endpoints. Take a look at the oembed_links gem. From the readme: It allows you to easily parse text and query configured providers for embedding information on the links inside the text. A sample configuration file for configuring the library has been included (oembed_links_example.yml), though you may also configure the library programmatically (see rdocs). If you use oembed_links in conjuction with http://oohembed.com/ you'll have dozens of content providers handled for you. You can easily write a custom provider to handle the rest.
