Am I formatting my switch statements wrong?

I have been working on a "Rock Paper Scissors" game to see if I understand the basics of JavaScript. It all works well until I get to the if statement from lines 30 to 71 in the fight() : I have adjusted the reply variable to indicate how it may be "if'ing" through. It seems to be returning the default value of every sub "if" in the overall "if". Am I using the wrong variable for the secondary condition maybe? radioGroup.html // You have chosen "; response += selectedWeapon + " The CPU has chosen "; " \n"; response += cpuChoice[threeChoice] + " \n"; response += reply + " \n"; output.innerHTML = response; } // end function //]]> Choose!
