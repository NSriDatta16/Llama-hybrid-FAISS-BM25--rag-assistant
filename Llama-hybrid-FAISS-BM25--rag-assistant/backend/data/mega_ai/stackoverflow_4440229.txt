Yeah he wants to load just the page fragment. The first argument is indeed url, so just put the name of the page that 'company_form' resides in then add the fragment you want. So it should look something like this... $('#new-company-form').load('company_form.php #autoform'); I guess the only change is add the extension to 'company_form'
