There is no general answer to this question. Ethan's answer is correct in stating that more data is almost always desirable (up to the amount that your hardware can process quickly enough to meet your needs). Less data means that you will be limited to fewer predictors (p >= n is typically a problem), and "noisier" results (point predictions will be less accurate, prediction ranges will be wider, classification accuracy will often be lower, etc.). Machine learning can be done with a sample size of one-- the results will just probably not be worth very much. If that's all the data you have, that's all that you have. The question isn't so much can ML be done here? as will the output of a specific ML technique be good enough to use? Answering that question requires a look at your results and your needs more so than a rule of thumb about data quantity.
