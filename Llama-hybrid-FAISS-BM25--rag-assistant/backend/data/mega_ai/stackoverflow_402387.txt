Think it over, and find the commonalities of each data set... then define your model. It may require the use of subclasses or not. Foreign keys representing commonalities aren't to be avoided, but encouraged when they make sense. Stuffing random data into a SQL table is not smart, unless it's truly non-relational data. If that's the case, define your problem and we may be able to help.
