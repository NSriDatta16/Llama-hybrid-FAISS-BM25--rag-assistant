Session scoped Managed Bean passivation

I'm reading about JSF2 and Managed Beans. I've got a question related to passivation. I've recently asked for different use cases of @Stateful EJB's, @SessionScoped and @ManagedBean here: sessionscoped managed bean vs stateful ejb . Now, stateful EJB's are eligible for passivation and activation which allow them to be temporarily passivated to persistent storage to decrease memory use when they are idle, I haven't seen this feature available to managedbeans. So it got me thinking that maybe I should go for @RequestScoped Managed Beans and prefer @Stateful EJB's for shopping carts etc instead. Using @Sessionscoped Managed Beans only to store minimal user information. Is this correct? Are there some guidelines for this?
