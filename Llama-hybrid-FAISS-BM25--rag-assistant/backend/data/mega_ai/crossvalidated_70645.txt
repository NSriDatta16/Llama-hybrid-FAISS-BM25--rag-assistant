Is two-way ANOVA appropriate?

This is the description of my study. I'm experimenting with three plants: A, B, and C. These plants are supposed to reduce blood glucose for diabetic patients. I want to determine which of these three plants has a longer effect on blood glucose reduction after a single administration into mice. This is done by measuring the blood glucose from mice at 7 time points (day 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 14). So there are 4 groups (untreated, treated with A, treated with B, and treated with C). For each group 3 mice were used (n=3). My goals are: To determine if the effect of each plant treatment is significant compared to untreated. To compare the effect of the among the groups for each day. To determine which treated group has the longest effect after 14 days. My solution is to use two-way ANOVA since there are more than 2 groups and I want to compare the groups in each day and finally the overall effect. Is the this the correct method? Will I be able to rank which will be the best plant followed by the 2nd and the 3rd? Or should I use time series analysis?
