If you can, you should anchor your URL's so they become root relative : For instance, change: background-image: url(images/image.png); To this: background-image: url(/images/image.png); Secondly, even if your CSS was setup as a pure relative path, it is relative to the CSS file not the page (unless you are embedding the CSS in the page).
