An average can be viewed as an "equal allocation". If children were pooled and alloted equally among families, each family would get 1.5 children. There's nothing in the formula for an average that respects the "indivisibility" of items - as far as the mathematical formula is concerned, children can be subdivided just like pizzas or acreage. The knowledge that children are not, in fact, divisible can be used in the interpretation , rather than the calculation of the average. Finding that the equal allotment requires 1.5 children in each family means that it is impossible to equally allot whole children among families. The observation "but you can't have 1.5 children" gets at this notion - even though we can calculate the numerical average, we cannot in practice equally divide children among families, since we can't actually allot 1.5 children per family. The average is a mathematical exercise of what it would take to do it, not a claim that one could do it in practice.
