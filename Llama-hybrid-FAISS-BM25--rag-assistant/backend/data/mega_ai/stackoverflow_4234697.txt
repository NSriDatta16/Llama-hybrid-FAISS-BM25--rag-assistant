Get path to exe file on py2exe

I am writing a little gui application with Tkinter, which requires me to have a path to icon files. I am planning on embedding the file into the exe that I make with py2exe, and then retrieving it from there. The only problem is that I need to know where that file is. Does anyone know a way of getting the currently running exe file/path? Thanks for the help in advance!
