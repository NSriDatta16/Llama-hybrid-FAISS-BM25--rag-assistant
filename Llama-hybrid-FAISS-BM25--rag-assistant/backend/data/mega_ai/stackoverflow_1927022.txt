What do you mean by "Publishing subscriber Replication topology"? In one sense (the "traditional" sense), SQL Server doesn't support a pub / sub model for replication, where a single publisher multicasts data out to many subscribers. In another sense, all forms of replication are pub / sub, in that there is a central Publisher that provides data to one or more Subscribers, by way of a Distributor and Agents (but it's actually serial unicast).
