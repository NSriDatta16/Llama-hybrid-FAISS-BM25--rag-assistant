Significant autocorrelation in Bayesian regression model

By running the following Bayesian regression model using SAS 9.4: PROC GENMOD DATA = TRAININGSET; CLASS X; MODEL Y = X /DIST = POISSON LINK = LOG; BAYES NMC = 1000 SEED = 1234 COEFFPRIOR = NORMAL; RUN; I found the following warning in the LOG window: WARNING: There is still significant autocorrelation after 500 lags, and the size for the parameter XXXX might not be estimated accurately. What does this kind of error imply in a bayesian framework for the $\beta$ coefficient estimates and what do you suggest to solve/avoid this kind of problem? Thanks in advance for the help!
