MySQL issue in DataSet

I am using the latest version of MySQL connector to .NET and Visual Studio 2008. I dragged and dropped all tables from the MYSQL database to VS 2008 dataset GUI successfully. When I was going to add a new stored procedure to the dataset, Visual Studio environment just refused doing so. Is there any solutions around this? Thanks
