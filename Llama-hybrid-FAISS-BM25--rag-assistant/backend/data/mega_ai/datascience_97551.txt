Dropping columns or inputing numbers

After looking at the various different ways of inputting data to replace NaN in a dataset vs. dropping observations or columns based on a threshold, the right technique is still is very confusing. I know that this must be treated on a case by case basis so I will give a context: I have a dataset of ~15k observations and over 40 columns. Col1 to Col6 have high missing values because the data simply does not exist. For example Col1 could be the average number of days between 2 consecutive transaction. If a customer only purchased once then the average is NULL . What would be the appropriate technique to approach this? column_name Count Percent Col1 12000 80% Col2 11500 78% Col3 10200 65% Col4 10000 62% Col5 8000 40% Col6 7500 36% Col7 2000 7%
