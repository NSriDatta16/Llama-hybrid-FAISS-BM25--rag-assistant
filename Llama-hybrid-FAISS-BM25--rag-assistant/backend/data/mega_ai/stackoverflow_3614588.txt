Like others have stated, there's not a really clear-cut "right" way. Whatever works for you. For me, I generally use about one view per action. (I use more if that action handles a form or something). For example I might have: 'items/view/7' which has a view for a specific product 'category/view/3' which has a view for a category You'll find as you use codeigniter more, you'll find things that are more organized (and therefore more "maintainable" to you). And with some small applications, I've even reorganized everything later on (I mean literally, rearranged classes and functions and folders containing views) just to make it more logical. I don't see anything that's "wrong" with what you're doing. Though the way it sounds with the last part of your post, where you use the same view and just have variables that process what the view is going to do, I would probably avoid this (though it depends on other things too). I would probably just have a view for "recent sold products" that was independent of the "category" view. Having the view do very much logic isn't usually a good idea.
