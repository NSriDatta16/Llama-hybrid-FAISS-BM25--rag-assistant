Is the maximum BDeu Bayesian Network always the empty network?

I'm recently reading a paper about Scoring Mechanisms for Bayesian Networks . For the BDeu score, it appears that the maximum possible score of BDeu for Bayesian Network structure learning is zero. Does it mean that the best network is always the empty network?
