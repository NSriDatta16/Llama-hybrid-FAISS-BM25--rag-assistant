Have a look at the Path Markup Syntax to get a feel for the raw drawing primitives available to you in WPF. You could use either cubic or quadratic Bezier curves (each has a smoothed version too) depending on how you want to define the control points. As for rendering the control points on screen and allowing the user to drag them about you might like to look into adorners and possibly the Thumb class.
