input elements do not have an onload event. W3C Reference The onload event occurs when the user agent finishes loading a window or all frames within a FRAMESET. This attribute may be used with BODY and FRAMESET elements. You could use the body 's onload event, or another event in your input like onclick or onchange , depending on what you want to do.
