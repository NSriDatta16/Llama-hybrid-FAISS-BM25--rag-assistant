To start with, you probably need to give the label a css class that can be used for selection: This will probably output something like This is the error message. You can now select the label in jQuery using the class as selector, and add class A or B depending on whether the .text() property is empty or not. $(function() { $('.ThisIsWhatWeWillWorkWith').each(function() { if($(this).text() == '') { $(this).addClass('ClassA'); } else { $(this).addClass('ClassB'); } }); }); All code is provided as is, with no guarantees of working without modification. But you get the general idea of how to solve the problem... EDIT: In response to your comment, here's a way to do it without adding a css class to the label. Instead of using an tag for the error message, wrap a literal in a tag you hard-code on your page: Another, perhaps more elegant way, would be to create your own custom label, and use that instead. public class ErrorLabel : System.Web.UI.WebControls.Label { public ErrorLabel() { this.CssClass = "ThisIsWhatWeWillWorkWith"; } } You then put the error message on your page with the following line: Again, not sure if the above code will work as is. But again, you get the idea of what to do...
