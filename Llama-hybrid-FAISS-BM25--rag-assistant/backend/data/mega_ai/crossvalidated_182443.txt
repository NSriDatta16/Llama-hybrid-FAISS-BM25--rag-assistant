I agree with davidivad's answer. But also I think the application of deep neural networks to images is that images (and, more importantly, labeled images) are relatively inexpensive to collect. In other domains, it can be very expensive to collect data on a large scale, especially within the constraints of a typical industrial or government enterprise. Compounding this issue is that in many applications, the phenomenon of interest is relatively rare, so there will be precious few examples to learn from, so even a relatively large-scale data collection effort might yield a small number of members of some class.
