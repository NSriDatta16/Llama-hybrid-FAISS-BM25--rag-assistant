I've just written a bash/shell script that uses grep to get today's TV shows from a txt file. Here's the format of the txt file: Monday: Family Guy (2nd May) Tuesday: House The Big Bang Theory (3rd May) Wednesday: The Bill NCIS NCIS LA (27th April) Thursday: South Park Friday: FlashForward Saturday: Sunday: HIGNFY Underbelly Here is the shell script which was saved in ~/bin and made executable: #!/bin/bash MYDATE=$(date +%A) grep -A10000 $MYDATE /path/to/to_watch/list.txt | grep -B10000 -m1 ^$ And here is the line to add to your .conkyrc file (below 'TEXT') $color${execi 3600 tv_today} I think the regex/grep stuff needs some work (it doesn't like crlf line breaks) but it works. Hope this gives someone some ideas of cool stuff to do with Conky... Edit 2010-05-02: Thanks to user tiftik for this more elegant awk/regex replacement for the bash script: #!/bin/bash awk '/^'`date +%A`':$/,/^$/ {if ($0~/[^:]$/) print $0}' /path/to/to_watch/list.txt
