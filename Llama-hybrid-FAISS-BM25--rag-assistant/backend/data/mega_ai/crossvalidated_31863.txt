I addressed your confusion about PCA in your other question. The correct version of your statement is that PCA attempts to characterize most of the variation in the in a lower dimensional space. As I explain in the answer to the other post PCA is not used for discrimination. It has been used to do clustering after reducing dimension to a subset of the principal components. If by imbalance of the data you mean one cluster center has many more points arund it than another then that may affect the ability of any clustering method at identifying the smaller cluster but the magnitude of separation of the clusters is probably more important.
