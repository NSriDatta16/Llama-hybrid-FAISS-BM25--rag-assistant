Duplicating an element (and its style) with JavaScript

For a JavaScript library I'm implementing, I need to clone an element which has exactly the same applied style than the original one. Although I've gained a rather decent knowledge of JavaScript, as a programming language, while developing it, I'm still a DOM scripting newbie, so any advice about how this can be achieved would be extremely helpful (and it has to be done without using any other JavaScript library). Thank you very much in advance. Edit: cloneNode(true) does not clone the computed style of the element. Let's say you have the following HTML: This is the first paragraph. The cloned paragraph is below: And some style like: body > p { font-size: 1.4em; font-family: Georgia; padding: 2em; background: rgb(165, 177, 33); color: rgb(66, 52, 49); } If you just clone the element, using something like: var element = document.getElementById('origin'); var copy = element.cloneNode(true); var destination = document.getElementById('destination'); destination.appendChild(copy); Styles are not cloned.
