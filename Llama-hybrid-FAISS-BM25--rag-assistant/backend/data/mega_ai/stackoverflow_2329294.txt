Segmentation fault when using stream extraction into a char pointer

I have a question. I have the following struct : typedef struct{ int vin; char* make; char* model; int year; double fee; }car; Then I have the following method that asks the user for the make of a car and returns it as a char pointer: char* askMake(){ char* tempMake = NULL; cout > tempMake; return tempMake; } Then I have a temp car struct : car tempCar; And I am trying to assign a value to it this way: tempCar.make = askMake(); It compiles fine, but I get a segmentation fault at runtime.
