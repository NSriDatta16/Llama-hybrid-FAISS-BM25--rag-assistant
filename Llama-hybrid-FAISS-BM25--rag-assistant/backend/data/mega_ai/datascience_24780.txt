Reading a CSV in TensorFlow RNN

I am just starting off with TensorFlow and trying to implement an RNN for a dataset which consists of 11 Features (all numeric). These features will be used to predict the output of another column. I am currently lost on where to start and tho I am able to understand how a RNN functions all the tutorials I could find were mainly related to image and text datasets.
