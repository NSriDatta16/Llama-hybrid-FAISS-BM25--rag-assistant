Train a RNN with strings using positive and negative samples

I'm trying to recognize strings coming from a regular language, using positive and negative samples by Recurrent Neural Networks. In particular, I tried to use the rnnlib by Alex Graves, but I had some troubles in changing the architecture of the network to adapt the network to my needs. This is an example of my training set: str1: w1 w2 ... wn --> label 1 (it is a valid string for the language) str2: w1 w2 ... wi --> label 0 (it does not belong to the language) where wi are drawn from the alphabet of the unknown language. In other words, I'm trying to use RNN as a binary classifier. Can you suggest a good tutorial or reference for this task? Thanks in advance.
