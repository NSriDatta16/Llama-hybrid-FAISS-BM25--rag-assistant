What are block-based animation methods in iPhone OS 4.0?

I am trying to implement a game using the iPhone OS 4.0 (iOS4?) SDK. In the previous versions of the SDK, I've been using the [UIView beginAnimations:context:] and [UIView commitAnimations] to create some animations. However, when I look at the documentation of the functions in 4.0, I see this comment. Use of this method is discouraged in iPhone OS 4.0 and later. You should use the block-based animation methods instead. You can find it here: http://developer.apple.com/iphone/library/documentation/uikit/reference/UIView_Class/UIView/UIView.html#//apple_ref/occ/clm/UIView/commitAnimations My question is, what are block-based animations in iPhone OS 4.0? I though that the beginAnimations:context: and commitAnimations functions were used to create animation blocks..
