All I can say is that looks like a lot of loops within loops you've got going on. Probably the main issue is just your general algorithm. To test if a number is prime, it's sufficient to check whether it's evenly divisible by any number between 2 and its sqrt (rounded down). But if you're checking many primes, you ought to leverage the fact that as you check higher and higher numbers you can start with only primes (I would store these in a simple List ). For example, say you've reached the number 27. You only need to check whether it's divisible by 2, 3, or 5 (the prime numbers you've already found less than sqrt(25) which is 5), not 4 (since 4 is divisible by 2â€”if it's divisible by 4, then it's divisible by 2), and not anything above that (if it's evenly divisible by anything above 5, the quotient will be below 5, and you would have already checked it). Those are some general concepts that ought to help you optimize what looks upon first glance like a pretty inefficient algorithm.
