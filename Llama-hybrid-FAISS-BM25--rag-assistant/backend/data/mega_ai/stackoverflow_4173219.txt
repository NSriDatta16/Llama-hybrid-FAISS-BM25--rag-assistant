Fragmentation does not affect SD card as much as it affect a harddrive since SD card does not have spinning parts or moving heads, the difference between random access vs sequential access of an SD card is negligible. In other words, SD card does not need defragmenting; in fact defragmenting an SD card will only lower the life span of your SD card since the memory cells of an SD card have a limit on the number of read/write that you can do on them. And if you need to "scandisk" (or "fsck" in Unix/Linux-speak, stands for "File System ChecK"), I don't think the Android's default shell comes with fsck, but you should be able to fsck the SD card from your computer.
