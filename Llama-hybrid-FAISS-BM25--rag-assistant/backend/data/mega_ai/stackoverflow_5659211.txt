I have done it by just replacing the cocos2d files - dragging them into the project. But before doing this make a copy of your project with the previous version (if still possible) That did it for me. As far as I know cocos2d is just a set of imported files anyway. The templates etc did not change, so there was no need to uninstall or reinstall anything.
