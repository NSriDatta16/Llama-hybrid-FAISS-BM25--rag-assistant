How to find vertical clusters in 1-D data

I have residuals of a multivariate time series data obtained from sensors on a server.spikes in the plots of residuals indicate abnormal server state. I want to cluster the data into vertical clusters and get the indices of the points in each cluster so that I can go back and look at the actual data and get the mean values of various parameters of a cluster. I tried 1d Gaussian ,Kmeans etc but they all seem to cluster the data horizontally. I want each spike to be a separate cluster and get the indices of the values in the cluster. Can any one suggest a technique to overcome this issue. Thanks.
