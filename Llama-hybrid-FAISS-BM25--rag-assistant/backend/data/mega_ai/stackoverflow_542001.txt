These both only work for single-character search terms... countOccurences("the", "the answer is the answer"); int countOccurences(string needle, string haystack) { return (haystack.Length - haystack.Replace(needle,"").Length) / needle.Length; } may turn out to be better for longer needles... But there has to be a more elegant way. :)
