I would suggest learning about generalized linear mixed effects models (there is much more to be learned than can be covered in a forum like this, take a class or at least an online tutorial). For counts you can do a Poisson regression (or negative binomial) and the duration can use a normal or gamma regression model. The pairs then become the random effects and your pre/post (and any other covariates) are the fixed effects. Difference in time periods can be accounted for with offsets. Another option would be a Bayesian hierarchical model where the "fixed" effects parameters would each have a prior, but the paired/random parameters (probably start with per person intercepts, but could explore more complicated models) would come from a distribution with a hyper prior. Again you would need at least a course (or a few) to do this properly.
