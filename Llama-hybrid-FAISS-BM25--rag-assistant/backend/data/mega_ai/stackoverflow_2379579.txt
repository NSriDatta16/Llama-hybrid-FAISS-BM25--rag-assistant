How much Javascript do you have? In my experience, on sites with lots of Javascript code on the pages, performance problems generally come from code that actually does things. Generally, problems stem from trying to do too many things, or trying to do some particular thing really badly. An example would be trying to do stuff like bind handlers to elements in table rows (big tables) instead of using something like "live". My point is that things like how your modules or functions or whatever get organized is almost certainly not going to pose any sort of real performance issue on your pages. What is motivating you to go to all this trouble?
