You need to consider what the actual output from MCMC is: a very large set of samples $\{ \theta_1, \theta_2, \dots, \theta_N\}$ that you hope are representative of the posterior distribution, $\pi(\theta)$ , say, of the parameter $\theta $ . MCMC proceeds by starting from some $\theta_0$ moving on to $\theta_1$ and so on until equilibrium is reached. Various indicative tests for convergence exist but proof that it has occurred is not available. It is assumed that after convergence each $\theta_i$ is a draw from the posterior distribution. You are then in a position to examine the empirical distribution of the MCMC output and summarise it using all the usual tools. You do not need to calculate the evidence to do that.
