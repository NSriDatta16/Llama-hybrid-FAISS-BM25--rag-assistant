If the likelihood is not Gaussian it's not possible to say if there are analytic results. Also, the second bullet is then incorrect in general. Since Gaussian prior and general likelihood does not make for conditional gaussian distributions on the vector components. One way to get the MAP would be to do a full Bayesian analysis, e.g. using MCMC and use the samples from the posterior to estimate it. [In which case you'd have better information available than only using the MAP.] Out of interest- why not go down this route anyhow? Another approach could be to do (I've not seen this done generally so someone please correct me if it's nuts): $ p(\theta|x) = \frac{p(x|\theta)p(\theta)}{p(x)}$ $ l(\theta|x) = l(x|\theta) + l(\theta) - l(x) $ $ \frac{dl(\theta|x)}{d\theta} = \frac{dl(x|\theta)}{d\theta} + \frac{dl(\theta)}{d\theta} = 0$ Then solve for $\theta$ (probably numerically).
