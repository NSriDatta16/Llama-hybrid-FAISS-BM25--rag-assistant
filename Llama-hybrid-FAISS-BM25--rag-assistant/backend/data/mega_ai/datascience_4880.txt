Generate tags for live chat transcripts

I'm wondering if there's a way to automatically generate a list of tags for live chat transcripts without domain knowledge. I've tried applying NLP chunking to the chat transcripts and keep only the noun phrases as tag candidates. However, this approach would generate too many useless noun phrases. I could use some rules to prune out some of them, but it would be hard to generalize the rules.
