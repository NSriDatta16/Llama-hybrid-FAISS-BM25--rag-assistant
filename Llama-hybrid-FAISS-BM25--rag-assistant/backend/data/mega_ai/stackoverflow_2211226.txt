Snap-To lines when aligning controls at Runtime

I have an app where users can drag controls around on a Form. But they re asking me for Snap-To lines to make the alignment of controls easier. I have no idea about the snep-to lines and how to implement them - I have looked at: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms752100.aspx Adorner's, but it says it's only for WPF. And I tried it in WinForms but (as expected) didn't work. How can I get snap-to lines (something like the ones in VS) in my app? Thank you Bael
