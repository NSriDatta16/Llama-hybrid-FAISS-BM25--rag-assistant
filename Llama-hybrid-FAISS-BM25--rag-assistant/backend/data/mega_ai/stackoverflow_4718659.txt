Customer session is different in different parts of a Magento website

I have a function inside of a Helper in Magento that returns whether or not a customer attribute equals one. Here is my Helper class class Nie_Nie_Helper_Data extends Mage_Core_Helper_Abstract { public function isNieAdmin() { if(Mage::getSingleton('customer/session')->getCustomer()->getNieAdmin() == 1) { return true; } else { return false; } } } Now when I call this function from a class that extends Mage_Core_Block_Template, everything seems to work fine. However when I try to use this inside one of my controllers, it does not work. In fact when I do Mage::getSingleton('customer/session')->getCustomer()->debug() the only variable that is returned is the website_id. Does anyone know what I have to do in order to get this to work?
