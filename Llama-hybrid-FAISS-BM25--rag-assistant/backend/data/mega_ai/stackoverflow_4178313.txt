Since this depends on a number of factors (how many different IDs you want to convert, how intelligently the compiler can compile the case when statemens), my advice would be: Measure it : Write a small test routine and convert, say, 10.000.000 ids to strings. Do this a couple of times with either implementation and compare the results. If you have no significant difference, take whatever you like more (I think, the hash solution is a bit more elegant...)
