Detecting features in XY Plots using CNNs

I have a simple classification problem - if two features plotted on a simple XY plot show a "kink" or characteristic turn, then the label is TRUE, otherwise FALSE. I've been attempting to detect the "kinks" in these plots using fully-connected NN's without much success. I thought about converting my XY plots into images, and then feeding them into a CNN, but that seems to be fairly inefficient. Does anyone have any advice for this situation? A kink is circled below. Thanks
