I don't think it's going to happen. You won't get the MAC anyway unless it is a very simple network. If this is an internal thing, perhaps you could deploy something that changes to the User Agent string. You could probably just make an Active-X or something and just have the users run it once. The User Agent could be modified to take the Mac address of the first NIC or something like that. Just an idea.
