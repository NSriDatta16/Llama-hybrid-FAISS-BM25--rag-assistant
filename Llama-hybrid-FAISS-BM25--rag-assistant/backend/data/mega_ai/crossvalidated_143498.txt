For your Thought #1: Your dependent variable is obviously a binary variable reaction/noreaction of each trial as you mentioned or the pair of (number of reactions, number of trials) if you had batched trials. For Thought #2: Let assume you don't have any limitation regarding to the number of experiments to run or the times you can use the lab. To decide if to run experiments batched or unbatched: Batched runs would be a good option if you only had categorical variables in this research. So you could choose a combination of factor levels and do a batch experiment each time (i.e 20 run). But Here you have continuous variables as well, and this make your design a little more complicated. Nevertheless if setting the variables' levels in your experimental environment is time consuming it is easier to set the explanatory variables in their levels (and choose random levels for continuous variables) and do a number of samples independently at a time (i.e 20 runs here - Batched drops as you say) In any of the forms of running the experiment(batched or unbatched) there would be no problem with the analysis of data, I think. As you use R you can define a custom model and For Batched trials > Use a binomial distribution for your dependent variable. in this way there would be no problem if you have different number of trials in each batch. you can use Maximum Likelihood estimation for estimating the effects and MLE's asymptotic distribution to test the hypothesis. For UnBatched trials > Use a general linear model as you said(a logistic regression,probit regression, etc). Finally consider that there would be some two-way interactions(or higher order of interactions) between the effect of your explanatory variables. If so, you may need a large number of runs to discover these effects. It's hard to say how many runs you will need for this, But if the first assumption is true, You can run your trials in a multi-phase approach. I mean you can start your experiment with a number of runs and do a preliminary analysis on your data. if you saw any sign on some potential significant interactions, then you can go back to the lab and continue the experiment with concentrating on the potential main effects and interactions (This will not recommend unless you can have the same environment with fix conditions in both phases of experiment).
