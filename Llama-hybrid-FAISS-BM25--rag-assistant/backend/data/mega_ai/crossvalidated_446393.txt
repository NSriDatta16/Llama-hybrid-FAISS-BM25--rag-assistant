If your N is actually 4, there isn't much you can do. But if the data shown are just a sample, then here are some ideas: You could just look at the average of the trials vs. the true measure. You can improve your looking ability by using graphs. Certainly a scatter plot. Perhaps a quantile quantile plot and maybe a Tukey mean difference plot (aka Bland Altman plot) and a plot of the differences between the two numbers. If you want a formal test, you can look into tests of equivalence; more particularly TOST (two one sided t test) may be useful. You would have to specify a difference that you regard as too small to matter.
