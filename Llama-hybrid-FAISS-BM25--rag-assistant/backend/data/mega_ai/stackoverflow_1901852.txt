Getting this type of interaction between the mouse and various elements shouldn't be approached with CSS alone. You will need to use Javascript. The following example uses the jQuery Framework (simply addon for raw javascript) to change the source of an image when you hover over a paragraph: $("p.magicParagraph").hover( function() { $("img.magicImage").attr("src", "image2.jpg"); }, function() { $("img.magicImage").attr("src", "image1.jpg"); } ); This code binds a set of events to the hovering of any paragraph having the className "magicParagraph". The first function is what will be done when you move over the paragraph, and the second is what will be done when you move off of the paragraph. This would function with the following markup: Hover over me to change the image!
