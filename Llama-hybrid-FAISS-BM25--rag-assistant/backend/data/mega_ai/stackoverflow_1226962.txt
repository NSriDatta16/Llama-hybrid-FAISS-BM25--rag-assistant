Maybe this code solve your problem, it is not as elegant as it could be but it seems to work. You should know ho arrangeGames works ;) Maybe you need to pay attention on arrangePlayerforDays . It put the various games in a day only if both of the players don't have a game already scheduled on that day. The other function are just for make the code more readable (and cover a pair of glitches in arrangePlayerforDays ) function gamePrettyPrint($gamesOnADay, $glue) { $result=array(); foreach ($gamesOnADay as $currentGame) $result[]=join($glue,$currentGame); return $result; } function arrangeGamesOnAday($day) { $result=array(); for ($k=0, $limit=count($day); $k
