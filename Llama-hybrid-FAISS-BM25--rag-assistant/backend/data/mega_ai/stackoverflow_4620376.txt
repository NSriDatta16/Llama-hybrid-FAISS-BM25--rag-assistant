Setting the AVAudioSession category in AppDelegate.m

So I hate to have to ask this question but I've spent a fair bit of time searching through Apple's documentation and Google with no avail. I'm simply trying to set the AVAudioSession category for my app ONCE, when the applicationDidFinishLaunching. I have an app that plays an audio stream and I would like it to continue playing when the app enters the background, so I'm trying to use the Playback category. Here is my code for AppDelegate.m : - (void)applicationDidFinishLaunching:(UIApplication *)application { // Set AudioSession NSError *sessionError = nil; [[AVAudioSession sharedInstance] setCategory:AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayback error:&sessionError]; [[AVAudioSession sharedInstance] setActive:YES error:&sessionError]; [[AVAudioSession sharedInstance] setDelegate:self]; // create window and set up navigation controller [window addSubview:myNavController.view]; [window makeKeyAndVisible]; } # pragma mark - # pragma mark AVAudioSession Delegate Methods - (void)beginInterruption { } - (void)endInterruption { } - (void)endInterruptionWithFlags:(NSUInteger)flags { } - (void)inputIsAvailableChanged:(BOOL)isInputAvailable { } With this code, the audio fades out anytime I hit the home button, putting the app in the background. Any help is much appreciated, I hope that it is a quick fix type of answer for anybody who has done this before.
