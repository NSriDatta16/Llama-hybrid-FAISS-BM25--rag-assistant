When using Jupyter (R kernel) and the keras library. When a cell is run there is no output. W/no output, there's no way knowing code functions.?

The keras digit object detection code does actually run in Jupyter using the R kernel. But it took three attempts to recognize that there wasn't an issue with Jupyter, or the R kernel, or the code. The problem was mistakenly thinking there was "an issue" because Jupyter was not outputting the Epoch results. I closed the Notebook twice and went back to scratch because it seemed all too likely that I'd made some mistake or another. Then I found that missing Epoch output being displayed in the PowerShell terminal - the same terminal I'd used to start the Jupyter Notebooks. Turns out there was nothing actually wrong with the IDL. And the predictions output does get displayed in Jupyter after some waiting. So this question is: How to display the output into the Jupyter output cells when using keras in Jupyter? library("keras") mnist = dataset_mnist() mnist $train$ x $train$ x/255 mnist $test$ x $test$ x/255 model % layer_flatten(input_shape = c(28, 28)) %>% layer_dense(units = 128, activation = "relu") %>% layer_dropout(0.2) %>% layer_dense(10, activation = "softmax") model %>% compile( loss = "sparse_categorical_crossentropy", optimizer = "adam", metrics = "accuracy" ) model %>% fit( x = mnist $train$ x, y = mnist $train$ y, epochs = 5, validation_split = 0.3, verbose = 2 ) predictions $test$ x) head(predictions, 2) model %>% evaluate(mnist $test$ x, mnist $test$ y, verbose = 0) And the output from the PowerShell terminal; c:\program files\python39\lib\site-packages\notebook\services\kernels\kernelmanager.py:176> cb=[IOLoop.add_future. .
