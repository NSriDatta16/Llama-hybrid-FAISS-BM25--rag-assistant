long time no see! Yes, DataFlex is still alive and well and being used by lots of people and organisations. The current version is the "Visual" form (i.e. Widows GUI): Visual DataFlex (VDF) 14.1, although v15.0 is just about to release (I've been using alphas, betas and RCs for development for a few months now). The character mode product (now v3.2) is still around as well, for DOS, Unix and Linux. VDF now has good support for Web Applications, web services (since about v10), an Ajax library (which will come "in the box" with 15.0), CodeJock controls for nicer UI design, a development environment (VDF Studio) that has for some time (since v12.0) been so complete that I rarely step outside it any more (I even code my JavaScript in it, when doing that for VDF projects). It also comes with a free CMS called Electos (now itself in v4.0 with VDF 15.0). It has connectivity kits in the box for Pervasive, MS SQL Server, DB2 and ODBC databases, with Oracle, MySQL and other drivers provided by Mertech Data Systems (Riaz Merchant's company: www.mertechdata.com). You can download a free "Personal" edition (for non-commercial use) from here - it is a fully-featured product, but if you make money from it you are required to buy a kosher licence. Give it a whirl! ;-) Good to hear from you again! Mike (Still fighting with the b4stard descendants of your thrice-damned DataSets!!! ;-) )
