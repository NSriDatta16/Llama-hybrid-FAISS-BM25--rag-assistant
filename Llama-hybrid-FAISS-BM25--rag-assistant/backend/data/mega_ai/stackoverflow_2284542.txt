So... I'm going to assume that you are leveraging Excel because it is an easy way to define, build, and test the math required. Your spreadsheet has a set of input data elements, a bunch of math, and then there are some output elements. Have you considered using Excel Services? In this scenario you would avoid running a batch process to generate your output elements. Instead, you can call Excel services directly in SharePoint and run through your calculations. More information : available online. You can also surface information in SharePoint directly from the spreadsheet. For example, if you have a graph in the spreadsheet, you can link to that graph and expose it. When the data changes, so does the graph. There are also some High Performance Computing (HPC) Excel options coming out from Microsoft in the near future. If your spreadsheet is really, really big then the Excel Services route might not work. There is some information available online (search for HPC excel - I can't post the link).
