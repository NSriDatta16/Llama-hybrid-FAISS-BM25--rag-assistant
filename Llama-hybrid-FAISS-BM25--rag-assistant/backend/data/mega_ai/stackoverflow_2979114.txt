Yes you can, alert() is just a JavaScript method, you can override its functionality by doing. window.alert = function alert(msg) { console.log('Hidden Alert ' + msg); }; Just remember to run that content script at document_start within the manifest via run_at manifest content script modifier. I believe there is an extension that just does that. The developer names it Nice Alert. https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/ehnbelnegmgdnjaghgomaakjcmpcakhk
