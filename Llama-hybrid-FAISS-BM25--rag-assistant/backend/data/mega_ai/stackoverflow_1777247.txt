Two factors are working against you - You can only collect point-in-time statistics (page views), and there's no reasonable way to detect what happened between those points; Even then, you'd be counting browser window time, not user time; users can easily have multiple tabs open on multiple browser instances simultaneously. I suspect your best approximation is attributing some average amount of attention time per click and then multiplying. But then you might just as well measure clicks.
