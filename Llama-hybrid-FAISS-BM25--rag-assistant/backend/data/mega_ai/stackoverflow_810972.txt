Have a look at the Java 7 proposals , and in particular the Project coin work (the language changes). The latter incorporates such things as better collection initialisation, type inference for generics etc. Of course it's important to consider the platform Java as well as the language Java. More progress is being made with languages like Scala / Groovy / Clojure and (of course) these can leverage off the available Java libraries.
