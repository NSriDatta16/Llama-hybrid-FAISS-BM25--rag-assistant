I'm completely ignorant of these data, but assuming the data are ordered (not in time, but by position?) it makes sense to make use of time series methods. There are lots of methods for identifying temporal clusters in data. Generally they are used to find high values but can be used for low values grouped together. I'm thinking here of scan statistics, cumulative sum statistics (and others) used to detect disease outbreaks in count data. Examples of these methods are in the surveillance package and the DCluster package.
