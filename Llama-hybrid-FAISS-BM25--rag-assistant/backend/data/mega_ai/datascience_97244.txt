The data you describe is perfectly appropriate for the tasks you mention. It's important to formalize each task in order to use the correct design, for example: predict things like which person is more likely to be involved in an incident based upon the training that they have or have not taken This is a typical supervised learning problem where the target variable is the number of incidents. If the target variable is boolean then it's more standard to treat it as a binary classification problem, but if it's a numerical value it would be a regression problem. In both cases, there are many methods that can be used: linear regression, SVM... I would recommend a decision tree because it provides a model which is easily interpretable. Note that in this case, you should split your data at least between the training set and test set in order to evaluate the performance of the model. which trainings are most effective based upon the number of incidents This question is a bit different, I don't know if this is intended: the difference is whether the goal is to predict a target variable (this involves training a model, see above) or to analyze/describe the data. The latter option involves simply calculating statistics on the whole dataset. For example in this case you could calculate the conditional probability of "had an incident given had taken training X" for every training X (this can also be done for various combinations of training). is there a way to perhaps assign a probability to each person based upon the training they took (or not taken) and the total number of incidents they were involved or not involved in? First part: finding a probability for a person based only on the training they took can be obtained with a predictive model (first option above). Most classification and regression methods calculate a probability for the result (mind that this probability is itself a prediction in this case). Second part: same problem but using an additional variable about the incidents the person has been involved in. This would be a significantly different problem because it involves the "incidents" variable used both as an input feature and as the target variable. This is doable but it requires thinking about including time in the design because it implies that at a particular time $t$ some people have already been involved in an incident and the question is whether they are going to be involved again .
