I know of no elegant way to do this with phpDoc. The phpDoc comment/api formatting is based on a the Javadoc format. Javadoc doesn't have a feature set to support this because in java, if you want a method to have a variable number of arguments you re-declare the method prototype for each variation. public double foo() { } public double foo(double my_param) { } So, my performance preference is to do something like /** * My General description * * Here explain what each argument combination can do * @param mixed $arg1 can be array, string, hex as string, or int * @param int $arg2 if arg1 is int, then this is etc, otherwise optional * @param int $arg3 if ar1 is int, then this is etc, otherwise optional */ but this may not play nice with the various auto-documentation tools. The according to Hoyle way to accomplish this can be found at the phpDoc site .
