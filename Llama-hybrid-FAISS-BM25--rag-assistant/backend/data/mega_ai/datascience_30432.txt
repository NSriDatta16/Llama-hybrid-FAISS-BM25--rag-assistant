What if my validation set is worse than my training?

I am running a CNN, on the 1st epoch my training set accuracy is 15% and validation set is 12%, by the 51st epoch my training accuracy is 87% and validation set is 13%. What is happening? What does it mean if my validation set is lower or greater than my training set ?? (my test set gives 12%)
