I don't have an answer to your question. But I also read the thread you mentioned and I'm trying to implement it. I'm surprised you have this code in the stopCapture function: // Add cleanup code when dispatch queue end dispatch_queue_t queue = dispatch_queue_create("capture_screen", NULL); dispatch_set_context(queue, self); dispatch_set_finalizer_f(queue, capture_cleanup); [dataOutput setSampleBufferDelegate: self queue: queue]; dispatch_release(queue); I thought that code was required as part of the session initialization. Does this work for you? Does your capture_cleanup function get called? mine isn't getting called and I'm trying to figure out why.
