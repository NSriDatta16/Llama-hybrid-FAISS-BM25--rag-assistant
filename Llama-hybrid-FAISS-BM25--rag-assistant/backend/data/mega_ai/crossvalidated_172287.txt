C 4.5 is a tree based method, they don't need normalization of the predictors. Actually, tree based methods are insensitive to any monotonic transform of the features. SVMs on the other hand rely on similarity between elements of the train set. If the variables are not scaled, similarity may be driven by one single variable, just because it is expressed on another scale. So your conclusions about normalization are correct. As for feature extraction, do you mean feature selection ? SVMs are known to perform better in high dimensions than most of other ML methods (like C 4.5). Therefore, they usually don't need much of feature selection.
