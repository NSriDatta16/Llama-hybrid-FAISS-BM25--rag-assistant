Login to a site and then POST to a page in it

I have to login to a page using three parameters, after that I have to POST two parameters to another page inside the site I've just logged in. So far I've got a cookie with this: curl -c cookie.txt -d "username=username&pwd=pwd&domain=mydomain" http://myurl ...inside of the cookie I have a JSESSION id. I use the cookie as follows: curl -b cookie.txt -d "par=value" http://myurlnumbertwo Problems: even after a POST to the login url I get in the console the HTML code of the login page, does this mean that the login did not succeed? How can I find the error that caused this, maybe a log? after a successful login how do I remain in the login session and POST my parameters to the other page? EDIT: I finally got this working after stran's hint, follows the code. POST_DATA contains the exact encoded string that was posted, as in 'parameter1=value1&parameter2=value2' ACTION_URL contains the full URL to which the form is posted, as in https://stackoverflow.com/users/login First I did a wget --save-cookie cookie.txt --post-data 'POST_DATA' ACTION_URL to make the login and save the cookie, followed by a: wget --load-cookie cookie.txt --post-data 'POST_DATA' ACTION_URL to make the POST I needed, thank you again for the hint ^^
