I don't think this question has a really good/canonical answer. Because of the low level of replication within cities, you don't have a lot of information to distinguish within- and between-city variation. You could: fit a multi-level model and hope for the best, i.e. that you don't run into numeric problems or singular fits pretend that the within-city variability is very large and treat every store as independent (this is what you suggest in your last sentence, i.e. running an ordinary regression model) pretend that the within-city variability is zero and average the observations within each city (you'd also have to average their covariates) pick some reasonable intermediate value for the relative degree of within- vs between-city variation and fit a multilevel regression with some parameters fixed pick a reasonable distribution of the within/between-city variance decomposition and use a Bayesian approach to average over the distribution If this is a very important question, you should consider (a) running more than one of these analyses and see how big a difference it makes; (b) simulate data with characteristics that resemble your real data and see how the different methods perform. (The danger of (a) is that it encourages cherry-picking, i.e. you might be tempted to choose the method that gives you the result you like the best.)
