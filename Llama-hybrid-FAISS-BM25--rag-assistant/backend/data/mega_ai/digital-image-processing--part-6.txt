 (1+4+6+28+30+2+3+2+2)) = 9 Gray Level Histogram method Generally, given a gray level histogram from an image as below. Changing the histogram to uniform distribution from an image is usually what we called histogram equalization. In discrete time, the area of gray level histogram is ∑ i = 0 k H ( p i ) {\displaystyle \sum _{i=0}^{k}H(p_{i})} (see figure 1) while the area of uniform distribution is ∑ i = 0 k G ( q i ) {\displaystyle \sum _{i=0}^{k}G(q_{i})} (see figure 2). It is clear that the area will not change, so ∑ i = 0 k H ( p i ) = ∑ i = 0 k G ( q i ) {\displaystyle \sum _{i=0}^{k}H(p_{i})=\sum _{i=0}^{k}G(q_{i})} . From the uniform distribution, the probability of q i {\displaystyle q_{i}} is N 2 q k − q 0 {\displaystyle {\tfrac {N^{2}}{q_{k}-q_{0}}}} while the 0 < i < k {\displaystyle 0<i<k} In continuous time, the equation is ∫ q 0 q N 2 q k − q 0 d s = ∫ p 0 p H ( s ) d s {\displaystyle \displaystyle \int _{q_{0}}^{q}{\tfrac {N^{2}}{q_{k}-q_{0}}}ds=\displaystyle \int _{p_{0}}^{p}H(s)ds} . Moreover, based on the definition of a function, the Gray level histogram method is like finding a function f {\displaystyle f} that satisfies f(p)=q. Challenges Noise and distortions: Imperfections in images due to poor lighting, limited sensors, and file compression can result in unclear images that impact accurate image conversion. Variability in image quality: Variations in image quality and resolution, including blurry images and incomplete details, can hinder uniform processing across a database. Object detection and Recognition: Identifying and recognising objects within images, especially in complex scenarios with multiple objects and occlusions, poses a significant challenge. Data annotation and labelling: Labelling diverse and multiple images for machine recognition is crucial for further processing accuracy, as incorrect identification can lead to unrealistic results. Computational resource intensity: Accessing adequate computational resources for image processing can be challenging and costly, hindering progress without sufficient resources.
