Activation function selection for autoencoders

I am running an autoencoder model and have to select my activation function. I have structured data (i.e. not an image) which comprises continuous variables which have a range of -4 to +4 for each continuous variable. Which activation function should I use for this? As background, I am using autoencoders as a dimension reduction tool to be create new predictor variables to be used for supervised classification.
