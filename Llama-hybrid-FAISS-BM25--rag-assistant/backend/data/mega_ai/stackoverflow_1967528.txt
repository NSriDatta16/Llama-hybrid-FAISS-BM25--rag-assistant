Extracting unique caller information in java

What I want to do is implement some basic security by checking not only what class has called a particular method, but also, which instance of that class. I tried StackTraceElement[] stackTraceElements = Thread.currentThread().getStackTrace(); but that obviously only gives me the class name. The problem with allowing/requiring the callers to send self, or personal IDs is that all the callers are required to have access to the details of all the others. Can anyone help? EDIT: More information: So we have a server which makes connections with several agents. The agents send packets of information which include the name they CLAIM to have. There is a special agent which decides whether or not people should be able to lie about this in each particular case. The agents make connections to instances of an Agent class on the server, but there is also a possibility that some agents will run natively. The reason I'm interested in this approach is that I will need that technique later (extract the specific instance that called a given method) I hope this is better, and sorry for not putting enough info before :/
