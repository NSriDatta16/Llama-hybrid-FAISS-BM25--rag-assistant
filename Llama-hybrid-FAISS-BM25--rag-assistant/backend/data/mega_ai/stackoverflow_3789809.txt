Maybe i've misunderstood you but if you are trying to use a std::set which has a std::vector for data storage (so all data of the set is actually stored int the vector), then the answer should be "no". The reason for this is simply that the c++ std::set implementation is a binary search tree and a std::vector manages just a simple array/memory block.
