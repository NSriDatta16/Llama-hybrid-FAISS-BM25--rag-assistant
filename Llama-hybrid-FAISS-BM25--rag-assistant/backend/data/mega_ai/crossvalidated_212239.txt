You have misunderstood logistic regression. Logistic regression is a probability estimator. Cutoffs and improper accuracy scores should play no role in logistic regression analysis and will result in arbitrariness and loss of power/precision. When you say 'multiple logistic models' you are implying that you don't know how to specify 'the' model or that you are doing problematic variable selection. Please elaborate on why you need to compare multiple models. Note that such comparisons should be based on gold standard methods such as likelihood-based measures.
