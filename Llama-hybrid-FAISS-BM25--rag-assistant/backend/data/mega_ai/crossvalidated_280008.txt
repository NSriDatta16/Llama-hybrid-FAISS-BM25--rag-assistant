If you assume the proportion to be the exact same in all trials, you can just consider this as $y:=y_1+y_2+\ldots$ successes out of $n:=n_1+n_2+\dots$ attempts with an estimate of $\hat{\pi}=y/n$. A CI for the proportion can then just be obtained e.g. using logistic regression or Clopper-Pearson or any number of simple asymptotic approximations for a single proportion. Or do you aim to account for and/or describe how to proportion varies across trials? One could e.g. do that using a logistic regression with a random trial effect, particularly if there is a reasonable number of trials.
