Correct me if i'm wrong but SSRS does not use Forms Authentication. For viewing reports from a web app using the built-in components will use what ever authentication is used for the application. However for subscription and using the Report Builder application (click-once) which requires access to the Report Manager its windows authentication. [Edit] From Robert MacLean - MSSQL 2008 does support Forms Authentication, which is a good thing.
