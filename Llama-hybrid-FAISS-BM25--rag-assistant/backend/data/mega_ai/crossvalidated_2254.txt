Usage on CV R -based questions are frequently migrated between Cross Validated (CV) and Stack Overflow (SO). CV fields questions with statistical content or of statistical interest and SO fields questions of programming and implementation. Your question belongs on CV when any of the following apply: You're not sure what the right procedure is to use on your data. You would like help interpreting and understanding the output of an R procedure. You would like help with producing a certain type of data visualization (or selecting the most appropriate one). Your question belongs on SO the following applies: Your question belongs on SO when any of the following applyapplies: You already know exactly what analysis or visualization or data processing you want to do, but only need advice about how to get it done in R. You want to know how to get your data into a format suitable for R. You need to know the R syntax for a particular model. [This is marginal, because often such questions are covering up deeper modeling issues. If you are unsure of the model, not just the syntax, post your question on CV!] r is the only applicable tag, i.e. when your question has no statistical content. . R R is an open source programming language and software environment for statistical computing and graphics. R is an implementation of the S programming language combined with lexical scoping semantics inspired by Scheme . R was created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman and is now developed by the R Development Core Team . The R environment is easily extended through a packaging system on CRAN . As of June 2020, formatting R code has been simplified. For small snippets within text, use backticks, as in `x ``` lang-R for (i in 1:3) { hist(rnorm(10*i)) } ``` Official CRAN Documentation Additional free resources include: PDF HTML An Introduction to R , a basic introduction for beginners.
