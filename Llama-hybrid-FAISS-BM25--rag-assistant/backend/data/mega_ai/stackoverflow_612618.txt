How do I best process my multi-dimensional arrays in PHP?

I have an app that shows store sales. It is a multi-dimensional array, so each value in the root array is an array containing [sales] , [cost] , [date] , etc. for the given day it pertains to. OK, there are 2 arrays for each store. One is for verified numbers and the next is for unverified numbers. The unverified picks up right after the verified, so the first date in unverified will be one day after the verified. OK, all this is fine so far. But when I show the total sales for all stores, I need to combine all the verified and all the unverified numbers to get the total. Here's the tricky part. The verified array should only go up to the date of the lowest verified store and all the rest should be unverified. For example: On a given date, if all the stores have verified numbers but one is unverified for that date, then they all need to be unverified for that date. So it's like it needs to create a verified total, and an unverified total, check each array and if they are all verified add to the verified array, else if any are unverified add to unverified array. I hope this makes since, I am trying my best to explain the situation. I do have an algorithm that is working but it's so complex I have to study it forever every time I work on it, and I was hoping there was a more elegant solution. Thanks!!! Here is what the array structure looks like $verified ( [0](sales => 355, cost=> 233, date=> 2008-03-01) [0](sales => 235, cost=> 133, date=> 2008-03-02) [0](sales => 435, cost=> 143, date=> 2008-03-02) ) $unverified ( [0](sales => 232, cost=> 133, date=> 2008-03-03) [0](sales => 335, cost=> 233, date=> 2008-03-04) [0](sales => 535, cost=> 243, date=> 2008-03-05) ) This is dummy data, but in reality there will be more entries. There are these 2 arrays for each store. The date won't show up for both arrays; a date will only be in unverified or verified. But when you have several sets of these arrays for each store and need to combine them, different store's unverified numbers will begin at different dates. storeA may be verified up to the 15th and storeB may be verified up to the 7th. So I need to build a new $verified and a new $unverified from all the ones for each store. But I can't simply combine all the verifieds, because they span across different date ranges. So if all the dates are verified then they stay verified in the new master array, but if any are unverified they need to go to the new master unverified array. If this doesn't make since I am sorry.
