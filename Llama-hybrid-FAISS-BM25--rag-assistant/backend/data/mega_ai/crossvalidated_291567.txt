Deriving the total score probability in basketball

I was reading a paper earlier today (Gabel and Redner 2012) and got stuck following their derivation of the following equation. Their logic goes like this: Let the number of possessions per second = $\lambda$ Let the number of seconds in a game (2880) = $T$ Therefore, the average number of possessions (per game) = $\lambda T$ Therefore, P(number of plays in a game = $k$) = $\frac{{e^{ - \lambda T } (\lambda T) ^k }}{{k!}}$ ( = $Poisson(\lambda T))$ We can also say that the total score ($S$) = $\bar{s} k$, where $\bar{s}$ is the average points per possession. Therefore, $k = \frac{S}{\bar{s}}$ This is the part at which I am stuck. We should be able to find P(total score = $S$) by substituting in the above equation: $$ P(score = S) = P(plays = \frac{S}{\bar{s}}) $$ $$ P(score = S) = \frac{{e^{ - \lambda T } (\lambda T) ^ {( \frac{S}{\bar{s}} ) }}}{{( \frac{S}{\bar{s}} )!}} $$ However, the authors of the paper get something slightly different: $$ P(score = S) = \frac{1}{\bar{s}} \frac{{e^{ - \lambda T } (\lambda T) ^ {( \frac{S}{\bar{s}} ) }}}{{( \frac{S}{\bar{s}} )!}} $$ Where does this $\frac{1}{\bar{s}}$ come from?
