What is the difference between posterior and posterior predictive distribution?

I understand what a Posterior is, but I'm not sure what the latter means? How are the 2 different? Kevin P Murphy indicated in his textbook, Machine Learning: a Probabilistic Perspective , that it is "an internal belief state". What does that really mean? I was under the impression that a Prior represents your internal belief or bias, where am I going wrong?
