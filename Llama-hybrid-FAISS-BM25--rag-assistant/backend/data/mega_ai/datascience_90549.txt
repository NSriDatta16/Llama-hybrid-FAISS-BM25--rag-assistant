Looking for CART/ML model that works with relative data

I am a beginner at AI and ML. I have been given a dataset, where I have noticed the columns are relative to one another. So is there any CART or ML model that can work with relative data ? For example in Decision Tree, the tree looks like : if X[0] 24: if X[2] I'm looking for a Decision Tree, that works like this : if X[0]>X[1]: if X[1] Is there any such Machine Learning Model ?
