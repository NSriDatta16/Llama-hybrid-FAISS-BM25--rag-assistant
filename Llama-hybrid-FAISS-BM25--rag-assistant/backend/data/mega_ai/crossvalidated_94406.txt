Building a time series model using more than independent variables

I am working on a project, and I am totally new to statistics. I have sales data for last two years at week level, along with other variables like temperature, holiday (TRUE/FALSE), where holiday are nominal variables. I have to do forecasting for the next 52 weeks. I have the following questions: Can I use time series regression model where sales would be dependent, and temperature and holiday would be independent variables? How to decide which independent variable would have more impact on the sales? Can we do forecasting using nominal variables? Will dummy coding work? Can we do it in R/SPSS? I would appreciate any kind of help. Thanks in advance.
