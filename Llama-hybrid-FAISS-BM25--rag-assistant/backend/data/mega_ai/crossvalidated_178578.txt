Relation between Quintiles and the Arithmetic Mean

I have a set of final exam grades for an entire year of students, and I need to calculate quintiles from them. How should I go about it? Also, is the range from the arithmetic average and the top of the set smaller than the range from the third quintile to the fifth quintile?
