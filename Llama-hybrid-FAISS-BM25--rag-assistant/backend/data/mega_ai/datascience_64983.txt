@Leevo. Many thanks for this. I've sorted out the issue: I can see that it is resolved by LSTMs which have inbuilt ReLu non linearities in each cell. However, my question was relating to vanilla RNN architectures. What I've found is that it's a well known issue with RNN autoencoders and that a general/partial solution is to use eith ELU or sigmoid functions. After playing around with these I've found that LSTMs generally do a better job with less tinkering so I've sided with that approach for the time being. Thanks again.
