Sometimes the requirement is that an element is a certain color. It is possible to test this with tools such as Jasmine, but since you want to validate the final display is right, a browser-based integration test is the right tool. (To get this to work in Jasmine, you'd have to do quite a bit more work and end up with a less valid test... anyway...) I wrote a simple jQuery plugin called Color Spy to be able to query an element about its colors. You can ask: $(...).backgroundColor() $(...).colorColor() The plugin traipses up the DOM calculating the color. To get this to work within the context of a selenium test, you will need to: make sure the plugin is available. You can just include this in your page, or there are various ways to pull this in dynamically. write an element_color(selector) test helper function. This will need to use the whole get_eval shenanigans to execute some Javascript dynamically. Use assert_equal as normal. (I also have some Javascript function in my jsutils repo to assert "visual closeness" of colors-- but that's a different question.) Hope this helps.
