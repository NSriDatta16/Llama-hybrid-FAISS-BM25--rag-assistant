I don't know if kdump will work. Last time I tried kexec in VMware it would bomb and lock up the VM. I guess there is a possibility kdump and/or kexec could work with the right settings but I didn't play with it much. I'm not sure what you're trying to do but VMware does provide the ability to connect gdb to a Linux guest from the host machine. Or at least it did, it has been a long time since I tried it but it worked when I was debugging a kernel module. I just looked in the VMware knowledge base and couldn't find any new information. This is the old post I got my information from. Also the VMware forum for this type of debugging. I haven't really been paying to attention to what the current status is.
