Unless you have a billion icons, you're not likely to have any problems with storage or performance. Really it comes down to the organisational approach you find easiest. Sometimes a shared repository is convenient, but it can be a hassle if the resources for a control are stored in an unrelated location. In general I'd just drop the icons into your resources and then set the Icon/Image property on your controls to point at them - this is just a much easier way of managing the resources. But if you find your approach easier (having tried out the alternatives), then go for it.
