Bootstrap is essentially a simulation of repeating experiment; let's say you have a box with balls an want to obtain an average size of a ball -- so you draw some of them, measure and take a mean. Now you want to repeat it to get the distribution, for instance to get a standard deviation -- but you found out that someone stole the box. What can be done now is to use what you have -- this one series of measurements. The idea is to put the balls to the new box and simulate the original experiment by drawing the same number of balls with replacement -- both to have same sample size and some variability. Now this can be replicated many times to get a series of means which can be finally used to approximate the mean distribution.
