loop through list of dictionaries

i have a list of dictionaries. there are several points inside the list, some are multiple. When there is a multiple entry i want to calculate the average of the x and the y of this point. My problem is, that i don't know how to loop through the list of dictionaries to compare the ids of the points! when i use something like that: for i in list: for j in list: if i['id'] == j['id']: point = getPoint(i['geom']) .... sorry, the formating is a little bit tricky... the second loop is inside the first one... i think it compares the first entry of the list, so it's the same... so i have to start in the second loop with the second entry, but i can't do that with i-1 because i is the hole dictionary... Someone an idea? thanks in advance! for j in range(1, len(NEWPoint)): if i['gid']==j['gid']: allsamePoints.append(j) for k in allsamePoints: for l in range(1, len(allsamePoints)): if k['gid']==l['gid']: Point1 = k['geom'] Point2=l['geom'] X=(Point1.x()+Point2.x())/2 Y=(Point1.y()+Point2.y())/2 AVPoint = QgsPoint(X, Y) NEWReturnList.append({'gid': j['gid'], 'geom': AVPoint}) del l for m in NEWReturnList: for n in range(1, len(NEWReturnList)): if m['gid']==n['gid']: Point1 = m['geom'] Point2=n['geom'] X=(Point1.x()+Point2.x())/2 Y=(Point1.y()+Point2.y())/2 AVPoint = QgsPoint(X, Y) NEWReturnList.append({'gid': j['gid'], 'geom': AVPoint}) del n else: pass ok, i think... at the moment thats more confusing :)...
