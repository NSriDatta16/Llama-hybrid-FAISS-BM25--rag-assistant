How would you design a form with many dynamic fields?

We have a form that allows a user to dynamically add inputs for fields. For example if you have a form for tracking projects, you want to dynamically add tasks to that project. Just to clarify my language: you dynamically add inputs for the task field. The problem is, we have 50 of those fields. Our current solution presents all 50 fields with a plus (+) next to the field to allow them to add another input box for that field. The labels for the field are to the left of the field and each input box that is added goes below the current input box. Please trust that dynamically adding inputs is the right solution, please trust that it has been thought out, please trust that this is what the users wants, please trust that we have gone down various other roads and this is the best solution. My question is about presentation: How would you do it? Please keep the answers to UI design. We already have the database schema figured out. Update Current Solution is a web based application that uses JavaScript to dynamically add new inputs and looks very similar to Corey Trager's drawing: Task [.............] + [.............] + [.............] + [.............] + Foo [.............] + [.............] + [.............] + Repeat 50 times...
