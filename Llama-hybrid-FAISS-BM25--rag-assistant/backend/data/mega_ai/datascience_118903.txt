Yes, it is perfectly possible, neural networks can have multiple output, you need to have a dataset fot this but you can do it yourserlf, using a pretrained model wouldn't require a big dataset. Here you have a post doing this: https://towardsdatascience.com/building-a-multi-output-convolutional-neural-network-with-keras-ed24c7bc1178 Another post but with regression outputs: https://machinelearningmastery.com/deep-learning-models-for-multi-output-regression/
