Error when using two different user agents

I have 2 sip clients on the same computer. Both of them is registering to a server that is running on port 5060. For the first client the UDP is on port 5060 and for the other is 5061. When I come from one client to another, after the ringing part i receive the error: only one usage of each socket address is normally permited. Got any ideas why I got this error?
