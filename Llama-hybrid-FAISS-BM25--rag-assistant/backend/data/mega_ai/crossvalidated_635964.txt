Another option is to do Bayesian analysis and estimate the posterior probability of the compound / complex hypothesis: Test if guava's had the greatest effect, raspberries had a second greatest effect, pears had the third greatest effect, and strawberries had the least effect. This hypothesis can be formulated as: $$ \begin{aligned} \operatorname{P}\left\{\theta_g > \theta_s > \theta_r > \theta_p | \text{data}\right\} \end{aligned} $$ where the parameters $\theta_{\text{fruit}}$ are the effects of having guavas, strawberries, raspberries or pears for breakfast, respectively. The question mentions no covariates or assumptions about the distribution of the outcome, so I assume that the model is $Y \sim \operatorname{Normal}(\theta_{\text{fruit}}, \sigma)$ . Note that the effects $\theta$ s are not defined as the coefficients $\beta$ s in a specific model parameterization. Instead for each diet $\theta_{\text{fruit}} = \operatorname{E}(Y | \text{breakfast = fruit})$ . We can fit the model by sampling from the model posterior given the data, calculate $\theta_{\text{fruit}}^{(s)}$ for each posterior sample $s=1,\ldots,S$ and finally estimate the posterior probability of the hypothesis of interest: $$ \begin{aligned} \frac{1}{S}\sum_s\operatorname{I}\left\{\theta_g^{(s)} > \theta_s^{(s)} > \theta_r^{(s)} > \theta_p^{(s)} \right\} \end{aligned} $$ where the identity function $I$ indicates whether the sampled effects satisfy the hypothesized ordering.
