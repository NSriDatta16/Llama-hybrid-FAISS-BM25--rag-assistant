I would probably create a timesheet object for each week, or pay period. Each timesheet object might have a collection of days, with hours worked or times clocked in and out. For persistent storage for a web site, I'd use a database like mysql. For an application running on a single machine I'd maybe use pickle, or a flat file system maybe.
