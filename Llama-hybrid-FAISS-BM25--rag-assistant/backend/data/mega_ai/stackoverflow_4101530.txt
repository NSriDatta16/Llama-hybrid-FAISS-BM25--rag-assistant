I have never tried this, but I'm pretty certain you need to talk to the iframe's $ object instead of your document's one to access that object's internal data storage. Not 100% sure how to do that - maybe something like $('#frame').contents().jQuery.find("#data").data("test") (wild guess) What would work for sure is a function inside the iframe document that fetches the data, and returns it to you. But that's much less elegant than fetching it directly, of course.
