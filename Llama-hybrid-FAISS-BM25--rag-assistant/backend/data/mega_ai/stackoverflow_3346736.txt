jQuery/JavaScript: Avoid unique ID's for each row in a table?

I'm not sure if I'm doing this the right way. I have table which I fill with rows that each represent a song in a playlist. Right now, I assign a unique ID per row, and also assign som jQuery.data() to each ID. html += '\ \ ' + song.song_track + ' ' + song_mix + ' \ ' + song.song_artist + ' \ \ ' + delete_holder + ' \ \ '; So as you can see, each row has an ID like track-1, track-2 etc. Is there another way to populate a playlist like this without assigning unique ID's to each track, or is this how it's supposed to be done? Each track has some properties like this: $("#track-" + i).data("song_id", song.song_id); $("#track-" + i).data("song_artist", song.song_artist); $("#track-" + i).data("song_track", song.song_track); $("#track-" + i).data("song_mix", song.song_mix); $("#track-" + i).data("ps_id", song.ps_id); ... and also .click events for each track, which allows the user to play, sort, drag etc... It just feels like I'm doing it wrong :)?
