Confidence interval for Brier score in R

I am using the lrm function in the rms package in R to fit a logistic regression model. The function outputs various useful stats, including Brier score. Is it possible to output the confidence interval for these statistics, especially the Brier score? If not then what are the other ways of doing this? EDIT: The calculation of the confidence interval is somehow related to the Spiegelhalterâ€™s z-statistic . I am not sure how. The brier function in STATA does output this statistic.
