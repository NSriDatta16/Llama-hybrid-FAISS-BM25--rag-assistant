I'm sure that some more elegant solution is possible, but this bash script just loops through the input and filters out the value between the first = and the following , and the value between the fourth = and the following " : while read line do value2=`echo "$line" | cut -d = -f 2 | cut -d , -f 1` value5=`echo "$line" | cut -d = -f 5 | cut -d \" -f 1` echo $value2 - $value5 # do something with $value2 and $value5 done You call the script like this: bash myscript.sh
