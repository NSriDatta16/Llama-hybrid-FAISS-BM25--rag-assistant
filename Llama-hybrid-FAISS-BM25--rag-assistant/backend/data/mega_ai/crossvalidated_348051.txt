This answer is very late, but for those who are still looking for an appropriate measure of forecastability for product demand time series, I highly suggest looking at approximate entropy . The presence of repetitive patterns of fluctuation in a time series renders it more predictable than a time series in which such patterns are absent. ApEn reflects the likelihood that similar patterns of observations will not be followed by additional similar observations.[7] A time series containing many repetitive patterns has a relatively small ApEn; a less predictable process has a higher ApEn. Product demand tend to have a very strong seasonal component, making the coefficient of variation (CV) inappropriate. ApEn(m, r) is able to correctly handle this. In my case, since my data tends to have a strong weekly seasonality, I set parameters m=7 and r=0.2*std as recommended here .
