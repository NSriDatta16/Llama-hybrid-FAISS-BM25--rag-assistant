Its a great technique, but you have to be real carefull as how you do it so it works correctly in every browser. It can be done and is a good optimizing tip, but as always, pay attention as how it works in IE, Firefox and Chrome while you are doing it. The cons are that it can't be used always, and you have to stick to the least common denominator for cross browser css support.
