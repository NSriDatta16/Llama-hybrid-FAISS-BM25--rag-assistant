[response] ~ (1|Block) + (1|Block:Subject) + (1|Date) + Vegetation + (1|Vegetation:Date) You don't have sufficient levels of Vegetation to treat it as random, and you have also stated that it is fixed, so even philosophically, you shouldn't include it as a random effect. You also don't have sufficient levels of Block to treat it as a random effect either. A better model would be: [response] ~ Vegetation*Date + Block + (1|Subject) This will estimate fixed effects for Vegetation , Date and their interaction, while controlling for the repeated measures within Subject by estimating random intercepts. Since you have 10 dates and 3 vegetations, this will result in quite a lot of interaction terms (18), if you code Date as a factor. If Date is numeric (for example the number of days since the experiment began), this will enable you to model the (linear) change in the response as a function of time. You could then also allow the effect of time to vary for each Subject with a random slope: (Date|Subject) . You could also add a quadratic term for to cater for non-linear change.
