Jscrollpane problem

There's probably a much better way to do this, but I'm a bit new to javascript/jquery. I'm trying to set up a webform inside a scrollpane using jscrollpane. The form contains several textareas, which are acting as rich text editors using tinymce. Having tried a whole bunch of things to make the whole thing work in chrome, firefox and IE, I'm getting close by initialising the scrollpane like this: jQuery(document).ready(function() { jQuery('.flexcroll').jScrollPane( { verticalDragMinHeight: 100, verticalDragMaxHeight: 100, autoReinitialise: true, autoReinitialiseDelay: 3000 }); }); I've used the autoReinitialise because what was happening was that the scrollpane was being applied before the RTE controls were being applied to the textareas. When the controls were applied, the bottom of the form was being pushed off the bottom of the pane. The autoReinitialise fixes this in IE and Chrome, but there is a visible 'jump' every time it reinitialises in Firefox. I either need to be able to figure out how to reinitialise in Firefox without seeing this jump, or I need to keep the jscrollpane function from applying until after the controls have been added to the RTE textareas. Thanks in advance.
