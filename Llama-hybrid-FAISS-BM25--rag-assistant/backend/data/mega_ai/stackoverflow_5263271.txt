How can I test whether a single character is lower case in PHP?

I want to implement a small routine that generates the plural form of the name of an entity in Spanish. Basically, it takes a WordInCSharpCase or a wordInJavaCase, such as MedioDePago (payment method), and it appends an "s" at right before the first non-lowercase character (excluding the first character), which in this case would produce the string MediosDePago (payment methods). In C#, this routine was: public string Pluralize(string input) { int i = 0; while (++i Now I need to implement this routine in PHP, but I cannot find an equivalent of C#'s char.IsLower . The only thing I have found is ctype_lower , but it takes a string as an input, and creating/testing/discarding several strings would be too inefficient. Does PHP have a function that tests whether a single character is in lower case?
