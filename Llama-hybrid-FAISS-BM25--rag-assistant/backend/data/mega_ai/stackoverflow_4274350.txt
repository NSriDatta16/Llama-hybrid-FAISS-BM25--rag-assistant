Magento website/store/storeview organization

I have two (example) domains: euro-shoes.com us-shoes.com I need them to be connected to the same Magento installation. They share most design elements and they share the catalog. They each have three translations: English, French, and German. I tried setting the two stores up as Stores, and the translations as Store Views (three per Store). But the problem is, when I go to "System > Configuration", I can't change the scope to the Store. I can just change it to a Website or a Store View. This means that any changes I want to make to one domain or the other need to be made three times: once for English, once for French, and once for German. I realized at this point that I might be going against the design of Magento. Considering my situation, should I make euro-shoes.com and us-shoes.com Websites instead of Stores? If no, what would be my best organization?
