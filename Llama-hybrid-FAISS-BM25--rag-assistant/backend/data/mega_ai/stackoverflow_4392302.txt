As others have pointed out, returning a "NULL" record rather than an empty resultset when no records match your query is somewhat unusual, and I don't know of a terribly-elegant way to support it. One option is to UNION your recordset as below: SELECT q1, q2, q3 FROM tresults WHERE date = 'NOV2010' AND brand = 'XYZ' UNION SELECT NULL AS q1, NULL AS q2, NULL AS q3 This ensures you will always get a resultset, but it also means the "NULL" record will be appended to your resultset even when the first query does return records... That said, as per @ceejayoz's answer, this would be better handled in your application logic. Would you mind elaborating on why you require this result?
