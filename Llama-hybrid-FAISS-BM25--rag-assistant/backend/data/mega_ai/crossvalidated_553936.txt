To follow up on what @Tim said, Let me give some specific examples. Optimizing for marginal revenue of investment : cut at the first edge that accounts for X% of revenue increase. X is decided by the amount required to increase head count in our department in next quarter, cause HR has asked for support evidence. We will make a case to hire new people to support customers in this first bin with the expected revenue it will bring. Optimizing for CTR : CTR is usually so skewedly distributed that a small percentile accounts for most data points. So a summary of the large group can inform decision on most of the customers. Here we are trading off complexity of the summary and the analysis coverage of the customers. If you wanna cover more customers in your summary, your conclusion and recommendation is harder to communicate to the business sector. Why 95% but not 98%? Cause the extra 3% looks different enough to complicate the conclusion without adding much to the recommendations.
