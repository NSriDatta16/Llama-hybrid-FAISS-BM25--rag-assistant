How do i know if a thread is suspended under Windows CE

Can I get a threads suspend count under Windows CE, using C or Visual C++, without calling resume or suspend functions? The only way I can see of doing it is something like int Count = SuspendThread(ThreadHandle); ResumeThread(ThreadHandle); This has a couple of problems, firstly, I'd rather not suspend the thread, and secondly the suspend might fail if the thread is running kernel code. I can work around this, but I feel there should be a more elegant solution. I could also reverse it using int Count = ResumeThread(ThreadHandle); SuspendThread(ThreadHandle); But this has similar problems. Any good alternative method of getting the suspend count from the handle?
