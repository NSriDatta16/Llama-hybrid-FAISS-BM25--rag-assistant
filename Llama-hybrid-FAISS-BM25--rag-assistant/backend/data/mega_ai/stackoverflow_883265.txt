PHP makes a surprisingly good shell scripting tool. It has a wealth of simple functions built in. File IO String manipulation Array manipulation While you can do the same thing in JSP and C# you will spend a lot more time vs. any scripting langauge. The biggest advantage PHP has over other scripting languages is PHP.net Documentation . Out of any language I have ever used this single resource defines what good documentation and organization of a langauge reference should be.
