A rarely mentioned but solid book is C++ Common Knowledge by Stephen C. Dewhurst. "Among the first users of C++ at Bell Labs", Dewhurst gives the book a somewhat deceptive title because he actually covers quite a bit of advanced material in particular in regards to templates. Dewhurst's book is organized similarly to Meyers's with 63 "Items" that you can usefully read on their own. On templates you should look over items 45-59 (about 70 pages of reading).
