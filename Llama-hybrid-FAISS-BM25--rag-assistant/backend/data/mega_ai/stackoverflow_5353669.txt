Using this kind of pseudocode does not help. Use real code that will compile. Setting instance variables does not in any way change the size of the object. All instances of classA have storage for the address of one object. All instances of classB have storage for the address of one object. It does not matter what that object is, it can be an array of 1 million strings, it doesn't affect the size of your instance of classA or classB.
