contentEditable works (tested in Firefox and Chrome) on elements which are foreign to html/xhtml if I use this doctype: and a .html file extension (instead of .xml). I don't have to include any html elements at all (eg head, body, div, p). css isn't applied though (if my xml is in a namespace, which i guess makes sense, given the doctype!). Not an elegant solution.
