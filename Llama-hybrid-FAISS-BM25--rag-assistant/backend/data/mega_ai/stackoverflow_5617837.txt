How can I display the cart contents in every tab of the Magento checkout process?

The client wants the checkout process to look like discrete pages for each step (login/register, billing, shipping, etc.), so I've modified the template to look like that and everything works fine. However, now they want to display the cart contents with every step. I presume I would be able to use the shopping cart sidebar module, but I can't get it to display properly. Partially I suspect this is because I don't understand some of the module/block configuration that Magento uses. I've tried reading up on it, but like everything Magento, it's remarkably unclear. So, how would I insert the cart contents into the template at custom/template/checkout/onepage/billing.phtml? I'm sure there are multiple ways to do this, and I'm just looking for the simplest.
