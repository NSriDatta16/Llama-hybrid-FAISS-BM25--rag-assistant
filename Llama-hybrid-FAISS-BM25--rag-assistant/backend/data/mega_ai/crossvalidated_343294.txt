This depends on what a plausible data-generating process for your time series is: If it could be stationary around a piecewise constant mean, then y ~ 1 should be used for the testing and dating "in levels". However, if the time series is integrated and you are looking for changes "in the growth rates or returns", then r or r should be used with r ~ 1 in testing and dating. I assume you are talking about the data you showed in in: Time series structural analysis with R's strucchange package: Interpreting breakpoint dating with respect to breakpoint testing To me, this looks neither like a shift in levels nor returns. But possibly taking logs would yield a piecewise linear pattern...
