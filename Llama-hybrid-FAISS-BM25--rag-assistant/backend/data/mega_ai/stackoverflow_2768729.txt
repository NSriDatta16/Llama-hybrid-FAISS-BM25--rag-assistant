As per the previous answers the basic overhead is 1MB per thread. I won't go into the various nuances - the other answers have them covered. For Microsoft Visual C/C++ threads you also have the per-thread overhead of any C runtime workspace that is allocated on demand (and stored using Thread Local Storage TlsAlloc()) to perform work such as sprintf(), scanf(), strtol() etc. I don't have any exact figures - you would need to scan the source to the Microsoft CRT to calculate that. For other C/C++ runtimes (gcc/g++/borland/digital mars) there may or may not be similar per-thread data held, its an implementation detail. None of us know the internals of the .Net Execution Engine, but there is probably some per-thread data stored there as well. Going to be hard to figure out what that overhead is though.
