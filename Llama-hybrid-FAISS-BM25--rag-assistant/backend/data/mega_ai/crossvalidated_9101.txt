I do not know the answer, so I can only offer some thoughts hoping that someone else can throw light on the issue. It seems to me that there is no problem in computing the likelihood. To compute the value of the AIC criterion (which may or may not make sense in this context), what would be required is the number of fitted parameters. Here is were things become slippery. To take the simplest example, the (univariate) local level model requires fitting two parameters (the variances of the state and of the noise), but those are really best described as metaparameters. If the variance of the state is zero, you are fitting a single mean (1 parameter). If the variance of the state goes to infinity, you are effectively fitting one parameter per observation. One way out is to define the "number of equivalent parameters" as in, Hodges, J. S. and Sargent, D. J. (2001) Counting Degrees of Freedom in Hierarchical and Other Richly-Parameterised Models, Biometrika, 88 (2), p. 367-379. and this is what I have done in my own work (on purely heuristic grounds and with some trepidation!). See for instance, PÃ©rez-Castroviejo, P. and Tusell, F. (2007) Using redundant and incomplete time series for the estimation of cost of living indices, Review of Income and Wealth , vol. 53 , p. 673-691. There are alternative ways of calculating "equivalent parameters"; if you want to follow this route I can give you some references.
