Create a DataContext and provide an API Key

i need some help with the following: i have a wcf data service with some api authorization mechanism . that works, if i enter the service url in the browser. it validates the api key and gives me data. in another project, i added the service url as a service reference and like to instanciate a EntityFramework DataContext object, but what i wanted was, that the given URI to the constructor of that DataContext needs to have an api-key in there. if i try to pass that api key as a query-parameter, i get an error: "Expected an absolute, well formed http URL without a query or fragment." ok that message points out clearly what i did wrong, but how can i get the apiKey included? greets, chris
