How can I choose how confident my beta distributed bayesian prior should be?

I am new to Bayesian statistics, and would appreciate help understanding the Prior. I want to combine a small national dataset with a prior from very large international studies, to give a posterior for the chance of success nationally. I am using a prior from large international studies (thousands of observations) that point to 20% chance of success. I want to use this information in a beta-distributed prior, but how can I choose between for example (a=2 & b=8) and (a=20 & b=80)? Both represent a 20% success-rate, but will give the prior different "weight" on the posterior result, since the latter is a lot "surer" about the 20%-rate, right?
