I'd probably do stats; but that's because it's the choice I made ;) If your undergrad was in pure math, maybe doing data science would be a good bet. Otherwise doing MSc stats is a good way to get better at math. Getting better at math is way more difficult to do outside of academia than getting better at programming. It partly depends what kind of data scientist you're aiming to be and what kind of work you want to do. If you're leaning towards doing visualisations rather than modelling the data science programmes might be more relvevant. I'd say beware of a focus on learning particular computer tools as this is a rapidly changing area and everything could be different in five years.
