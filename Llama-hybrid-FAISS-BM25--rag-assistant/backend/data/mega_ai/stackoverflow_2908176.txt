Updating counters through Hibernate

This is an extremely common situation, so I'm expecting a good solution. Basically we need to update counters in our tables. As an example a web page visit: Web_Page -------- Id Url Visit_Count So in hibernate, we might have this code: webPage.setVisitCount(webPage.getVisitCount()+1); The problem there is reads in mysql by default don't pay attention to transactions. So a highly trafficked webpage will have inaccurate counts. The way I'm used to doing this type of thing is simply call: update Web_Page set Visit_Count=Visit_Count+1 where Id=12345; I guess my question is, how do I do that in Hibernate? And secondly, how can I do an update like this in Hibernate which is a bit more complex? update Web_Page wp set wp.Visit_Count=(select stats.Visits from Statistics stats where stats.Web_Page_Id=wp.Id) + 1 where Id=12345;
