How to determine if the mean of 1 time series is significantly greater than that of a group of other time series?

I have 20 different time series data over the past 60 days. Each time series is collected from 20 different geographic zones. A test was run in zone A but not in the remaining 19 zones. Is there a way to determine whether the time series from zone A (the experimental one) is significantly different from the time series belonging to the control zones (the remaining 19 time series)? To be clear, there are a couple ways that times series could be similar. For example, they may be correlated (they go up and down together) or they may have a similar mean. I am specifically interested in the later type of similarity. How can I determine if the mean of the time series from zone A is significantly higher than the mean of the mean of the time series from the control zones?
