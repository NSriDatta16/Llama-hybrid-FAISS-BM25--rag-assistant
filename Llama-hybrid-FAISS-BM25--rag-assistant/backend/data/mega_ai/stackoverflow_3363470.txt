As everyone has said, there's no reason your app can't run forever. Well, nuclear holocaust would bring it to a screeching halt, but Dilbert and his tie would be the least of your concerns at that point. Have you considered using an embedded system? You're using a general purpose computer and OS to do only one thing. It would be more economical and a great experience to implement this using Arduino or even some GP-DSP like Analog Devices' Blackfin. You can still program in C/C++ and even have an embedded OS such as ucLinux. Much much cheaper, and rock solid.
