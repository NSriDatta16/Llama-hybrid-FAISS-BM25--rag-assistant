I fully agree with the answer of clockworkgeek - the easiest way is to turn on Template Path Hints in System -> Configuration -> Developer section of admin panel (scope of your store must be chosen for this field to appear). After that all your store pages will be rendered with inclusions of red panels, showing the path to templates. Nice addition is also to turn on Add Block Names to Hints in the mentioned above admin section - so you'll also see block names serving that templates. These actions will allow you to easily trace 95% of all design. However, there are also some blocks that do not render phtml. Or they overload standard toHtml () method in such a way that it doesn't show template's path. These are more complicated cases. To find the place where design is created you should either: Learn layout-blocks-phtml model of View part in Magento - Designer's Guide to Magento is a good place to study it. Then you'll be able to find blocks and templates by layout structure. Install X-Debug, set it up for your IDE, set a breakpoint at getChildHtml('topMenu') ?> line and dig in this line. It's the easiest and most universal way to solve your problem (although knowledge of Magento design structure still is a must).
