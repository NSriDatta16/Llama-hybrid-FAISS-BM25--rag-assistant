XGBoost tree "Value" output:

Using the following R code I obtain a decision tree using the agaricus dataset: data(agaricus.train, package='xgboost') bst $data, label = agaricus.train$ label, max_depth = 3, eta = 1, nthread = 2, nrounds = 2,objective = "binary:logistic") # plot all the trees xgb.plot.tree(model = bst) # plot only the first tree and display the node ID: xgb.plot.tree(model = bst, trees = 0, show_node_id = TRUE) I want to understand more clearly the "value" output of the tree (the 3rd line in the oval shaped object). Here we can see that tree 0 leaf 7 gives a value 1.90174532 . (That is the first terminal node in the image). I want to know if this value is the same as the log-odds score. So, all observations which follow the upper path of the decision tree will obtain a log-odds score of 1.90174532 . Then in a new decision tree the observations will fall into a different split depending on each observations characteristics and will obtain a "new" value Then we sum up all these values across all trees to obtain a final log-odds score which can then be converted to a predicted probability using the logistic function. Is my intuition correct? Does value = log-odds . ( https://rdrr.io/cran/xgboost/man/xgb.plot.tree.html )
