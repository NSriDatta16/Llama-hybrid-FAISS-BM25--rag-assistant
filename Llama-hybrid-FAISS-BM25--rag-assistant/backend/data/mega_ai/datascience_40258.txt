Do we need to use off-policy methods for policy shaping?

Let's say that there is a reinforcement learning task and an agent in a environment. I want a human teacher to manually modify the policy of the agent (policy shaping) to speed up the learning of the agent. Do I have to use off-policy methods or I can get away with on-policy? Why?
