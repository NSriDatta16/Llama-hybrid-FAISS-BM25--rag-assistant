Where should I store a site sitewide configuration setting for a Rails app?

I have a rails app and from the admin section of the site I'd like to be able to enable / disable certain settings such as serving ads or embedding of Google Analytics tracking code. Is there a best practice for this in Rails? One thought was creating a settings table and storing values in it.
