Math from apache commons has some tools you can use for generating data from simple probability distributions. It is actually pretty easy to roll your own variant of these generation functions using the random() functionality of whatever system you're using. Assuming random() returns a uniformly distributed random number between 0 and 1 you just pass that through the inverse cumulative distribution function of whatever distribution you need to get the random numbers you need. If you need something very fancy you can use Markov Chains .
