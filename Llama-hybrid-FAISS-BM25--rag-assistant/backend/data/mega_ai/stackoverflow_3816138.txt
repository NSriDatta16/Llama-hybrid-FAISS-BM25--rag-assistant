Although I "wrote the book" on R to SPSS migration, that was aimed at programmers and most SPSS users that I know prefer to "point-and-click" instead. A graphical user interface like Deducer (or R Commander) can help them feel at home while teaching them how R programming code works if they want to see it. Deducer's Plot Builder also does a nice job letting you create complex plots easily, and if you want to learn to ggplot2 code, it will show you that as well. Ian did a great job with it! However, while the SPSS graphical user interface covers 98% of what SPSS can do, Deducer covers perhaps 1% of what R can do. That's probably still 75% of what your average researcher needs, but R is so broad that to get the most out of it people will need to learn to program. The free version of my book, "R for SAS and SPSS Users" is only 80 pages & covers the areas of programming that I think are most likely to confuse beginners. It's at http://r4stats.com .
