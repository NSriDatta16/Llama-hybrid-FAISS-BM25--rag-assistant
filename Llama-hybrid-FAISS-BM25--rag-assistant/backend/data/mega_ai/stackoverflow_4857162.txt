Is there a way to refresh Magento *Catalog* (not Shopping Cart) prices with a Coupon code?

Been searching high and low for a question similar to this both here and in Google and I'm surprised that I haven't been able to find anything similar. I'm familiar with Customer Groups and Tiered Pricing but it doesn't fit the objective that my client has set. What we want is for a user to come to our Magento store and see the regular homepage with regular prices. At that point we want a prominent text field for the user to add a Coupon Code upon which the site will refresh and display the new discounted prices with the regular price struck out (or "slashed" by some other visual method. Customer Groups / Tiered Pricing aren't the solution because they require that the customer log in. The NOT LOGGED IN group wouldn't help either since all users would see the discount. This can't happen in the Shopping Cart either because by then it's too late, this needs to happen on the Catalog level. We are currently using OSCommerce and transitioning over to Magento shortly. Right now what we're doing to emulate this behavior is to have a text field on our regular website on the Store Access page where a user can click on a region or enter a coupon code. IF they enter a code they are redirected to a custom store that has special pricing. I know that it's easy to recreate our current method in Magento by creating a store view and then using the same functionality but it seems a shame to do this when the idea of moving to a new platform that so much more powerful. I haven't seen any extensions that do this. Does anyone have any insight as to whether something like this can be accomplish and if so, how?
