Well, I've been fairly deep into memory management issues and I've talked to Adobe engineers about it, and I never heard any mention of a defrag phase. On the other hand, it seems reasonably unlikely that they'd leave it out, and I've certainly seen my overall memory use drop after a GC, in the sort of way you'd expect it to if there was a defrag phase. So overall I'd say there probably is such a phase. But what I do feel fairly confident about is that I don't think there's any official public docs on it either way. I certainly never saw any, anyhow. If anyone knows otherwise I'll happily rescind, but just in case you don't get any other answers.
