Logistic regression in r for aggregated counts

I have country level data for a binary (good/bad) outcome. For each country, I have the number of individuals in the sample who answerd "good" and number of individuals who answered "bad". I also have percent of the sample (instead of number). So basically, instead of 1/0 for outcome, for each obseration (country) I have % of people for each category of the binary outcome. Hope this is clear enough... How can I create a logistic regression model in R for this?
