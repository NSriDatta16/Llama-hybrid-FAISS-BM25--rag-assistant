What does (function($) {})(jQuery); mean?

I am just starting out with writing jQuery plugins. I wrote three small plugins but I have been simply copying the line into all my plugins without actually knowing what it means. Can someone tell me a little more about these? Perhaps an explanation will come in handy someday when writing a framework :) What does this do? (I know it extends jQuery somehow but is there anything else interesting to know about this) (function($) { })(jQuery); What is the difference between the following two ways of writing a plugin: Type 1: (function($) { $.fn.jPluginName = { }, $.fn.jPluginName.defaults = { } })(jQuery); Type 2: (function($) { $.jPluginName = { } })(jQuery); Type 3: (function($){ //Attach this new method to jQuery $.fn.extend({ var defaults = { } var options = $.extend(defaults, options); //This is where you write your plugin's name pluginname: function() { //Iterate over the current set of matched elements return this.each(function() { //code to be inserted here }); } }); })(jQuery); I could be way off here and maybe all mean the same thing. I am confused. In some cases, this doesn't seem to be working in a plugin that I was writing using Type 1. So far, Type 3 seems the most elegant to me but I'd like to know about the others as well.
