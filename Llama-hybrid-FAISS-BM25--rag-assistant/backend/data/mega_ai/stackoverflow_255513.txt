The main benefits of TDD brought to refactor is that developer has more courage to change their code. With unit test ready, developers dare to change code and then just run it. If the xUnit bar is still green, they have confidence to go ahead. Personally, I like TDD, but doesn't encourage over-TDD. That is, don't write too much unit test cases. The unit tests should just be enough. If you over unit testing, then you may find you are in a dilemma when you want to do a architecture change. One big change in production code will bring a lot of unit test cases change. So, just keep your unit test enough.
