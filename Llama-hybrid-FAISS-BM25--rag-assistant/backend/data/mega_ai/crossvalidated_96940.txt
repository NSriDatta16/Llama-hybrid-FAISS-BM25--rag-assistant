As there has been no reply i'll throw a suggestion into the pot. As far as i'm aware there is no non-Bayesian implementation of a dependent changepoint test currently in R. Having said this the strucchange package implements changes in regression and as such you can construct AR models manually in this framework. Take an AR(1) model as an example: set.seed(1) # reproducibility x=c(arima.sim(model=list(ar=0.8),n=50),arima.sim(model=list(ar=-0.8),n=50)) # simulate some data with a change library(strucchange) # load the package breakpoints(x[2:100]~x[1:99]) # detect breaks in an AR1 model The final line fits an AR(1) model to the data and assesses if there is a change in the AR(1) parameter. You have to essentially ignore the first p data points in order to fit an AR(p) model. This is probably not exactly what we want as you are required to fully specify the AR model but i'd argue it is better than nothing. I have some code to fit general AR(p) models to changepoints using likelihoods where the code automatically chooses the best p for a segment but I haven't had time to incorporate this into the changepoint package yet. I can post this to a repository if it would be useful to you. For information there is a list of R packages related to changepoint analysis at: www.changepoint.info/software
