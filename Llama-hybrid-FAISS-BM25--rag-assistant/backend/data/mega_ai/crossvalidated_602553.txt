Appropriate family to use for continuous response variable (proportion data) with both negative and positive values in glmm?

I have a continuous response variable from proportion data with both negative and positive values. Values in response variable range from 0.92 to -0.92. I would like to use glmms but not sure what family to use. As I understand, beta family can be used for proportion data with values between 0 & 1 (both exclusive). About the experiment, I had a field trial where I observed disease severity on plants, harvested the plants, and distributed the harvested diseased plant pieces into the ground to infect plants in the next year. Next year, I planted healthy plants on the same field and let them infected by infected left-over plant pieces from the previous year. I then subtracted disease severity observed in the current year from disease severity observed in the previous year to find the difference in disease severity. I repeated the same process for 11 years. This is not a time series data. Thank you very much for any assistance. I will be relating this difference to weather variables. Is gaussian family appropriate here? Histogram of residual from running the following doesn't show a normal distribution. mod_1
