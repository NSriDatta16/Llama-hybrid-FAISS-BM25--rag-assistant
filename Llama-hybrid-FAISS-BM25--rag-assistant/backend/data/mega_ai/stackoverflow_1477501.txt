In your Magento directory under /app/design/frontend/default/(your current theme -- or default)/template/page/html, you'll find your global basics for things like your header, footer, breadcrumb trail, etc. If you want to add text/images throughout your site, that's the place to look first. If you're looking to add text/images only to your home page, you can use the CMS features in the admin. Also, the Magento site has a pretty clear tutorial on how to manage your site design and templates: http://www.magentocommerce.com/design_guide/articles/how-magento-builds-content
