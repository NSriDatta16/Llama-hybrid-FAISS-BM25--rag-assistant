One year later, I finally got around to writing a test harness to test chunking performance of streaming downloads. Here's the set-up: Use an iPhone 4 to download a large file over a Wi-Fi connection* with an asynchronous NSURLConnection . Periodically flush downloaded data to disk (atomically), whenever the amount of data downloaded exceeds a threshold. And the results: It doesn't make a difference. The performance difference between using 32kB and 512kB chunks (and several sizes in-between) is smaller than the variance between runs using the same chunking size. The file download time, as expected, is comprised almost entirely of time spent waiting on the network. *Average throughput was approximately 8Mbps.
