Elements of Statistical Learning: Variance Reduction via Bagging for Random Forests

While Reading chapter 15 of ESL about Random Forests I had some confusion with this phrase: The idea in random forests (Algorithm 15.1) is to improve the variance reduction of bagging by reducing the correlation between the trees, without increasing the variance too much. If I interpret this sentence correctly it means that although the variance of the decision trees could be increased due to decorrelation the variance of the ensemble will decrease. Is this interpretation correct or am I missing something ?
