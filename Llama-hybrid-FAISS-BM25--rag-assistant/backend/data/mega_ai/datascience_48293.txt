How to penalize for empty fields in a DataFrame?

I have to calculate the consistency of racing car drivers during the whole season. My DataFrame consists of 10 columns (10 circuit names) and for each of those columns I have the standard deviation in lap time the driver posted in that circuit. In other words, how consistent the driver is from lap to lap. In races the driver did not finish the field is blank. So far I have calculated their average season consistency by averaging all 10 columns. However, not finishing a race should affect a driver's consistency negatively and I do not know how to implement that.
