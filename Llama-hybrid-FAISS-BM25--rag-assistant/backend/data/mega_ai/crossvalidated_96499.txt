The two functions linked below compute the PCA using either np.linalg.eig or np.linalg.svd . It should help you get there for going between the two. There's a larger PCA class in that module that you might be interested in. I'd like to hear some feedback on the PCA class if you do end up using it. I'm still adding features before we merge that in. You can see the PR here . It won't let me post a deep link for some reason, so look for def _pca_svd and def _pca_eig .
