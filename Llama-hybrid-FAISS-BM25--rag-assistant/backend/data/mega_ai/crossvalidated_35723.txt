In survey sampling the standard error of the estimate of proportion is needed. It depends more on i than j. Also it requires that the i opened ballots were selected at random. If p is the true final proportion for candidate A, then the variance of the estimate is $$\frac{(1-\frac{i}{j})p(1-p)}{i}$$ The quantity $(1-\frac{i}{j})$ is called the finite population correction factor. To estimate this variance the usual estimate for p is substituted for p in the formula. The standard error is gotten by taking the square root. In predicting a winner the pollster might use the estimate plus or minus 3 standard errors. If 0.5 is not contained in the interval, then Candidate A is declared the winner if 0.5 is below the lower limit, or his opponent is declared the winner if 0.5 is above the upper limit. Of course this only says with very high confidence who the winner will be in the event that 0.5 is outside the interval. The confidence level is 0.99 if three standard errors is what you use (based on the normal approximation to the binomial). If 0.5 is inside the interval no one is declared the winner and the pollster waits for more data to accumulate. In making a projection the pollsters can select a stratified random sample from the accumulated votes to avoid potential bias that mmay occur if one looks at all the counted ballots. The problem with looking at all accumulated votes is that certain precincts complete counting over others and they may not be representative of the population. The article here provides good coverage of the problem and numerous references. It has been pointed out that accumulated votes can provided biased estimates of proportions because either the precincts that have yet to report are precincts that tend to favor the party with the candidate that is trailing or the absentee ballots are likely to favor the candidate that is trailing and those votes get counted last. The sophisticated pollsters like Harris and Gallup do not fall into such traps. The simple analysis of constructing confidence intervals based on accumulated votes that I have outlined is only one factor that is used. These pollsters have a great deal more information at their disposal. They have polls that were taken shortly before the election and they have the voting patterns of all the precincts and absentee votes taken in elections in recent past years. So if there are clear biases that could swing a close election in the opposite direction the pollsters will recognize this and hold off projecting a winner. In the US absentee ballots come predominantly from the military overseas and college students who are at school away from home. While the military may tend to be more conservative and likely to vote Republican, the colleage students tend to be more liberal and likely to vote Democratic. All these considerations are taken into account. The care and sophistication of modern polling is the reason that gross errors such as the Literary Digest poll of 1936 or the Chicago newspaper's premature concession of the 1948 election to Dewey have not occurred since then.
