There are various ways to reduce training time per epoch. Divide the dataset into batches, like @raghav gaur suggest. Train on GPU. By default, I think Keras will use CPU. Reduce the size of the neural networks. Print out the number of parameters to get an idea about the size of your network. A good practice for debugging is to overfit one batch of data with your model. If it can't do that, there's likely a bug in your model.
