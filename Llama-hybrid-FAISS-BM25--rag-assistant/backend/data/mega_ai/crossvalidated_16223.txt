I have used quadrat analysis only on regular grids. It was helpful in regard to the purpose, which was to compare the dispersion of sampling data with a known process, e.g., random. Therefore a regular grid worked well. The method you developed and described is not sure to be quadrat counting. For example in the moving average method, one option is to count the number of neighbors for the process, i.e., averaging, which is simply done by searching within a circle (in 2D) or sphere (in 3D). Your method looks similar with a slightly different use of those selected samples.
