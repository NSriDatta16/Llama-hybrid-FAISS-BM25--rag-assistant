Where do you start your design - code, UI, workflow or whatever?

I was discussing this at work, and was wondering where people start their designs? We tend to start with designing code to solve the problem presented to us, but that is probably all of us are (or were) programmers. I was wondering where other people and organisations start their design. Do they start with solving the problem as a coding problem, sit down and design what UI to use, or map out the data or workflow? Thanks
