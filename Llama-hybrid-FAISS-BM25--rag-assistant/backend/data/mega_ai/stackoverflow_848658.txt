This answer is outdated but remains for historical value. As of Xcode 7, Connor's answer from Jun 8 '15 is more accurate. No, there are no generics in Objective-C unless you want to use C++ templates in your own custom collection classes (which I strongly discourage). Objective-C has dynamic typing as a feature, which means that the runtime doesn't care about the type of an object since all objects can receive messages. When you add an object to a built-in collection, they are just treated as if they were type id . But don't worry, just send messages to those objects like normal; it will work fine (unless of course one or more of the objects in the collection don't respond to the message you are sending) . Generics are needed in languages such as Java and C# because they are strong, statically typed languages. Totally different ballgame than Objective-C's dynamic typing feature.
