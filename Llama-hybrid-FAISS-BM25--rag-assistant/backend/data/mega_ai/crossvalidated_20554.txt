PCA's principle and available algorithms

If I understand correctly, PCA's principle is very simple: Calculate data vectors' covariance matrix C . Solve det( C - e *I) = 0, to find matrix C 's eigenvalues e . Calculate matrix C 's eigenfunctions (from those eigenvalues). FIRST: Is this description correct? SECOND: Any algorithm for machine-solving of the polynomial equation det( C - e *I) = 0 ? I understand that this is a general math question (finding roots of a polynomial of degree n ). THIRD: Are there any simple implementations of PCA in C/C++?
