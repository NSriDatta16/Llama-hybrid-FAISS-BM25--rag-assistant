If you want to use an actual System.Windows.Forms.Panel and have it dynamically resize, then you will have to do it like if you were doing drag-n-drop. You will have to handle the mouse Click event on the panel, determine if you are on the edge of the panel (within a 2-3 pixels) and then handle the Drag events and change the Size property of the panel.
