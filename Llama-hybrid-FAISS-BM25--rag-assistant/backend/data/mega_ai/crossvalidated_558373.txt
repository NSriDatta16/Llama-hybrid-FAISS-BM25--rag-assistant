In some ways this may be a philosophical question. My view is that the randomness a statistician sees in data analysis is often real. Randomness might result from random sampling or from inherent randomness or instability. Either way, statistical procedures of estimation might be useful. Let's look at two entirely different situations. (1) We wonder whether the true average height of women high school seniors in a US state is 65 inches. At noon on a particular day, one might carefully measure each of them (thousands or hundreds of thousands, depending on the state), round to the nearest tenth of an inch, and take the mean. Even with perfectly accurate measuring and record keeping, the result would likely be different on another day. Some students might have grown just a bit. Also, there is some evidence that a person's height may depend (slightly) on how much sleep they got the previous night. Does it make sense to say that the true statewide average height fluctuates constantly in some random way? More realistically, one might take a random sample of $n = 400$ women for the measurements and averaging. In this case, random sampling has clearly induced randomness. It would not be surprising if another random sample of $400$ resulted in a different mean. Using such a random sample we could make a 95% confidence interval for heights of senior women. Perhaps this CI would be about $0.7$ inches wide, but we could be fairly sure that the interval contains the right answer for the heights of senior women in the state. For practical purposes that might be sufficiently close to the 'correct' answer. Perhaps some probability model such as $\mathsf{Norm}(\mu = 65, \sigma=3.5)$ is approximately correct. If so, then our two samples of size $400$ might (at random) have been $65.2$ and $65.0.$ round(rnorm(2, 65, 3.5/20) ,1) [1] 65.2 65.0 (2) You have a small specimen of some radioactive material with a long half-life (several thousand years). You use an appropriate counter to count particles emitted in one particular minute to be $746.$ Using exactly the same experimental set-up several minutes later the count is $721.$ Monitoring the specimen over several hours, you believe the hourly rate of particle emission in your experiment is distributed $\mathsf{Pois}(\lambda=750).$ As far as is known, the number of particles emitted into our counter per minute is truly random, and $\mathsf{Pois}(750)$ is a reasonable model. Both of our one-minute measurements could be exactly correct, but it would be wrong to expect them to be exactly the same. (But not often fewer than 697 or more than 804.) set.seed(1226); rpois(2, 750) [1] 746 721 qpois(c(.025,.975), 750) [1] 697 804
