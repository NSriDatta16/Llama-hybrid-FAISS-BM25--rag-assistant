All you need is to add another Transformer that provides the vertex shape when it is selected. The Transformer should choose the shape based on the whether the vertex is "picked" or not. To get the picked state, you need to obtain a PickedState object from the visualization. When the selection is changed, the transformer will be asked for the shape and the vertices will be updated with the returned shape. Here is an example of how to do this: final VisualizationViewer vv = new VisualizationViewer (layout); // Transformer for cycling the vertices between three unique shapes. Transformer vertexShape = new Transformer () { private final Shape[] styles = { new Ellipse2D.Double(-25, -10, 50, 20), new Arc2D.Double(-15, -15, 30, 30, 30, 150, Arc2D.PIE) }; @Override public Shape transform(Integer i) { // Choose a shape according to the "picked" state. PickedState pickedState = vv.getPickedVertexState(); int shapeIndex = 0; if (pickedState.isPicked(i)) { shapeIndex = 1; } return styles[shapeIndex]; } }; vv.getRenderContext().setVertexShapeTransformer(vertexShape);
