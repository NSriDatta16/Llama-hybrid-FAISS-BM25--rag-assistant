You can't - there is no way to reference assemblies in a circular manner like you want to do. Most likely you have not properly designed these assemblies if you need to create a circular reference. Your first assembly is a dependency so there should not be any code in there that knows about anything other than its dependencies. Once your assemblies become "smart" and begin to have knowledge of anything outside their own dependencies you will begin to have serious maintenance and scalability headaches. I would look into reorganizing your code in such a manner that you do not need to create the circular reference.
