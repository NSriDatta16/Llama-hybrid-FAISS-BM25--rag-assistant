In C++, are static initializations of primitive types to constant values thread-safe?

i.e., would the following be expected to execute correctly even in a multithreaded environment? int dostuff(void) { static int somevalue = 12345; return somevalue; } Or is it possible for multiple threads to call this, and one call to return whatever garbage was at &somevalue before execution began?
