Inventory Turnover Estimation

I have an inventory of real estate. Every period I am acquiring some new inventory and selling some items from the inventory. I would like to estimate the average waiting time it takes to sell an asset from the time I purchase. The problem is that I only know how many periods it took to sell those assets I managed to sell, but only know that waiting time is at least some value T(i) for those that I couldn't, where i is the asset index. I cannot simply take average of all waiting times since it will underestimate the average due to the fact that I do not know the exact waiting time for those that I couldn't yet sell. What kind of distribution should I consider and most importantly what kind of estimation procedure should be employed? Thanks
