Something that revolves around the name "controller" can only mean problems. I tried following the Nerddinner http://www.asp.net/mVC/ tutorial this morning. I'm comfortable in webforms, but nothing in that nerddinner tutorial made sense, just an outdated, hardcoded recipe from mvc1.0 that dosent even compile with the current mvc2.0, probably Wrox made this tutorial, only they can come up with only formating and no content. I didn't see anything in there that was good; a bunch of hardcoded conventions I didn't need. I certainly didn't see anything in there that would make me say I'd want to move from webforms, although this seems to be all the propaganda I read. They put this tutorial based around wizards, on http://www.asp.net/mVC/ main page, while claiming the model is lean, all of it is generated code they don't explain, the default mvc template project has something like 15 references. This 2 page website managed to be slow to build and to load. Was 30 minutes in it until I realized my data model didn't match the one from the tutorial and many things that had been generated using the create controller and create view wizards were now failing. With what I was provided in the rushed tutorial, I wasn't able to recover the project. I'll just pass until I find better documentation.
