My guess would be that the problem you're having is not the database itself (although you should check it for index problems), but the amount of time that it takes to retrieve the information from the database, put it in the appropriate objects etc., and send it to the browser. If this is the case, there aren't a lot of options without some real work. You can cache frequently accessed information on the web server. If you know there are a lot of cities which are frequently accessed, you can store them up-front and then check the database if what the user is looking for isn't in the system. We use prefix trees to store information when a user is typing something and we need to find it in a list. You can start to pull information from the database as soon as the user starts to type and then pair down full result set down after you get more information from the user. This is a little trickier, as you'll have to store the information in memory between requests (so if the user types "B", you start the retrieval and store it in a session. When the user is done typing "BOS" the result set from the initial query is in memory temporarily and you can loop through and pull the subset that matches the final request).
