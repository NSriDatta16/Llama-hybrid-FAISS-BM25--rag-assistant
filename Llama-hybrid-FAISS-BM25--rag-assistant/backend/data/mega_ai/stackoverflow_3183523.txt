How to set vertical space (leading) between two HTML paragraphs in an AS3 TextField?

Is there a way to control the vertical space between two HTML paragraphs, in an AS3 TextField? I understand and have successfully applied CSS styles via AS3 and have also utilized the TextFormat class. I am still unable to control the vertical space between a closing and an opening tag: txt.htmlText = " First paragraph here. Second paragraph here. "; The example above renders with the correct font and letter-spacing, but the space between paragraphs is either two-times too tall if txt.condenseWhite = false or it is too condensed if txt.condenseWhite = true . Since only margin-left and margin-right are available CSS attributes in AS3, and not margin-top or margin-bottom , I am at a loss. Thanks!
