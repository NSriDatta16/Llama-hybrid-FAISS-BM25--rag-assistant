Extreme Value Analysis of Hurricane wind speeds

As per the theory, an EVA with annual maxima presupposes that the series is complete, i.e. all years have an event. However, hurricanes don't occur every year, and so the hurricane wind speeds in Miami-Dade exhibit values in some years only, sometimes twice or more in a series from 1900 - 2020. How should I model this incompleteness in the series? Some potential answers include: add zeros in years with no hurricanes Use the average annual number of events (Gilleland and Katz 2016, p.20). Not sure if this is widespread though. Use Generalized Pareto instead What's a preferred way to handle this? are there better ways? thanks!
