How can I stop CKEditor replacing paragraphs with double when pasting from Word

When I use the Paste from Word or Paste as plain text options in CKEditor double line returns get converted into double instances of . Whilst this is technically exactly what exists in the source file it would be fantastic if there were a way to have all double line returns be converted into paragraph tags when pasting from an external document. TinyMCE doesnâ€™t seem to struggle with this. Is this possible with CKEditor? I'm using Pixel & Tonic's Wygwam version of CKEditor and the inference of this support thread is that it can't be done as exists :(
