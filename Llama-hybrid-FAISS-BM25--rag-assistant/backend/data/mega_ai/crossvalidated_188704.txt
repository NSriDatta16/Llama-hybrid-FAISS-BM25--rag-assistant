How to compare classification methods in terms of performance?

I'd like to compare logistic regression to classification trees. In a first step, I compared the theoretical framework of the two classifiers. In a second step, I compared the performance using a rather unbalanced data set containing two classes. I therefore compared confusion-matrices, balanced-accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, I compared the ROC curves and derived therefrom the AUC values. Are there any other value adding measures to compare the classifiers? How would you compare the efficiency in terms of running time?
