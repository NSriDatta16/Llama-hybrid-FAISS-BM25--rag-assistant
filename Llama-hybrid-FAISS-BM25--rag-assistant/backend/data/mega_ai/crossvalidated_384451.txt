Referring to your question regarding 'What do filter_h = $5$ with filter_hs = $[3,4,5$ ], whether filter_h is the maximum length for each filter_hs?? how it works?' In CNN step $1$ ,we target to create a $1D$ convoluted feature. In the research paper by Yoon Kim, there are $6$ filters applied, $2$ filters for each sliding window size [ $3,4,5$ ]. So the convoluted layer would be of the dimension : $(S-W +1)\times 1$ , where $S$ means length of the sentence and $W$ mean sliding window size chosen.
