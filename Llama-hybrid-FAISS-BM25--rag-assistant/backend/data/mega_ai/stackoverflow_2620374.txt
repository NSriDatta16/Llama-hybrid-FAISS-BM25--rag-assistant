Machine learning is a scientific discipline that is concerned with the design and development of algorithms that allow computers to evolve behaviors based on empirical data, such as from sensor data or databases. Read more on Wikipedia Machine learning code records "facts" or approximations in some sort of storage, and with the algorithms calculates different probabilities. The code itself will not be modified when a machine learns, only the database of what "it knows".
