The URL path is normalized before RewriteRule sees it, in particular, // is replaced by / . You should apply your rule to the original request instead like this: RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/(https?:.*) RewriteRule ^ /api/create.php?content=%1 [L] %1 refers to the match done by RewriteCond . %{REQUEST_URI} is the actual query in the first line of the HTTP request. Alternatively, be less strict and accept a single / after the scheme as well as // , since the path might be similarly normalized by the user agent or by proxies.
