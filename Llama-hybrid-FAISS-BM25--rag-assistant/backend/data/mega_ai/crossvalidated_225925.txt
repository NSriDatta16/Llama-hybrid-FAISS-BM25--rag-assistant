Is there anything wrong with treating neural network bias as a node?

I've seen a lot of examples of neural networks where when they introduce the bias, they treat it as a node that always outputs 1, and then the nodes each have an individual weight for it, instead of each having a number that they add with the rest of their inputs before being activated. Is there anything wrong with this form, like maybe how it loses the point of being modeled after cells in the brain?
