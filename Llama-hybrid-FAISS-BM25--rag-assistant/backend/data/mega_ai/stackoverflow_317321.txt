Do you want the text box to be editable for any other browser other than the iPhone? If not, have you attempted to disable the text box? I haven't tried this, nor can I recall seeing a disabled text box on a site with my iPhone; however, it may do it. If disabling the text box works , but you still only want to restrict it to the iPhone, you'll need to look at the User Agent for the iPhone. You can determine this through server side code or through JavaScript's navigator.userAgent . To save a bit more time for you as well, the iPhone's user agent is as follows: Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; U; CPU like Mac OS X; en) AppleWebKit/420.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/3.0 Mobile/3B48b Safari/419.3
