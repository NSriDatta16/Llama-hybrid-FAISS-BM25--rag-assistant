javascript changing location hash of a window, also adds the fragments to the document title

I'm using jQuery BBQ: Back Button & Query Library , which is a great jquery plugin by Ben Alman, and as the name implies provides browser history behavior for a javascript dynamic pages. My problem is that the fragments are getting stacked in the browser's title, when in debug I can see it in the document object ( document.nameProp, document.title ). Is that a know issue when handling the hash part of a URL? if so is there a fix for it or should i maintain it manually?
