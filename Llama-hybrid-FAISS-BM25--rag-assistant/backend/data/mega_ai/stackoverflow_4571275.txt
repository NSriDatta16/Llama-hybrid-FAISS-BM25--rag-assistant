Every order has a store_id , when entered through administraction it will either be 0 (for 'admin' store) or null. if ($order->getStoreId()) { // was placed via frontend } Don't use getStore() as that won't always return the admin store object reliably. Does not work with latest versions of Magento. (see comment)
