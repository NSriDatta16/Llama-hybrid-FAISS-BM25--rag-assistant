I evaluated a tool called Parasoft SOATest . It is very capable but I only scratched the surface when playing with the tool. It can work with Net.Tcp and has various load testing feature, including distributed agents, parameterised tests, test result assertions using xpath etc. However priorities changed and the tool is very expensive as well so we didn't end up using it. But you can always get a trial key from them and see if it suits your purpose.
