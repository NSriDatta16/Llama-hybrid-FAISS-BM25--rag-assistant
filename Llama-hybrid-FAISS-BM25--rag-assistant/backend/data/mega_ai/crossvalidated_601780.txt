What if there are unknown confounders in causal models?

Observational causal models such as causal forest and orthogonal/double machine learning requires the unconfoundedness assumption, i.e. there's no hidden confounders affecting both the treatments and the outcomes. To me, this seems a strong assumption to have in real world application. I feel that the best one could claim is that "at the best of our knowledge, there's no other confounder" and that surprising hidden factors will almost always pop up over time. What would these models behave if there are unknown, unaccounted for confounders (that affecting both treatment and outcome)? And what if there are unknown factors that affect either the treatment or the outcome but not both? What if we know the possibility of some factors but don't have the actual observational data about them and so can't incorporate them into the model? All discussions I read only state the requirement of this assumption without elaborate on the effect of violating it.
