The second table you give as an example does not contain any information about not having a given disease, so you'd be throwing away useful information. You say: What type of omnibus statistical test would you use to check if there is some type of dependency between belonging to a group (A or B) and having a certain disease? So I assume you're not interested in finding relationships between diseases, but just between the variable "group" and each disease taken individually. In this case, a possible approach is simply to consider that there are three distinct contingency tables you're interested in: group vs. disease A, group vs. disease B, group vs. disease C. For instance, for disease A: Disease A No disease A Group A 231 15258 Group B 312 15177 Once you constructed those three contingency tables, you can conduct individual tests on each of them. If you're interested in the question " Is the variable group related to having any disease? ", you'd have to create a new variable "having any disease", and use a contingency table structured like that: Disease No disease Group A 329 15160 Group B 451 15038 Finally, if you want to incorporate information about multiple diseases in your model (e.g. "Does belonging to group A increase the risk of having disease A, if we control for the presence of other diseases?", or "Does belonging to group A increase the risk of having an additional disease, compared to group B"?), there are other possible options (e.g. logistic regression), but you have to tell us more about your study to get more appropriate advice because this is not entirely clear from your question.
