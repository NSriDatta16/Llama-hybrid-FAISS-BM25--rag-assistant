Check out the MSDN page for SortedList : From Remarks section: The SortedList )>) generic class is a binary search tree with O(log n) retrieval, where n is the number of elements in the dictionary. In this, it is similar to the SortedDictionary )>) generic class. The two classes have similar object models, and both have O(log n) retrieval. Where the two classes differ is in memory use and speed of insertion and removal: SortedList )>) uses less memory than SortedDictionary )>) . SortedDictionary )>) has faster insertion and removal operations for unsorted data, O(log n) as opposed to O(n) for SortedList )>) . If the list is populated all at once from sorted data, SortedList )>) is faster than SortedDictionary )>) .
