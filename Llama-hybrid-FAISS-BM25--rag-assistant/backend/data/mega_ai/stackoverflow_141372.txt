How to emulate Emacs’ transpose-words in Vim?

Emacs has a useful transpose-words command which lets one exchange the word before the cursor with the word after the cursor, preserving punctuation. For example, ‘ stack |overflow ’ + M-t = ‘ overflow stack| ’ (‘ | ’ is the cursor position). | becomes . Is it possible to emulate it in Vim? I know I can use dwwP , but it doesn’t work well with punctuation. Update: No, dwwP is really not a solution. Imagine: SOME_BOOST_PP_BLACK_MAGIC( (a)(b)(c) ) // with cursor here ^ Emacs’ M-t would have exchanged b and c , resulting in (a)(c)(b) . What works is /\w yiwNviwpnviwgp . But it spoils "" and "/ . Is there a cleaner solution? Update²: Solved :nmap gn :s,\v(\w+)(\W*%#\W*)(\w+),\3\2\1\r, kgJ:nohl Imperfect, but works. Thanks Camflan for bringing the %# item to my attention. Of course, it’s all on the wiki , but I didn’t realize it could solve the problem of exact (Emacs got it completely right) duplication of the transpose-words feature.
