touch any place outside popup menu(self draw) to hide the uiview

I have created myself popup menu(draw an uiview and list some items). But I hope when touch any place outside the uiview, the popup menu will disappear. I try to use - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { //UITouch* touch = [touches anyObject]; } - (void)touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { } to catch the touch event, but it looks like sometime the function above are not triggered. Welcome any comment Thanks interdev
