You need the border-spacing property. Table cells are not like other elements, because while div and p gets are block level elements, and span and input are inline, table cells and rows get their own table-cell and table-row display values. Using border-spacing with border-collapse: separate will give you what you'd need. Have a look: http://jsfiddle.net/kjag3/1/ PS. I've also taken the liberty of cleaning up the HTML by separating them into two tables, so you won't need the fillers for the empty cells.
