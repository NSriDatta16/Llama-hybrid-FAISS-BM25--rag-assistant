the image picker that apple provides only gives you access to pictures saved in the camera roll. It also gives you the functionality to take a new picture if you are on an iphone. If you save pictures in your app's local storage directory, then you need to build your own mechanism for viewing these photos. You may want to take a look at Joe Hewitt's 320 project - it has a lot of good controls that you may find useful.
