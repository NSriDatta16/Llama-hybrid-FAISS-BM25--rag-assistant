ASP.Net PostbackURL doesnâ€™t work if I put in Javascript Validation

I would like to share my problem with you in detail. 1) I have a textbox and a button in my page consider it as home.aspx 2) I have written the code like this: 3) I have to check wheteher the textbox is null. If not null i want to redirect to search.aspx as given in the postbackurl. 4) Using java script i have validated; function validate() { if(document.getElementById('txtCity').value!='') { alert('please enter the city to search'); returnn false;} } 5) If the textbox is null. It alerts to enter the city. If not the page remains. It is not redirected to the search page. I hope you can..
