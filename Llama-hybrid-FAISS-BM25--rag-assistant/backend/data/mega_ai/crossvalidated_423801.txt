As you say, as for all Bayesian inference, the answer depends on the prior distribution. It also relies on having data randomly selected from whatever population is of interest. I think we may be on squishy ground in this problem on both accounts. If the newspaper poll claimed a 95% margin of error of around $\pm 0.03$ and the professor believes her students are reasonably representative of the US population, then she may choose the prior distribution $\theta \sim \mathsf{Beta}(72,128),$ for the proportion $\theta$ who have traveled abroad. This prior distribution has mean about 0.36, standard deviation about 0.33, and probability about 95% in the interval $(0.295, 0.428).$ The density function is proportional to $\theta^{72-1}(1-\theta)^{128-1}.$ Computation from R: qbeta(c(.025,.975), 72, 128) [1] 0.2950489 0.4276035 Intrinsically, this prior distribution also implies that $P(\theta > .36) \approx 1/2.$ 1 - pbeta(.36, 72, 128) [1] 0.4945107 Then, regarding her class as an appropriate sample from the US population, suppose she sees 7 out of 14 who have traveled abroad, so her binomial likelihood function is proportional to $\theta^7(1-\theta)^7.$ The posterior beta distribution has a density which is proportional to the product of the prior and the likelihood: $\theta^{79-1}(1-\theta)^{135-1},$ which we recognize as the kernel of $\mathsf{Beta}(79, 135).$ It follows that a 95% Bayesian credible interval estimate of $\theta$ is is approximately $(0.306, 0.435).$ qbeta(c(.025, .975), 79, 135) [1] 0.3058837 0.4347508 The posterior probability $P(\theta > .36) \approx 0.605.$ 1 - pbeta(.36, 79, 135) [1] 0.6048508 In this case the information in the prior distribution, based in a poll of perhaps about a thousand US residents, has overwhelmed the information from 14 students in the professor's class. Even though their influence on the result has been modest, it is fair to ask whether 14 non-randomly chosen students should have had any influence at all in an assessment of the traveling habits of Americans in general. Using an noninformative Jeffries prior distribution $\mathsf{Beta}(.5, .5)$ that carries little or no information, the professor would obtain a 95% Bayesian credible interval estimate of $\theta,$ based on the responses of her 14 students: $(0.259, 0.741).$ And $P(\theta > 0.36) \approx 0.86.$ qbeta(c(.025,.975), 7.5, 7.5) [1] 0.258927 0.741073 1 - pbeta(.36, 7.5, 7.5) [1] 0.8618112 Before doing these computations, the professor should make it clear from what population she believes 14 students, who happened to attend her class on a particular day, may rightfully be considered a random sample.
