How does disk de-fragmenting work?

I'd like to have a go at writing something which shows the state of a hard drive in terms of how fragmented it is. Maybe even has a go at de-fragmenting it. But I've realised that I don't fully understand how this works. Can anyone explain this to me and perhaps offer some suggestions of where I might start? I mainly use C# - would this be a suitable language to have a go at putting something together. Thanks in advance
