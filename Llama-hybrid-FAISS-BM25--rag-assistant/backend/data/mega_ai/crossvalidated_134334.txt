Bayesian credible intervals: "superiority" even if 1 is included?

In a recent medical publication comparing a cardiac device to anticoagulation ("blood thinners") using a Bayesian statistical model to evaluate the efficacy of preventing strokes and cardiovascular death, the rate ratio (RR) of the primary outcome (stroke and death and all that) was 0.60 with a 95% credible interval of 0.41-1.05, and the posterior probability of superiority was stated to be 96%. So my question is: how can the posterior probability of superiority (i.e., the device is better than anticoagulation) be 96% if the 95% credible interval of the RR includes 1, meaning it includes the possibility that the device is not better? As I have understood the Bayesian 95% credible interval so far, it answers the question "give me an interval in which the true value of the statistic lies with a probability of 95%", in this case stretching from above 1 to below 1; so how can I still be 96% certain that it is below 1? Is this a plain mistake, or is there a trick to Bayesian statistics that eludes my admittedly poor understanding of these things?
