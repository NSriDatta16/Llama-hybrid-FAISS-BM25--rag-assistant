asp.net mvc c# - Is it possible to access value of textbox in View from Model in CodeBehind?

I have a problem to get a value of textbox which is in view into the controller. In WebForms it was quite easy, it needed just to call textbox in codebehind trouhg Id, but in MVC it seems not possible this way, or? Help me please! Take care, Ragims
