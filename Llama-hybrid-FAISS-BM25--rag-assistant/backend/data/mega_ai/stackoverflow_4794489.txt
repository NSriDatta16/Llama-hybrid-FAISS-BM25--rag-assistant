JAXB represents its metadata as annotations so there really is no marshal/unmarshal according to the XML schema. I lead the JAXB component ( MOXy ) of EclipseLink , which is best know for its JPA implementation . My recommendation for developers is to use a combination of JAXB & JPA annotations on their model. Uses of XML schema: As mentioned by biziclop JAXB can leverage the XML Schema during marshal/unmarshal operations to perform validation. The XML schema also provides a means for clients of your RESTful service to know what the expected XML message looks like. As mentioned by Fabian Steeg you can make the schema easier to maintain by having it created as part of your build.
