Poisson Regression in R based on categorical time variables

I am trying to make a prediction on the number of visitors of a website and am wondering if it can be done based only on categorical time variables. I received some guidance on how to structure my input after a question on Stack Overflow, but I still can't make predictions close to the real values, no matter what I've tried and how I've combined the data. Here are the variables in my dataset: website_id date_int - would act as a time index month - would be used for seasonal effect type - variable derived from the response variable (number of visits), representing the size of the website by calculating an average of number of visits (ranges from 1 to 5). D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6 - variables used to capture the "seasonal effect" for the day of week. visits I'm leaving also a link to a sample data in case it might be relevant: train.csv. This is what the code I've tried in R looks like. train = read.csv("trainData.csv", header = TRUE) head(train) dates I'm new to R, but from what I've seen, all the examples, even those that should be similar (like estimating sales), use other variables beside those categorical time variables. I don't have other features to base my prediction on, so I feel the need to ask if a prediction can even be made using the input given in this situation?
