Need some interpretation with plain English for a part in Bayesian Statistics with Beta proability distribution?

Can somebody explain why equation (6.3) and (6.4) are shown in the book and what the author is trying to say? It feels to me that I am reading the text but I don't think I getting the true meaning that the author is trying to say. I am reading the book, "Doing Bayesian Data Analysis" and the page is "127".
