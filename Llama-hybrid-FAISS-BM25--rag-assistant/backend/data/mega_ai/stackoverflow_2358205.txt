Invoking a jQuery function after .each() has completed

In jQuery, is it possible to invoke a callback or trigger an event after an invocation of .each() (or any other type of iterative callback) has completed . For example, I would like this "fade and remove" to complete $(parentSelect).nextAll().fadeOut(200, function() { $(this).remove(); }); before doing some calculations and inserting new elements after the $(parentSelect) . My calculations are incorrect if the existing elements are still visible to jQuery and sleeping/delaying some arbitrary amount of time (200 for each element) seems like a brittle solution at best. I can easily .bind() the necessary logic to an event callback but I'm not sure how to cleanly invoke the .trigger() after the above iteration has completed . Obviously, I can't invoke the trigger inside the iteration as it would fire multiple times. In the case of $.each() , I've considered adding something to the end of the data argument (that I'd manually look for in the iteration body) but I'd hate to be forced to that so I was hoping there was some other elegant way to control the flow with respect to iterative callbacks.
