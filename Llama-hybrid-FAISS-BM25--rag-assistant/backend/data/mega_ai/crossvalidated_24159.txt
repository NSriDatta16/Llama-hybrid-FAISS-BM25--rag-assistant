Realtime data change detection

I have been asked to do some real time data analysis. The data values represent parameters of phone calls for a telco (like number of calls, call length, etc.) If the numbers suddenly drop or spike, I'm supposed to raise an alarm. Normal noise is expected, but we want to know if things change suddenly, like if no one's routing calls over a line. So individual outliers are not an issue, but if the whole set changes significantly, we want to know. I can handle the programming, but I'm not sure what statistical quantities I should be checking. My first guess was to compute a moving average (of number of calls per minute, for example) and a moving standard deviation, and trigger an alarm if the average changes more than one standard deviation. But looking over this site, I think that might be terribly na√Øve. What would be a good way to detect these changes?
