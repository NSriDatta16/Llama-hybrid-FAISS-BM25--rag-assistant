Alan, Thanks so much for your contributions to the Magento development community. I really appreciate it. When I was in your position about 6 months ago, we evaluated a lot of the extensions that were available for this sort of transaction, and none of them seemed viable. We tested a few that left out information like addresses, another errored out, it was a mess. We ended up doing it programmatically. The quality of some of the extensions available is really questionable, and it seems that the import/export market is particularly bad. Good luck!
