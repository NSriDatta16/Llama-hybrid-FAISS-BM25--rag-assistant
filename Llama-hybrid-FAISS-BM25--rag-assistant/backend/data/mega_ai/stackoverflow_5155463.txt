What job(s) would you want SQL Server Agent to perform? For example, if you were only looking for backup, but the host already has backup capabilities, what else would you need to work around? As to whether you should switch, it might become a personal decision. You may be more comfortable with SQL Server, but sticking with MySQL on a relatively small project helps you gain some new experience. You'd also have to weigh the expected productivity gain of working in a familiar territory against the upfront effort / time it would take you to make the switch.
