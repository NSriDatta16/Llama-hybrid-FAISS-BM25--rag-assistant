When will YTD hit a goal?

I'm estimating a deadline, when my time series will add up (total so far) to a certain large number. I'm doing so by getting a forecast line, plus or minus the RMS error of the known values. But if I the error every period, and subtract it every period, to get the upper and lower bounds on my estimate, that will yield a worse estimate of my deadline than is likely. How do I find the error more reasonably? Should I instead use the RMS error itself, not compounded many times, since over time the underestimates and overestimates will tend to add up to something within the RMS error? (Something like that reasoning, anyway. The series is generally decreasing, so maybe that's a reasonable idea.) Any better ideas?
