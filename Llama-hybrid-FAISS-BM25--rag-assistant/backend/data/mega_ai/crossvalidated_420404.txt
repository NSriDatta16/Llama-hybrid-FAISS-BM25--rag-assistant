You're fitting the PCA twice in the first code snippet. First time here: pca_transformed_fit = pca.fit(data) , second time here: pca_transformed = np.around(pca.fit_transform(data), 10) . I guess there are some small computational errors that result in a slightly different decomposition upon every repeated call to fit() or fit_transform() . Replace fit_transform() with transform() and it should work (at least it worked for me when I tested it).
