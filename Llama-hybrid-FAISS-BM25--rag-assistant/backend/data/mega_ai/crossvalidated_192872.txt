Absolutely, you can compare the different clusters, although it's important that you carefully consider what you infer from statistical significance. While it is indeed a very good indicator, by its very nature a threshold of $p This question touches on the problem of multiple comparisons where the more tests you apply the more likely you are to find something statistically significant. There are simple corrections such as bonferroni which essentially reduces the threshold to $p So there is no harm in looking at your data from a number of ways to extract insight from it, in fact I would encourage it. The best advice I could give is to look at your data, plot it out, look at the distributions, how many data points do you have, are they normal or non-parametric or skewed. Get a real feeling of whats going on rather than just relying on statistical tests. If you have a hunch and the p-value looks in the right ball park, gather more data and see if this confirms your theory.
