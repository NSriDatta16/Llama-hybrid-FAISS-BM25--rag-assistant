How about: let rec chunks n sq = if not (Seq.is_empty sq) then seq { yield Seq.take n sq |> Seq.to_array yield! chunks n (Seq.skip n sq) } else Seq.empty Note that this requires sq to have a number of elements which is evenly divisible by n (because Seq.take and Seq.skip, unlike LINQ's Take and Skip extension methods, require that the sequence contains at least n elements). Also, this isn't as efficient as explicitly using the enumerator would be, but it's more elegant.
