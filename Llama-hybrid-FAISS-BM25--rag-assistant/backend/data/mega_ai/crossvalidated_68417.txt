Integration step in Bayesian linear regression

I want to obtain the integral: $$\int_{{\mathbb R}^p} \frac{1}{(2\pi)^{\frac{n}{2}}\vert\Sigma\vert^{\frac{1}{2}}}\exp\left[-\frac{1}{2}({\bf y} - {\bf X}{\beta})^{\top} \Sigma^{-1}({\bf y} - {\bf X}{\beta})\right] d\beta,$$ where ${\bf y}$ is an $n\times 1$ vector, $\beta$ is a $p\times 1$ vector, $\Sigma$ is a symmetric positive definite matrix and ${\bf X}$ is an $n\times p$ matrix. This expression is very common in Bayesian linear regression but I do not know the trick used to separate ${\bf X}$ from $\beta$ in order to obtain the integral by using its resemblance to the multivariate normal distribution. I would appreciate any guidelines on this. Thanks.
