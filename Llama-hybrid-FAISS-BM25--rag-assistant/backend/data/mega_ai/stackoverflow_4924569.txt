Why doesn't rails 2.1 catch exceptions with rescue_from?

in my ApplicationController, I have rescue_from StorageExceptions::AuthorizationFailed, :with => handle_auth_error def handle_auth_error redirect_to error_path(403) end but the code is not catching this error. I have checked that what is being caught is NameError with message: "uncaught throw `StorageExceptions::AuthorizationFailed'" Why is this and how can I catch the actual error?
