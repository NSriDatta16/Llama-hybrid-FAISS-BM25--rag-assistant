Magento vertnav expand one category

I want that in my magento shop with vertnav meniu(3 levels) first level would be open by default. Example: > AA > -1a > -2a > -3a > BB But now I have: > AA > BB There is in configuration way to make all levels expanded, but i dont need that, because then it would be like this: > AA > -1a > -1aaa > -2aaa > -2a > -3a > BB Is there any way?
