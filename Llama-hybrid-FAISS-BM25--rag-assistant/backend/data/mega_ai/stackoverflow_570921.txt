If I understand, you need to specify your domain name instead of S3. To do this, you need to write a handler which will act as a proxy to the amazon server. But, that would actually double your bandwidth as you need to send the image to the client as well fetch the image for S3. I am not sure is there any S3 specific way to handle this. Below is Amazon S3 specific way taken from Amazon S3, CNAME record The average user may sign up for Amazon S3 hosting and begin uploading files - accepting the default URL structure for hosted files: http://s3.amazonaws.com/your-bucket/some-file.txt If you plan on using S3 to host media files - more specifically Flash files - you’ll run into Adobe’s cross domain security policy. The fix requires mapping your hosted S3 files to look as though they are being served from your own domain - virtual hosting. The easiest and most attractive method would be a hosted file URL that like this: http://s3.your-site.com/some-file.txt To get started, create a bucket on S3 that you want as the root for your hosted files. For this example, your S3 bucket would be: s3.your-site.com The most important step is adding the appropriate CNAME record to your DNS settings. Name Type Data s3.your-site.com CNAME s3.amazonaws.com. Expect your new DNS settings to take up to 24-48 hours to resolve.
