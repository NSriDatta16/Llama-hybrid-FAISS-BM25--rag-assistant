How to automatically launch needed services and apps?

I am writing my first erlang application and I want to do things the way they should be done in the erlang ecosystem. My app depends on ssl, inets services and log4erl application to be already started and as for now I start them manually in the erlang shell. After that I start my app's supervisor that starts other parts. The question is how should I organize things so that there would be no need to start ssl, inets and log4erl manually ?
