Unit Testing in XCode

I am trying to test some model classes that I've written with SenTest in XCode. I have dragged the model header and implementation files into the Compile Sources group within my LogicTests target, and my tests pass. The problem though is that I'm getting a ton of compiler warnings about no rule to process file such as: warning: no rule to process file '$(PROJECT_DIR)/Speaker.h' of type sourcecode.c.h for architecture i386 If I delete the header and implementation files from the Compile Sources group, then the tests don't pass. What do I have configured wrong here?
