Because probabilities are bounded between 0 and 1, we need some function which can take the unbounded input $\theta^T x$ and map it to the unit interval. Mathematically, we need $$f : \mathbb{R} \to [0,1]$$ The sigmoid function accomplishes this, but it is not the only one. If we had used the CDF of the normal, we would be doing something called Probit regression (closely related to logistic regression). In short, we have constructed logistic regression (i.e. defined it) in a way that $P(y=1) = h_\theta (x)$ .
