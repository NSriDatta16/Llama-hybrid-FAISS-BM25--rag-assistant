The justification for using the t distribution in the confidence interval for a mean relies on the assumption that the underlying data follows a normal distribution, which leads to a chi-squared distribution when estimating the standard deviation, and thus $\frac{\bar{x}-\mu}{s/ \sqrt{n}} \sim t_{n-1}$ . This is an exact result under the assumption that the data are exactly normal that leads to confidence intervals with exactly 95% coverage when using $t$ , and less than 95% coverage if using $z$ . In the case of Wald intervals for proportions, you only get asymptotic normality for $\frac{\hat{p}- p}{\sqrt{ \hat{p}(1-\hat{p} )/n}}$ when n is large enough, which depends on p. The actual coverage probability of the procedure, since the underlying counts of successes are discrete, is sometimes below and sometimes above the nominal coverage probability of 95% depending on the unknown $p$ . So, there is no theoretical justification for using $t$ , and there is no guarantee that from a practical perspective that using $t$ just to make the intervals wider would actually help achieve nominal coverage of 95%. The coverage probability can be calculated exactly, though it's fairly straightforward to simulate it. The following example shows the simulated coverage probability when n=35. It demonstrates that the coverage probability for using the z-interval is generally slightly smaller than .95, while the coverage probability for the t-interval may generally be slighter closer to .95 on average depending on your prior beliefs on the plausible values of p.
