There is an open source Javascript library that offers something related : mobile-bookmark-bubble The Mobile Bookmark Bubble is a JavaScript library that adds a promo bubble to the bottom of your mobile web application, inviting users to bookmark the app to their device's home screen. The library uses HTML5 local storage to track whether the promo has been displayed already, to avoid constantly nagging users. The current implementation of this library specifically targets Mobile Safari, the web browser used on iPhone and iPad devices.
