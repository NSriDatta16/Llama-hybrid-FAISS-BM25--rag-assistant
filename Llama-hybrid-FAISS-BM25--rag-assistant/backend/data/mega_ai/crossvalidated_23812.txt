The Sleeping Beauty Problem . This is a recent invention; it was heavily discussed within a small set of philosophy journals over the last decade. There are staunch advocates for two very different answers (the "Halfers" and "Thirders"). It raises questions about the nature of belief, probability, and conditioning, and has caused people to invoke a quantum-mechanical "many worlds" interpretation (among other bizarre things). Here is the statement from Wikipedia: Sleeping Beauty volunteers to undergo the following experiment and is told all of the following details. On Sunday she is put to sleep. A fair coin is then tossed to determine which experimental procedure is undertaken. If the coin comes up heads, Beauty is awakened and interviewed on Monday, and then the experiment ends. If the coin comes up tails, she is awakened and interviewed on Monday and Tuesday. But when she is put to sleep again on Monday, she is given a dose of an amnesia-inducing drug that ensures she cannot remember her previous awakening. In this case, the experiment ends after she is interviewed on Tuesday. Any time Sleeping beauty is awakened and interviewed, she is asked, "What is your credence now for the proposition that the coin landed heads?" The Thirder position is that S.B. should respond "1/3" (this is a simple Bayes' Theorem calculation) and the Halfer position is that she should say "1/2" (because that's the correct probability for a fair coin, obviously!). IMHO, the entire debate rests on a limited understanding of probability, but isn't that the whole point of exploring apparent paradoxes? (Illustration from Project Gutenberg .) Although this is not the place to try to resolve paradoxes--only to state them--I don't want to leave people hanging and I'm sure most readers of this page don't want to wade through the philosophical explanations. We can take a tip from E. T. Jaynes , who replaces the question “how can we build a mathematical model of human common sense”—which is something we need in order to think through the Sleeping Beauty problem—by “How could we build a machine which would carry out useful plausible reasoning, following clearly defined principles expressing an idealized common sense?” Thus, if you like, replace S. B. by Jaynes' thinking robot. You can clone this robot (instead of administering a fanciful amnesiac drug) for the Tuesday portion of the experiment, thereby creating a clear model of the S. B. setup that can be unambiguously analyzed. Modeling this in a standard way using statistical decision theory then reveals there are really two questions being asked here ( what is the chance a fair coin lands heads? and what is the chance the coin has landed heads, conditional on the fact that you were the clone who was awakened? ). The answer is either 1/2 (in the first case) or 1/3 (in the second, using Bayes' Theorem). No quantum mechanical principles were involved in this solution :-). References Arntzenius, Frank (2002).
