I don't know much about SEMs, but I've heard they're pretty complicated. An easy to understand alternative would be a multinomial logistic regression. In R, you can formulate this with the vglm() function from the VGAM package. Here's a quick gist: In binomial logistic regression, your model looks like this: $$\log\left(\frac{p}{1-p}\right) = \mathbf{X\beta}$$ In a multinomial logistic regression, you need to have a baseline factor level (I think R defaults to the last one alphabetically). So, if you have $k$ prediction factors, you predict $p_1, ..., p_k$, where $p_k = 1 - p_1 - ... - p_{k-1}$. Your model then looks like this: $$\log\left(\frac{p_i}{p_k}\right) = \mathbf{X\beta}_i$$ Notice here that $\mathbf{\beta}_i$ is itself a vector. So if you have $p$ predictor variables, you now have $p\times(k-1)$ slope estimates.
