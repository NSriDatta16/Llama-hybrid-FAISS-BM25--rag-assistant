You can use __autoload function __autoload($class_name) { include 'classes/'.$class_name . '.php'; } So place every single class in its own file in the classes folder. When you want to use that class it will include it. More info: http://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.autoload.php Update: When I answered this it was fully valid. Now it still works, but keep in mind PHP.net since then says this: spl_autoload_register() provides a more flexible alternative for autoloading classes. For this reason, using __autoload() is discouraged and may be deprecated or removed in the future.
