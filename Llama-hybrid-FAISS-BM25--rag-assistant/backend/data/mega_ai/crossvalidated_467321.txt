I think this is simply known as expanding-window estimation . This can be contrasted to rolling-window estimation (also moving-window estimation ) where you keep the window size fixed by discarding initial observations when you add new ones. (We have the tag moving-window for that.) This is not specific to GARCH models but can be used with any time series model. The forecasts obtained using the rolling-window method may be called rolling forecasts . (I suspect forecasts from expanding-window estimation might be called rolling forecasts , too.)
