Informativeness of t-score?

My organization recently did a morale survey. Results were given as t-scores. I had never seen that before, so I embarked on a web journey. I found a very similar survey . My question isn't about the validity of the approach; rather, it is about how to meaningfully interpret a t-score (as opposed to a z-score). The t-score is similar to the z-score except that the displacement from the mean is normalized by the sample standard deviation. I get uncomfortable about this because a standard deviation under a t-distributino is not as meaningful to me a standard distribution under a normal distribution. Table 1 at this stats info page shows that the area under a standard deviation is not constant (except when the t-distribution approaches a normal distribution). So what exactly does a t-score convey?
