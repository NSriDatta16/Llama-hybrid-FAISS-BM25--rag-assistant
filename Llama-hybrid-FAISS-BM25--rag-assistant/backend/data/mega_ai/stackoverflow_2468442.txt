You should allocate an extra byte for the terminating 0. And you should use strlen instead of sizeof here: newout = (char*)malloc( 2*sizeof(char)+sizeof(output) ); Sizeof returns the size of char* (which is something like 4 on an average system) instead of the length of the string pointed to by output . Moreover, as @Agnel rightly pointed out, i is uninitialized, although that does not make your program crash, just execute the loop for a random number of times. Also, I would recommend strstr strcat for concatenating your strings.
