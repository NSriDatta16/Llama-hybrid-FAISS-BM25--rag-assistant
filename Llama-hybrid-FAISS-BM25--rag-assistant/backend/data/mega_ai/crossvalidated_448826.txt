I want my Random Forest to recognize a simple non-linear model

I have generated probabilities from 0 to 1 based on a non-linear function of my 4 covariates: $X_1 + X_2^2 + X_3 + X_4$ I am hoping to use an off the shelf machine learning method to estimate the probabilities to show how machine learning may be superior to logistic regression in this non-linear situation. I don't want to spend a ton of time tuning the model, because I'm only trying to show that the ML method offers improvement, and naturally picks up on the non-linear term without the user explicitly specifying. Any advice on how I may setup a random forest in R (or perhaps a method that would recognize this non-linearity better)? I am only feeding the ML model $\mathbf{X}=X_1, X_2, X_3,$ and $X_4$ . The quick off the shelf method has not been superior to logistic regression: rf = randomForest(x=X, y=label, data=df, sampsize=0.8*nrow(X), ntree=500) Thanks!
