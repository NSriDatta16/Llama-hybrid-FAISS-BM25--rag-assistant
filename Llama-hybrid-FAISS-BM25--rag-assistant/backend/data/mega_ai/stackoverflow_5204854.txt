How can I prevent showing content that is off-screen when a user "drags" mouse across viewing area?

I am using "overflow: hidden" on the body tag, which hides the scroll bars, but it doesn't prevent the user from click-dragging the mouse to reveal outer content when dragging to the bottom or right-hand edge of the browsing window. Here's the site: http://entanglement.gopherwoodstudios.com/ To replicate behavior, one way (in Chrome) is to press the middle mouse button and drag down or right. In IE9, grab and drag a menu button to the edge. Is there an application-wide way to prevent this, or is there a property or event-call that I must rework on every single element?
