ARMA/ARIMA are univariate models that optimize how to use the past of a single series to predict that single series. One can augment these models with empirically identified Intervention Variables such as Pulses, Level Shifts , Seasonal Pulses and Local Time Trends BUT they are still fundamentally non-causal as no user-suggested input series are in place. The multivariate extension of these models is call XARMAX or more generally Transfer Function Models which use PDL/ADL structures on the inputs and employ any needed ARMA/ARIMA structure on the remainder. These models can also be robustified by incorporating empirically identifiable deterministic inputs. Thus both of these models can be considered Applications to longitudinal (repeated measures) data. Now the Wikipedia article on multi-level models refers to their application to time series/longitudinal data by assuming certain primitive/trivial i.e. non-analytical structures like "The simplest models assume that the effect of time is linear. Polynomial models can be specified to allow for quadratic or cubic effects of time". One can extend the Transfer Function model to cover multiple groups thus evolving to Pooled Cross-section time series analysis where the appropriate structure (lags/leads) can be used in conjunction with ARIMA structure to form both local models and an overall model.
