Project the data orthogonally onto the line and inspect the residuals. In this case, where the reference line is given (independently of the data) as $y=x$, the projection is tantamount to plotting the points $\{((x_i+y_i)/2, y_i-x_i)\}$. To illustrate, here are your points and the reference line: Here is the derived plot: You can now apply any test of homogeneity and independence of residuals you like, such as the Fligner-Killeen test or Breusch-Pagan test. (Many such tests assume the first coordinate is fixed, not random, so they will be only approximately correct, but in general--at least when the data aren't terribly noisy--they should work fine.)
