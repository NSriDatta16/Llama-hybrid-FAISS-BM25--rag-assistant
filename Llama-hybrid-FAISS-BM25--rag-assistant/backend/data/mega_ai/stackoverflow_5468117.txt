I want to store metric units in a database - what datatype should I use?

I'd like to store height which would eventually be displayed in Imperial/US ( 6 ft 4 for example ) in a database which is currently MySQL ( which I plan to migrate to PostgreSQL ). I'm wondering what unit is good for this type of storage, and what column type I should use? I'm thinking centimeters/metric system and some numeric column type, but would be great if someone can provide insight.
