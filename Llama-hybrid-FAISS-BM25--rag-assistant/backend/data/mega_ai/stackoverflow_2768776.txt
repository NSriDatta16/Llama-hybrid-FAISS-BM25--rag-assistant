Whenever you are embedding user-supplied information in HTML, you should use htmlspecialchars . Whenever you are embedding user-supplied information in SQL, you should use mysql_real_escape_string . Follow these rules and you should be OK. Note, however, that a better solution for database security would be to use prepared/parametrized queries (see here and here ), as these will handle the escaping for you, eliminating the possibility of your forgetting. Also, don't forget to check for magic quotes .
