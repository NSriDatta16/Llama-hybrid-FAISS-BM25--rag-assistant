use $.load() , and the script will be evaluated. $("#something").load("request.php"); Maybe jQuery there also uses eval() , so it is'nt more safe, but as long as load() only works on the same Domain u should have Control over the things that will be evaluated. However, it is easier to use, because you did'nt have to parse the Fragment for script's on your own :)
