I'm not aware of any such method, but a workaround is to directly use the Apache Commons library in your Groovy code: import org.apache.commons.lang.StringUtils def str = StringUtils.capitalize(input) It makes your Groovy code a bit Java-ish (some may not like it) but it does the job. IMO the great advantage of Groovy is that you can very easily leverage all the Java libraries you normally use with a more traditional Java code base.
