Why is it not advised to use k-means for classification?

It seems like a trivial extension of k-means clustering if you have labelled training data is to assign each centroid a label, and given a new piece of test data to classify it to the label corresponding to the centroid with the closest distance. However, I could not find much online about the (ab)use of k-means clustering for this purpose, and people advise using just k-nearest neighbors or SVMs directly. Why would (ab)using k-means clustering via this relatively straightforward method not yield good results?
