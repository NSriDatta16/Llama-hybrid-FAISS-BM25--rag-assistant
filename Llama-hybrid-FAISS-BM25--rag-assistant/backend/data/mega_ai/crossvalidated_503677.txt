Feature Engineering for missing values over test and train data together or separately

I note 2 styles of feature engineering. Hence my question to confirm what I think is best practice by an example as follows: If we need to fill in missing values (as opposed to discard the observation, then in the case of imputing missing Age I would do this over the whole data set before splitting into train and test, etc. However, I see example of persons doing this over the test and train data individually. Surely this is incorrect.
