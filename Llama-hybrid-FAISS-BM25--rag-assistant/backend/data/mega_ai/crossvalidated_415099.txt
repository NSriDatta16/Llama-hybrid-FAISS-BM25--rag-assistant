You pose the following question: Are there really research questions where all you want to know is whether at least any one of those groups is different from any other group, but where you don't care which ones they are? Yes, here is one such example. Research Question: Do students randomly assigned to different teaching assistants' recitation sections do comparably well on key course assessment indicators (say, the final exam)? I think the issue with the way you've presented your query is that it seems to suggest only ANOVA with statistically significant results are possible for RQs. However, the RQ here is still reasonable (something someone might want to know), and it so happens that the hope is most likely NOT to find a statistically significant finding. That said, if your query is specifically, are there other methods than 1-way ANOVA when you are expecting a difference? then I would agree...it might be harder to find an authentic RQ example. To address the second query posed: Yet in this frequent scenario, I often see the ANOVA done anyway. Is this just a historic relic? I would argue that starting with the planned comparisons without first confirming that a difference is actually present (i.e., an omnibus test) is a quasi-failure to confirm assumptions of the test. I would argue, thus, that it is not just an historic relic, but a process that should be encouraged (even in the more pedantic examples like an ANOVA). As a reviewer that has encountered more than one manuscript where subsequent significant findings (even with MCP adjustments) were reported when the MANOVA failed to detect a difference...I think there is something to be said in maintaining the omnibus protocol for 1-way ANOVA and subsequent MCPs.
