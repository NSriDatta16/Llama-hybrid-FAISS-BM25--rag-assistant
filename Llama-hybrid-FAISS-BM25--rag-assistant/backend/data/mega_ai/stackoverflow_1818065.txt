xml creation with xslt (items per page with delta)

I'm using XSLT 1.0 to transform some XML documents. I have a problem to do one thing, in that I would need some help please: I have a set of items in my XML document something like : ... ... ... I want to create something like this based on delta (items per page), for example delta is three: ... ... ... ... ... ... So, basically to create a XML structure in XSLT that will put fixed number of items per page. If tried something like this (in order to use node-set): ` But this doesn't work because the xslt parser says 'Expected end of tag 'page' and this is for the first tag I want to add. It seems that I have to end the page tab in the same line. With it doesn't work unfortunately. Please advise, how can I make this kind of tree fragment structure in order to later extract the node-set using EXSL extension. Thank you.
