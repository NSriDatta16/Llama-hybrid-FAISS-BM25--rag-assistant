"Random Forests" or "Random Forest"?

A question that has been bugging me recently is whether it is more correct to refer to the Random Forests Classifier as "Random Forests" or "Random Forest" (e.g. "We implemented a Random Forest classifier" or "We implemented a Random Forest s classifier".) Which is more correct, or are both equally correct? Breiman in his classic paper https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~breiman/randomforest2001.pdf seems to use both interchangeably, although most papers I have read refer to it as "Random Forests".
