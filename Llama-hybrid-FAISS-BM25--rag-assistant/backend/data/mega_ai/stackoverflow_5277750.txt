Store image and then later display it in ImageView on Android

Im building an application on android that displays an image stored in a specific folder on the SD card. I want my code to build the folder on the SD card then put an image file in that folder. Then after it is created I want it to pull the image out of the folder and display it in the imageview. This is what i have so far. //create the folder then add the image here File SDlocation = Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(); File clothingdirectory = new File(SDlocation + "/images/"); clothingdirectory.mkdirs(); File outputFile = new File(clothingdirectory, imagename.png); FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(outputFile); //pull the image out of the folder here Bitmap bMap = BitmapFactory.decodeFile(SDLocation + "/images/imagename.png"); ImageView iv = (ImageView) findViewById(R.id.imageView1); iv.setImageBitmap(bMap); EDIT: sorry my question is how create the file to save on the phone. I'm missing a step. I don't have an image called imagename.png. How would i create one? EDIT2: How do i take an image from my project folder and put in in the directory i created to pull out later?
