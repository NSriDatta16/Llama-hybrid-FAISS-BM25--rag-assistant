What does it mean to say that "a topic is a distribution on words"?

I was taking a machine learning course and they say the following two phrases that confuse me: each document is a distribution on topics. and each topic is a distribution on words. I was wondering if someone knew what that meant. Here is a link to the notes: http://people.csail.mit.edu/moitra/docs/bookex.pdf Currently this is how I interpret it (my thoughts). Well, we are modeling a topic as a vector $u^{(i)}$ with the relative frequencies of each word. So it just specifies how often each word appears in a specific topic. Also, each document can approximately thought of as a linear combination of these topic vectors, i.e. document $M_{j} = \sum^{r}_{i=1} w_{i}u^{(i)}$ thought I wasn't sure if that was right or how to include the concept of "distribution" to this.
