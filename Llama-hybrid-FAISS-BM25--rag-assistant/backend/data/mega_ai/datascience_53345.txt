Concrete example to elaborate on the relationship between `linear function` and `aﬃne function` in the context of machine learning

I am learning the deeplearningbook Section 5.1.4 says: so the mapping from parameters to predictions is still a linear function but the mapping from features to predictions is now an aﬃne function Can any one give a concrete example to elaborate on the relationship between linear function and aﬃne function in the context of machine learning?
