$L(\theta;x)=f(x;\theta)$ vs. $L(\theta;x)\propto f(x|\theta)$

My second-year notes in Statistical Inference and Modelling (unpublished) have a definition, The likelihood function of $X$ , given the data $x$ , is $Lâˆ¶\Theta\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ defined by $L(\theta;x)=f(x;\theta)$ . My third-year notes in Bayesian Statistics (unpublished) have a statement, the likelihood is proportional to the joint distribution, i.e. $L(\theta;x)\propto f(x|\theta)$ . This makes me wonder several things. What's the significance of the order of parameters separated by a semicolon, e.g. $(\theta;x)$ vs. $(x;\theta)$ ? Do $f(x;\theta)$ and $f(x|\theta)$ refer to the same function? $f(x|\theta)$ has a 'given' bar like a conditional but the third-year notes appear to refer to it as a 'joint'. Which is it? and why the apparent mis-match? Is the likelihood $L$ equal to the other function $f$ or proportional? Is it proportional in general and sometimes equal as a special case, with a proportionality constant of $1$ ? Edit: The paragraph from the third-year notes.
