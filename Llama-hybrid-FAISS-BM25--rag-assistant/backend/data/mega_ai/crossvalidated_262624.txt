You can use the application of Bayes formula. For each of 3 categories, you have total number which can be labeled as $n_i$ for $i\in\{1, 2, 3\}$. Thus, you can use the prior as $$ P(C=i) = \frac{n_i}{\sum_{j=1}^3 n_j} $$ The percentages of determinants, you can interpret as likelihood $P(X_k|C=i)$. For example, the probability of living in a village conditioned by delivery at home. The index $k=1,\dots m$ where $m$ is total number of determinants. Thus, for each category, we will have $m$ likelihoods. For that purpose, you can use naive Bayesian classifier: $$ P(C=i|X_1, X_2, \dots, X_m) = \frac{P(C=i) \prod_{k=1}^{m} P(X_k|C=i)}{z} $$ where $$ z = \sum_{i=1}^{3}\left(P(C=i) \prod_{k=1}^{m} P(X_k|C=i)\right) $$
