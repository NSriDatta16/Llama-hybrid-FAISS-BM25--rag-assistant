Failing to read values from a file

The program below should read in a bunch of integers from a file and work out their average: #include "stdafx.h" #include #include #include using namespace std; int main( int argc, char** argv ) { ifstream fin( "mydata.txt" ); int i, value, sum = 0; for ( i = 0; fin >> value; i++ ) { sum += value; } if ( i > 0 ) { ofstream fout( "average.txt" ); fout The file mydata.txt exists in the same directory and contains 1 2 3 4 5 but the output is always: No list to average! What am I doing wrong that it always skips the calculation and output file generation parts? Thanks for your help, H
