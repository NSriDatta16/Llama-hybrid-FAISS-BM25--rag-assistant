Why do we use neural networks? Because they're simple to construct, and often appear to be a good approach to certain classes of problems, such as pattern recognition. Aren't there any more solutions that're more "suitable" for computers? Yes, implementations that more closely match a computer's architecture can be more suitable for the computer, but then can be less suitable for an effective solution. Why do we use the human brain as a model for inspiration for artifical intelligence? Because our brain is the superior example we have of something intelligent.
