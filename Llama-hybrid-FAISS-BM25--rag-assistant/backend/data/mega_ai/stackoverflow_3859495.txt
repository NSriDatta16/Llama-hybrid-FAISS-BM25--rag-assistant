Using AVG() function between two tables

I have two tables, and I need to determine the company that offers the highest average salary for any position. My tables are as follows: employer eID (primary key), eName, location position eID (primary key), pName (primary key), salary) The code I wrote determines all avg salaries that are higher than one, but I need to find only the highest average salary over all Here is my code so far: SQL> select eName 2 from Employer E inner join position P on E.eID = P.eID 3 where salary > (select avg(salary) from position); This outputs all salaries that are higher than the lowest average, but I need only the highest average. I tried using avg(salary) > (select avg(salary) from position) but I received the error that group function is not allowed. Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!
