Cheating in online games: Is it possible to prevent one Win32 process from inspecting/manipulating another's memory?

I play the online game World of Warcraft, which is plagued by automated bots that inspect the game's allocated memory in order to read game/player/world state information, which is used to mechanically play the game. They also sometimes write directly to the game's memory itself but the more sophisticated ones don't, as far as I know. The game's vendor, Blizzard Entertainment, has a separate application called Warden that it is supposed to detect and disable hacks and cheats like that, but it doesn't catch everything. Would it be possible to make a Windows application where you're the only one that can read the things you've read into memory? Would that be pragmatic to implement on a large C++ application that runs on millions of machines?
