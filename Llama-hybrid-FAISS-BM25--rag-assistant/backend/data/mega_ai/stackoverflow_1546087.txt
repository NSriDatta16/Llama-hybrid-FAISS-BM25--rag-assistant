How to check the cause for a HTTP request latency/waiting time?

I issue a simple GET request to my server, and it's coming back after ~1.2 seconds on average (using firebug NET tab, the "waiting for reqponse" part- not even the whole reponse time) My ping to the server is 0.250 Using Passenger with rails 2.3.3, in the rails log the request is taking ~0.023 My server is on GoDaddy, so I checked their homepage with firebug also- the "waiting for reqponse" time for their page is ~0.320 Worst case should be around 0.4... so where did I lose the other 0.8 seconds? What else can I check? Edit: Seems like it's unrelated to rails- An image request (that only apache responds to, doest hit the rails at all) takes ~1.2 seconds also
