I noticed in both of the functions called, you're trying to access localStorage. On OS5, the regular HTML5 localStorage isn't supported, only Google Gears methods. Are you using the html5_init.js in your project? Follow these instructions to add it. It is a Google Gears to HTML5 "converter" for OS5. That may not be your problem, but you'll need it anyway if you're writing a Webworks app that will work on both version of the OS.
