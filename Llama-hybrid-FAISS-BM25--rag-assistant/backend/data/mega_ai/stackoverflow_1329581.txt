ok. this is not guaranteed to work every time but something like this can work (and in the cases it wont you will have a conflicting changes anyway that has to be resolved): do your local branch do local-only change continue development when doing merge to the master: rebase -i master from your branch and move the local-only change to the END of the patch chain. resolve any conflicts in the process. If the local-only change is in the config files and you are not touching them in the regular development, then you will have no problems. If, otherwise, you do have a conflict, then this is a case when you actually change in the same area and it needs your attention to resolve anyway. check out master merge your local-branch -1: git merge local^ This will leave you with master having all the changes on the local except for the last one. If you have multiple local=only changes, I suggest you squash them together during rebase.
