If you really cannot change the character set that oracle will use then how about Base64 encoding your data before storing it in the database. That way, you can accept characters from any character set and store them as ISO-8859-1 (because Base64 will output a subset of the ASCII character set which maps exactly to ISO-8859-1). Base64 encoding will increase the length of the string by, on average, 37% If your data is only ever going to be displayed as HTML then you might as well store HTML entities as you suggested, but be aware that a single entity can be up to 10 characters per unencoded character e.g. Ï‘ is &thetasym;
