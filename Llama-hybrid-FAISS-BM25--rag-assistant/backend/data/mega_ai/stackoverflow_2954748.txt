I recommend reading this for a good explanation of null storage: How does SQL Server really store NULL-s . In short, the null/not null bit is stored in a different place, the null bitmap for the row. From the article: Each row has a null bitmap for columns that allow nulls. If the row in that column is null then a bit in the bitmap is 1 else it's 0. So while the actual values for 8 bit columns are stored in 1 byte, there are extra bits in the row's null bitmap that indicate if that column is NULL or not...so depends on how you're counting. To be completely accurate, 8 bit columns use 2 bytes , just split up in 2 different locations.
