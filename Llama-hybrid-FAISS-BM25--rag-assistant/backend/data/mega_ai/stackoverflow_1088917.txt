These are just HTML templates with ordinary view functions. This doesn't require much: Parameters come in from a form; write the query in the view function, passing the queryset to the template. The template presents the report. Why would you need something more than this? You can use generic list/detail views to save yourself from having to write as much code. If you go this route, you provide the query set and the template to a generic view that handles some of the processing for you. Since you must write the query in Crystal reports or Django, you're not really getting much leverage from a "reporting" tool.
