I have written many such examples myself but they are scattered and not organised and probably rarely read (one time the folks at avrfreaks borrowed something). StackOverflow might curb this but SO could in theory be used. Ask a question about boot code for an arm whatsit, then answer your own question with example code and text on how and why it works. The SO tags would be nice in that you could do a search on "boot" "arm" "embedded" and then one on "boot" "avr" "embedded", etc and get similar example programs for different platforms.
