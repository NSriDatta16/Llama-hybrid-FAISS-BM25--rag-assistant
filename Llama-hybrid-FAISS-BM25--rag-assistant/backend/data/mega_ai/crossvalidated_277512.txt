The main problem is the tolerance together with the terrible choice of priors (recall that ABC does not work as other MCMC methods since it is based on simulations from the priors). You need to reduce the tolerance_quantile in order to reduce the distance between simulated and observed summary statistics. See for instance (better tolerance): model.abc and (better tolerance and priors): model.abc
