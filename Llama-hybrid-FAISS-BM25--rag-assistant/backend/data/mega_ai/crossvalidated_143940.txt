A question on Bayesian updating (Han Solo and the Bayesian priors)

http://www.statslife.org.uk/the-statistics-dictionary/2148-han-solo-and-bayesian-priors in the preceding article, there is a bit of Bayesian updating that does not make sense to me. We have a prior probability (of Han Solo escaping the asteroid field) and the C3PO estimate of a probability that someone survives the field. they are somehow combined to yield a posterior probability (of Han surviving the field) now ... the way I understood the process of calculating a posterior, you'd need a prior $P(A)$, observe an event $E$, and use two conditionals $P(E|A)$ and $P(E|\not A)$ to calculate the posterior (or, perhaps, the ratio between these two conditionals) the question is: why is C3P0's estimate of the probability of a random person being used in this place? It seems you would need two conditionals, or a likelihood ratio, and C3P0's estimate is neither.
