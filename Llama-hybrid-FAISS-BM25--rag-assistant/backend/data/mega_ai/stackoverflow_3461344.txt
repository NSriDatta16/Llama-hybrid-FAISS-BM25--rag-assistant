I don't think there is an answer to this question, but I will weigh in anyways. Personally, I think that using absolute URLs is the best. The web is full of crappy content scrapers. Many of the people who wrote these scrapers forget to change the original URLs (in absolute links) before they post the content onto their own page. So, in that regard, absolute URLs can turn into a really dodgy way to get a couple extra links. If I follow that, it seems logical that absolute links would also be a great indicator of duplicate content caused by content scrapers. A couple of years ago, I did some research into what happens to a page's search rankings when you dramatically change content/navigation (ie - in the case of a dramatic re-design). At that point, I found that having absolute URLs seemed to spook Google a little less. But, there were some problems with my research: a) The 'absolute URL bonus' was barely quantifiable (an average of less than two positions of difference) b) The 'absolute URL bonus' only lasted a few weeks before Google settled down and started treating both pages the same c) The research is two years old and the Google algorithm has changed dramatically in that time When I add a and b together, I'm left with a very unsettled feeling. Google gets a little weird from time to time, so the bonus may have been a fluke that I attributed to absolute URLs. Good old experimental bias.....Either way though, the difference was so slight and lasted for such a short time that I don't think it is worth spending a whole lot of extra time making absolutes! Best of luck with your site Greg
