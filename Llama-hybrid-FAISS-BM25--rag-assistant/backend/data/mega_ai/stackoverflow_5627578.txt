python: library behavior on failed import

Is there any standard practice on how a library should behave, when certain module can't be imported? Should it just let an exception fly or should it rather catch it and exit elegantly with a proper information? For example I have something like this: try: from argparse import ArgumentParser except ImportError: print('fathom library requires python 3.2 or argparse package.') Is it better or worse?
