Simple random sampling, average as a parameter

In a forest of 100 Acre, let 10 (1 acre size) plots be the sample. Inside each plot, one took measurements of total trees and trees diameter. It is reasonable to think about the number of trees inside each plot (counts). However, in terms of tree diameter, it is reasonable to think about the average. The sum of all tree diameters of each plot would not end up with some value that is useful, however, its average would describe better each plot. The question itself is about if it is valid to calculate the sample error of a Simple Random Sampling like I have described but instead of using counts or sum (inside each plot) use the average of some variable (diameter in this case). PLOT Number of Trees Average Diameter (cm) 1 103 34.3 2 120 31.2 3 98 34.7 4 145 29.7 5 99 41.5 6 107 38.4 7 78 34.1 8 139 37.4 9 115 29.7 10 103 27.2 Another thing that I have noticed is that: If I take the SUM or the COUNT of some variable and summarize by plot, for example (Number of Trees) of the table, it will result the same as counting all the trees that I have measured (raw data). However, the average by plot is not the same as the total average (raw data). In this case, which one is the best estimation of the mean? The raw data average of some variable or the average of the averages (by plot)?
