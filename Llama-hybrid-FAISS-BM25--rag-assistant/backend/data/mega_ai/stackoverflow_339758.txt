I'd say most new web developers would be better off initially learning about HTTP specifically without muddying things with either classic ASP or ASP.NET. Once they have the fundamentals, then I'd suggest moving straight to ASP.NET and a compiled/object oriented coding language. While classic ASP is more compact and focused (smaller group of objects to grasp), most code written using it is unfortunately in VB-Script. Some of the most atrocious code I've ever seen was classic ASP web sites in VB-script. While it is probably possible to write maintainable and clear code in VB-Script, the language itself seems to almost encourage the complete opposite. Also, it sounds like ASP.NET MVC would be a better choice for your environment as it "hides" less about HTTP from the developer. For certain types of application it is a better choice then ASP.NET Web Forms. In summary: skip the classic ASP and avoid all of the bad habits and problems that it can introduce.
