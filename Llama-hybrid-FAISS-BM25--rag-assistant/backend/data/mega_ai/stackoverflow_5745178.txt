How are listproperty fields ordered in App Engine?

I am planning to store some data in a listproperty and want to be sure that the order of the items in the list remains the same when I query my entity back out. Is there such a guarantee when putting and getting data from the datastore? To be clear, I am not trying to order a set of results by anything in the listproperty, I just want to make sure that if I have a list of strings (for example: "Sam", "Alberto", "Rick"), they are always in that order when I access that entity. The answer to this question would imply that they do always stay the same, but I'd like to be sure: Use a ListProperty or custom tuple property in App Engine?
