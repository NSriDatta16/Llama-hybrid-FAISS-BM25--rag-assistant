First, you need to reshape the input for 1D-CNN then you can continue to model as follow: cnn_input = Input(shape(?, ?)) x1 = Conv1D(32, 5, padding='same', activation='relu')(cnn_input) x2 = Conv1D(32, 3, padding='same', activation='relu')(cnn_input) x3 = Conv1D(32, 2, padding='same', activation='relu')(cnn_input) concat_layer = keras.layers.concatenate()([x1,x2,x3]) After taking the input and apply 1D CNN like this, you can continue to your model as a adding new CNN layers or Reshape the concat_layer for LSTM and give as an input to it.
