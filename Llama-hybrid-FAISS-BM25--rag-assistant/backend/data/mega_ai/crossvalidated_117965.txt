Regarding Question issue #1: Maybe you could try to do seasonal adjustment before you estimate an ARIMA model. I am not sure if it would help, but you could at least try. For example, non-parametric seasonal adjustment procedure such as STL in R. Regarding Question issue #4: If you have an ACF graph with confidence intervals marked, it is no surprise that one or a few of the autocorrelation bars are sticking out (not fitting inside the interval). This can happen due to pure chance even if there is no aucorrelation in population. Here is why: if you have a 90% confidence interval, then on average you may expect 10% (=100%-90%) of the bars in your graph to stick out of the confidence interval when the null hypothesis of no autocorrelation at any lags holds. That is "built in" the definition of a confidence interval.
