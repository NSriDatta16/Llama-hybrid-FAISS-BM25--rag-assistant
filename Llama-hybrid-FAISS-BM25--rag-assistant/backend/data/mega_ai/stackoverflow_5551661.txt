Task::Kensho is usually where I start. Its an actively maintained list of recommended modules and its on a monthly release schedule. The group of people maintaining it seem fairly organized and are very active in the community so I think it is a pretty accurate reflection of whats currently considered "good" in the Perl community. Obviously it doesn't cover every possible topic and the whole thing is at least somewhat subjective, but I still think its useful.
