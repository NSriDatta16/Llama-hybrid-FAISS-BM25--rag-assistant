The problem was caused by the addition of the Unit Test Bundle to the project. To ensure that tests were built and run along with the main project, I had dragged the Unit Tests target into the main project Target. By default, it had assigned the Unit Test Bundle to be built against the iPhone Device 3.1.2 SDK rather than the simulator. Also, the Unit Test Bundle had an auto-generated .plist file which contained the default Bundle Identifier of com.yourcompany...etc. So despite specifying a target which I knew had a default SDK of the iPhone Simulator 3.1.2, the inclusion of the Unit Test Bundle caused the error to keep appearing. Selecting 'Get Info' for the Unit Test bundle, select the Build tab and set the Base SDK to iPhone Simulator 3.1.2 and all will be well.
