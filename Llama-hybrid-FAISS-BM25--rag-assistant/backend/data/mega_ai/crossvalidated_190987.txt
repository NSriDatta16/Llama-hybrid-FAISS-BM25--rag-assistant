Suitable test for determining the change in average

I have faced several schools of thoughts for determining the mean change. I'll discuss the solutions starting with the simplest one but first I want to provide you with an example data: site year2011 year2012 1 site 1 14 64 2 site 2 22 44 3 site 3 104 148 4 site 4 242 314 5 site 5 48 68 6 site 6 158 206 7 site 7 126 150 8 site 8 244 288 9 site 9 356 514 10 site 10 264 298 11 site 11 144 184 12 site 12 246 310 13 site 13 64 84 The data above are collected for a total of 13 locations twice- first in 2011 and second time in 2012. The numbers indicate concentrations of an element in the air. The aim is to conclude whether overall there has been a mean change of the element's concentration after a year. First approach: This approach takes the average (& standard deviation) for all sites (n=13) in 2011 and 2012, which are 156 (sd:107) and 206 (sd:135), respectively. If we take 95% confidence interval i.e. 2*sd/square root of n; then we get 156+/-59 for 2011 and 206+/-75 for 2012. Since the deviations from the mean of the two surveys overlap, the conclusion is that the mean concentration of the element haven't not change over a year. Second approach: This approach adopt paired t-test based on the assumption that surveys were done at the same locations at different times. Paired t-test (I used t.test function of R programming language) gives a p-value here Paired t-test data: a$year2011 and a$year2012 t = -4.8569, df = 12, p-value = 0.0003936 alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 95 percent confidence interval: -71.31598 -27.14556 sample estimates: mean of the differences -49.23077 Third approach: This approach similarly relies on t-test but its called 'Welch Two Sample t-test'. The assumption here: although the same sites were investigated one year apart they were measuring the concentrations from different samples (because air moves) i.e. the locations/sites are fixed but the measurements were done in two different samples. Paired t-test should be performed on the same sample (needs to be dependent). This approach requires the use of equations here and the final result (below) shows a p-value > 0.05 indicating the mean concentration of the element didn't change significantly! This test supports the simplest (first) approach. Welch Two Sample t-test data: a$year2011 and a$year2012 t = -1.0295, df = 22.769, p-value = 0.3141 alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 95 percent confidence interval: -148.21209 49.75055 sample estimates: mean of x mean of y 156.3077 205.5385 My question is: which approach of determining mean change in concentration is the most suitable for the given problem and why not the other approaches?
