Regardless of the minor difference in memory storage, using Boolean for true/false yes/no values is important for developers (including yourself, when you have to revisit the code a year later), because it more accurately reflects your intent. Making your code more understandable is much more important than saving two bytes. Making your code more accurately reflect your intent also reduces the likelihood that some compiler optimisation will have a negative effect. This advice transcends platforms and compilers.
