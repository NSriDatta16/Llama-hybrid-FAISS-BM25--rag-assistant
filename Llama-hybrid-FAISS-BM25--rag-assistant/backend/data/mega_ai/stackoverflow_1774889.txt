Cobertura ant script is missing Log4J classes

I tried to get Cobertura running inside my ant script, but I'm stuck right at the beginning. When I try to insert the cobertura taskdef I'm missing the Log4J libraries. Ant properties & classpath My ant target I think I did everything like it is described in the Cobertura documentation but I get this Ant build error BUILD FAILED build.xml:95: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/apache/log4j/Logger Inside the ${cobertura.dir} there is the lib directory with all files. I unzipped it from the cobertura distribution ZIP directly into that directory. Am I missing a step? Something wrong with my configuration so far?
