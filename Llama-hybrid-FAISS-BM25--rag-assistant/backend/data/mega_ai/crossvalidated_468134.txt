I think there may be a confusion in your reasonning. When you write that $X = \sum_i \pi_i \mathcal{N}(\mu^X_i, \Sigma^X_i)$ you actually mean that the density of $X$ is a weighted average of normal densities : $f_X = \sum_i \pi_i \varphi_{\mu^X_i, \Sigma^X_i}$ . But when you write that $Z = X + Y$ you mean that the random variable $Z$ is the sum of $X$ and $Y$ (thus the density of $Z$ is the convolution product of the densities of $X$ and $Y$ ) When you write that $Z = \sum_i \sum_j \pi_i \phi_j (\mathcal{N}(\mu^X_i, \Sigma^X_i) + \mathcal{N}(\mu^Y_j, \Sigma^Y_j))$ the two uses of the summation are mixed. The $\sum_i ...$ refers to the summation of densities when the " $+$ " between the $\mathcal{N}(...)$ refers to summation of random variables (and could be replaced by a convolution product). So, from $Z = \sum_i \sum_j \pi_i \phi_j (\mathcal{N}(\mu^X_i, \Sigma^X_i) + \mathcal{N}(\mu^Y_j, \Sigma^Y_j))$ you get that, if the mixtures components of X and Y are independent , $$Z = \sum_i \sum_j \pi_i \phi_j (\mathcal{N}(\mu^X_i + \mu^Y_j, \Sigma^X_i + \Sigma^Y_j)$$ which is a mixture with $N^2$ components, and $\sum_i \pi_i \phi_i =1$ so all is good. So a sum of mixture of gaussian is a mixture of gaussians if the sum of any component of $X$ and any component of $Y$ is still gaussian. In particular, this is the case when there are independent.
