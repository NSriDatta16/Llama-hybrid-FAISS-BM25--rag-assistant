This error was due to a hardware problem. A hard drive failed and for some reason the RAID didn't cover us correctly. "bad gang" means "check your hardware" to me now. A related (or maybe the real one) problem: Check your gp_vmem_protect_limit setting. Ours was too high, and I was using up all of the machine's swap space in my query.
