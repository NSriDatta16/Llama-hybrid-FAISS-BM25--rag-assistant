How do I average statistics from two different groups?

1 in 100 men and 1 in 300 women have some type of red-green colorblindness. Assuming the population is 50% men and 50% women, what is the average rate of red-green colorblindness? I assume that because it’s 50/50, I would simply take the arithmetic mean? $$\frac{\frac{1}{100} + \frac{1}{300}}{2} = 1/150 \approx 0.66\%$$ Or do I add each part? $$\frac{1}{100} \& \frac{1}{300} = \frac{2}{400} = 0.5\%$$ What would happen if it weren’t 50/50, for example, 40/60?
