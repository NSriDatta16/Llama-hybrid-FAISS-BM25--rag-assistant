How can I best convert an AS1/AS2 application to an ActionScript3 application?

I have a program consisting of multiple SWF's. An AS2-SWF loads a bunch of AS1-SWFs. It's a crappy program. I'd like to specify the GUI in MXML and perhaps refactor some code to AS3. However, converting all of the 300+ symbols to AS3 or whatever is undoable. What are my options in converting to AS3/Flex/MXML? The app is very simple, only also quite large. It consists only of buttons, backgrounds and attention-texts. All the button texts are in XML files. I want to turn this into pretty code ASAP but also controlled so the code becomes: easily updateable/maintainable, readable learnable (so I can have the updating done by someone that can only script AS3 or even MXML). Of course doing this is on my own initiative, if it'll take more than a week, I won't be able to find the time. Regards, Jurgen
