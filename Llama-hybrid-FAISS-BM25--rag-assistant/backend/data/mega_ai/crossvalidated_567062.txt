Subtracting mean from time series in AR(1) process

In Cryer and Chan the book Timer Series with Application in R . We find the following piece. Consider the first-order autoregressive process, abbreviated AR(1), in detail. Assume the series is stationary and satisfies. $Y_{t} = \phi Y_{t - 1} + e_{t}$ Where $e_{t}$ is a white noise process. We assume that the process mean has been subtracted out so that the series mean is zero. I don't understand what this means. Does this implicitly imply the following logic? $Y_{t} = \phi Y_{t - 1} + e_{t} - \mu + \mu$ Suppose that: $W_{t} = \phi W_{t - 1} + e_{t} + \mu$ and that: $X_{t} = W_{t} - \mu = \phi W_{t - 1} + e_{t} - \mu + \mu$ In this case, the time series $Y_{t}$ is stochastically equal to the following time series $X_{t}$ . Am I correct?
