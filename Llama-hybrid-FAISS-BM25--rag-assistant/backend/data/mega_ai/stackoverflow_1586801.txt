The easiest way to do this is to use jQuery to send an $.ajax (or $.post or $.get) to each script, retrieving the result from each of them and doing what you will with the results. $(document).ready( function(){ $('#mySubmitButton').click(function(){ //Send data to the email script $.post( 'send-email.php', $('form').serialize(), function(data, textStatus) { //data is the result from the script alert(data); }); //Send data to the other script $.post( 'my-other-script.php', $('form').serialize(), function(data, textStatus) { //data is the result from the script alert(data); }); }); }); update: The serialize command is the data that is being sent. Take a look at the jQuery serialize function. It basically just takes the various inputs, selects, textareas, checkboxes, etc in your form, and puts them into a string like this: myNameInput=john&active=on&whateverSelected=3 It's just a string of your form element names and their values. That is what is sent to the external script via the ajax command. A side note, when doing serialize, make sure that all your form elements have a name attribute, not just an id . The serialize doesn't pay any attention to their id's . Only their name .
