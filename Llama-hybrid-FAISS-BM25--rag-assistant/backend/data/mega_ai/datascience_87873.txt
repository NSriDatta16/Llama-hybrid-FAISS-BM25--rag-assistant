The wording of the question is a bit vague, but I believe the machine learning term you are looking for is transfer learning , which is essentially recycling a previously trained model while adding new data. This is a common technique for data scientists to take advantage of existing models (oftne created by groups with much more data and resources, such as Google) and customizing it for their own specific use-case. For example, taking an existing, general NLP model and training it to work better on StackExchange comments. Depending on the problem, there are other concepts like lifelong learning and continual learning, but transfer learning is a better starting point for someone new to ML.
