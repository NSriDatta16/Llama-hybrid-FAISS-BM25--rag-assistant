Laplace Approximation of Gaussian Classifier step clarification

I'm reading Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning (Rasmussen and Williams) and trying to understand an equation. In chapter 3 section 4 they're going over the derivation of the Laplace Approximation for a binary Gaussian Process classifier. $\mathbf{f}^{\text{new}} = \mathbf{f} - (\nabla \nabla \Psi)^{-1}\nabla \Psi = \mathbf{f} + (K^{-1} + W)^{-1}(\nabla \log p(\mathbf{y} \mid \mathbf{f} ) - K^{-1}\mathbf{f}) $ $= (K^{-1} + W)^{-1}(W\mathbf{f} + \nabla \log p(\mathbf{y} \mid \mathbf{f} ) ) \tag{3.18}$ Now, I see where they went from step 1 to step 2 using equations $\text{3.13}$ and $\text{3.14}$ since we have $ \nabla \Psi(f) = \nabla \log p(\mathbf{y} \mid \mathbf{f} ) - K^{-1}\mathbf{f} \tag{3.13}$ and $ \nabla \nabla \Psi(f) = \nabla \nabla \log p(\mathbf{y} \mid \mathbf{f} ) - K^{-1} = -W - K^{-1}\tag{3.14}$ So step 2 replaces $\nabla \Psi(f)$ and $\nabla \nabla \Psi(f) $ and pulls out the negative it looks like but I don't get where $\mathbf{f}$ disappeared to in the next step. Any help would be great, thanks.
