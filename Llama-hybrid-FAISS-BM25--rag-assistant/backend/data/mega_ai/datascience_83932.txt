Determining whether a Machine Learning model is overfitted with regard to the stability of the features

I need to know how would I get to know if I have overfitted my Machine Learning model on the train data. The performance metric I have used is Logistic Loss. Does the stability of the features affect the performance of my model? If yes, how do they relate?
