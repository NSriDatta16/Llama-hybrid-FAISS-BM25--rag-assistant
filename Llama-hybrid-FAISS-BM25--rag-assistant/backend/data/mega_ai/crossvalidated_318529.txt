Why do multilevel models not incorporate a concept of 'cross-level covariance'?

Multilevel models (aka hierarchical linear models, mixed models, etc.) incorporating random slopes can entail unstructured variance-covariance matrices decomposing level-specific heterogeneity into portions attributable to variables with random slopes and to the joint distributions of those variables with one another, and with level-specific outcomes. For example, in the two-level random slopes model of individuals $i$ nested within populations $j$ $$\hat{y}_{ij} = \beta_{0ij} + \beta_{xij}x_{ij} + \beta_{zj}z_{j},$$ where: $$\beta_{0ij} = \beta_{0} + \varepsilon_{0ij} + \mu_{0j}\\ \beta_{xij} = \beta_{x} + \varepsilon_{xij}\\ \beta_{zj} = \beta_{z} + \mu_{zj},$$ and where: $$\begin{eqnarray*} \left[\begin{array}{c} \varepsilon_{0ij}\\ \varepsilon_{xij}\end{array}\right] & \sim & \mathcal{N}\left(0,\Omega_{\varepsilon}\right):\Omega_{\varepsilon} = \left[\begin{array}{cc} \sigma^{2}_{\varepsilon 0} &\\ \sigma_{\varepsilon 0x} & \sigma^{2}_{\varepsilon x} \\ \end{array}\right]\\ \\ \left[\begin{array}{c} \mu_{0j}\\ \mu_{zj}\end{array}\right] & \sim & \mathcal{N}\left(0,\Omega_{\mu}\right):\Omega_{\mu} = \left[\begin{array}{cc} \sigma^{2}_{\mu 0} &\\ \sigma_{\mu 0z} & \sigma^{2}_{\mu z} \\ \end{array}\right] \end{eqnarray*} $$ heteroscedastic variance at the individual level is decomposed into individual intercept variance $\left(\sigma^{2}_{\varepsilon 0}\right)$, variance contributed by $x_{ij}$ $\left(\sigma^{2}_{\varepsilon x}\right)$, and a covariance between individual-level $y_{ij}$ and $x_{ij}$ $\left(\sigma_{\varepsilon 0 x}\right)$. Likewise, heteroscedastic variance at the population level is decomposed into population intercept variance $\left(\sigma^{2}_{\mu 0}\right)$, variance contributed by the population-level predictor $z_{j}$ $\left(\sigma^{2}_{\mu z}\right)$, and a covariance between population-level average $\hat{y}_{j}$ and $z_{j}$ $\left(\sigma_{\mu 0 x}\right)$. † A positive population-level covariance $\sigma_{\mu 0 x}$ means that populations with higher values of $z$ are more likely to also have higher population-level intercepts $\left(\beta_{0} + \sigma^{2}_{\mu 0}\right)$. A positive individual-level covariance $\sigma_{\varepsilon 0 x}$ means that individuals with higher values of $x$ are more likely to also have higher individual-level intercepts $\left(\beta_{0} + \sigma^{2}_{\varepsilon 0}\right)$. Question: Does it make sense to think about 'cross-level covariance'? For example, imagine a term $\sigma_{\varepsilon\mu xz}$ with an interpretation along the lines of 'A positive cross-level covariance $\sigma_{\varepsilon \mu x z}$ means that individuals with higher values of $x$ are more likely to be nested within populations that have higher values of $z$.' Is this crazy? Is it already somehow captured in the model above, and I am just not interpreting it? I'm probably crazy. † I am aware that lots of folks approach multilevel models without the conceptual framework in place that recognizes that individual-level heteroscedastic variance can likewise be decomposed in multilevel models. Lots of statistical software that is fine modeling complex variance at higher levels does not offer a means of doing so at the lowest level (i.e. level 1), but some statistical software can estimate such models (e.g., MLwiN, JAGS, etc.).
