Code design question: Is using [self view]; or [self window]; a bad practice?

It has come to my attention that if one calls [self view]; or [self window]; within, respectively, an init method of NSViewController or NSWindowController, then all the IBOutlets become available right there in the init method. Would you regard it a bad programming practice to do so? For NSWindowController, I suppose it's better to use the "windowDidLoad" method to guarantee the outlets are connected. But what about NSViewController?
