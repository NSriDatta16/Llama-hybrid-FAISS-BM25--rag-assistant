Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) is a widely accepted standard for evaluating the distance between image distributions. The exact details are available from the original paper , but to make a long story short, you pass all the images through a pretrained neural network (usually a standard "Inception" network, hence the name) and they're all encoded into some $k$ -dimensional vector. Then you fit two separate $k$ -dimensional gaussian distributions to each set of images accordingly, and measure their Fréchet distance, which, for gaussian distributions, has a closed form $||\mu_0 - \mu_1||_2^2 + \text{tr}(\Sigma_0 + \Sigma_1 - 2(\Sigma_0\Sigma_1)^{1/2})$ .
