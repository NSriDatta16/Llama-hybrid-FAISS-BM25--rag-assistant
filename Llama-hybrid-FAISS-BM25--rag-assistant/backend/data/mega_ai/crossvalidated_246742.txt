I'm still not entirely sure on exactly what you're asking, but I think this might address it. I'm going to let $k_i$ denote the representer of $x_i$ in our Hilbert space $\mathcal H$ (so $k_i = \phi(x_i)$). We know that $$ f = \sum_i \alpha_i y_i k_i $$ is the function that is normal to our hyperplane (this is our $w$, but I'm using $f$ to emphasize that it is a function). Computing the norm: $$ \vert \vert f \vert \vert^2_\mathcal H = \int \left( \sum_i \alpha_i y_i k_i(z) \right)^2 dz = \sum_{ij} \alpha_i\alpha_j y_i y_j \int k_i(z) k_j(z) dz $$ $$ = \sum_{ij} \alpha_i\alpha_j y_i y_j \langle k_i, k_j \rangle = \sum_{ij} \alpha_i\alpha_j y_i y_j K(x_i, x_j) $$ so if $K$ is the linear kernel we have that $$ \vert \vert f \vert \vert^2_\mathcal H = \sum_{ij} \alpha_i\alpha_j y_i y_j x_i^T x_j = w^T w. $$ Does that help?
