If the arrays are larger than can be stored in your computer's RAM, then, obviously, you should store part of the array or its entirety on disk. For this purpose, you can use a database. Now that you don't want to install a server, you can use an embedded database such as HSQLDB. You can configure HSQLDB to delete all data when your application terminates or to retain them for future use. An alternative is to use a custom Map implementation that flushes the data to secondary storage whenever its size increases more than a threshold defined by you. For this purpose, multiple strategies are available: FIFO, LIFO, LRU, etc. Also whenever you need to access a certain element of the map, again you can load a bulk of adjacent elements from the disk (or again, use a strategy that is more appropriate for your use case) to reduce excessive disk I/O.
