Nothing it is a regular compiler. Its primary reason for creation was to create a platform for compiler research. Therefore it is designed to be very modular so that you can work on that part of the compiler that deals with your research and not have to worry about other parts of the compiler. There is no dragon compiler just as there is no LLVM book(any theory you read in the dragon book or any other compiler book should be directly applicable). In fact while I haven't looked in on LLVM in a while their documentation was pretty poor.
