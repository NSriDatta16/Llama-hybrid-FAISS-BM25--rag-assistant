Clustered standard errors and multi-level models

Stata allows estimating clustered standard errors in models with fixed effects but not in models random effects? Why is this? By clustered standard errors, I mean clustering as done by stata's cluster command (and as advocated in Bertrand, Duflo and Mullainathan). By fixed effects and random effects, I mean varying-intercept. I have not considered varying slope.
