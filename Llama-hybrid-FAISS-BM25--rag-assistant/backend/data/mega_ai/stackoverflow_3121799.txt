Automated testing of C++ console app in Visual Studio by sending text files to stdin?

I am going to take part in a coding contest my University is organizining next week. I am only allowed to use C or C++ and I would prefer to use the latter one using Visual Studio 2010. For every task there is a text input provided as plaintext to stdin, for example: 200 100 10 2 11 I need a tool which would assist me with running my code with some pre-defined text file as stdin input. On a unix-based system I would just use something like: gcc mycode.cpp ./mycode.o result1.out diff result1.out test1.out Is there any way to reach this in Visual Studio 2010. Or maybe one could recommend a nice C++ IDE with rich debugging functions which would have something like this "out of the box"? With best regards, Alexander.
