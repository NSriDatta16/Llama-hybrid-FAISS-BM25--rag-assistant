Examples of interventions changing the Population distribution of a system

When learning about the Datasets of naturally occuring systems you encounter distributions, for example power law distributions in the domain of population sizes of cities. In my understanding this usually reflects a simple functionality of the system you are sampling.(domain specific that means lots of cities form in small sizes and the likelihood of them getting increasingly bigger decreases exponentially). This is accordingly reflected in the simulations of those systems. Sticking to that domain example political influences on population sizes usually only change the behaviour by ,for example a constant factor(omitting taxes to promote a certain growth), or change behaviour at one end of the spectrum (charging additional taxes to second homes in big cities). Are there examples of interventions in systems that completely change the distribution to another? (for example power law to Erlang distribution, or vice versa) I don't have a specific domain in mind but I wanted to know if that happens at all. I try to establish a simulation framework, and asked myself the question of what changes to the system can occur. As distributions often determine which statistical values are significant (averages do not tell a sufficient story when describing power law distributions) I wanted to know if I have to expect distributions to change in a system due to an intervention.
