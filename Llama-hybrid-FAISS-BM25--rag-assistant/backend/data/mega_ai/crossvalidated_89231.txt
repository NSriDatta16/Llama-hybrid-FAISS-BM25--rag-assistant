Edit: Time to add details, I think. The OP has long since worked it out but hasn't taken the invitation to write up a more complete solution, so I shall, in the interest of having a full answer to the question. A pivot is a function of the data and the statistic whose distribution doesn't depend on the value of the statistic. So consider: (1) what would the distribution of a statistic consisting of the sum of the observations ( $T=\sum_i x_i$ ) be? A sum of $n$ i.i.d. $\text{gamma}(\alpha,\theta)$ random variables has the $\text{gamma}(n\alpha,\theta)$ distribution (for the shape-rate form of the gamma). Here $n=6$ and $\alpha=2$ , so the sum, $T$ has a $\text{gamma}(12,\theta)$ distribution. (2) Note that the distribution in (1) does depend on $\theta$ and the form of the statistic doesn't . You need to modify the statistic ( $Q=f(T,\theta)$ ) in such a way that both of those change. (This part is trivial!) Let $Q=T/\theta$ . Then $Q\sim \text{gamma}(12,1)$ . $Q$ satisfies the conditions required for a pivotal quantity. (3) Once you have a pivotal quantity (i.e. $Q$ ), write down an interval for the pivotal quantity (in the form of a pair of inequalities, $a ) with the given coverage. Since the distribution doesn't depend on the parameter, this interval is always the same (at a given sample size) no matter what the value of $\theta$ . One such interval is $(a,b)$ , where $P(a , when $a$ is the 0.025 point of the $\text{gamma}(12,1)$ distribution and $b$ is the 0.975 point. (4) Now write the interval involving the pivotal quantity back in terms of the data and $\theta$ . Back out an interval for the parameter, for which the corresponding probability statement must still hold (keeping in mind that the random quantity is not $\theta$ but the interval). $P(a implies $P(1/b , so $P(T/b . Therefore $(T/b,T/a)$ is a 95% interval for $\theta$ . Our observed total, $t = 4.91$ . The 0.025 point of a gamma(12,1) is 6.2006 and the 0.975 point is 19.682. Hence a 95% interval for $\theta$ is (4.91/19.682,4.91/6.200) = $(0.249, 0.792)$ .
