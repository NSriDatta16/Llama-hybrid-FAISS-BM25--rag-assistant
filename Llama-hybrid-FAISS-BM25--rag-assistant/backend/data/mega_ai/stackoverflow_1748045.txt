What you are looking at is a Multidimensional Array. You would typically use these for organizing your data into groups and subgroups. I personally tend to avoid going much farther than a few levels in order to avoid unnecessary complexity. If you were to var_export your array var_export($nv) you should be able to see the structure of the array when you execute your code. In order to expand your knowledge I would highly recommend taking a good look at the PHP Documentation on arrays to avoid any confusion/misconceptions.
