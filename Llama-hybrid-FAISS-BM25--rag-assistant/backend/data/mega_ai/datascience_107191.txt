Workflow for stock prediction in machine learning

I'm trying to find the best workflow for a stock prediction problem. My idea goes as follows : I will use a classfication and a regression at the same time Classification (-1 ; 0 ; 1) Regression (float) => I will classify the output in the end just like the classification to make a decision (if the float number is really close to 0, it will be a zero for me) The pipeline of the classification and regression will be the same: Data engineer with X (increase X with moving averages, Z score, lags etc of the current X) Remove outliers from X Scale X Split (train, validate, predict) => ex(if length of all data is 120 : train = 118, validate = 1 , predict = 1) Calculate important features to reduce dataset => Question 1 : Feature importance should be done on train or validate ? I think train Remove colinearity from the selected features (using VIF) Tunning parameters => Question 2 : Apply on train or validate ? Train in my opinion Question 3 : Where I can use the validation in this case if the length is 1 ? I think I'm missing something. Of course I will run a backtest on this framework, but I want be sure that in term of biais I'm not violating something or something else. If you got any ressources or something else, please share
