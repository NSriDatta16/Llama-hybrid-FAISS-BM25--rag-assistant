You could walk along each point (Pa) of LineString A and measure the distance from Pa to the nearest line-segment of LineString B, averaging each of these distances. This is not a quick or perfect method, but should be able to give use a useful number and is pretty quick to implement. Do the line strings start and finish at similar points, or are they of very different extents?
