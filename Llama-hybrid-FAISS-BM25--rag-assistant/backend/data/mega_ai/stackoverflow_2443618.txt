html scrollable tab bar - make a td continue on the next row when it overflows the screen

What I'm trying to achieve is a scrollable tab-bar. I have a web page with multiple tabs. The "tab" control it's just an html table, with a single row, in which each tab is a td. The page has way over 10 tabs, an the tabs no longer fit in the screen. I'd like to have the tabs scroll, or at least continue on the following row (something like a word-wrap effect) or any other means so as to have as many tabs as I need, without worrying about the screen size... thanks a lot saludos sas ps: maybe I should be using a table, but rather just a paragraph, with each tab side by side...
