Join a Flat Table to an EAV Table with Magento?

I am trying to manke an Adminhtml Grid which joins a table that I made called "facility" to "customer_entity" and all of its attribtues. I'm noticing that since my table is flat, and the model inherits fomr Mage_Core_Model_Mysql4_Collection_Abstract, I'm not able to use all the class_methods that I've seen as examples on the backend. I've successfully been able to join my table to the customer_entity table doing the following: $collection = Mage::getModel('facility/facility')->getCollection() ->join('customer/entity', 'customer_id = entity_id'); However, what I really need is just to get the customer name. Any help?
