Reasonable to remove TestContext from a unit test?

All my unit test classes have been created by Visual Studio 2008 from a built-in unit test template that includes a "TestContext" property. So far I have not used a test context and this field is upsetting Resharper and code coverage. Is it ok to remove TestContext or would doing that indicate my unit tests are poorly structured?
