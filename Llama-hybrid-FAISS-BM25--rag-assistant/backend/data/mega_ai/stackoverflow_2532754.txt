Let's compare the two. What is common? Both are open source, follow MVC architecture and has a servlet based front controller. Advantages of Spring MVC Extension of Struts. View can be developed using JSP and HTML. You can also plugin other's like PHP or velocity. Has large number of controllers predefined. Integrated out of the box with Spring framework. Advantages of Seam Extension of JSF View can be developed using JSF component library. There are large number of vendors to choose from. Integrates JPA entities with Web layer Annotation based validation Integrates with EJB 3.0 Out the box jBPM support which provides process flow definitions. Integrates with Drools where you can define web layer business rules. Good community support. Conclusion Since Seam is built on JSF, it has large number of UI Component libraries to pick from. It reuses Java EE stack better. It has lot of interesting modules integrated beforehand. Spring MVC is built on top of Struts and Spring, so it will reuse Spring framework stack far better than others. But the view is built using JSP, so we have to rely on JSP tag library vendors to build rich components. Seam framework would be a better choice as Spring framework is anyway extensible enough to be leveraged by Seam.
