I've been asked to tutor Pascal to a kid. Despite never seen Pascal before I did manage to get a tutorial and I now know enough to teach him. I am writing you guys to see if anyone can point me out some basic exercises that involve simple algorithms, Something like: Sort this array, find the average, etc... It can be in any language, I just need to find some exercises so he can work out.
