Agree with most of the users. I tend to use primarily the # Way 1 class Foo def self.bar puts 'class method' end end There are some small differences, if I recall correctly, that are shown on the Pragmatic Programmers Metaprogramming talks (which I recommend), which relate to how the class code is called and executed. They were quite small, though and mostly things we won't have to deal with on a normal basis. Will see if I can check them out and post it.
