Agree with you about that method, and the fact that you would expect it to allow what you say. Another option would be Join p = t.join(Team_.players); t.fetch(Team_.players); c.select(t).where(cb.equal(p.get(Player_.age), age)); i.e do a join() , add a fetch() for it, and then make use of the join. This is illogical and only adds to the inelegant nature of JPA Criteria, but anyway, ought to be a workaround
