When should you balance a time series dataset?

I'm training a machine learning algorithm to classify up/down trends in a time series and I'm using an imbalanced feature set. It seems necessary to balance the data since the algorithm could learn a bias towards a particular trend, but this comes at the cost of a non-representative dataset. Should I balance my data? And if so, is random undersampling the right method?
