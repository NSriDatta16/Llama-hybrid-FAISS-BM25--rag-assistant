I think you need to be teaching them a popular Data Science language like Python or R. Excel is not going to help them in a real job, and isn't practical for data science purposes. I would probably say Python would be most valuable to them in the long run, and with packages like scikit-learn your regressions and classifications can be demonstrated in very few lines of code which they can read and understand more easily. It is not always easy to understand what R is doing by just reading it. Another word of advice: Don't waste time forcing your students to set up an IDE and download the necessary packages, if you use python create a virtual environment for them with all the necessary packages, and set up an IDE like pycharm(they can get this and most other IDEs under a student/academic license) where then can develop and run their code through UI rather than console which they may find daunting and confusing. If you go down the R route then make sure you have an IDE like RStudio set up for them and make sure all of the includes and package installs are either included in your example code or fully described.
