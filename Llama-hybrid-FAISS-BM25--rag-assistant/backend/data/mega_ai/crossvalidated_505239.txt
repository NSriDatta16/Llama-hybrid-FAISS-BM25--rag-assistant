Data dimension in machine learning

I am working on Ml project and I Have 4-d dataset. I wanted to use dimensionality reduction algoritm And suddenly a question made me stop Here is my dilemma Is there difference between dimension definition in mathematics and machine learning word? For example if i have variable. Like 5×60000×900×300. In mathematics, i say i have 4-D data or 4 dimensional data. And in each dimension we have different size. For example in 1st dimension i have size of 5 And in machine learning What we say? Is our data's dimension is 4? If yes, so by using dimensionality reduction algorithm we convert this data to a new 2-D data?? Or no As i understand in dimensionality reduction algorithm, we try to reduce the size i.e. Some thing like Reduce 9000 to 50 in a data of 9000×60. So how can we explain this in a 4-d matrix like previous example of 4-d data 5×60000×900×300
