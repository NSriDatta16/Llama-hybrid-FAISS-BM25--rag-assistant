Dump all the vertices in an array, then do unique(sort(array)) . This should be O(k n log(n)), where k is the average number of triangles that share a vertex, usually k The only caveat I can think of is that your unique function should be able to take a pointer to a comparison function, since you probably want to consider your vertices equal if distance(vertex1, vertex2) but that seems to be OK .
