Drag the image into Xcode and then set up an UIImage variable like this: UIImage *theImage = [UIImage imageNamed:@"theImage.png"]; then implement it into your UIImage view by 'myImageView.image = theImage; Make sure you have IBOutlet set up to your image view, though. The easiest way is to just drag the image into Xcode and select it under the popup list in Interface Builder.
