I really feel as though there must be some elegant trick or util for automatically performing this casting operation. I don't think you will find one. If you had a large number of type alternatives (i.e. 20 or more), it might make sense to do a hash table lookup on value.getClass() to give you a instance of some "setter" object. But you'd need to write a lot of boilerplate code ... so that doesn't count as elegant, IMO. Reflection is also an option, but its expensive and introduces more potential runtime failure modes. Besides, I don't actually see how it would help much in this particular case.
