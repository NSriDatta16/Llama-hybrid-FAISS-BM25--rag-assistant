How to split tool windows on right vertically again?

In Visual Studio 2008 I somehow dragged around my tool windows so that now Solution Explorer Database Explorer Class Explorer Properties are all in one long vertical tool window on the side. Now matter how I move them around, undock, unhide, hide, dock them, I can't get them back to how they were. What do I have to do so that: Solution Explorer Database Explorer Class explorer are on the top half on the right, and: Properties is on the bottom half?
