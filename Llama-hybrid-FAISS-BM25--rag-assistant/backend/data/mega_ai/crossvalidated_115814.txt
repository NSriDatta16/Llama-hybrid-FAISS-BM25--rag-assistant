I see no reasons why machine learning wouldn't be applicable in this setting. The main issue here is to define the right set of features to use, what usually requires a good degree of familiarity with the problem and some expert knowledge. Just reading your explanation was not enough to make me understand how to use the "gradient and relative time to minima" to perform classification, but clearly your features will be something derived from them. Some random thoughts which occur me: Rotate the curves to put them over the x-axis and possibly normalize your data (if you rescaled a curve, would you still be able to classify it?). Use polynomial regression to fit the curves (visually it seems fitting a Gaussian would be well enough). Use the coefficients of you fitted Gaussian as features. Use the 1st and 2nd derivatives of your Gaussian as features. In summary, the answer for your question is "yes", ML will probably tackle your problem. Though your have to spend some time in the data preparation and feature engineering phases to achieve a good result. Good luck and please tell us if you succeed.
