Detecting Spikes in a 1-D discrete time series data with unknown underlying distribution

I have a discrete 1-D data set with a value range of 0-100. The underlying distribution is unknown --although we have enough data to fit a model-- to summarize it is a highly right-skewed data set, with a vast majority of values between 0-5. My goal is to detect spikes in this data set. Spikes such as [0, 0, 0, 20, 15, 5, 0, ...]. One problem is that although spikes peak very visibly, they do not fade out as sharply. For example, in the previous example, I like to detect [20, 15] part as a single spike, although many mechanisms give them as two distinct "outlier points". I do not have a strong statistical background, I am a systems engineer. What are the steps to follow in this scenario? Thank you for your help,
