ROC curves are false negative rate vs true positive rate graph. If you have AUC = 1, by definition you have perfect classifier. From Information retrieval viewpoint ; if you have AUC = 1 then you have perfect recall and perfect precision. You recall all documents which exists about this topic, also all the documents you recall are relevant to your topic. I would like to add more information for response to commenter. Following is a graph from "ROC Graphs: Notes and Practical Considerations for Data Mining Researchers, Tom Fawcett" A discrete classifier is one that outputs only a class label. Each discrete classifier produces an (FP rate,TP rate) pair, which corresponds to a single point in ROC space. ... The point (0;1) represents perfect classification. D's performance is perfect as shown.
