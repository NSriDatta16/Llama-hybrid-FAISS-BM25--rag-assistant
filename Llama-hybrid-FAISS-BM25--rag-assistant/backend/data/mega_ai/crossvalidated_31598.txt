Is Amazon's "average rating" misleading?

If I understand correctly, book ratings on a 1-5 scale are Likert scores. That is, a 3 for me may not necessarily be a 3 for someone else. It's an ordinal scale IMO. One shouldn't really average ordinal scales but can definitely take the mode, median and percentiles. So is it 'okay' to bend the rules since the large part of the population understands means than the above statistics? Although the research community strongly rebukes taking averages of Likert scale based data, is it fine to do this with the masses (practically speaking)? Is taking the average in this case even misleading to start with? Seems unlikely that a company like Amazon would fumble on basic statistics, but if not then what am I missing here? Can we claim that the ordinal scale is a convenient approximation to the ordinal to justify taking the mean? On what grounds?
