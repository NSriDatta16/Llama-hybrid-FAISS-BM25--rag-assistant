We've done this in the past for large (and many) PDFs that store lots of text - Training Packages for Training Organisations in Australia. Its about 96% text (course info etc) and a few small diagrams. Sizes vary from 1-2Mb to 8 or 9Mb and they usually come in volumes of 4 or more. We've found compressing with Zip OK to get good compression as the PDF format is already heavily compressed, it was more of a ease of use for our users to download it all as a batch instead of worry about the filesizes. To give you an idea, a 2.31Mb file - lots of text, several full page diagrams - compressed to 1.92Mb in ZIP and 1.90Mb in RAR. I'd recommend using LZMA to get the best - looking at resource usage on compressing and uncompressing too. How big are these files? Get a copy of WinRAR, WinAce and 7Zip and give it ago.
