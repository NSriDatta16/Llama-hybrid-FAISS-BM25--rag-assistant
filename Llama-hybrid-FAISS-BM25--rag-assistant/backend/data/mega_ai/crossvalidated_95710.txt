Problem 1: Agreed, play the game. The key here is that you know the actual probabilities of winning 5 vs 20 since the outcome is dependent upon the flip of a fair coin. Problem 2: The problem is the same as problem 1 because you are told that there is an equal probability that either 5 or 20 is in the other envelope. Problem 3: The difference in problem 3 is that telling me the other envelope has either $X/2$ or $2X$ in it does not mean that I should assume that the two possibilities are equally likely for all possible values of $X$. Doing so implies an improper prior on the possible values of $X$. See the Bayesian resolution to the paradox.
