Requiring JS files at bottom of document presents usability issues

This is more of a best practice question. I recently began using the HTML5 boilerplate for a bunch of projects I have been doing but recently discovered something that could be an issue. Another developer brought to my attention that it may be an issue loading JS files at the bottom of the document due to certain functionality not working on page load( ie. form using jQuery $.ajax) and in turn presenting some usability issues. I wanted to get some opinions on what is the best way to address common issues like this that may arise. I have been using HTML5 boilerplate as I know Paul Irish and friends have really thought out this system and are constantly improving upon it. Example issue: Home page of site has newsletter sign up form that uses the jQuery $.post function to submit values of form. User has access to enter values and press submit but this will render no action as js is not loaded presenting usability issues. What is the best way to work with JS included at the bottom of the site?
