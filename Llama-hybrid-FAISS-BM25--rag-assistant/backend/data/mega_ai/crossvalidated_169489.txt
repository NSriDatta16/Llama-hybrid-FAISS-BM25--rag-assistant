how should I do regression analysis where response is number in each category

I try to find genes that related to output which is numbers in three category. The simplified analogy is: first we take an zygote and measure the expression of a gene, and clone this zygote to many replicates and finally we have hundreds of clone man. we take a record of their career choice, assume there are only three choice (fireman, policeman and teacher). assume the distribution of gene expression is normal. We take many zygote then the data table looks like: gene expression, fireman, policeman, teacher 13.2, 223, 198, 992 9.1, 195, 311, 775 ..., ..., ..., ... How can I decide if a gene is related to career choice? I thought it would be something like multinomial logistic regression but I still don't know how to do it.
