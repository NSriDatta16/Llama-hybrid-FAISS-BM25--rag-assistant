Set android:fastScroll="true" on your listview, or anything scrollable by all accounts. You can also set this in your theme or settings.xml files. My bad, android:fastScrollEnabled As per the comment below. On api target >= 11 you should also use list.setFastScrollAlwaysVisible(true). Otherwise it may not show up. â€“ Igor Ganapolsky
