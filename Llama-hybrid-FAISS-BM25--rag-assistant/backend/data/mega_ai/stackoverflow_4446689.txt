how to get notification of devices in the bluetooth range in objective c?

I am working on one application where i need to display notification for the devices in the bluetooth range. I surfed a lot also searched in the stack overflow,but got most of the questions unanswered or the solution to use pacifist,which is quite impossible for me,as i cant download old version of xcode,its not allowed in my organization. So can anybody help me out with some sort of example code or something that i can use in my application and proceed further? Thanking you. -Sarah.
