Asymptotic value of an integral related to distances in a unit n-ball

In trying to find out the pdf of the range $T$ of euclidean distances of $m$ randomly and uniformly chosen points from the origin in an $n$ -dimensional unit ball, I have obtained the following : $$ f(t)=m^2.n(n-1)\int_0^{1-t} u^{m-1}(u+t)^{m-1}[(u+t)^m-u^m]^{n-2}du.$$ From the geometry of the n-dimensional ball, it is intuitively expected that the average range and variance should approach zero.That requires computing the integrals: $$E(T)=\int_0^1tf(t)dt $$ and $$E(T^2)=\int_0^1t^2f(t)dt.$$ How do I evaluate the above integrals in, say, Mathematica; and is it possible to find the analytical expressions for them in the cases when both $m,n$ approach infinity?
