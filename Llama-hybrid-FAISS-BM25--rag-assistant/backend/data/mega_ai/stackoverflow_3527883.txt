The simplest approach is to use a sibling selector: p + p { margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px; } This rule applies to paragraphs only if they come directly after another paragraph. So, this rule doesn't apply to your first paragraph, as it doesn't follow a paragraph. If you want space between every paragraph, but not before the first and not after the last, use this: p + p { margin-top: 20px; }
