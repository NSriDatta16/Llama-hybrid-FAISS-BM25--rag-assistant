I don't know about causality, but the skill set required to write well overlaps quite a bit with those required for programming: knowing how to plan, being able to keep a myriad of details consistent, being able to make things clear for a future reader, knowing how to organize your thoughts and the resultant product. That isn't to say that a successful author would make a good programmer, but a programmer with good language skills and the same logic/math/deductive skills is probably a better programmer than one with poor language skills -- at least the code has a greater chance of being understandable.
