Thanks for the clarification by commenting. Tree-based models do not care about the absolute value that a feature takes. They only care about the order of the values. Hence, normalization is used mainly in linear models/knn/neural networks because they're affected by absolute values taken by features. You don't need to normalize/standardize. Check this post .
