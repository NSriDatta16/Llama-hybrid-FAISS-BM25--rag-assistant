I think this is discouraged because exceptions are caught only once and there may be multiple things, like background threads, that need to know if a process throws. Is this a WinForms app? Forms.Application.Run raises events whenever a thread throws an unhandled exception. The MSDN docs try to explain this, but the handler they show doesn't work! Read the updated example from the WinForms UE site.
