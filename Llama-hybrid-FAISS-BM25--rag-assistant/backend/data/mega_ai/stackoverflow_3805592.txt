Abiquo is commercial, but offers an open source "community edition" under GPL3. However, I don't know what features are in and what's not in the open source edition versus the enterprise edition. Nimbula is new, but looks very interesting. I heard a rumor of them doing open source, but could be wrong. OpenStack holds a lot of promise. There are a number of contributors, including the primaries RackSpace and NASA. That's three potential Infrastructure-as-a-Service right off the top of my head. However, if you are also looking into Platform-as-a-Service tools to ride on top of the infrastructure, you have other considerations. Under the PaaS umbrella you'll find tools and services for virtualizing applications, building applications that auto-scale up and down and have automatic failover reliability, storage solutions ala Amazon S3, simplified application and service management across many servers, etc. OpenStack offers a storage solution ala Amazon S3. Appistry CloudIQ Platform offers a free community edition version which can be used in production (distributed storage ala S3, distributed execution engine for building cloud applications, distributed memory cache, application/service management and virtualization) . GigaSpaces offers open source versions of some of their distributed tools and services (distributed memory cache, distributed execution engine for building cloud applications) I'm sure there are more, but again, off the top of my head. Good luck!
