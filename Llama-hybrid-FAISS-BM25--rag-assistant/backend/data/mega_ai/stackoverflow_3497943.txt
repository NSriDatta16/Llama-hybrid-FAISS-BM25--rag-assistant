How to change itemTemplate of an item in itemControl at runtime in silverlihgt 4

I have a ItemControl in silverlight 4 with a Canvas as a ItemPanel, the idea is to simulate a canvas area with drag and dop items. ItemsControl has a ItemTemplate with a image and one button. The idea is that when the button of itemTemplate Click the itemTemplate change. Some of my code: (Items Control) (ItemTemplate) I try to get that when a button in a itemTemplate is clicked the template of this item change to other template from resource. Was that possible or i taking a bad way. Thanks a lot.
