c# async await implementation

I have some doubts about the design of C#'s upcoming async/await feature. The convenience of attaching the new mechanism to Task I think is better to use async substituting the await keyword. For expaple: var result = async GetResultAsync(); The mechanism to cancel a ongoing async operation using a token is not as elegant as I feel it could be. Async/away is a great feature, but I think it's not as well designed as LINQ. Also, I feel the desing team is dangerously pleased with the current design; and might not take community feedback into account. What do you think?
