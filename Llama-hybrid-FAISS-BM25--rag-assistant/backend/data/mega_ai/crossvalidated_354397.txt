If you work on logged data, be aware that simply taking the exponential of your point forecasts will not give the expectation on the original scale, for the same reason that the mean of a lognormal distribution is not simply $e^\mu$, but $e^{\mu+\frac{\sigma^2}{2}}$. Rob Hyndman is working on his new fable forecasting package that will automatically correct for biases induced by such Box-Cox transformations. Then again, the bias may not be much of a problem for you. ARIMA and ETS (not "est") are good choices. Be sure to tell R that your time series are seasonal through ts(..., frequency=12) , then seasonal models will automatically be considered. Don't use HoltWinters() , rather use ets() , which will likely do a better job at identifying a model than you or I could. You are quite right to use a holdout sample to assess which method performs better. You might get even better by fitting and forecasting multiple models and then averaging the point forecasts for each future month. Few things improve forecasts more than simple averaging. You may be interested in Forecasting: Principles and Practice . EDIT to address your follow-up questions: 1) You say: By taking the exponential of the point forecasts you won't get the expected value on the original scale. I don't understand fully why this is not the case but is it likely to be a problem for me? If I predict 300,000 instead of 301,000 that is not really an issue but if it is 100,000 off for instance this is not good for me. It shouldn't be a problem. Here is some toy data. The forecast on the original scale is the blue line, the one on a log scale the red line. set.seed(1) foo In any case, I would recommend that you assess any bias in your forecast by calculating the Mean Error. 2) If you had to do one or the other would you use ets/ARIMA (taking whichever predicts better through the testing I mentioned) or average between the 2 predictions from both models? I'd assess both methods as well as the average and go with whatever performs best, which will probably be the average. 3) Is it okay to log the data (to help make stationary) then let the ARIMA do the differencing if it finds it appropriate to do so? Sure, you can do that. Whatever works, works. 4) When I do the tes model would it be better to do forecast(ets(train), h = 6) or forecast(ets(log10(train)), h = 6) ? As above: try both, assess the error on a holdout sample and use whatever works best.
