It seems that you have problems with the genes that do not show any variation. For example, I had a look at Gene783 where you get NA values after the scaling: the column corresponding to this gene in your data consists only of ones. It is impossible to scale the degenerate random variable in a way that will result in it having a unit variance. I do not have much experience with the scale function myself, but I guess it tries to do that, fails, but the result is NA. You have quite a few of such predictors, you can find their names by which(is.na(colSums(trainx))) . I would remove them from the sample before performing logistic regression.
