You could create a bookmark with a wildcard %s and the msdn keyword by using the following url for the bookmarked page: http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/search/en-us/?query=%s Now in the address bar, when I type "msdn StringBuilder" it brings me to this result page: http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/search/en-us/?query=StringBuilder I did the same with the stackoverflow keyword and the http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/%s url. EDIT: as @AgentConundrum pointed out, using the http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&safe=off&q=%s%20site:msdn.microsoft.com url will restrict Google search to the msdn.microsoft.com site.
