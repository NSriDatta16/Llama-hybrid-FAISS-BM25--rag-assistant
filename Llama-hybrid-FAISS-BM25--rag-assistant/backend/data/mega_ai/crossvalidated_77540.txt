Logistic regression prediction validation

I am try to evaluate a logistic regression with new data using R. I have created the logistic regression using the old data and evaluated that using chi^2 etc. i.e. model (note I do need the intercept = 0). And then the predicted probabilities: predicted.probabilities How can I now perform the same sort of tests with these new probabilities? and what are the best tests to do here?
