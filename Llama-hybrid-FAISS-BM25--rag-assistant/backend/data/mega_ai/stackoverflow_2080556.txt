How to get the sub-string lying in between two sub-strings in C?

I have a packet capture code that writes http payload into a file. Now i want to extract the URL information from these dumps. For each packet , the payload begins like this. GET /intl/en_com/images/logo_plain.png HTTP/1.1..Host: www.google.co.in..User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 I would like to extract : the string between "GET" and "HTTP/1.1" the string between "Host:" and "User-Agent" How to do this in C ? Are there any inbuilt string functions ? Or Regular expressions ?
