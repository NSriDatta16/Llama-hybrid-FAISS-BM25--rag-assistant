In Ruby 1.9.2 you could simply measure coverage without a significant impact on performance. In 1.8.7, however, this would slow down things way too much. Instead you could get an overview of what's used using perftools.rb (with the CPUPROFILE_METHODS=1 option). As far as I know it has virtually no impact on application performance and it would allow you to see what methods have been called, although you would not get any information about the different code paths (ifs and loops and whatnot).
