I think the statistician is mostly right, the question makes sense: given two number of visits, are these numbers compatible with the hypothesis of an unchanged attractiveness of the website? I don’t get how the traffic was compared with the Wilcoxon test. My first move would be to model it as Poisson, and use the approximation "square root of a Poisson = normal variable vith variance 0.25", thus $$ \sqrt 2(\sqrt{X_{\text{aug}}} - \sqrt{X_{\text{oct}}}) \sim \mathcal N(0,1),$$ leading to a test procedure. However the problem is that the traffic can change simply because of the month — I suspect that August and October are very different months in this regard, independently of the site attractiveness. Here is what I would do, assuming that the traffic in one week is large enough and that the site is several years old. Compute the mean traffic $mw_i$ ($i = 1,\dots, 52$) on each of the 52 weeks of the year, across the last 5 years for example Denote $w_{ij}$ the traffic for each week $i$ of year $j$. You are interested in the difference between $w_{ij}$ and the mean traffic at this time of the year $mw_i$. Just plot the values $w_{ij} - mw_i$ (time on $x$-axis, value on $y$-axis). This should be easy to interpret. Asses the effect of the site reorganization simply by eyeballing — I frankly don’t think that computing a $p$-value is meaningful. If you don’t see an increasing slope after the reorganization, there is no change, that's it.
