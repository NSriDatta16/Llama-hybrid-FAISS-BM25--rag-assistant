What happens if the sample size is too high in logistic regression?

I know there's a minimum sample size calculation for logistic regression and I've found many discussions about it. However, what I'd like to know is what happens if the sample size is too high. Hypothetically, let's say for about 200 predictors, if I have 12,000 records, will there be any problems with the analysis? Should I check for something before I choose the data? I don't have actual proportion of the data but assuming 50% positive cases, will there be any problem with the assumptions and analysis?
