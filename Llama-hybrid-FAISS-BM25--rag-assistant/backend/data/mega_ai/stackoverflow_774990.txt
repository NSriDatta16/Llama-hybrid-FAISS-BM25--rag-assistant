You could write an custom content processor to handle your level files, but it is probably overkill. This has the advantage that you can "compile" the levels to some format that would be more difficult for a user to modify. You can just add it to your project (not in Content) and specify "Copy to Output Directory - Copy always" in properties. Create a new subfolder in your project and place it there - that'll be the directory it is copied to. For disallowing users deleting prebaked levels, no way on Windows to allow for that. You could do a check in your code that would cause it to fail if a user were to delete some expected files. For creating a new directory, you can use the StorageDevice.OpenContainer().Path to get the root path and use Directory.CreateDirectory. This'll work on PC and XBox.
