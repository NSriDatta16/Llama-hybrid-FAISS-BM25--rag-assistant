Because 'orderby' => 'meta_value' requires meta_key , and your meta_key is already in use for a comparison, I don't think you can do this. meta_key only accepts a single value and not an array of options. This is definitely a limitation and I encourage you to open a request if you don't find a solution. As far as the button to re-run the query, you could simply reload the page and pass a query variable to change the sort. Unfortunately you still have to solve the first part of your question. UPDATE You could always sort the returned array yourself using PHP. Also, not sure what you are checking with time available but you could register a filter that may help you customize the query a bit further add_filter('posts_where', ...); http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/query_posts
