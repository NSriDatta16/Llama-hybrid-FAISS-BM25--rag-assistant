INSERT gets slower too, especially if you have a lot of indexes which have to be updated as well. There is a difference between the different storage engines though: MyISAM is faster for a lot of SELECT , InnoDB is faster for a lot of INSERT / UPDATE because it uses row locking instead of table locking and the way it handles indexes.
