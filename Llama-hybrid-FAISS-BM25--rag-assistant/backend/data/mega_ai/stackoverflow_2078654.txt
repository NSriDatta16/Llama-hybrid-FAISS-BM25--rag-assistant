this call is well specified in the openmp spec. linux has the correct behavior here. with that being said, you are in a master region which is effectively serial and fhe the main thread, so the num threads call is explainable. if you arent tied to pure c I would encourage you to look at the c++ tbb library and particularly the ppl subset, you will find more generality and composability like for nested parallelism. I'm on myphone so I apologize for typos here.
