glm with nested treatments

I am currently doing the statistical analysis for my master thesis. In my experiment, I have 3 species that I expose to Erosion treatments. After every treatment, I see what percentage of each species fall under one of 11 damage categories as can be seen in the picture: I collected how big the angle compared to standing upright was. If the number was 5 for example, it was heavily leaning to the right. Angle_cat is just the damage category, sorry for not naming it properly. For the percentages, I looked at all shoots of the same plant species after an erosion treatment and calculated how much percentage of the plant fell under this damage category. So in the picture, all the percentages of Phrag (which is reed) and an erosion of 0 cm amount to 1. So for the Phrag 2.5 cm erosion, you can see that the percentage of species with an angle of -3 decreased. The problem I currently have is that for each Erosion;Species combinations, I have multiple damage categories. So if I do glm(Percentage~Erosion*Species) all percentages would be like different experiment results of the same treatment, instead of a part of the results. Is there a way I can look at the difference between the different Erosion;Species;damage categories with a glm or do I need a different method? Another way of representing this data is like this (if this helps): I wish you a nice easter, Sam
