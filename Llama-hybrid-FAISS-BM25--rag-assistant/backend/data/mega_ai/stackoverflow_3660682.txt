Code coverage in vs 2010

We just switched over to VS2010, and I remember a while back I had setup code coverage for a project I was working on in 2010, and there being a little bit of setup involved. I can't seem to remember the steps in wiring up code coverage with my unit test results. Anyone know the steps?
