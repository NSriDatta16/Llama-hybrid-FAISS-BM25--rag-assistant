How to automatically update UI when items are added to List<>

Wihtin my current project I have to add data items to a List<> object. I am using a list due to the fact that it is being derived from an external type and due to how it is being utilized by other applications I do not have the ability to request that the type be changed in the assembly from List to ObservableCollection. So as of right now I am stuck using List<> for my storage collection. Since List<> does not automatically update the UI when items are add I was wondering how to go about invoking this update? thanks in advance
