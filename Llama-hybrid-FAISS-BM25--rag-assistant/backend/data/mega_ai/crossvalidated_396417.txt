For a random variable $X \sim \operatorname{Bernoulli}(p)$ defined on a probability space $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$ , the parameter $p$ (a number) is the probability of a certain event, namely, the event $\{X = 1\}$ . That is, $$ p = P(X = 1). $$ The single number $p$ completely determines the distribution of $X$ since for any Borel set $B \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ we have $$ \begin{aligned} P(X \in B) &= \mathbf{1}_B(0)P(X = 0) + \mathbf{1}_B(1) P(X = 1) \\ &= (1 - p) \mathbf{1}_B(0) + p \mathbf{1}_B(1). \end{aligned} $$ (Here $\mathbf{1}_B$ is the indicator function of $B$ .) This is why the family of Bernoulli distributions is parametereized by the interval $[0, 1]$ . This fact is independent of a frequentist or Bayesian interpretation of statistics: it is just a fact of probability. If we're being Bayesians, then we'd want the parameter $p$ to be a random variable itself with some prior distribution. Formally, we can say that our parameter is a random variable $\Pi$ supported on $[0, 1]$ and we have $$ X \mid \Pi \sim \operatorname{Bernoulli}(\Pi), $$ which means that $$ \begin{aligned} P(X = 1 \mid \Pi) &= \Pi, & P(X = 0 \mid \Pi) &= 1 - \Pi \end{aligned} $$ almost surely (or $$ \begin{aligned} P(X = 1 \mid \Pi = p) &= p, & P(X = 0 \mid \Pi = p) &= 1 - p \end{aligned} $$ for any $p \in [0, 1]$ ). In this case, the parameter $\Pi$ (a random variable) is the conditional probability of the event $\{X = 1\}$ given $\Pi$ . This conditional probability, together with the distribution of $\Pi$ (the prior distribution), completely determines the distribution of $X$ since $$ \begin{aligned} P(X \in B) &= E[P(X \in B \mid \Pi)] \\ &= E[\mathbf{1}_B(0)P(X = 0 \mid \Pi) + \mathbf{1}_B(1) P(X = 1 \mid \Pi)] \\ &= E[(1 - \Pi) \mathbf{1}_B(0) + \Pi \mathbf{1}_B(1)] \\ &= (1 - E[\Pi]) \mathbf{1}_B(0) + E[\Pi] \mathbf{1}_B(1) \end{aligned} $$ for any Borel set $B \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ . In any case, frequentist or Bayesian, the usual parameter of Bernoulli data is the probability (either marginal or conditional) of some event.
