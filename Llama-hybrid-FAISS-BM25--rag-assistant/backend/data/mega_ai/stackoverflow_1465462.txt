I'd recommend you start by learning the Servlet-API, which backs all things related to HTTP-requests and responses in the Java world. HttpServletRequest and HttpServletResponse cover a lot of ground here. Jetty is a nice choice here; there's a good introduction about Clojure and Jetty at http://robert.zubek.net/blog/2008/04/26/clojure-web-server/ (using Jetty 6). That being said, Compojure's basic model is pretty low-level too: it just wraps the requests and responses in Clojure-datastructures, but you are still responsible for all routing, generating the right response codes. generating an ETag etc., which is sometimes more low-level stuff than with a LAMP-stack.
