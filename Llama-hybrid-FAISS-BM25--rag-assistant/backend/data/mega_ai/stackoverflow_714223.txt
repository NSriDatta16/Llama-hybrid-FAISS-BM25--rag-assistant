Talk to them. Ask why they don't do unit tests. If it's just laziness, explain how it's a time-saver in the long run (with the specific examples you mentioned), and that yes, it takes some effort to get into, but soon becomes a habit with proven benefits. If that doesn't help, give them a separate time buget for unit tests and implementation and tell them that it's now their job to spend 5 hours writing unit tests for this use case that produce decent coverage, and that you'll be happy to help them get started. If that still does not help, fire them and get someone who won't disregard outright orders to do his job properly.
