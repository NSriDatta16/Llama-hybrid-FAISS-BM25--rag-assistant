SVM on sparse data

In this paper related to factorization machine, the author compares factorization machine (FM) with SVM. As FM performs better than SVM, it's considered state of the art for sparse data. Why SVM is considered so important algorithm for sparse dataset? What features of SVM makes it superior for sparse data?
