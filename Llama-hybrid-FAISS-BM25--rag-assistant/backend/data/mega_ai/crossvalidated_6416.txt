If you want to test whether the variances of several machines deviates from the other variances combining them into average will not help you. The problem is that these differing variances will skew your average. To test whether there are different variances you can use Bartlet's test . It is sensitive to normality, but since you said that your data is normal this should not be a problem, though it would be a good idea to test that. Now if you can assume that all the machines are similar in sense that they can have different means but similar variance, the problem is very simple. If you assume that machines are independent treat the variances from each machine as a random sample. Then estimate the mean and standard deviation of this sample. For large number of machines, the normal approximation will kick in, so it will not matter whether you use standard deviations or the variances. In both cases the sample mean will estimate average statistic of your choice, and standard deviation of the sample will estimate average spread of statistic of your choice. The 95% confidence interval will then be $\mu\pm 1.96\sigma$.
