The idea of a randomization test is that if a given treatment has no affect on an outcome, then the assignment of that treatment is just a kind of arbitrary labeling. ( Fisher's exact test was the first method to be based on this concept.) Now if we have some statistic and we want to know its distribution under the null hypothesis of no treatment effect, we can through simulation estimate this null distribution by randomly relabeling the observations and looking at the behavior of our statistic in this setting, because then the null hypothesis is effectively true. The example you give is an interesting one, but notice that it isn't the size of the difference in average time that we'd take as evidence that bus A is faster, but the fact that bus A is always faster. So a more sensible test statistic would be something that measures this more directly, like the statistic used in Wilcoxon's rank sum test . If you did a randomization test using a rank sum statistic instead then you would get a highly "significant" result.
