wpf listview drag select multiple items

Just wondering if anyone has any idea on how to do this. I want to let the user select multiple items by clicking and dragging the mouse (without letting the click go). Say the user clicks on item 1, then drags down to item 10; item 1 through 10 should get selected as if he clicked item 1, then shift + clicked on item 10. Let me know thanks!
