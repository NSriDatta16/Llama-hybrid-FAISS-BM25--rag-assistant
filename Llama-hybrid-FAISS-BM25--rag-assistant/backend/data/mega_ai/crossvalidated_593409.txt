svyglm and margins - variable not significant anymore as marginal effect

I run a logistic regression with survey weights (only raking) with svyglm. Thereafter, I calculated marginal effects with package margins (svyglm.margins). However, one variable that is significant in the svyglm is not significant anymore when calculating marginal effects. Is this possible? margins(svyglm-object, design = surveydesign, type = "response") The variable is a categorical variable (language - german, french or italian). Also, the weighting is based on this variable. The marginal effect of french is - 0.065 SE 0.04 z -1.6165 p 0.1060 lower -0.1438 upper 0.0143 In svyglm the coefficient is -0.47483 SE 0.27865 t value -1.704 Pr(>|t|) 0.088878 Thank you!!
