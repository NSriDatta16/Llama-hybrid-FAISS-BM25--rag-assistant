How do I write unescaped XML outside of a CDATA

I am trying to write XML data using Stax where the content itself is HTML If I try xtw.writeStartElement("contents"); xtw.writeCharacters(" here "); xtw.writeEndElement(); I get this &lt;b&gt;here&lt;/b&gt; Then I notice the CDATA method and change my code to: xtw.writeStartElement("contents"); xtw.writeCData(" here "); xtw.writeEndElement(); and this time the result is here ]]> which is still not good. What I really want is here So is there an XML API/Library that allows me to write raw text without being in a CDATA section? So far I have looked at Stax and JDom and they do not seem to offer this. In the end I might resort to good old StringBuilder but this would not be elegant. Update: I agree mostly with the answers so far. However instead of here I could have a 1MB HTML document that I want to embed in a bigger XML document. What you suggest means that I have to parse this HTML document in order to understand its structure. I would like to avoid this if possible. Answer: It is not possible, otherwise you could create invalid XML documents.
