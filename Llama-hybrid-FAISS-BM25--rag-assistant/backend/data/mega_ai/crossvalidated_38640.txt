Fit Inverse Gamma Distribution to dataset in R

I am having some problems in modifying Procrastinator's code that assesses the fit of the Inverse Gamma distribution to some randomly generated data. I am refering to the code appearing in the following link: 'Fixing' PearsonFitML to fit to a Pearson V distribution In my case, I have the dataset save in a .csv file which I directly import in R for further processing. MY modification of this code is as follows: # Required packages library(MCMCpack) data=my.csv.data$V1 hist(data) # log-likelihood ll = function(par){ if(par[1]>0 & par[2]>0 & par[3] It seems that I cannot attach the .csv file in here, but I can send it to anyone who is familiar and willing to help. I get the following error: Error in optim(c(5, 2, 2), ll) : function cannot be evaluated at initial parameters and I cannot understand why due to my lack of knowledge in R.
