Magento: load template file from admin module

I've been following this tutorial on creating modules in the management section. I'm just expermenting with magento modules and the twitter API. Here is the tutorial http://t.wits.sg/2009/03/31/howto-repackageable-custom-extension-development-in-magento/ I got as far as page two where I have a module menu in management that calls on my AdminController's indexAction like so: loadLayout(); $this->getLayout()->getBlock('content')->append($this->getLayout()-> createBlock('twits/helloWorld')); $this->renderLayout(); } } So this displays the block/HelloWorld.php block: THis all works fine, I can navigate to my management menu click on the menu item and I see 'HelloWorld'. What I want to do is load a template file here instead of displaying text through a class. I have a form that I want to display that looks up all the products and displays them. I can then choose a product and write in tags and when I click the submit button on the form it formats the data and punts it over to twitter as a status update. Am I going about this wrong? (should I not be using templates here?) if not can someone help me out with where to put my templates and how to call them. This is what my phtml file will hopefully look like: 'Tweet up' Your Products getProducts(); $i = 0; foreach ($products as $product) { // var_dump($product); echo ' '; echo ' '; echo ' ' . $product . ' '; echo ' '; echo ' '; echo ' '; echo ' '; echo ' '; echo ' '; $i++; } ?> Thanks a lot! Jonesy
