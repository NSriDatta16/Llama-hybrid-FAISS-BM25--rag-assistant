I think you could run through a sample of the reports coming in, see what kind of words are used and the most common spelling errors, and use that as a base. You most likely can't find all possible errors but the most widely misspelled words could be a good place to start. I have no clue on even the start of machine learning, however coming at this from another perspective might be able to help. If you can build a dictionary of the most common misspellings, the machine should be able to learn from there.
