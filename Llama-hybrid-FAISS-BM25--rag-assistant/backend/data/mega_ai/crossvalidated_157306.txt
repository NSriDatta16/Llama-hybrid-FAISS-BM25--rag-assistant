The Random Forest algorithm involves a lot of randomization, as I assume you know (right?). So you will get somewhat different results each time you run it. To obtain reproducible results, which is a good idea, initialize your random number generator with a fixed number. In R, you can do this with set.seed(1) , or with whatever other seed you want. Be sure to investigate the effects of changing this seed, i.e., how sensitive your results are to your specific random number stream.
