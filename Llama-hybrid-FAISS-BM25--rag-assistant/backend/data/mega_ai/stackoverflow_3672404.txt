Forget the JavaScript. Trying to fiddle the page around a print from script is complicated, fragile and pointless. This is what a print stylesheet is for! Add a stylesheet with media="print" which contains display: rules to hide all the parts of the part you don't want printed, and cause normally-hidden parts of the page to appear when being viewed on a printer. You don't even need a scripted print button, the normal web browser Print function will pick up the differences.
