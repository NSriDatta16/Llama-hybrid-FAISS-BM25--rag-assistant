SQL Aggregrates without a GROUP BY

I'm trying to determine if there is a way to accomplish this elegantly. I have a query: SELECT TASK.*, PROJCOST.act_cost, PROJCOST.target_cost FROM task LEFT OUTER JOIN projcost ON task.task_id = projcost.task_id I just found out that PROJCOST.target_cost and act_cost are not 1 to 1 and need to be summed. I understand how to use SUM and GROUP BY, but what I'm trying to find an elegant way NOT to have to spell out every single one of the fields in the TASK table in the GROUP BY (there are close to 100 fields, and yes, I need all columns). I also understand I could move this up to the code level and only select the task list and then do another query to get the cost data. I was hoping to avoid that. Also, I cannot make this a stored proc because this isn't my database. Any ideas? Thank you.
