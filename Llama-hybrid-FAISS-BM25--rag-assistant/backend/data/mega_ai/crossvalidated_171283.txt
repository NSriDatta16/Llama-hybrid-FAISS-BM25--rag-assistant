First of all, I tried to comment on the question but I couldn't because I didn't have (still don't) 50 reputation , so I'm posting my opinion as an answer despite knowing it is not a complete answer to what's asked.. On a Bayesian probabilistic framework, probabilities are considered as "degrees of belief", that is, the "most rational" measure of plausabilities of assertions on situations of incomplete information ( 1 ). On that context, one can show ( 2 ) that the Principle of Maximum Entropy is the reasonable choice to update a "state of knowledge" of a rational agent to another state when stumbled with new information that constrains its' knowledge (for example, more data). So that's Maximum Entropy as I see it. Your question, however, concerns of priors , which are a much more delicate matter. That's more or less terrain of philosophical, epistemological questions: some will argue that priors are a non-sense, because science is remarkable certain, and can't allow space to subjectivities; on the other side, some other people will argue that it's truly subjective, and there is no complaint about it, because we will never have access the "true nature" of our object of study. I prefer to justify bayesian subjectivity and priors by saying that we normally won't have access to the objective, mechanistical description of our event - or maybe we have, but we don't want to! (because of the many degrees of freedom, low computational power et cetera). On these scenarios, we take advantage on every piece of key information that we have on the problem ( not the data!): be it symmetries, moments, or whatsoever, so that we can codify our knowledge as probabilities and update it on the basis of more data. On the behalf of Bayesian and Entropic Inference , I shall try to explain the reasoning behind these wrongly understood topics by quoting quote Bertrand Russell: I wish to propose for the readerâ€™s favourable consideration a doctrine which may, I fear, appear wildly paradoxical and subversive. The doctrine in question is this: that it is undesirable to believe in a proposition when there is no ground whatever for supposing it true. Bertrand Russell, in Sceptical Essays The main point is that we can't use information that we don't have or ignore information that we do have when constructing our priors. All knowledge must be considered. I must apologize for my bad english, I'm not a native speaker and sometimes (many times) I write some things thinking they're right but they are not. I'd really appreciate if someone pointed my mistakes ^^
