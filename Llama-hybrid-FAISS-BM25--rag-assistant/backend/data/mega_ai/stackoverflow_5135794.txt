I know this may sound silly, but have tried to restart Visual Studio (after Cleaning and Rebuilding the solution)? I noticed some strange behavior, especially if you have Code-Coverage enabled and some of the Powertools for Visual Studio installed. Was Model internal in some previous builds? It's a really common name. Edit: A way to make sure you actually have the right type, you can hover the "Model" declaration in your second project and press F12 (or right click and choose "Go To Definition", don't know the german term right now). This should take you to your class or to the definition of some other "Model"-class (.NET internal types are displayed too).
