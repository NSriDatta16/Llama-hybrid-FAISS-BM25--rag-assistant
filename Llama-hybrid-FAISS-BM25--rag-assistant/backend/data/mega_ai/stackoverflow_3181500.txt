Respond to HTTP HEAD requests using ASP.NET MVC

I'd like to correctly support the HTTP HEAD request when bots hit my ASP.NET MVC site using HEAD. It was brought to my attention that all HTTP HEAD requests to the site were returning 404s, particularly from http://downforeveryoneorjustme.com . Which is really annoying. Wish they would switch to GET like all the other good bots out there. If I just change [AcceptVerbs(HttpVerbs.Get)] to [AcceptVerbs(HttpVerbs.Get | HttpVerbs.Head)] will MVC know to drop the body of the request? What have you done to support HTTP HEAD requests? (Code sample would be great!)
