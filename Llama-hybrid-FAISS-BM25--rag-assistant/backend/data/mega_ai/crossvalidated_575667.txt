There is no need for absolute values around your sine function. f(x) = sin(x) is a perfectly fine pdf on the sample space [0, pi/2]. As schotti points out, you can create an RV with this pdf by taking the inverse cosine (arccos) of a standard uniform RV; this follows from the Jacobian transformation that you have given in your question. That being the case, undoing the arccos by applying the cosine will obviously take you back to the standard uniform that you began with. Don't believe this? Here is an image of a pdf histogram (total area = 1) for a sample of 10^5 standard uniforms transformed by arccos, with the graph of sine superimposed. Clearly, this works. It's important to use a standard uniform, with sample space [0,1] as input of the arccos and the output of the cosine. Obviously, if the upper endpoint is greater than 1, you will get errors from the arccos, and impossible values for the cosine transformation. The real danger is negative values. If your uniform variable input generates negative values, arccos will take you to values above pi/2, and you cease to have sine as a valid pdf. You could work with a uniform RV with sample space [-1,1], but the RV resulting from the arccos will have sin(x)/2 as its pdf, not the sin(x) that you desire. Here is that situation:
