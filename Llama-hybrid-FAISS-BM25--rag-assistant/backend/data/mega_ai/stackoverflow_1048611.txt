do interfaces belong in files of their own

As as rule of thumb I generally put classes in a file of their own. Visual studio seems to encourage this but what is appropriate with regards to interfaces? e.g. I have Class Foo that implements interface Bar public interface IBar { } public class Foo : IBar { } it seems natural to group these within the same file until another class implements the interface but to dedicate a file to 2 lines code seems excessive but correct. What is appropriate?
