The simple, O(n log n) way is to sort the list then get the last k elements. The proper way is to use a selection algorithm , which runs in O(n + k log k) time. Also, heapq.nlargest takes O(n log k) time on average , which may or may not be good enough. (If k = O(n), then all 3 algorithms have the same complexity (i.e. don't bother). If k = O(log n), then the selection algorithm as described in Wikipedia is O(n) and heapq.nlargest is O(n log log n), but double logarithm is "constant enough" for most practical n that it doesn't matter.)
