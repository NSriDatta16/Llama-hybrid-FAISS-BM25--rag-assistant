Which tool is good to collect tweets on 50 keywords over the last 5 years and then analyze them with the LDA algorithm or sentiment analysis?

I want to find tweets from the last 5 years to a topic. For this I decide for 50 Keywords (related to the main topic), where I want to find data on Twitter. I want to find out how the trend on the subject is, are there any opposing/negative opinions, are there recognizable patterns, ... (I am also unsure which possibilities I have to get something useful from the data) I totally new to Data Science and never done it before. I have found the following tool https://algorithmia.com/pricing and https://monkeylearn.com/ . Especially Algorithmia looks like it could help me. Are there other alternatives that could help me with this task? Since my programming skills are not very good and my data science skills are not existing, I thought it would be the easiest thing to buy a tool. I am happy about any advice. :)
