Good uses for Apache CollectionUtils

I found the CollectionUtils class a year or so ago and a few of the methods like, collect, and transform seem really cool, however, I have yet to find a use where it would not by syntactically cleaner and\or easier to just write the logic with a simple loop. Has any found a unique\useful use for these methods (transform, predicatedCollection, collect, etc) e.g. the methods that take a transformer or predicate as an argument?
