Yes, this is possible. Depending on which version of Visual Studio you're using, your new control may or may not immediately show up in the Toolbox. Worst case is you have to add it manually. Once it's in the toolbox, you just use it like any other control. Drag it from the toolbox to the form, set the properties and event handlers, etc.
