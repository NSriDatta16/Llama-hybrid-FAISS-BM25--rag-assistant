Getting the raw value of a c++ ofstream's put pointer (for storage)

To get the position of a c++ ofstream's output pointer, I call ostream::tellp() which returns a streampos object. I want to store this value, which may be quite large, into a binary file. However, I cannot find a way to get the raw value of the output pointer's position from this streampos object. If I were not worried about this value being very large, I would simply convert it to an integer; however, my file may be a few gigabytes in size. Does anyone have any ideas for this? Thanks!
