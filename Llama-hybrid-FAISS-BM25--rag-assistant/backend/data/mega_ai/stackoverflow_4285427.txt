With Xcode, do the following: NIB-files -> MainMenu.xib (doubleclick). This opens interface builder. file -> new... -> Cocoa -> mainMenu link your mainMenu's dockMenu to "File's owner" (second click mainMenu -> drag and drop the dockMenu-circle to File's owner) double Click mainMenu and edit the item names. Link the item "send actions" to the actions you want to perform (same way as in bullet 3). Bullet 4 is a bit shaky as I don't remember excatly how it goes. I'll give you a link for further reading: http://cocoadevcentral.com/articles/000036.php . There should not be any problems to link it with applescript, though. I would appreciate if you could post a working solution (when you get it to work, I mean). br, Juha
