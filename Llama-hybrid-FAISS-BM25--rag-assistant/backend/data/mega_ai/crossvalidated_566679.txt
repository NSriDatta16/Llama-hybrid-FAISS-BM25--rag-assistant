How does one compute standard errors for coefficients in multinomial logistic regression?

I am currently engaged in a project to try and compute standard errors for coefficients for multinomial logistic regression. I saw answers with code in this post here How to compute the standard errors of a logistic regression's coefficients which I believed very enlightening but I am wondering how it may extend to classes of more than two. If someone can provide me with a document or explanation about how one may obtain the standard errors for coefficients in the multinomial case, that would be most appreciated.
