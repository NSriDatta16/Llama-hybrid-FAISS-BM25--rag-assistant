Mapping from the two-dimensional spatial coordinates to your spatial index / geohash is an interesting problem. You might look at this article on quadtrees, geohashes and Hilbert curves . The Hilbert curve is a space-filling curve that provides locality; for your purposes, that means that nearby items in the one-dimensional spatial index will be nearby in two-dimensional space. The goal (as described by other responders) is to minimize the number of queries necessary to cover the space in question without requesting tons of unnecessary data from the server. How you do the mapping from 2-d space to a 1-d index will affect that goal.
