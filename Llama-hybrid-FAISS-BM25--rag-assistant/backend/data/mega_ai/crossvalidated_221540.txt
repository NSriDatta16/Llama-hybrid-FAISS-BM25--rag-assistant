Feature Selection with Categorical Variables: Multicollinearity and Statistical Significance

Building a logistic regression model with three categorical features and one continuous. For simplicity, let's say I have the following features and variables: Feature | Variable ======================================== Gender | Male ---------------------------------------- Weight | Weight (continuous) ---------------------------------------- Income Bucket | 0 - 50k Income Bucket | 51k - 75k Income Bucket | 76k - 100k Income Bucket | 101k - 150k ---------------------------------------- Continent | North America Continent | South America Continent | Europe Continent | Asia Continent | Africa Continent | Australia Recall that I am using for the number of variables so there is no variable for Gender = Female, Income Bucket = 100k+, or Continent = Antarctica. if I run this through a multicollinearity check and get VIFs for one categorical variable being higher than 10, does it make sense to remove it? For example: Feature | Variable | VIF | ================================================= Gender | Male | 2 ------------------------------------------------- Weight | Weight (continuous) | 1 ------------------------------------------------- Income Bucket | 0 - 50k | 3 Income Bucket | 51k - 75k | 4 Income Bucket | 76k - 100k | 11 Should I drop the categorical variable for Income Bucket = 76k- 100k and then proceed to further model selection? Furthermore, does it make sense if one or more (but not all) have p-values are not significant? For example: Feature | Variable | P-Value | ===================================================== Gender | Male | 0.002 ----------------------------------------------------- Weight | Weight (continuous) | 0.001 ----------------------------------------------------- Income Bucket | 0 - 50k | 0.05 Income Bucket | 51k - 75k | 1.65 Here, does it make sense to drop Income Bucket = 51k - 75k and Continent = Europe based on the P-values? How does the "missing" categorical variable (the one removed due to the rule) become interpreted once you drop a few of the ones that are included? Remember that this is for a logistic regression but I am okay with knowing how it would work for linear as well. And would another method be more suited for this? Thank you!
