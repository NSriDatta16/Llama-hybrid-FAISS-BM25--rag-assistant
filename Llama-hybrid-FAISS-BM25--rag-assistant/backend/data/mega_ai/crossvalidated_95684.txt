Let's say for the Bernoulli Distribution, in this case the toss of a coin. Clearly this is a binomial distribution $B(n=400,p=0.5)$, and it is indeed close to $N(\mu=200,\sigma^2=100)$. Obviously the interviewer is asking for the result of $k$ with $95\%$ confidence interval with $B(n=400,p=0.5)$, or the $p$-value of $B(n=400,p=0.5,k=220)$. In the Bayesian approach, your prior is that $p=0.5$ instead of $\pi(p=0.5)=0.5$ and $\pi(p\neq0.5)=0.5$ Let's use some other more fair prior that $\pi(0.49\leq p\leq0.51)=0.9$ and $\pi(p 0.51)=0.1$. We assume $p$ has uniform distribution within each interval. We then can calculate the posterior $P(0.49\leq p\leq0.51|k=220)$. Or highly likely the prior is a normal distribution $p$ ~ $N(\mu=0.5,\sigma^2=0.25)$, or we may assume much smaller variance such as $\sigma^2=0.1$. Then we calculate the posterior distribution of $p$ as $f(p|k=220)$. My reputation is not enough for me to write comment under the Question. Instead I'm gonna write something here regarding You Can't Bias a Coin . @Adrian Here's what we have The experiment result $B(n=400,k=220,p=\theta)$ The theoretical and experiment study You Can't Bias a Coin Here's our Hypothesis $H_0:$ The coin is fair, or $\hat\theta=0.5$ $H_1$: The experiment data is wrongly recorded Here's our result Based on the paper You Can Load a Die, But You Can't Bias a Coin , we accept hypothesis $H_0$. Based on the experiment result that the difference is twice the standard deviation, we roughly have 95% confidence level to accept hypothesis $H_1$, that the experiment study is wrongly recorded. Since the $p$-value for hypothesis test to reject either $H_0$ or $H_1$ is roughly below 5%, we must accept them both. Or we must reject them both. Otherwise we create double standard for hypothesis testing here. We cannot accept the Hypothesis that the toss of coin is fair and the experiment data is correctly recorded . It does not make sense to say that the coin has a probability p of heads We have experiment result to back up this hypothesis. If the experiment is repeated n times, is it possible that we have the prior of $p$ for the coin toss as $N(\mu=0.5,\sigma^2)$ when n is considerably large? If that is acceptable, we can then estimate $\sigma^s$ with 95% CI based on method of maximum likelihood.
