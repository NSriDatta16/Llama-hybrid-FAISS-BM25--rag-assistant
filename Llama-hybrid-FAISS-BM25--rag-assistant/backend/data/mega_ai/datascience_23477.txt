Non Scaled New Actual Data

I am new to Machine Learning and I have a conceptual question. I have a scaled dataset (scikit-learn and pandas). After training/testing my algo, I will make new predictions using new actual data which will not be scaled or normalized. Will this discrepancy be a problem, if so, how should I resolve it? Best,
