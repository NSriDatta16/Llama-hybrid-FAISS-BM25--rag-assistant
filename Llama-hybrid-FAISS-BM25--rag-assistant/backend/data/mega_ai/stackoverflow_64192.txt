Lotus Notes/Domino stores mail in a Notes database. There are APIs available for getting documents (emails), reading field values (From, Subject), and detaching files. APIs include -LotusScript (VB variant, available within the Notes database) -Java (from within or external to the database) -C API (external) -Same API available through COM server You can create a "scheduled agent" within the database (using LotusScript or Java) that can locate documents created since it last ran, locate the attachments, and extract them. The agent will need to be signed with an ID that has the appropriate permissions on the server, including those required to write to the file system and initiate any other processes. External to the database, you can use any API except LotusScript to log-in to the server/mail database, and follow a similar process, e.g. extracting the files locally on a client or separate server. C API and COM require a notes client install, but Java applications can be set up to run via CORBA/DIIOP without a full install. Consult the Domino Designer help (or IBM's website for C API) for more information. As to a "generic way" to do this, if you are accessing data in Notes and needing to extract attachments, I believe these APIs are your best option. If you envision porting the application to another mail system, consider decoupling the API routines via an "interface" so you only need to add a new implementation of that interface to support a new mail system.
