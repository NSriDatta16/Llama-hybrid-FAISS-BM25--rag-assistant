Browser Bookmarklet To Pull & Store Selected Text From Active Window

Firstly, I should make it clear that I am not a programmer (merely working out the details of an upcoming project). So please go easy on me if some questions sound silly. Basically, I have a requirement to create a browser bookmarklet. This can be dragged on to the user's status bar. So this is how it should work : when I am on any particular webpage, I can select some chunk of content from the page and click on the bookmarklet. On doing this, the bookmarklet should save all the selected data in my database. Now, what I would like to know is if this is possible if I also want to store all formatting, hyperlinks,etc from the selected text. For instance, the portion of webpage I select on a browser window may include some images, links, bold text and three paragraphs. Is it possible for me to capture all of these by a simple click of a bookmarklet? Thanks a lot for the help. PS : I tried searching for this information on this website, but no answers seem to delve with this specific problem.
