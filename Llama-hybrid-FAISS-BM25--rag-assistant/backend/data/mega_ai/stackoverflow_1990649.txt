Yes, but it would be a hack. You would have to look at the session storage mechanism and read it directly. I believe it is files by default, stored in /tmp . If you need to be more precise about it, consider defining your own session storage mechanism and then providing exta hooks to accomplish what you want. http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.session-set-save-handler.php
