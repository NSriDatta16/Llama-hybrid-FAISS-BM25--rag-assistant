android adb won't start

I can't get the adb to run. From the dos line when I type adb I get "error: write failure during connection. I'm running Motodev's eclipse (probably Ganymede or Galileo) on windows XP. I've reinstalled eclipse and android three times from an administrator's account, and I've removed all virus software from the computer. The complete error dump is: _adb_connect: host:version socket_loopback_client: port 5037 type tcp => fd 100 writex: 100 0022BB57 4: 30303063 000c _socket_set_errno: unhandled value 10022 writex 100 -1 Invalid argument adb_close: 100(lo-client:5037) error: write failure during connection any ideas as to what's stopping adp?
