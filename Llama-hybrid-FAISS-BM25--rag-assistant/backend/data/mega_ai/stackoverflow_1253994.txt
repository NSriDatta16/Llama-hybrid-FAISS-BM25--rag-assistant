Any side-effects from deleting Reader and Contributor groups in TFS?

I want to set up TFS permissions to better reflect the responsibilities and levels of clearance of different roles within my organization; I'm finding that the default Reader and Contributor groups are too coarse-grained for my needs (and too loosely named). To keep maintenance overheads to a minimum, I'm therefore thinking of replacing the Contributor and Reader groups with my own groups, but... is there any negative side effect of deleting those two groups? Does any part of TFS rely on them being there?
