I am getting Could not find UpdatePanel with ID Exception while using UpdatePanel

On an aspx page i am having a dropdownlist and a panel control the dropdownlist autopostback is true. in dropdownlist control there are two options and depending on the option selected by the user i display a user control containing ajax updatepanel with a timer configured to launch async request after every one second. the problem arises when user selects the other option in dropdownlist control and the user control gets changed in the panel control. The error which is occured is shown below: Sys.InvalidOperationException: Could not find UpdatePanel with ID 'ctl00_ctl00_cphMainMasterPage_ChildContent_ctrlPinStatusMonitor_updpnlPinStatus'. If it is being updated dynamically then it must be inside another UpdatePanel. I thnk the problem is that the last control which have launched the async request is no more available in the panel control and gets replaced by the new other user control. Can anyone suggest a solution to get rid of this error.
