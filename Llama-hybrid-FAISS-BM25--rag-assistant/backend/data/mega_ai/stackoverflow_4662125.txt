By far and away your best option is to use the new menu functionality within WordPress. It's dead straight forward to set up in your theme: add_theme_support( 'menus' ); add_action( 'init', 'register_my_menus' ); function register_my_menus() { register_nav_menus( array( 'public-menu' => __( 'Public Menu' ), 'sidebar-public-menu' => __( 'Sidebar Public Menu' ), 'sidebar-members-menu' => __( 'Sidebar Members Menu' ), 'sidebar-staff-menu' => __( 'Sidebar Staff Menu' ), 'footer-menu' => __( 'Footer Menu' ) ) ); } place that in your functions.php file (and obviously change it for your requirements). Then in your template file - probably sidebar.php you'll want something like: 'sidebar-staff-menu', 'container' => false ) ); ?> And then go to the back end of WordPress (your wp-admin) and then go to Appearance > Menus and voila you're able to drag and drop your categories to your heart's content!
