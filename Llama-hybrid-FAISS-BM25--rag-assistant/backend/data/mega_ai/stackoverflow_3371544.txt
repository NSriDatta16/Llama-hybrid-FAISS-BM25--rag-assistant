A JavaScript Array also inherits from Object, so it will get all the capabilities of an object. JavaScript Arrays have additional functionality though: var myA = ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']; var myO = {0: 'foo', 1: 'bar', 2: 'baz'}; // these both give us "foo": console.log(myA[0]); console.log(myO[0]); // array has additional methods, though: console.log(myA.pop()); console.log(myO.pop()); // While you can add integer properties to regular Objects and add non-integer properties to Arrays, this won't give an Object the special properties and methods that Array has, and Array's special functionality only applies to its integer-keyed properties. A good reference to all the extra properties that Arrays inherit is the Mozilla Developer Center article on Array . Make sure you pay attention to the little "non-standard" and "Requires JavaScript 1.x" notes if you want to maintain cross-browser compatibility.
