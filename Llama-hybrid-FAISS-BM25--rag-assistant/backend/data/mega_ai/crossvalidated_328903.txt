This is an over simplified and misleading plot. Ultimately performance is determined by the quality of the predictors and the signal to noise ratio. Adding more rows of data (more examples) may help with SNR but can't improve the quality of the predictors, whether you take a deep learning or alternative approach. The unbounded trend in the plot suggests perfect prediction is attainable if only one had enough data. The truth is that in many contexts deep learning will perform no better than other approaches. It may perform better, particularly when you add more columns (predictors), but this is certainly not guaranteed.
