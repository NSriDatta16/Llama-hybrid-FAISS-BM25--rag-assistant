a.) I believe the answer is yes, at the mysql level the connections will wait indefinitely for mysqldump to release the table locks. You can control this a bit at the application level by using a connection pool with a validation query that queries against the tables getting locked and setting the timeout for retrieval to whatever you want. This would be pretty easy to do in c3p0 for example. However, in the absence of other information, I would not recommend this approach; it seems pretty kludgey. I've not used the mysql C driver so I can't so for certain, but I would assume similar behavior to Java. All of this is why for mysqldump is not a good option for a live backup of systems with non-trivial amounts of data and activity. b. All tables dumped will be dumped as part of a single transaction, thereby yielding a consistent snapshot for all of the tables participating in the dump. Primary-foreign key relationships will have no bearing on the transaction. Using single-transaction is viable option for hot backups.
