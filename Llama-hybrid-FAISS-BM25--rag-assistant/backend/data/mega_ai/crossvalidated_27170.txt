If selection of validation data is difficult because of dependencies, then it might be better to consider using Bayesian regularisation instead of early stopping to avoid over-fitting as the validation set is not then required. Most neural network packages have an implementation of this procedure, for MATLAB I would recommend NETLAB . Note however that the dependencies in the data may cause a problem of model mis-specification (as the standard Bayesian approach assumes the data are i.i.d.). So it is worth a try, but not guaranteed to work.
