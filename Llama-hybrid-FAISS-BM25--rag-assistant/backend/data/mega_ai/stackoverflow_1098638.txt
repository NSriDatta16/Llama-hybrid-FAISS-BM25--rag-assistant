Browser stats suggest it would be a waste of time. From my own relatively high-traffic public-facing website, older browsers (generation 1 firefox, netscape 5 or less, MSIE 5 or less) last month registered 40,000 hits out of 8.3 million, or 0.5%. It also seems to me that any organization restricting you to some ancient browser might be the same ones that restrict you from browsing the BBC. None of the companies I deal with at work have restrictions for older browsers either, and we have a couple hundred clients ranging from small to fortune 500. Thank goodness too - I can't imagine trying to make our application work for older browsers.
