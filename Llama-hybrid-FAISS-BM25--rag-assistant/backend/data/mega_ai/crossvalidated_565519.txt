changing intercept logistic regression in R

I did logistic regression and got an intercept of -14 and a beta_1 of 0.17 . My equation is: -14 + 0.17*x = y How can I calculate the change of probability if x increases by 0.1 , assuming a original probability of 20% ? Can I change beta_0 to log(0.2/0.8) and then add 0.1*0.17 ?
