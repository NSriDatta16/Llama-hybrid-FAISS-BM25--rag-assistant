The mean of a probability distribution is also called its expected value. For a discrete random variable, $X$, its defined as: $$E[X] = \mu = \sum_{x}x P(X=x)$$ Where $P(X)$ is the probability mass function and the sum is taken over all values that $X$ can take. For a continuos RV simply replace the summation with an integral. The mean of a sample of points $(x_1, ..., x_n)$, also known as the sample mean , is the arithmetic average of all points, defined as: $$\bar{x} = \frac1n \sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i$$ In literature, we reserve the use of $\mu$ to denote the true population mean and $\bar{x}$ as the mean of a sample of points, from some population.
