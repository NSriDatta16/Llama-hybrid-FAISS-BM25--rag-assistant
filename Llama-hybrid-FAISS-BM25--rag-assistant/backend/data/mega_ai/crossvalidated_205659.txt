Thanks for posting the data. Here are four of several possibilities. Top left is a quantile-box plot, a hybrid of quantile plot (points shown in order) and box plot. In addition to boxes showing medians and quartiles, extra horizontal lines show means. Both distributions show slight positive (upward, but conventionally called right) skewness. Top right is a dot plot or strip plot with stacking (a little arbitrarily with bin width 0.02) and means superimposed. Bottom left are histograms with arbitrary bin width 0.05 and bin limits multiples of the same. Bottom right are conventional box plots with the Tukey rule of showing points separately that are more than 1.5 IQR from the nearer quartile. That rule selects two points in each case. Those two points are not the only points that straggle a little, but it takes the first two plots to make that really clear. These designs are not exhaustive, even less definitive, and elements could be added to or subtracted from each. As in quantum physics and certain kinds of philosophy, superficially contradictory statements are both correct: The example data are rather well behaved with at most one awkward feature to note, the slight skewness. In these circumstances, all graphs show the main message faithfully and without serious distortion . There is still room for argument among close competitors about which design is best . My personal bias is to designs showing all the data so that I can decide for myself what is trivial noise, what is interesting fine structure and what are clear signals. When it's somebody else's data, I often distrust the graph designs chosen, as when for example there is interest in means and people show box plots (but not means!). The next possibility I would try given infinite energy would be a quantile-quantile plot for both groups with a normal (Gaussian) distribution, as suggested by @EngrStudent. In this case a transformation, e.g. to logarithms or reciprocals, might be contemplated, but as the data vary less than twofold, the effect might be modest.
