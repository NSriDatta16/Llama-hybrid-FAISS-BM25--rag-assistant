Normal Distribution (using calculator)

I know this is more a calculator question than statistics, but here it goes. My statistics professor is wanting us to rely on our calculators, but I'm having trouble with my NSpire CAS. Here's an example: According to a report by Scarborough Research, the average monthly household cellular phone bill is 73 dollars. Suppose monthly household cell phone bills are normally distributed with a standard deviation of 11.35 dollars. What is the probability that a randomly selected monthly cell phone bill is between 80 dollars and 90 dollars? The answer, in my book, is .2008, but I'm getting .20161 on my Nspire (using the normCdf function). I know that isn't that much of a difference in answers, but my online homework is picky, not to mention, I know my professor might have questions with similar multiple choices on our exam.
