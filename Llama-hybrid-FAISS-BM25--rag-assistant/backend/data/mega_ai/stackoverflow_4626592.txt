RIA Services error

I have a domaindatasource with a filter descriptor. This is for a textbox used to search the data. it filters out only the names which start with the text. I'm getting an error whenever text is entered in the search box. Part of the error message says this: 'The method 'Skip' is only supported for sorted input in LINQ to Entities. The method 'OrderBy' must be called before the method 'Skip'' I'm not able to drill down into it and locate the linq statement used by the filter only the original query. Can anyone tell me where this linq statement is or how i might find it?
