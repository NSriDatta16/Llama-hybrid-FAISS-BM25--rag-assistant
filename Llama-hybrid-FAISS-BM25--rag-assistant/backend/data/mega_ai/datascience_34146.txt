What does the long curve-shape t-SNE mean?

I use 1-D CNN input 1*512 size time series data which randomly fragment segment, the output will classify input into 10 classes. After training the CNN, I apply t-SNE to the prediction which I fed in testing data. In general, the output shape of the tsne result is spherical(for example,applied on MNIST dataset). But now I apply t-SNE on my own dataset. No matter how I adjust perplexity early, learning rate or maximum number of iterations. It will give me the result of long-shaped output, just like the pic below. Does the long-shaped t-SNE mean anything? Thanks everyone beforehand. Edit: Explaining about dataset contents. p.s. before feeding into CNN for training, I randomly split it into training/testing dataset.
