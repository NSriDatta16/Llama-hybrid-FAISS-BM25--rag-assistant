I will answer with a cautious No . Imagine that I select 100 volunteers to play a carnival game. They must make a basketball shot. That is our event X . Let's say we know that the average person makes the shot 60% of the time. Scenario 1 - Divide first then shoot 90 of the volunteers go to group A and 10 are assigned to group B. 60% of the volunteers make the shot as expected. Leaving us with 54 (90*0.6) in A and 6 (10*0.6) in B. Scenario 2 - Shoot first then divide All 100 volunteers shoot the basket and 60% make the shot as expected. Group A will have 54 and B will have 6. Conclusion No difference. The same probability distribution results. A smarter person will be able to prove this mathematically. But the crucial bit is that membership to a group must, in itself, not alter the probability of event X occurring.
