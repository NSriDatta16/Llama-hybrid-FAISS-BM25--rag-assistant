How can I measure the volume that a piece of text takes in a web browser screen with PHP (in server time)?

I need to store in a database pieces of text and the size of the layer that will wrap the text in the browser screen (I cannot build the layer in the client side - it is a requirement of the project). The whole piece of text must fit into the square layer properly. Users will be able to use different font size and font families from a small group of options and we'll know the selection at the time of computation. Right now, I compute the layer volume based in the theory that every character size is its font-size pixels height and 50% of the font-size width. With the 50% value, I got the best approximation for the average cases, but it is still not a good solution because it cuts pieces of text or leaves too much blank space at the end. And it's even worst with some wider font-types. Any idea on how to approach this problem?
