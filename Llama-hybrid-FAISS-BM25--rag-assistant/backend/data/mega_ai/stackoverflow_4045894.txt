How to apply, converting image from colored to grayscale algorithm to Android?

I am trying to use one of these algorithms to convert a RGB image to grayscale: The lightness method averages the most prominent and least prominent colors: (max(R, G, B) + min(R, G, B)) / 2. The average method simply averages the values: (R + G + B) / 3. The formula for luminosity is 0.21 R + 0.71 G + 0.07 B. But I get very weird results! I know there are other ways to acheive this but is it possible to do this way? Here is the code: for(int i = 0 ; i > 16) ; //bitwise shifting int G = (pixels[i] >> 8) ; int B = pixels[i] ; int gray = (R + G + B )/ 3 ; pixels[i] = (gray
