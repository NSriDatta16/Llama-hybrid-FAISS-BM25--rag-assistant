They're some sort of generative models, learning the PDF so that they can sample from it. This is achieved by having random latent representations and mapping them to the relevant domain. So, you can easily generate new samples, but, this is not the same thing as calculating the probability of that sample. The learnt parameters belong to the neural network, not the PDF itself directly. There is no explicit calculation of the probability. To do that, you may need to resort to Monte Carlo methods.
