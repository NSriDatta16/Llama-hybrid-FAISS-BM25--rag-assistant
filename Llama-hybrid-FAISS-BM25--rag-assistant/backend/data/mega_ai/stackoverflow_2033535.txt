Creating view from complicated select

I have quite complicated query from which I would like to create a view. The query looks like this: select s.avg as c3, fs.bayes, fs.sure, fs.visu, fs.fstd from ( SELECT AVG(q.c3), COUNT(q.c3), q.std FROM ( SELECT std, c3, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY std ORDER BY id) AS rn FROM ssims WHERE obraz = 'peppers2' and noisetype ='L' and data>'2009-12-23' and maska = 9 ) q WHERE rn It selects me averaged results of the tests with specified parameters. The output of this query returns 10 rows (std values from 5 to 50 with step 5, so 5, 10, 15...) and 5 columns: c3, bayes, sure, visu, std But I would like to be able to change the obraz and noisetype field for both sub-queries. So after creating such view I would like to be able to select results in this way: select * from my_view where obraz='peppers2' and noisetype = 'L' How to do it?
