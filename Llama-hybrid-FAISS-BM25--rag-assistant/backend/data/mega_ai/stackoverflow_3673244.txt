How are your users going to rank the tracks? Will they order them one after the other in some user interface? If this is the case, I suggest delegating the rank numbering to the client-side (the interface). Therefore if you'd be having an interface that allows users to drag and move tracks around to rank them in order, simply assign them a sequential rank number, and when they hit save, send this information to the database. UPDATE: If you want a new record to always be ranked last you could simply get the MAX(rank) WHERE memberid = ? and then INSERT the new row with a rank + 1 as you suggested in the question. Wrapping everything in a transaction will guarantee atomicity .
