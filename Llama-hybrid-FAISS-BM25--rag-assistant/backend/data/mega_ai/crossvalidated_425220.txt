I would give up on hopes of finding strong evidence of anything. avoid a null hypothesis statistical testing framework (i.e. don't trust any p-values). do an exploratory analysis consisting of looking at lots of plots (to start with, every independent variable against each of the dependent variables) and simply calculating correlation coefficients (while ignoring the p-values). if you want to be ambitious, you can write a Bayesian regression model and define priors for all the relationships, but it's probably not going to get you much more than an exploratory analysis in this case.
