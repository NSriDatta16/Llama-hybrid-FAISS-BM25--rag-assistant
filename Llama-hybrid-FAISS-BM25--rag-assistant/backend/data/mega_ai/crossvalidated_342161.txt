How do I know what my VIF limits should be for collinearity should be when doing binary logistic regression?

Using SPSS, I have determined that for each of my IVs the VIF is between 1.2 to 5.1. How do I know what is a good cut off and what is a bad one? How is this determined? Is it relative to the number of IVs or something else?
