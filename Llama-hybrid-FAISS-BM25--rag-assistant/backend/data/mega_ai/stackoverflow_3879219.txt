jQuery UI drag/drop sorting comparision using float:left vs display:inline-block

I have two examples here, only difference between these two example are one uses display:inline-block and other one uses float:left, li.doc_item{display:inline-block;} vs li.doc_item{float:left;} My problem is display:inline-block sorting is not as fast or responsive as float:left. I want to use display:inline-block because thumbnails that I am re-ordering sometimes can vary in size and float:left doesn't work well when thumbnails have different height and width. Any question is how to make block:inline-block as fast as float:left ? You can find comparative example here: http://dev-server-2.com/drag-drop-sample/
