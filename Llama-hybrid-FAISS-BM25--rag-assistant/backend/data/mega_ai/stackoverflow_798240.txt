A partial view is not 'rendered' by the browser at all. It's stuffed into the output stream of the server at the right point as the page is generated. Most likely you have some malformed HTML (elements crossed or not closed), and so you're seeing different things on different browsers. Update: I can't, at a glance, see anything wrong with that sample you've just added, but you need to look at the source for the whole page (at the browser), not just a fragment.
