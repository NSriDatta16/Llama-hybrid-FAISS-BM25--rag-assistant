You probably have to combine several techniques to achieve what you want. To catch the panning, I'd try overriding your MapViews onTouchEvent(), or maybe dispatchTouchEvent(), and listen for the MotionEvent.ACTION_UP event. This is triggered when the user lifts his finger from the screen: public boolean onTouchEvent(MotionEvent event) { if (event.getAction()==MotionEvent.ACTION_UP) { // Call your procedure here } return super.onTouchEvent(ev); } If you wanted to call your procedure during the panning, I think you'd have to look for the panning motion overriding one of the two same methods. Something like this: public boolean onTouchEvent(MotionEvent event) { if (event.getAction() == MotionEvent.ACTION_MOVE) { if (event.getHistorySize() 0.5f || Math.abs(diffY) > 0.5f) { /* Position has changed substantially, so this is probably a drag action. Call your procedure here. */ } } } To detect a change in zoom level you can override dispatchDraw: int oldZoomLevel=-1; public void dispatchDraw(Canvas canvas) { super.dispatchDraw(canvas); if (getZoomLevel() != oldZoomLevel) { // Call your procedure here oldZoomLevel = getZoomLevel(); } }
