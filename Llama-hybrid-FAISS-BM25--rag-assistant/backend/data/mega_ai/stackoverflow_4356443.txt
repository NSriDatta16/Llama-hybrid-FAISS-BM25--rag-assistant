@Josh The reason why your stylesheet doesn't seem to work is because, as you said, the HTML has inline CSS code which will always have more weight than the stylesheet. So, an easy solution that I can think of is to add "!important" after the values of your external stylesheet attributes. This will now give more weight to your stylesheet. For example: if your HTML has: hello world and your stylesheet has: p { color:blue; } your paragraphs will be red-coloured. But if you add the "!important", i.e: p { color:blue!important; } Now the paragraphs will appear blue :) Hope that fixes your problem!
