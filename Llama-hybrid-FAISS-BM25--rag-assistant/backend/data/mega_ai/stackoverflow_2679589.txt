Is there a way to easily serialize form input into xml or yaml for database storage?

I am dealing with an old app in asp classic vbscript. I'd like to store the input of a form in a database text field as the form fields are a subject to frequent change and I don't feel like normalizing the old database. Any solutions for serialization in vbscript? Thank you!
