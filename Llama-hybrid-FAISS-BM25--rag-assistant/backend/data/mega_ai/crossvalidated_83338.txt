Changepoint Analysis in R for Time Series Data

I'm new to R and statistics in general. My background is in Software Development, and I've tasked myself to solve a problem in a 3rd party application. This application is a Game, and I'd like to measure the existence of a performance problem. I measure performance in Frames Per Second (FPS), and for some reason under high load the system exhibits periodic drops (hesitation) in performance. I want to measure the frequency, severity of this drop in performance. The idea is to measure whether changes in the codebase/testing-conditions has changed the base & hesitation performance. I acknowledge this is similar to time-series analysis of data like stocks, temperature, etc. However the resources out there that I would like to apply hasnt quite sunk in yet. So I'm looking for set a responses for me to review and hopefully teach myself. I've been able to load data into R Studio and create graphs. I've followed a few other answers to create some smoothed lines, but it didnt quite work for my dataset. https://i.stack.imgur.com/AbRNC.jpg - An album of the data graphs. Any help would be appreciated.
