Heterogeneity test in meta-analysis

In a random effect meta-analysis model with one categorical independent variable $\theta_{ij}=\theta_i+s_j+\epsilon_j$ , where $\theta_{ij}$ is the observed effect size in category $i$ in study $j$ , $\theta_i$ is the mean effect size in category $i$ , $s_j$ is the random study effect, and $\epsilon_j$ is the within study error (or sampling error). We often further assume that $s_i$ follows a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance $\tau^2$ . $\epsilon_j$ is also normally distributed and its variance ( $\sigma^2$ ) is calculated from primary literature and is assumed to be known when fitting the model. In a model like this, meta-analysis software, such as metafor in R, can perform two heterogeneity test. The first is testing if among study heterogeneity is 0, that is, $\tau=0$ . This is done by computing a Cochran's $Q=\sum w_i(\theta_{ij}-\hat{\theta_i})^2$ . Here, $w_i=1/\sigma^2$ and $\hat{\theta_i}$ is the weighted average ( $w_i$ as the weight) of all $\theta_{ij}$ within the $i$ th group. Meta-analysis text book often says that Q is asymptopically chi-square distributed under the null hypothesis $\tau=0$ . The second homogeneity test is whether all $\theta_i$ are equal. This is done by computing a $Q=\sum w^*_i(\hat{\theta_i}-\hat{\theta})^2$ , where $\hat{\theta_i}$ is the weighted ( $w^*_i=1/(\hat{\tau^2}+\sigma^2)$ ) average of all $\theta_{ij}$ within the $i$ he category and $\hat{\theta}$ is the weighted overall mean. Again, Q follows a Chi-square distribution. The questions I have are In the first test, Why is Q asymptotically chi-square, not exactly Chi-square? We know for a normally distributed random variable, $(n-1)S^2/\sigma^2$ follows chi-square distribution. Q is essentially the same. Is it the weighted average that makes it asymptotically, but not exactly, Chi-square? Is the heterogeneity test for $\tau$ still valid in general for a linear mixed effect model? In a linear mixed model, we usually don't know $\sigma$ and have to estimate it using "ML" or "REML". Does this break the Chi-square distribution of Q? I have never seen the Q statistics for testing random effect in a linear mixed model text book. We know that likelihood ratio or Wald test for random effect tends to be conservative. If this Q statistics works in general, why isn't it adopted as a general test for linear mixed models? For the second heterogeneity test about the categorical predictor, is it just a Wald test? We know that Wald test or likelihood ratio test are anti-conservative in linear mixed model. Many text book recommends conditional F test (with df corrections) or simulation based inference. Is such anti-conservative nature still a concern for meta-analysis model? I don't know whether the fact that $\sigma$ is given to the model as a known quantity alleviate such problem. I have read a few meta-analysis textbook and search online but cannot find detailed explanations for these technical details. Any insights or references would be very helpful.
