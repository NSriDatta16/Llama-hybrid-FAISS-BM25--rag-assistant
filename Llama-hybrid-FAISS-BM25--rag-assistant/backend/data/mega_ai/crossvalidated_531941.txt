I am not sure because I don't know the reference, but I think that the authors have carried a PCA with an oblique rotation which permits correlations between factors, and thus, they are reporting the results. To get a similar result, you need to add an oblique rotation after PCA. Without that, PCA dimensions are orthogonal, e.g., uncorrelated to each others. EDIT From the comments below, the authors used an orthogonal rotation on 5 dimensions. If you wan to do exactly the same, use PCA, retains 5 dimensions and add a varimax rotation. Most softwares will let you record scores for each participant on every factors. Finally, carry out a correlation analysis on these extracted factors. You will have replicate this part of the analysis. I will leave this as an open comment, but I find this approach questionable. The correlations between factors are induced by the rotation. So variance that were not related to the original components (a kind of errors) are added to the rotated components. At best the the correlation matrix between rotated components only tells you informations on the rotation itself. At worst, they are commenting on "opportunistic" error (from optimizing loadings).
