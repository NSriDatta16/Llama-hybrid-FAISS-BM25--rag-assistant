For bracket expressions: To include a literal ] in the list, make it the first character (following a possible ^ ). To include a literal - , make it the first or last character, or the second endpoint of a range. To use a literal - as the first endpoint of a range, enclose it in [. and .] to make it a collating element (see below). With the exception of these and some combinations using [ (see next paragraphs), all other special characters, including \ , lose their special significance within a bracket expression. So this should do what you want: "^([]0-9a-z_[* -])+$"
