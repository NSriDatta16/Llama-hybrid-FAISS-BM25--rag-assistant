I'm not sure how the name originates but here is my opinion on it. The Bayes risk is some average of the risk function of the Bayes estimator, weighted by the prior. The least favorable prior only places weight on the part of the risk function that achieves the supremum. One example of such could be a Dirac delta at the $\arg \sup_{\theta} \text{R} (\theta, \hat{\theta})$ . However, there is a slight problem with this example. Namely, we cannot choose the least favorable prior after fixing a risk function, since the risk function is determined by the prior. So in reality, the prior comes first and the risk function of the Bayes estimator can be determined. If then we realize the prior happens to place all the weights on the supremum of the risk, we have found the least favorable prior.
