There is no technical reason to disallow any characters in a password. I guess in the case you describe, they would allow only alpha-numeric characters to avoid problems on the user's side (say, by entering a character that isn't available on keyboards in another country). Many providers and sites force users to choose very complex passwords containing a minimum number numbers and, sometimes, evenb special characters to prevent brute-forcing or dictionary attacks . I don't think forcing people to choose a complex password is wise. Passwords you can't remember, you will write down somewhere, which is often creating a much bigger security risk in real life. A simple rate limit in the login system (e.g. deny access for 15 minutes after 3 failed login attempts) takes the edge off the brute-forcing threat much more elegantly. One doesn't have to agree 100% with it, but I found this provocative paper on the subject from Microsoft Research very interesting. So Long, And No Thanks for the Externalities: The Rational Rejection of Security Advice by Users From the abstract: It is often suggested that users are hopelessly lazy and unmotivated on security questions. They choose weak passwords, ignore security warnings, and are oblivious to certificates errors. We argue that users' rejection of the security advice they receive is entirely rational from an economic perspective. The advice offers to shield them from the direct costs of attacks, but burdens them with far greater indirect costs in the form of effort.
