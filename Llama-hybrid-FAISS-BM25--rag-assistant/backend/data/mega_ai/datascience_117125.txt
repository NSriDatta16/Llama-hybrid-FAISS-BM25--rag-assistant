Prophet is quite well adapted to multivariate time series with or without seasonality, including events. Here are several codes that could be useful: https://grabngoinfo.com/multivariate-time-series-forecasting-with-seasonality-and-holiday-effect-using-prophet-in-python/ https://medium.com/mlearning-ai/multivariate-time-series-forecasting-using-fbprophet-66147f049e66 https://www.kaggle.com/code/bagavathypriya/multivariate-time-series-using-fb-prophet https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2022/04/an-end-to-end-guide-on-time-series-forecasting-using-fbprophet/ However, Prophet only works on time-series data and cannot handle missing data very well. Therefore, you can use Random Forest which can handle any type of data, but the time-series predictions could be worse than Prophet: https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/06/random-forest-for-time-series-forecasting/
