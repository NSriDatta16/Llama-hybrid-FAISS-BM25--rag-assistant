Why is my logistic regression fit that bad?

I was requested by a professor to analyze a high dimensional dataset (92 cases, 400+ variables, and a lot of NAs...) of various patient outcomes (gaussian distributed, counts, and binary) and their blood clotting tests. He requests confidence intervals over coefficients and a simple model, being no expert in statistics (and I am not either). The main goal is statistical inference, not prediction, and I am using R. So, after having researched different models for a long time, I came up with the following plan of analysis: Multiple imputation : following analyses are done on a pooled long format dataset. Bolasso : to select predictors for further analysis based on their frequency of selection. OLS or logistic regression : using the selected predictors. I proceeded by including predictors in decreasing order of bolasso frequency selection up to the first non significant (p>0.05) predictor. backwards stepwise regression (requested by my professor, less interesting to me as it has been extensively criticized in the literature) I used glm.diag.plots() from boot , and residualPlots() and influenceIndexPlot() from car . I already removed 4 influential observations that had a high Cook's distance, as explained in this book chapter , but to no avail. Why are the green fits in my residualPlots() totally off? Can I do anything about it? Model (outcome = bleeder y/n) Call: glm(formula = as.formula(paste(outcome, "~", paste(names(Q$bootstrapped.lasso$summary[signif.preds]), sep = "", collapse = "+"), sep = "")), family = "binomial", data = d) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.9947 -0.6291 -0.4362 -0.1706 2.5597 Coefficients: Estimate Std.
