Bash script for /dev semi-mounted volume

I am trying to write a bash script to automatically mount a volume that is in /dev (EC2 EBS storage). When the device is connected, it shows up as /dev/sdf (always)...but the "find" command does not work on it when it is there (just not technically mounted in /etc/mtab). These do not work: [ -f /dev/sdf ] && echo "It exists" || echo "It does not exist" [ -d /dev/sdf ] && echo "It exists" || echo "It does not exist" What am I missing?
