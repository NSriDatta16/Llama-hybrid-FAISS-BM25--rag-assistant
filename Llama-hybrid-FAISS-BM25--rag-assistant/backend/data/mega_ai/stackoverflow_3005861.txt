Thanks for all I found the solution when you call $("#divDoB").draggable({ disabled: true }); the JQuery insert a Css class that will set the opacity to.35 and that make the Item look in Disable mode so to keep the Same look and fell in both mode Enable and Disable I just set the Element opacity to 1 thanks for every one :)
