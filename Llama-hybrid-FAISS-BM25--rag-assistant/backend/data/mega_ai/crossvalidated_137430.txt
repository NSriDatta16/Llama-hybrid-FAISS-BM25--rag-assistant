PCA and diagonalization of the covariance matrix

I am preparing for an upcoming exam and having looked at older exams I found one PCA related question I am having trouble understanding: You have a dataset of $N$ two-dimensional points $\ y^t $. You want to perform PCA on the dataset. You have already estimated that the data is zero-mean and has the covariance matrix $$ S = \begin{bmatrix}10 & 6 \\ 6 & 10 \\\end{bmatrix} $$ and you know that covariance matrix can be diagonalized as $\ C^TSC = D $, where $$ C = \begin{bmatrix} 1/\sqrt{2} & -1/\sqrt{2} \\1/\sqrt{2} & 1/\sqrt{2} \end{bmatrix} $$ $$ D = \begin{bmatrix}16 & 0 \\0 & 4\end{bmatrix} $$ A) Explain how the matrices $C$ and $D$ are related to PCA? B) In 2-dimensional space, plot the PCA coordinates (direction of the largest and second largest variance of the data) C) Define the principal components of the data by $z^t=C^Ty^t$. What is the covariance matrix of $z^t$? I am having trouble understanding how to begin. Matrix $D$ seems to be a diagonalized $S$ (as the diagonal adds up to $20$) but how to perform any calculations on given data I have no clue. What computations should I perform in order to be able to plot the PCA coordinates?
