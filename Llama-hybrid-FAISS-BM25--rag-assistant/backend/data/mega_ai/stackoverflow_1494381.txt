If your needs are restricted to extracting values from an XML document and no more, XPath queries would be sufficient. The Sun JRE comes with a built-in XML parser, XSLT transformer and XPath engine. On other JREs you would need to package an XPath engine like Xalan. A good tutorial to get you bootstrapped on XPath in Java 5 is available at IBM Developerworks . The most important classes to start referrring to in the Java API documentation would be DocumentBuilderFactory DocumentBuilder Document XPathFactory XPath XPathExpression XPathConstants The first three classes would help you load the contents of an XML document, into an object, that you can later use in XPath queries. The latter four classes are important from the point of view of creating XPath expressions and for casting the result of the expression back to a suitable object in your application.
