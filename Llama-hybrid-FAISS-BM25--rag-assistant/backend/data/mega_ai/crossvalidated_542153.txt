If we can assume that the two measurements are independent and the errors are not correlated, then the measurements from you and your friend should be combined weighted by the reciprocal value of the variances - thus the measurement with the lower variance gets the higher weight: $$x_{fused} = \frac{\sum \frac{x_i}{\sigma_i^2}}{\sum \frac{1}{\sigma_i^2}}$$ The variance estimator for the combined value is $$\frac{1}{\sum \frac{1}{\sigma_i^2}}$$ which is always lower than the smallest variance of the single measurements. For the derivations, see this paper on Fusion of Continuous-valued Sensor Measurements using Confidence-weighted Averaging .
