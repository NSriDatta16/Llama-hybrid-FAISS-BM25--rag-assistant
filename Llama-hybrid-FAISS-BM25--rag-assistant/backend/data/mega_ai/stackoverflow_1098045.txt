Why doesn't type inference (var) work with the ASP.NET GridView.Rows property?

In this code fragment foreach (var row in grid.Rows) { } the type of row is inferred as Object instead of GridViewRow. I have to explicitly declare the type to work with a GridViewRow: foreach (GridViewRow row in grid.Rows) { } GridView.Rows returns a GridViewRowCollection and GetEnumerator on the collection "Returns an enumerator that contains all GridViewRow objects in the GridViewRowCollection." If I access a single row from the collection by index var row = grid.Rows[0]; the type is correctly inferred. Why can't the compiler infer the type for row in the foreach declaration? Edited to add: Interesting responses, I didn't think to look for the obvious problem. ListView.Items implements IList , so this looks like an oversight to me.
