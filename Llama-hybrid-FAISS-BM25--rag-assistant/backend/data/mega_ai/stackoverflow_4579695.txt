How to have Rails Views process HTML tags from database content?

Ok. I know this is very basic. I want to have some basic tags around text content in the database to be processed in the view's rendering. Basically, I have a model named Page. rails g model Page name:string content:text I want whatever is in the content field to be shown in the view but, if there is HTML in the content field, I want it to be processed not just shown. For example, in my Page#show view, I may have: Which outputs: This is my first paragraph . When I want it to output: This is my first paragraph . Again, please be gentle. I know this is probably pretty basic but I am having a hard time searching for how to do this. :)
