How can I use my Machine Learning trained model in an optimizer to reverse the problem (use as input the target, y, and get the resulting x)?

So, I have used scikit-learn to train a linear regression model on input variables, X, to predict property Y. Now, I want to be able to define a (min, max) range for Y, and get what are the possible Xs. My understanding is that I can do this with an optimizer, by using my trained model as an objective function in conjunction with scipy.optimize. However, I don't find any option that I can use to define the desired min,max for Y.
