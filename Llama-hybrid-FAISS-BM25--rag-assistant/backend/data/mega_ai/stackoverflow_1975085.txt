Getting real-time market/stock quotes in C#/Java

I would like to make an program that acts like a big filter for stocks. To do so, I need to have real-time (or delayed) quotes from the market. I started getting stock quotes by requesting pages from yahoo, accordingand parsing the html to the ticker, and parsing the html. I was wondering how to do this requesting and parsing html. Is there some way I can request only the stock quotes and its info? I know some applications do this, and I am very curious how they do it, because requesting web pages and parsing them is very time-consuming. Thanks, Dave
