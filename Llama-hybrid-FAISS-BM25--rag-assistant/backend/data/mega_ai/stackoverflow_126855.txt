Compute Users average weight

I have two tables, Users and DoctorVisit User - UserID - Name DoctorsVisit - UserID - Weight - Date The doctorVisit table contains all the visits a particular user did to the doctor. The user's weight is recorded per visit. Query: Sum up all the Users weight, using the last doctor's visit's numbers. (then divide by number of users to get the average weight) Note: some users may have not visited the doctor at all, while others may have visited many times. I need the average weight of all users, but using the latest weight. Update I want the average weight across all users.
