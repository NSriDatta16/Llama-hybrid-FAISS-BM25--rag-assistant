Performing PCA with only a distance matrix

I want to cluster a massive dataset for which I have only the pairwise distances. I implemented a k-medoids algorithm, but it's taking too long to run so I would like to start by reducing the dimension of my problem by applying PCA. However, the only way I know to perform this method is using the covariance matrix which I don't have in my situation. Is there a way to apply PCA knowing the pairwise distances only?
