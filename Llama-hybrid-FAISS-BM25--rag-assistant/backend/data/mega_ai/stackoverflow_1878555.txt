For your simple projects, yes, you'll always get one assembly per project. However, if you move towards more production ready software the answer is different. Let's say you want to deliver a DLL, but it contains text which must be displayed to a user. You probably want to localize that text (provide English and German versions or even US-English and Great Britain-English [think program vs. programme]). You'll place your text into resources and then compile those resources into what are called satellite assemblies. You'll get one satellite assembly for each locale which you choose to support. Here's a quick run down on how to generate and use satellite assemblies: http://sanjaysainitech.blogspot.com/2007/08/satellite-assemblies.html I see people talking about netmodules and ILMerge. I think that if you're worrying about netmodules then you're doing something wrong because you're not using the tools Microsoft gave you (or you're over in Mono land in which case you don't any tools from Microsoft). I haven't used ILMerge, but after reading about it I'm not sure I trust it. This person says it works fine except for WPF/XAML code; this person had trouble accessing embedded resources after running ILMerge; this person saw optimized code that couldn't be stepped though using a debugger after running ILMerge. That's enough information to tell me that ILMerge is not a production ready tool for all scenarios. Part of designing software is figuring out how you'll deploy it. If you want to deploy a smaller number of assemblies, you should design your software that way rather than mucking about in the IL after you've compiled it. As cartographers used to say, "Here be dragons."
