k fold cross validation

i want to use KFold from mode_selection instead of cross_validation ut it didn't work for the pobject Kfold from sklearn.model_selection import KFold import xgboost as xgb # Some useful parameters which will come in handy later on ntrain = X_train.shape[0] ntest = X_test.shape[0] SEED = 123 # for reproducibility NFOLDS = 10 # set folds for out-of-fold prediction kf = KFold(shuffle=False, n_splits= NFOLDS, random_state=SEED) def get_oof(clf, x_train, y_train, x_test): oof_train = np.zeros((ntrain,)) oof_test = np.zeros((ntest,)) oof_test_skf = np.empty((NFOLDS, ntest)) for i, (train_index, test_index) in enumerate(kf): x_tr = x_train[train_index] y_tr = y_train[train_index] x_te = x_train[test_index] clf.train(x_tr, y_tr) oof_train[test_index] = clf.predict(x_te) oof_test_skf[i, :] = clf.predict(x_test) oof_test[:] = oof_test_skf.mean(axis=0) return oof_train.reshape(-1, 1), oof_test.reshape(-1, 1) xgb_oof_train, xgb_oof_test = get_oof(xgb,x_train, y_train, x_test) i got this error TypeError: 'KFold' object is not iterable
