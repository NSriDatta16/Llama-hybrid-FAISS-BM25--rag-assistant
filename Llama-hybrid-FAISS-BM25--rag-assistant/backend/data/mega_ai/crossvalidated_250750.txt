Why is removing instationarities a good thing when trying to forecast a time series?

Most introductory texts or tutorials to time-series forecasting mention that one should de-trend and de-seasonalize a time series first so that it becomes stationary. It is then easier to forecast future values of the time series. I don’t completely understand this: Aren’t the trend and the seasonality of the time series the more relevant pieces of information? Once those two are removed, isn’t what’s left a random process equivalent to a coin toss or throw of a die for each new observation? When one removes the trend and seasonality, is there any deterministic signal left to forecast?
