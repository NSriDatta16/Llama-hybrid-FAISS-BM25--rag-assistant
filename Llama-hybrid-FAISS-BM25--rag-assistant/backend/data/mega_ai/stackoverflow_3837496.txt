The tempting mechanism is to use ThreadLocal storage, but in some App Servers this is dangerous - the App Server may use pools of Threads and a single request may be processed by different threads at different points. Some App Servers (I know WebSphere does) offer a specific API for this purpose. In WAS it's a UserWorkArea. See here for a reference, a little way down the article. I'm not aware of a portable solution to this problem.
