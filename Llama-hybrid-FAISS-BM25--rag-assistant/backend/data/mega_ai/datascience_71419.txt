Shall I install anaconda, with Python3 and R already installed?

On my Ubuntu 18.04, I have Python 3 and R installed. I am about to study some data science and just found https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/ . anaconda comes with Python and R and some packages. Will installing anaconda conflict with my existing installation of Python 3 and R? Shall I install anaconda, or shall I install the packages manually and individually on demand? How do people in data science install the tools?
