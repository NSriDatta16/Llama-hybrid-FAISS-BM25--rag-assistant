Nope, it's not possible out-of-the-box. Word does not assign a permanent index to paragraphs. The simpliest way, but it ain't so simple, to do this is to programmatically assign an index number of each Paragraph range item to a CustomXML control that wraps the paragraph on load or whenever you run it. For this or any other solution, you'll need to learn the Word object model and program it through VBA or VSTO or OpenXML.
