It sounds like your Markov chain can't travel among the hidden states because the modes on the probability surface are too far apart and/or separated by some very improbable states. For example, if your objects are vehicles and your two styles are "racecar" and "minivan", you'll have a lot of trouble getting from one to the other. Imagine trying to update the style variables one at a time--you'd have to traverse lots of wildly improbable states like a sports car with 7 seats or a minivan with no safety features and a giant spoiler. Your Markov chain doesn't want to sample those intermediate states, so it stays where it is. The original paper may have used EM because they recognized that they had no hope of moving between modes with MCMC and didn't bother to try. Or maybe more advanced MCMC methods like the ones I talked about here could sample the full distribution. Good luck!
