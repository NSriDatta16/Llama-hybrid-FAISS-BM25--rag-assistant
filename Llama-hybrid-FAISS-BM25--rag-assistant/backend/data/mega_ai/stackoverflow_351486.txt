You'll find more than one thread here about whether to start work from the database schema or the user interface. There's one place to look. I can think of far more than one tool that takes a schema and builds your CRUD UI for you ("scaffolding") than vice versa. There's another place to look. (Poster-child: Ruby on Rails and its cognitive offspring). When discussing ORM tools, there are too many times (but not all by any means) when the preferred acronym would be "ROM". We have a lot of tools that encourage us in our evil propensity for "Ready, Fire, Aim". For management, it's the shortest line between "Proof of Concept" and "RC1".
