YOLO : why does changing the confidence threshold change the mAP@0.5?

I trained a YOLOv7 model for a detection task. I have only one class, which is the object I want to detect. I ran test.py with --conf-thresh to 0.001 (default) and a second time with --conf-thresh to 0.5. I got the two following PR_curve and I don't understand what is happening. Isn't mAP@.05 defined to be the average precision at 0.5 threshold ? Why does the value change if I change the threshold ?
