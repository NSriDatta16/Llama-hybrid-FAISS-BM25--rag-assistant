You should be able to implement this in a fairly RESTful way with HTTP PUT and GET operations. This would be very useful for several reasons: Able to link to the storage directly from internal websites Easy testing Lots of libraries available to help you implement this No need to worry about what platform the client application uses I would suggest implementing it so that getting a file in a specific format is as simple as navigating to: http://www.myserver.com/filestore/documents/docname&format=xxx Within the server of course I would use a database of documents, file formats and cached versions of already converted files. I would invoke the third party translators on demand, i.e. when a request comes in for a document in a specific format and the document is not already in the cache.
