java networking, calls to write in average take 4x longer than calls to read, is it normal?

To be more specific, i have written a server with java NIO, and it works quiet well, after some testing i have found out that for some reason, in average a call to the SocketChannels write method takes 1ms, the read method on the other hand takes 0.22ms in average. Now at first i was thinking that setting the sent/receive buffer values on Socket might help a bit, but after thinking about it, all the messages are very short(a few bytes) and i send a message about every 2 seconds on a single connection. Both sent and receive buffers are well over 1024 bytes in size so this can't really be the problem, i do have several thousand clients connected at once thou. Now i am a bit out of ideas on this, is this normal and if it is, why ?
