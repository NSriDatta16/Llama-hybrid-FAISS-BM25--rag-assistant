Calculating average of averages in absence of complete data

I have a dataset with three variables: Cust_ID AvgSpend Location 1 10 A 2 200 A 3 140 B 4 250 B 5 40 C 6 60 C 7 90 D A customer's ID, The customer's average spend Location of the customer I only have these data, and I have been asked to calculate the average spend at each location. As far as I know, taking the average of Avg Spend here isn't going to be accurate. Do I need to ask for more data to calculate this? If I am not provided more data, is there any way to calculate the average spend at each location that I am not aware of? Elaboration: A business team is interested in getting a rough idea of how much a customer spends typically, at their locations. Hope this helps, because this is really all I have been informed of by our respected business users. Thanks.
