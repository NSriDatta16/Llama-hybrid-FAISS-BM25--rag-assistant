I think you are looking for 'Level of detail' algorithms. A simple one to implement is to break your volume (surface) into some number of sub-volumes. From the points in each sub-volume, choose a representative point (such as the one closest to center, or the closest to the average, or the average etc). use these points to redraw your surface. You can tweak the number of sub-volumes to increase/decrease detail on the fly.
