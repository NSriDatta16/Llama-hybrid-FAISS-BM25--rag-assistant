Figuring out Write in Unix

We've been assigned an ASCII compression project for Systems Programming, and I'm having a hard time with one specific line in my code. I asked a question about compressing, and I adapted the array code to my program after working through the first dozen letters of a sample file on paper. In ddd, the values of the packed[] array are what I worked out on paper, but the values aren't being written to the file. unsigned char packed[7]; //compression storage int i, jCount; int j; int bufferLength= sizeof(unpacked)/sizeof(char); //loop through the buffer array for (i=0; i 1)){ int writeLoop; for (writeLoop=0; writeLoop The write function expects a const void * as the second argument, which is why I'm referencing the value of that particular array slot, but nothing is written to the file. When I delete the &, I get a compile warning. Any suggestions to get me down the right path are appreciated.
