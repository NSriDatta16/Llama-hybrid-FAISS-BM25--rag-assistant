Statistics, in general, is about learning from the data, that is thought as intrinsically random. There’s no truly deterministic models in statistics. Even when statistician does build a model that is based on some mechanistic model of the phenomenon of interest, she would additionally account for the noise in the data. The name “frequentism” itself is about thinking of probabilities as of frequencies. Bayesian approach is even more extreme, assuming everything to be a random variable. In both cases, probability theory serves as a foundation.
