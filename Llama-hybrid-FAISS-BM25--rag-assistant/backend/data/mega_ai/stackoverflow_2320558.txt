Best way to move a project into a new project

I have not found any answer to why I cannot add a data model to an existing project. So given the fact that creating a project from scratch using core data for storage does create the data model correctly I am trying to move the entire project into a new project that contains the data model. No matter how I try to do it at some point it will the new project will not build. In my first attempt I tried just dragging an dropping from one to the other, clean all targets and build... disastrous. After trying several different approaches, the closest I came to success was as follows... created the new project (same name as my existing project) link the necessary frameworks copy the resources, ie plists, icons, picts create all the classes in the new project copy the contents of each .f & .m files of each class that does not reference any other class. For each class delete the .xib file and copy the .xib file from the existing project, clean all targets, check all links in the .xib, build. work my way through the remaining classes as in step 5 making sure that any referenced classes are always created first. Following this methodology I get to my last 2 classes and get a symbol(s) not found error on a reference back to one of the first classes I created. This error as far as I can tell has something to do with not having a framework properly linked, but I can't figure out how to fix it. Is there a better way to do this. I have a tech request in to apple on my data model problem, but can't afford to sit around and wait for their response. Thanks for any help. John
