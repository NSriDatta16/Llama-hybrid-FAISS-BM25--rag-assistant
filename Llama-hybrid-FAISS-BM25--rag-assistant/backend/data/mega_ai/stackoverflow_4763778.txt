What's the correct way to determine when a MapView's Lat/Lon window has changed?

I'm developing an Android application that uses a MapView . I'd like to run a procedure whenever the visible portion of the map changes (due to zooming/panning/rotating the phone/etc), and I'd like to pass the new latitude and longitude values to the procedure. I thought I could override onInterceptTouchEvent to do this, but then the procedure only seems to run when you first touch the screen (so, for example, panning by dragging your finger only calls the procedure at the beginning of the dragging motion). Which means the procedure is never called with the new coordinates. So -- what's the correct way to do it?
