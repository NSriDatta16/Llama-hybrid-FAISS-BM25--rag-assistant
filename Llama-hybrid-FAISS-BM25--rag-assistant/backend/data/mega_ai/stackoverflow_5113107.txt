This is going to be difficult to solve without javascript, if your gauge only moves by a couple of increments (say, 15, 30, 45... deg), you could use this tool: http://www.useragentman.com/IETransformsTranslator/ and manually pass the margin-left and margin-top values to IE. Otherwise I'd recommend javascript with CSSSandPaper by the same author. http://www.useragentman.com/blog/2010/03/09/cross-browser-css-transforms-even-in-ie/ .
