The easiest way to achieve this is to split your recent data into two time period: the recent data is that from 13 days ago to today. The previous data is that from 27 days ago to 14 days ago. From both vectors of 14 data points, you generate an average which give 14-days averages for these numbers, giving you two numbers $r$ and $p$ for the recent and previous periods, respectively. The rate of change $C$ is the difference computed in percentage: $$ C = \frac {r -p }{p} \times 100 $$
