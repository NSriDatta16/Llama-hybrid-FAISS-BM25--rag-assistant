My thoughts from an ecologist's perspective, especially in the context of: The ultimate goal is to estimate likely paths that the moose are taking into and then out of the bounded region. Movement ecology I mentioned this in a comment, but movement ecology might be the place to look. It focuses a lot on movement data, particularly from GPS trackers, but it's also a very young field. I'm not sure if the theoretical foundation is there yet to go from something like GPS data (which has temporal information, possibly speed acceleration info as well) to what you have (no temporal information, so you don't know the order of your tracks). Unfortunately, I only have a superficial familiarity with it, so I can't point to specific types of modeling/statistical analyses. But just a comment, you might be able to infer speed (or the magnitude of the vectors) by the stride length if you have enough tracks together in a sequence. Landscape ecology Depending on your goals and other types of data you might have access to, you could look at landscape ecology for inspiration. A very common goal of ecologists is to understand connectivity in landscapes, usually focused on a particular species, which is important for conservation planning. Connectivity in the landscape is directly related to movement. Low connectivity = low movement potential. Enter Circuit Theory (the ecological version, which is based on electrical circuit theory). In principle, if you have environmental data relevant to your species, you can create a resistance (or conductance) map specific for your species. For example, things like water and tree cover might indicate low resistance areas for moose, since that's what they generally need to survive, whereas a boulder field might be high resistance (they are more likely to go around it rather than through it). With that single resistance map, you can then model flow and connectivity to predict where your organism might move. Typically, this is based on a random-walk model due to its simplicity. With environmental data, your moose tracks can potentially be used to create a species distribution model . This in turn can be used as a conductance map for circuit theory. The idea being that if an area is considered "good" for the species, then it's probably easier for them to move through it as well. The problem is that species distribution modeling is a huge and complex topic. The most well known tool in (ecological) circuit theory might be Circuitscape . There are a ton of research papers and reports that utilize it. More recently, someone I know developed a generalization of circuit theory that incorporates absorption (e.g., mortality), and I developed the samc R package for it. Specifically , it allows you to calculate things like the probability of reaching a particular point, how many times an individual is expected to visit a point, how long it's expected to take to reach a point, how long an individual is expected to survive, etc. There is overlap between movement and landscape ecology, including incorporating the movement data with correlated random-walks, which can then be incorporated into circuit theory (something I hope to incorporate as an option in my package in the future).
