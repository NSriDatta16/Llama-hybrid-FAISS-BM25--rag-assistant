Preventing the Android "long press" to save images

I've written a web-app in HTML and Javascript for iPhone and Android which involves the dragging and dropping images. You initiate the drag by holding your finger over the image for about a second. However, Android then pops up the message giving me the option to save the image, set it as wallpaper etc. How can I prevent Android from doing this? Is there a metatag I can use? Some javascript?
