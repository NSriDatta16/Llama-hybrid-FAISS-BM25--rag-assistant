Constrained regression for binary dependent variable

I would like to discuss the methodology for the following case: I have a data for several patients over several years for 5 factors describing the health of a particular patient. Every factor consists of one or more questions depending on its comprehensiveness and importance. Each question is assigned to one of the four ordinal categories , which indicates patient's health condition within the factor. The best category is 1, while the worst one is 4. My task is to determine the final category using some kind of weighted average and then round the result to be in {1, 2, 3, 4}, so it's basically some kind of a scorecard/unbalanced longitudinal data. However, my dependent variable , which I want to calibrate these weights on, is binary , indicating whether the patient is alive or not in a way it is 0 when alive and 1 when deceased, thus when turning to 1, the following year the patient is no longer in the data . Patients can also be cured and then they disappear from data as well without having indicator variable equal to 1. The problem is the weights have to be non-negative and sum up to 1 , and there will be no intercept in the regression equation (weighted average). Another restriction is that each of the 5 factors has to have weight of at least 10% , so if the 1st factor consists of e.g. 4 questions, the sum of the associated 4 weights should be at least 0.1. I was thinking about some generalized linear models (logit, probit, survival analysis) with applying the mentioned linear constraints into some optimization quadratic programming algorithm, but I find the concept rather complicated, I don't really know what would be the best model and how to program it in SAS or R. I would be very thankful if anyone can help with some similar example or idea.
