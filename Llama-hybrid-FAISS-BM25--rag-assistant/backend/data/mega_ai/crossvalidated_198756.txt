How to test the productivity difference between two nurses?

I have this data with 60 observations for continues three days hours, in which two nurses work in irregular shifts to cover this whole period: hours Productivity Nurse 1 50% A 2 40% A 3 20% B 4 10% A 5 60% B 6 15% B 7 15% B . . . . . . 60 5% A I have been asked to build a time series model for the Productivity and decide whether there a strong Productivity difference between nurse A and nurse B. What is the right statistical approach to handle this question?
