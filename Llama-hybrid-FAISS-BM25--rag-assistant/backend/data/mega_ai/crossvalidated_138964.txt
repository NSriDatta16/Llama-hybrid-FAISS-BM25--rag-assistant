I don't think logistic regression is a good option for you as you have described your study question. You state that your substantive question is: if the first event happens, will the second event happen within a month of the first event. The probability of the second event happening within a month of the first event can certainly be calculated, and you could run a binomial test, but what is the appropriate probability for your null hypothesis? You could divide the total number of second events by the total number of months in your observation period, but that still leaves something to be desired. Moreover, you are throwing a lot of information away by doing this. (For example, what about second events that occur 32 days after the first event?) I think you would be better off using a survival analysis based approach. You could count the number of days from a given first event until a second event (or the end of your study period). Then you could get a survival curve, and perhaps a median survival with a confidence interval. It strikes me as likely to be a lot more useful to know if the median duration is close enough for your purposes.
