I agree with Steve Marx, casing does not seem to affect this issue. In fact Microsoft's Azure diagnostics tables are created with unusual casing eg: WADPerformanceCounters. I get the problem even in the dev environment. So it is something else entirely - my opinion. Error fixed in my case: The problem was an error with the connection string as defined in (or lack thereof) in the webrole or workerrole project properties. Fix: Right-click on the webrole under "Roles" folder in your cloud application. Select "Properties" from the context menu. Select the "Settings" tab. Verify or Add a setting for you connection string that you will use to initialize table storage. Mine was a simple error - no setting for my connection string.
