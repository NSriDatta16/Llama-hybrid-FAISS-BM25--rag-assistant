SQL Primary key sort order

I am using MS SQL server 2005 I have a table with 3 columns where I store user-message mapping like: msg_for msg_from msg_id bob bob 1 bob john 1 bob steve 1 bob bob 2 bob john 2 bob bob 3 bob john 3 bob steve 3 The PK is on 3 columns and msg_id is FK to messages table that stores the messages The above is the physical storage I see according to the PK on 3 columns Now my query MUST return the messages for a given user having latest msg at top (order by msg_id DESC) bob john 3 bob steve 3 bob john 2 bob steve 2 bob john 1 bob steve 1 This mapping table has millions of rows. I see 95% of the cost is to SORT the result. Is it possible to have the PK or some other way store data physically like this (avoid SORT)? msg_for msg_from msg_id bob bob 3 bob john 3 bob steve 3 bob bob 2 bob john 2 bob bob 1 bob john 1 bob steve 1 Thanks
