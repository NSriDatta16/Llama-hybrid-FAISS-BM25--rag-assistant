In Bayesian setting we are dealing with posterior distribution, that is defined in terms of likelihood and priors $$ p(\theta | X) \propto p(X | \theta) \, p(\theta) $$ If you need to constrain the parameters, you can do this by constraining the priors , or by transforming them . If you'd assume a prior that is zero for some region of the possible values of the parameters, multiplying likelihood by it would also zero-out the posterior probability over this range. Alternatively, in some cases you can transform the parameters. For example, if you have unconstrained parameters $\theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3$ , and need $\eta = \theta_1 + \theta_2 + \theta_3 \le 0$ , you can transform it by taking something like $\eta = -\exp(\theta_1 + \theta_2 + \theta_3)$ would make it negative, or course there is an infinite number of other possible functions. This is easier discussed on practical, rather then abstract, examples, since in such cases it is often easier to come up with reasonable reparametrizations of the model.
