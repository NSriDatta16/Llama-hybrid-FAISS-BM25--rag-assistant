AB testing vs testing the null hypothesis

I'm trying to understand the difference between testing the null hypothesis (i.e. testing that the probability of a "goal" is the same across 2 different populations, similar to prop.test in R) an A/B test using a bayesian formula such as described here: http://www.evanmiller.org/bayesian-ab-testing.html Is there a difference? Is one preferable? The problem I'm facing looks something like this: control group has 100,000 impressions and 100 reactions test group has 50,000 impressions and 55 reactions
