Clustering of multiple very similar time series

so I have around 100 measurements of the current from a welding system. Each measurement has different sizes, but all are between 40k and 90k samples. Some tests were done with very high (and different frequencies - 100, 200 hz) pulsed currents and others with continuous current. What I am trying to do is compare them, or cluster them? or something? To detect the interesting features that differentiate them. I was thinking of using first autoencoders to simplify every reading, and then use a Kmeans clustering. But this sounds to be a lot of work and some kind of work around. Then I found direct clustering of time series, would this make more sense? I am definitely not an expert, some guidance would be appreciated. Thank you!
