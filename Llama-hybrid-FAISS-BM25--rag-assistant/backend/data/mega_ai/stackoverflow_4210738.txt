There seem to be two problems here. First, you're calling redirect when matching everything. So, the user requests account.myapp.com/ and that matches anything so they get redirected to account.myapp.com/ie, but that also matches anything and so they get redirected to account.myapp.com/ie and they get redirected again. It becomes an infinite loop, but you probably didn't see this because Rails wouldn't even match it due to the second thing. Second, Rails requires you to put a name in there. You can use " url" or whatever you like (path, page, whatever). That's so that Rails can assign the requested path to that name in params - so that you get params[:url] with whatever the path is. I was a little surprised that it wouldn't let you just use " ", but it doesn't. This works for me: constraints :user_agent => /Firefox/ do match "*url", :to => "ie#index" end I'm on a Mac and don't have IE to test with, but you can easily sub IE into there.
