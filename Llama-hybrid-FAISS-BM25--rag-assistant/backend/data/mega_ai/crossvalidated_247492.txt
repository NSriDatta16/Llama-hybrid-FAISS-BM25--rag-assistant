Help interpreting Elasticnet

I have a dataset from the telecom sector that had 150+ columns for 7 months. Every row was essentially a line item containing cost,revenue and profit information for a subscriber. there can be between 0 and 1000 line items per subscriber per month and summing them up gives us the monthly cost, revenue and profit for that subscriber per month. However having just sums would make me lose a lot of information like most services used by subscriber etc. So I decided to work around that problem by flatening the table and converting all the catogorical variables into numerical ones (absolute value of monthly profit that came from them). I ended up with a wide data set for 2000 subscribers having about 3000 columns. Each row has now the catagorigal data for seven moths per subscriber as well as their monthly sums and the average monthly sum across 7 months. The resulting data set is fairly sparse. I would like to predict the absolute monthly profit for the 7th month based on all the values of the previous 6 months. I'm using the following tutorial to try out ridge,lasso and elastic net regression on my data to see which one would provide better results . However, I'm having trouble interpreting the results. I'm new to statistical learning and come from more of a computer science background so please excuse my lack of statistical knowledge. I would really appreciate it if someone more knowledgable in stats and R than I'm will have a look at my code and point out how I could get the RMSE for the best fit and also explain the plots to me. library (glmnet) require(caTools) set.seed(111) new_flat The plot in the code looks like
