Embedding fonts is technically doable these days, using @font-face rules. You will need to provide fonts in both EOT format (for IE) and TTF/OTF (for everyone else, with WOFF in the future). See eg. here for some strategies to serve different browsers as smoothly as possible. The problem is more likely to be legal than technical. Conventional commercial font licenses do not permit this kind of font embedding.
