Ok. Here's how I did it. I replaced... clsDragStack.prototype.selected = function (){ return _selectStack; }; with... return { selected : function(){ return _selectStack; } }; ..still within the main body of the class. If anyone can explain to me what the hell is going on here I'd be very grateful! Especially what this return {name: function(){}}; structure is - and why in my original implementation it was returning the original array even though it had been modified??
