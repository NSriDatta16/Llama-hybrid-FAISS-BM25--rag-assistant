Getting PartCover.Browser.exe to show a coverage xml through command line

Need help with a silly question. How do I get PartCover.Browser.exe to load and show an existing coverage xml generated by PartCover.exe? I have a batch file that runs PartCover.exe and my tests and generates the coverage xml without problems. Then I try to load the xml with PartCover.Browser.exe. "C:\Program Files\PartCover .NET 2\PartCover.Browser.exe" "D:\coverage.xml" but that doesn't seem to work. Is it even supported? Can't seem to find any documentation on it either. I'm using PartCover 2.2. Thanks in advance.
