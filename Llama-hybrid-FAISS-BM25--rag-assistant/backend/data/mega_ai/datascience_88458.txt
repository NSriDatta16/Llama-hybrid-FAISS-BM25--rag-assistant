References/tutorials about data mining and machine learning

I am learning data analytics and I wonder if there are some good references and tutorials about machine learning, data analytics and data mining. What I'm searching for is an understandable reference/tutorial, which isn't very technical and isn't very basic either, in other words, the material begins with the basic steps towards advanced steps. Thank you.
