I think estimating production or population size from serial numbers is interesting if traditional explanatory example. Here you are trying the maximum of a discrete uniform distribution. Depending on your choice of prior then the maximum likelihood and Bayesian estimates will differ in a pretty transparent way. Perhaps the most famous example is estimating the production rate of German tanks during the second World War from tank serial number bands and manufacturer codes done in the frequentist setting by (Ruggles and Brodie, 1947). An alternative analysis from a Bayesian point of view with informative priors has been done by (Downey, 2013), and with an improper uninformative priors by (Höhle and Held, 2004). The work by (Höhle and Held, 2004) also contains many more references to previous treatment in the literature and there is also more discussion of this problem on this site.
