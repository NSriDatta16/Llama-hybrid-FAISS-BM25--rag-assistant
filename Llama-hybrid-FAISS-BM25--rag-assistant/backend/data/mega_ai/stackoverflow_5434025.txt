Javascript framework (RightJS) as content-script in a page-mod

I'm new to the jetpack world (and firefox extension for that matter) and while doing some research on the possibility of jetpack, I found something strange. I did a simple test project that included a javascript framework (RightJS) in a pagemod (the tutorial used jQuery and that seemed to works fine) and I got the following error : error: An exception occurred. Traceback (most recent call last): File "/home/nic/Aptgeek/TestProjects/ff-extension/data/external/libs/right-src.js", line 5979, in File "/home/nic/Aptgeek/TestProjects/ff-extension/data/external/libs/right-src.js", line 990, in TypeError: Array.include is not a function My main.js script is fairly simple : var pageMod = require("page-mod"); var self = require("self"); exports.main = function() { pageMod.PageMod({ include: "*", contentScriptWhen: 'ready', contentScriptFile: [self.data.url('external/libs/right-src.js'), self.data.url('test.js')], onAttach: function onAttach(worker) { worker.on('message', function(message) { console.log(message); }); } }); } After seeing that discussion : http://groups.google.com/group/mozilla-labs-jetpack/browse_thread/thr ..., I began to wonder about the jetpack javascript framework support. Am I using page-mod incorrectly ? Or should that work ? Is there any limitations concerning the use of javascript framework as content-script in a page-mod ?
