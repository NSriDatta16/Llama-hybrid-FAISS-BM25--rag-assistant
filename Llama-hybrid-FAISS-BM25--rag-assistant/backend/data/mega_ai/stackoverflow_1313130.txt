In order to determine whether to go with a virtual or clustered solution the requirements for fault tolerance need to be detailed. Does the solution need to accommodate for hardware failure, storage failure, or instance failure? If the server goes down how simple/complex should the recovery process be? What is the planned hardware resource utilization? Both virtual and clustered solutions will offer hardware failure tolerance. SAN storage will likely cover the storage tolerance. Does the application need to come up immediately after a failure? If it fails in the middle of the night what level of interaction is needed to bring the application back up. Should it be automatic or manual? If it needs to be automatic, should this be built into the technology or something that gets coded around? Depending on the answers to the questions above either the virtual or clustered solution may fit the needs for high availability. I'd recommend laying out the requirements and often that will point to the solution that fits. Sorry the answer is mostly questions but they'll point you to the appropriate solution.
