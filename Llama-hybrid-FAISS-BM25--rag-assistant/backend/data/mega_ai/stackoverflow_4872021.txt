How to get all results, except one row based on a timestamp?

I have an simple question (?) about SQL. I have come across this problem a few times before and I have always solved it, but I'm looking for a more elegant solution and perhaps a faster solution. The problem is that I would like to select all rows in a table except the one with the max value in a timestampvalue (in this case this is a summary row but it's not marked as this is any way, and it's not releveant to my result). I could do something like this: select * from [table] t where loggedat But when working with large tables this seems kind of slow. Any suggestions?
