Why are svm training labels +/- 1?

I'm new to svm and I've been looking for a svm to use. From all the ones that I've seen, the training label vector is basically a m by 1 vector of 1 and -1. I don't understand why this is so. I was under the assumption that each row of the training vector should be a unique number that labels its respective trained instance. So a m by n matrix, of m training instances each with n features should have m labels that labels each instance. That seems logical to me. But it seems like I'm not quite understanding this. Can someone explain?
