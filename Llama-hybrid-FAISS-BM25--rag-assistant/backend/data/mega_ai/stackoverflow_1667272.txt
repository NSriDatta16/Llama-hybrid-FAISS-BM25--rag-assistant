Page class outside of App_Code will not compile

I have a website that has 2 files as follows: page.aspx page.aspx.cs It used to be that I could just drop new files onto the web server and IIS would automatically compile the files and I could access the page e.g. http://www.website.com/page.aspx ... and the associated functionality in the page class contained in the .cs file would work nicely. Now I get the error: "Could not load type namespace.classname" which refers to my page class. Now for some strange reason I have to put all my .cs files, even page classes into the app_code folder. All that has changed on my website is that I reorganised the structure so that instead of my pages being on the web root they are now inside http://.../newfolder/page.aspx . For some reason all my page.aspx.cs files now have to be in app_code. Any ideas?
