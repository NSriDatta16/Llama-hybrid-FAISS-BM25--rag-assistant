I think they are plenty valid approaches. I would first test a simple dense neural network architecture. You could have 2 * number_of_sequences input neurons, each pair being one neuron for the weight and another neuron for the sequence presence ( 0 : not present and 1 : present). Hidden layers depending on the complexity. Output 0 or 1 using a sigmoid.
