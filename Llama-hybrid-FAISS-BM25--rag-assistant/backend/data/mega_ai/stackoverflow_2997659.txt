The short answer is that you must have a Windows CE driver for the device. Obviously it's a composite device that enumerates as a storage device and also whatever the radio is. Windows CE understands the storage device part and therefore loads up the driver for that. It has no idea what the radio is. You would have to either get a driver from the OEM (they probably don't have one, though it's always worth checking) or write your own (you probably don't have enough info on the radio chipset to be able to do that).
