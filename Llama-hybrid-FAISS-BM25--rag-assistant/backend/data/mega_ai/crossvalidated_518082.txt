In your model, $$E[\ln y \vert x, z]=\alpha + \beta \cdot x + \gamma \cdot z.$$ Here $z$ stands for other covariates. Taking the derivative of that with respect to $x$ , you get $$\frac{1}{y} \cdot \frac{\partial y}{\partial x} = \beta \approx \frac{\frac{\Delta y}{y}}{\Delta x}.$$ This means that $$ \beta \approx \frac{\frac{\Delta y}{y}}{\Delta x},$$ so that $100 \cdot \beta $ can be interpreted as the percentage change in $y$ for a one unit change in $x$ . This is a semi-elasticity. It is fairly straightforward to take rewrite this as $$\beta \cdot x \approx \frac{\frac{\Delta y}{y}}{\frac{\Delta x}{x}}.$$ Since $x$ is a variable, you can calculate the average elasticity in your sample like this: $$\frac{1}{N}\sum_i^{N} \beta \cdot x_i=\beta \cdot \bar x$$ In your case, $-0.17 \cdot \bar x$ would be the quantity your reviewer wants. It tells you the average percentage change in $y$ for a 1% change in $x$ .
