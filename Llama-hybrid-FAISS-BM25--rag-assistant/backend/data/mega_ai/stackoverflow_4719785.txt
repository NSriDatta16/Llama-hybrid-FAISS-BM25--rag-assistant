My testing methodology isn't up the snuff as in for example Java/Junit and I should really work more on this(improve). I should really practice TDD more. I played a little bit with expresso and liked to the fact that you could generate code coverage reports. What I thought was missing was something like @before @beforeclass @after which you can find in java. I also played a bit with nodeunit which does have setup/teardown. I still like to play a little bit more with this framework. I don't like the vowjs syntax, but it is very popular BDD framework, so maybe I should use it (more) to get sold like a lot of other users. But for now I am going to dismiss vowjs. I also played with zombie.js a litle bit which is also pretty cool. I also lately saw another cool testing framework which I can't remember the name, but there are luckily enough options to do testing in node.js. The only thing I don't like is that the integration with IDE is not up to snuff in my opinion. The IDE I had for Java cannot be compared with what I have found for node.js, but I think with a little bit effort I can make a more useful programming environment. I will try and keep you guys informed about this progress. P.S: But what I do like a lot is the npm package manager. When you compare it to for example maven you just say wow. I still has some minor bugs because it is still a young project. But still npm is very good in my opinion!
