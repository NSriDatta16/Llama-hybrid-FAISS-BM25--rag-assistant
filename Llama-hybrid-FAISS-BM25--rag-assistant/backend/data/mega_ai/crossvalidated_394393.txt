Can I use averages to improve the forecast of a multiple regression?

I have a cross-sectional multiple regression that I have estimated and now I would like to apply it to make a simple forecast of the dependent variable. Take the data generating process $$y_i =\alpha+\beta x_i+\Gamma Z_i+\epsilon_i,$$ where $y$ is the dependent variable, $x$ the independent variable and $Z$ some vector of covariates. I have performed the regression for the entire sample and estimated $\alpha$ , $\beta$ and $\Gamma$ accordingly. Now, I would like to make an out-of-sample forecast of $y_j$ , say, at indicator $j$ . All of $Z_j$ is known to me; however, $x_j$ is not. Now, it itches to take the average or conditional average of $x$ , i.e., $E[x|..]$ , of the original sample and use the it to predict $y_j$ . That is $$\hat y_j =\hat\alpha+\hat\beta \bar x+\hat \Gamma Z_j.$$ Would using the average or conditional improve the forecast in any way? Intuitively it appears to me the average or conditional average does not store any additional information to improve the prediction per se, but, if I have to leave out $x_i$ from the original regression and re-estimate it and then do a forecast without $x_i$ , it appears that I am losing out on the information stored in $x_i$ as well.
