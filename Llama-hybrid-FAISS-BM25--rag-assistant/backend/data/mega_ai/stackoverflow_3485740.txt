QC has many, many, many features that are not in Jira. It would make this post horribly wrong even to list them. I've been working with QC for over 2 years, and although I'm not big fan of it, I must admit, that all those QC features allows it to support almost every QA activity (if tool and testing process are fully and properly implemented in organization). As for the question, frankadelic you are right, maintaining QC defects and Jira Bugs in sync can be a pain. I would suggest: a) look at orasi plugin for Jira (link) b) look at Go2Group plugin for Jira (link) c) write your own plugin for Jira Unfortunately in my company none of those 3 solutions were implemented yet, so I can;' say much about them.
