Find repeating patterns in data

I have database of sequential events for multiple animals. The events are represented by integers so it looks something like: Animal A: [1,6,4,2,5,7,8] Animal B: [1,6,5,4,1,6,7] Animal C: [5,4,2,1,6,4,3] I can manually see that for each event 6 event 1 first happens. And event 4 happens quickly after a 1,6 combination. But these are easy to spot in such a small dataset, the real lists are 10000+ events per animal. Is there a way to use an algorithm or machine learning to search for these kinds of patterns?
