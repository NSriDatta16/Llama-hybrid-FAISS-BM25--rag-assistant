How to Organise a Domain Driven Design Project?

I've started learning about DDD and wanted to know how others have organised their projects. I've started off by organising around my AggregateRoots: MyApp.Domain (namespace for domain model) MyApp.Domain.Product - Product - IProductService - IProductRepository - etc MyApp.Domain.Comment - Comment - ICommentService - ICommentRepository - etc MyApp.Infrastructure - ... MyApp.Repositories - ProductRepository : IProductRepository - etc The problem i've bumped into with this is that i have to reference my domain product as MyApp.Domain.Product.Product or Product.Product. I also get a conflict with my linq data model for product....I have to use ugly lines of code to distiguish between the two such as MyApp.Domain.Product.Product and MyApp.Respoitories.Product. I am really interested to see how others have organised their solutions for DDD... I am using Visual Studio as my IDE. Thanks alot.
