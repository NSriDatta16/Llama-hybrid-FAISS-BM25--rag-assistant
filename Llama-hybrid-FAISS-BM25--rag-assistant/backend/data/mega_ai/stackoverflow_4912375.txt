I think this is more towards coding standards and best practices here. Organize your web application structure properly, best to use Mindmap to visualize the pages and the organization so that you can always have clear picture of where stuff were. Use a good IDE tool to organize stuff according to the practice of MVC where View to keep all your JSP pages. Within organize them with their components family and keep common JSP pages using common folder. Use built-in Search feature of Eclipse that allow you to search the source contents. Something might be useful for long run maintenance is to keep all your source code using Subversion so that you could compare various version of source code from past to future.
