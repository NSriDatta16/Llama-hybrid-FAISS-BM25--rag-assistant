Magento custom order attribute/fields? Shooting myself in the foot?

I'm building a Magento store using a single catalog over 4 domains: 1 for the US and 3 for Europe (UK, French, and German). There's 1 fulfillment warehouse in Europe, 1 in the US and a sort of unofficial/internal "warehouse" in the US where giveaways and such are fulfilled, and we are not tracking inventory levels in Magento. We need to track particular transaction types like plain web sales along with internal/admin orders like non web sales, giveaways, trade show orders, etc. My plan is to extend the core order model and adding some kind of "order/transaction type" field and then, upon the placement of an order, process the order data and direct which warehouse it is sent off to for fulfillment based on the store id and the 'order type' value. Being new to Magento, I want to know if this kind of setup is a bad idea for any reason. Am I shooting myself in the foot? Is there any reason a single catalog might be problematic? Is there an easier or better way of handling this flow? Is there a way to add custom attributes to orders like you can to products?
