Answers coming in from twitter R + packages @philmikejones R all the way! (both are good lets be honest, so just follow what you have greater knowledge of) — Mark Green (@markalangreen) May 15, 2017 @markalangreen Have you used a specific package for setting up your longitudinal data, or just base R? — Phil (@philmikejones) May 15, 2017 @philmikejones Depends on what you are doing but I tend to stick to data.table - I don't think there is that one 'golden' package — Mark Green (@markalangreen) May 15, 2017 @markalangreen @philmikejones agree - in my experience people using the forecast package by @robjhyndman usually use ts(), otherwise zoo or xts objects — andrea panizza (@unsorsodicorda) May 15, 2017 So, recommendations: data.table (which I'm not a big fan of, but tidyverse is fine as my data isn't 'big') forecast package, particularly ts() zoo or xts objects Prophet @philmikejones What abt Prophet? Based on @mcmc_stan , available in R & Python, didn't use much but got great results when I did: https://t.co/Pqat2KevCj — andrea panizza (@unsorsodicorda) May 15, 2017 https://research.fb.com/prophet-forecasting-at-scale/
