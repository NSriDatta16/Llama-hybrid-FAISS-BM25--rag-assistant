Combining the results of two seperate SQL queries with 'OR'

Framework: Rails 2.3.8 Database; PostgreSQL I currently have the following SQL statements (generated by Rails) SELECT "outbreaks".* FROM "outbreaks" INNER JOIN "bacterial_agents" ON bacterial_agents.outbreak_id = outbreaks.id INNER JOIN "bacteria" ON "bacteria".id = "bacterial_agents".bacterium_id WHERE (bacteria.name ILIKE E'%VTEC O157%') SELECT "outbreaks".* FROM "outbreaks" INNER JOIN "viral_agents" ON viral_agents.outbreak_id = outbreaks.id INNER JOIN "virus" ON "virus".id = "viral_agents".virus_id WHERE (virus.name ILIKE E'%NOROVIRUS%') With the following tables (I've skipped the non-used attributes and the layout / key naming is down to Rails conventions) outbreaks id bacterial_agents id outbreak_id bacterium_id bacteria id name viral_agents id outbreak_id virus_id viruses id name Any ideas how I would join the two above SQL statements with an "OR" condition, to select outbreak records which are related to the bacteria table where the bacteria.name is like "VTEC O157" OR related to the viruses table where the virus.name is like "NOROVIRUS"? *EDIT Abit of clarification on the Rails generation of the SQL - it currently outputs the following SQL SELECT "outbreaks".* FROM "outbreaks" INNER JOIN "bacterial_agents" ON bacterial_agents.outbreak_id = outbreaks.id INNER JOIN "bacteria" ON "bacteria".id = "bacterial_agents".bacterium_id INNER JOIN "viral_agents" ON outbreaks.id = viral_agents.outbreak_id INNER JOIN "viruses" ON "viral_agents".virus_id = "viruses".id WHERE ((bacteria.name ILIKE E'%VTEC O157%') AND (viruses.name ILIKE E'%NOROVIRUS%')) LIMIT 1 Essentially I want to output the combined results from the first two statements into a similar format as the above statement (with an "OR" condition in place of the "AND"). However if this isnt possible I'll just have to write a scope to handle the SQL union instead. Think judging by the replies below I'll go with a union of the two seperate statements, cheers :)
