I am quite new to the field of HE. What I read and as far as what I know about the algebra everything is ok if it is just addition and multiplication- in short polynomial operations. Thus the exponential is only ok if it is approximated by a polynomial. This rules out the radial basis kernel for SVMs. The linear should work. On the other hand with neural networks if the sigmoid is used, then it should fail. Otherwise matrix multiplication should work.
