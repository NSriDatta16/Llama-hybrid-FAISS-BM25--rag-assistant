c arrays: setting size dynamically?

I am new to C programming. I am trying to set the size of the array using a variable but I am getting an error: Storage size of 'array' isn't constant !! 01 int bound = bound*4; 02 static GLubyte vertsArray[bound]; I have noticed that when I replace bounds (within the brackets on line 02) with the number say '20', the program would run with no problems. But I am trying to set the size of the array dynamically ... Any ideas why I am getting this error ? thanks much,
