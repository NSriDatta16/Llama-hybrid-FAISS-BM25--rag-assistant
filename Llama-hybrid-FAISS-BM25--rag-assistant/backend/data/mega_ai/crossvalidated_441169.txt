are Dimensionality reduction techniques performed before or after feature selection?

What would be a sensible approach to get the best features to improve accuracy? DImensionality Reduction -> Feature Selection -> Reduction -> Selection ...... Selection-> Reduction Reduction -> Selection I think the loop method helps until we find the best score?
