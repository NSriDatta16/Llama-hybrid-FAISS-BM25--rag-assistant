Best course of action for what purpose? Purely mathematically, the client brought in either 0 (and 0 to 1000 is not a 100% increase but rather an infinite increase) or the income was missing (was perhaps not even a client). If you are interested in predicting future income, then perhaps trying different approaches (e.g. also average income from other - in some sense similar - clients could be something to try) and seeing the prediction performance in cross-validation could be an approach.
