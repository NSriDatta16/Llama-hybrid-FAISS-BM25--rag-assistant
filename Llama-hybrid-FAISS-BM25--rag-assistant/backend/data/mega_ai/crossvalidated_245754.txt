What you are interested in here is essentially heteroscedasticity. It is possible to test if the variances differ. Typically, you would get the absolute values of the differences from the mean or median of each group and run a 2x2 ANOVA on those sets of deviations. Using the mean will be a little more efficient when the data are normal, but a little less robust when they are not. However, you seem to have short time series here. That makes this a little more complex. Using deviations from a single number (either the mean or the median) assumes the series is stationary. That may not be true. For example, the temperatures could be trending upwards over time, with one series of temperatures tracking very closely to the trend (little residual variability) whereas another series might not have a prominent trend but may fluctuate around a mean value (real variability), and yet the first case could look like more variability than the second. You need to figure out which you are interested in detecting. A simple solution would be to fit a straight line to the temperatures within each combination of factors and use the residuals from that fit. There are a couple more issues here. First, the data in the analysis described above would not be independent, so the p-value (e.g.) would be wrong. To address this, you would need to use a mixed effects model, a GEE, a robust sandwich estimator, or model the non-independence with generalized least squares (GLS). With only 6 units, it is hard to say what approach would be viable. The last issue is that, from your comment , I gather you want to understand the impact of varying temperatures on bleaching. That means that the model you really want is: Bleached ~ temp.variance + Site However, it appears that you used an outcome dependent sampling strategy for your study and that your multiple temperatures are really pseudoreplications . That isn't necessarily lethal, but it requires special methods that I am not familiar with. Perhaps someone else could address that issue.
