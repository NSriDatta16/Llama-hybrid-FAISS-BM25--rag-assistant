There are a number of well-known XSLT IDE's : The XSelerator (free) -- I have been using this excellent tool for 10 years. oXygen -- probably the most extensive support for XSLT 2.0 plus Docbook plus good XML authoring tools Visual Studio --both VS 2010 and VS2010 come with an excellent XML editor and an XSLT Debugger/Transformer Stylus studio XML-SPY All of these tools support XML intellisense and debugging , some support schema-directed editing.
