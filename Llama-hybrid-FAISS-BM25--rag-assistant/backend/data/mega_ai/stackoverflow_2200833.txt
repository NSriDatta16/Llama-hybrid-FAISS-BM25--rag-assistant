I would suggest that you think about what you wanna do with Maven, or why you wanna introduce it into your projects. Maybe ask your boss for his reasons/goals in introducing Maven . After you have named your main goals why to introduce Maven. Ask potential consultants how they would use Maven to achieve those goals. Examples 1 Goal : Improve overall code quality in project. Question : How may we use Maven to improve our overall code quality in projects. Possible answer : Maven has several plug-ins to force/meassure code quality in projects, we could integrate those into our buildscripts in almost no time. (e.g. checkstlye, pmd, cobertura, xradar...) Examples 2 Goal : Creating automated deployment scripts for several destination environments. Question : How may we use Maven to automatically deploy artifacts to several destination environments. Possible answer : We could use Maven plug-ins for deployment (e.g. Cargo) and use maven's profiles to handle several configurations. a.s.o.
