An expression is a treelike structure. So you need a way to present the tree in a table. You can for example use the fields: ID TypeExpression (and, or etc...) FirstChildID SecondChildID In this case, you have the following types: AND, Children point to other expression. OR, Children point to other expression. Equal, Children point to other expression. Literal, FirstChild points to an entry in a literal table. VariableLookup, FirstChild points to an entry in a varable table. But I think there are better ways to organise expression. I once made a simple expression evaluator that accepts a string and produces a numeric result.
