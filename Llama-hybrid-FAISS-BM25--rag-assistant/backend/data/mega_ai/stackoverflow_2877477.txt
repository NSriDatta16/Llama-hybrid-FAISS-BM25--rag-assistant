Should you use LAMP or Spring Framework?

Recently, I've been exploring the Java space, and I came across the Spring Framework. Is this a web app framework like CodeIgniter or Rails? If so, is Springs used for developing enterprise web applications that run on Java EE technology? I am curious, why is Spring getting lot of attention? Isn't it a lot cheaper to simply use LAMP + CI or Rails to develop web applications? Can Spring be used to develop desktop applications?
