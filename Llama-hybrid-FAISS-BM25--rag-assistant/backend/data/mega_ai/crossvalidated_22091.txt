Estimating an unknown restricted Markov Chain from partial measurements

There is an Markov chain $M$ defined on states $1, ..., N$ with the special property that it only has transitions $p_i$ from $i$ to $i + 1$ , $q_{i + 1}$ from $i + 1$ to $i$, and $r_i = 1 - p_i - q_i$ from $i$ to $i$ (for $i \in [N - 1]$; $p_N = 0$ and $q_1 = 0$ since there is no successor/predecessor state). We know our chain respects this special structure, but we don't know the transition probabilities. Our data about the process is generated as follows: Start in some known state $n_0 \in [N]$ For $k = 0, ... , {t - 1}$: Go to state $n_k$ in $M$ Take $n_k$ many steps in $M$ Set $n_{k + 1}$ as the current state in $M$ Output $n_0,...,n_{t}$ In other words, we only have partial information about our walk through M. But from many of these $n_0,...,n_{t}$ I want to be able to infer the transition probabilities of $M$. How should I go about this? Is there a standard procedure for this? If so, is there an implementation in Matlab (or R)?
