Which metric to use to evaluate prediction problem

The product manager wants to know if you can develop a model to predict the number of views a listing will receive based on the boat's features. She would consider using your model if, on average, the predictions were only 50% off of the true number of views a listing would receive. (please interpret the bold sentence!!) The data used in this: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/karthikbhandary2/boat-sales I tried using the RandomForestRegressor() model along with RandomizedSearchCV. param = [ {'n_estimators': [100, 200, 300, 400, 450, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000], 'max_depth': [3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12,14,16,18,20], 'max_leaf_nodes': [15, 20, 25,30,35,40]}, ] rf = RandomForestRegressor(random_state=42) rs_rf = RandomizedSearchCV(rf, param, cv = 4, n_jobs = -1, verbose = 1) rs_rf.fit(X_train, y_train) I tried using RMSE like this: rmse = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)) print(rmse) I got the result as 483887.72666891955 My question is whether I am doing this right or not?
