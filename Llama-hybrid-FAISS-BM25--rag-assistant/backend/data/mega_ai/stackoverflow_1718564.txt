Do you want to use if for headlines and other 'special' text or for general paragraphs of text? If the former, sIFR or an image representing the text would probably be best. If you want whole paragraphs then you should look into @font-face like DA suggested or see if there's an acceptable web safe font that is close enough to the font you would prefer to use.
