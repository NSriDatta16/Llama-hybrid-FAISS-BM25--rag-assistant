I'm not sure whether the "log pseudo-likelihood" returned in a crr object is suitable for a likelihood-ratio test (which is probably what you're getting with the "Chisq" anova test on coxph objects). This discussion suggests that it might not be, at least as Fine-Gray is implemented in Stata. Presumably the summary of coefficients reported for a crr object includes standard errors of coefficients and corresponding Wald tests. The Wald test for the interaction coefficient would be an acceptable assessment. Pay close attention to the form of your model, however, as its interpretation might not be so straightforward as you would hope. Black women have a higher incidence of the particularly aggressive "triple-negative" type of breast cancer (TNBC), something not necessarily captured by the stage and grade predictors in your model. See, for example, Ref 1 directly comparing outcomes for races within TNBC. There also might be racial differences in the tendency to receive chemotherapy; see Ref 2 . If you don't account for the biological type of breast cancer or differences in receipt of chemotherapy, it will be hard to interpret any of the regression coefficients, including the chemotherapy:race coefficient, very cleanly. Finally, don't forget the cautions raised by Austin and Fine with respect to interpreting the magnitudes of coefficients in Fine-Gray models. 1.
