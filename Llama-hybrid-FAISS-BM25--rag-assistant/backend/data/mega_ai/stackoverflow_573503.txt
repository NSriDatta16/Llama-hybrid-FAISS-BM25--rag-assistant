This is the sort of micro-optimisation that you really just don't need to worry about. However, I will post what I would think is most elegant (and efficient) way of doing this anyway: Dim result = If(lReturnString.Length = 0, "|", lReturnString.ToString()) This saves converting an empty StringBuilder to a string unnecessarily (or then calling Append, which is definitely not required). Note the use of the inline If statement (VB 9.0), which does not evaluate both statements in any one case, as it is a language construct and not a function (exactly equivalent to a normal If statement with variable assignments).
