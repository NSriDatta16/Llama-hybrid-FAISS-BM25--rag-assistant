I believe one reason to do so is that a Bayesian analysis provides you with a full posterior distribution. This can result in more detailed intervals than the typical frequentist $\pm 2 \sigma$. An applicable quote, from Reis and Stedinger 2005, is: Providing a full posterior distribution of the parameters is an advantage of the Bayesian approach ï¿¼over classical methods, which usually provide only a point estimate of the parameters represented by the mode of the likelihood function, and make use of asymptotic normality assumptions and a quadratic approximation of the log-likelihood function to describe uncertainties. With the Bayesian framework, one does not have to use any approximation to evaluate the uncertainties because the full posterior distribution of the parameters is available. Moreover, a Bayesian analysis can provide credible intervals for parameters or any function of the parameters which are more easily interpreted than the concept of confidence interval in classical statistics (Congdon, 2001). So, for example, you can calculate credible intervals for the difference between two parameters.
