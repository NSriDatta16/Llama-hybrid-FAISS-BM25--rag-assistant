It's not possible with the webbrowser module. All webbrowser does is provide a simple way to identify the default web browser and feed a URL to it. If you want to render just a portion of a page, you need something that can either take arbitrary HTML fragments or can inject some Javascript after loading a page to strip out the unwanted elements. For that, what you need is to build a purpose-specific web browser that's nothing more than a dialog box containing a web widget. That can be done using any of the following combinations of libraries: PyQt and the included QtWebKit (GPL or Commercial, Windows/Mac/Linux) PySide and the included QtWebKit (LGPL, Linux) PyGTK and PyWebKitGTK (LGPL, Easy on Linux... no clue about Windows or OSX) PyGTK and GTKMozEmbed (LGPL, Easy on Linux... no clue about Windows or OSX) wxPython and the included wxIEHtmlWindow (BSD-like, Windows-only. Embeds Internet Explorer.) wxPython and the included wxWebKitCtrl (BSD-like, OSX-only) wxPython and wxWebKit (BSD-like, Windows/Mac/Linux) My advice: If GPL licensing is OK, use PyQt. If GPL licensing isn't OK: For Linux, use PySide or PyGTK with PyWebKitGTK (GTKMozEmbed is heavy) For Windows, use wxPython with wxIEHtmlWindow For OSX, you'll have to ask someone else.
