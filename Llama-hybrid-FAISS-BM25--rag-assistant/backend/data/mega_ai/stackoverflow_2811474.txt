The HtmlConverter tool in the jdk/bin directory should help you to create the Object tag (at least with an old version of Java). Now Sun (euh Oracle) recommends the applet tag and even jnlp. Look at the deployJava.js script. I don't think changing it to object will fixed your problem as the applet will be still be paint above the HTML.
