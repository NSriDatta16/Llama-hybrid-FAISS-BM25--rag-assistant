The scope of an item's visibility should dictate how descriptive that name needs to be. If you literally have a tiny loop, i, j, and k are fine and typical index counters. Sometimes a more descriptive name can help illuminate intent, but if the for loop is set up like the following, then a more descriptive name doesn't really matter. for (int i = 0; i That said, abbreviations should never be used unless they're used consistently. I personally think ndx is a terrible identifier because it's hard to type; I can type English perfectly well and my programming speed is not limited by my typing speed. If you want to say index say index . I believe that it was in The Pragmatic Programmer that they said you shouldn't use abbreviations because then people will never know what abbreviation to use. I know I want a thing called index so I type index but I get a compiler error. Now what? (Hunt through the code to find that it's written ndx will bother me.) As I try to think about it, about the only abbreviation that I use that isn't game specific is 'num' to stand in for 'numberOf'. Other than that I use 'npc' to mean non-player character, 'ai' to mean artificial intelligence, etc., etc., and sometimes I use abbreviations in small blocks, e.g. a 10-line function operating on a Camera may just call it 'cam', but the scope is small so it's easy to see what's going on and the possibility for confusion is limited. So- small scope -> do whatever you like (as long as there's some consistency). Large scope -> make your names unambiguous, meaningful, and easy to type. (By "easy to type" I mean "easy to remember how to spell" as well as "don't go overboard".)
