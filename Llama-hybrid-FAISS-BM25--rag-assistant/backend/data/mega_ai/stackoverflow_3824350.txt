The SQL is determined via the Universe and the order of how the objects are dragged into the WebI doc does effect how BO generates that SQL. It sounds like you are looking to change how the from clause is being built, which almost always requires a change in the Universe and not the order that objects are brought into the WebI query builder. You may be able to get a better feel on how to change the universe to generate the correct/better SQL on Dave Rathbun's blog most notably his articles on contexts.
