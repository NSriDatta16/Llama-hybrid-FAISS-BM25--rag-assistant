Can pseudo $R^2$ be used to describe Fraction of Variance Explained?

I have recently done some Logistic regression analysis whose results I will be presenting to my non-mathematician colleagues. One of the key aspects to this is how well the regression fits the data in each specific case. I'm using the McFadden Pseudo $R^2$ for this work, which is $1-\frac{null~deviance}{residual ~ deviance} $ , and I'm aware of others. In linear regression, $R^2$ can be described as a measure of 'the fraction of variance explained'. How well can this be generalised to a pseudo $R^2$ derived from a logistic regression? For the purposes of talking to (albeit technical) non mathematicians, is it permissible to say that 'given an $R^2$ of X, my model explains X% of the behaviour that we have observed in the data'?
