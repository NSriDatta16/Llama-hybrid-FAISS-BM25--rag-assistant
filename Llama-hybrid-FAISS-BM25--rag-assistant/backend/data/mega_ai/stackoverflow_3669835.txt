The isXxx prefix is a widespread naming convention, so it's generally the best choice. For order-sensitive operations, wasXxx is appropriate. For example, in JDBC, retrieving the value of a database column might return zero when the field is actually NULL (unset); in this case, a follow-up call to wasNull determines which it is after the actual retrieval was performed. For retrieving attribute settings, hasXxx may be more appropriate. It's a grammar preference, as in "the object's flag is set" versus "the object has an attribute". Then there are capability tests canXxx . For example, calling canWrite to see if a file is writable. But names like these can probably be renamed to the isXxx form, such as isWritable .
