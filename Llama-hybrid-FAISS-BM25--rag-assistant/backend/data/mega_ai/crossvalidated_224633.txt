When it comes to questions like this, there's no "right" answer. I've been there before. The easiest way is to just take average scores, weighting 1st as 5 points, 2nd as 4 points, etc. An overkill way (that I've used before) is to do some variable clustering or unsupervised learning techniques (eg: PCA) to see which experts agreed most with each other. Following the logic of "consensus of the experts is probably correct", you can restrict your ranking to only those who agree most with each-other. Without more context it's hard to make a recommendation. How much time do you have? What is the data about? Can you get a bigger sample size than 16? etc.
