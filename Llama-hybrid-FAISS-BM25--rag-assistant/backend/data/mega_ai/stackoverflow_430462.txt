In the Access application interface, you can only have one database container open at a time. In VBA code, you can open multiple database instances within a Workspace. See the help file documentation for the Workspace.OpenDatabase method (or http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb243164.aspx ) for an example where more than one Database is opened in one Workspace. One would infer that when transactions are supported by all of the underlying Databases that are open in a Workspace, the BeginTrans method of the Workspace would apply across all of the databases. I suspect there be dragons there, but I'm sure it would work with two MDBs inside of one Workspace. When there's only one database open in the Workspace, Workspace.BeginTrans and Database.BeginTrans are indeed the same.
