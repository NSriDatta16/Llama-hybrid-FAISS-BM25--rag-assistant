In addition to Stephan's points: In almost any application where you're interested in nonlinear functions of the random variable, substituting the mean will generally introduce bias and possibly contradictory results. The average velocity and average mass of a particle will generally not be consistent with average kinetic energy, because energy scales with V^2. The mean value may not even be a possible outcome for the random variable. If my possible outcomes are 0 "patient dies" and 1 "patient lives", it's probably not helpful to have a model that describes the patient as 0.1 "mostly dead but slightly alive".
