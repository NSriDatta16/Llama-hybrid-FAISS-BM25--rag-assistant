When it is a good idea to average data to reduce variability?

I have 4 responses per day from animals, at different points of the day (morning, afternoon, etc). My data is marred by a lot of variability, since the nature of the response is such that while some of it is systemic, a lot of it is just random behavior by the animals. I fit an initial regression model which was very flexible (all continuous covariates were fitted with smoothers), and I only manage to explain at most 35-40 % of the deviance. However, if I make a boxplot of the response dependent on the time of day, I get So, it does not seem to have an affect. So, is all of the above a good enough reason to say: you know what, let's just average the per day data to reduce some of the variability, and thus ignore the "time"-factor, since it does not have an affect anyways?
