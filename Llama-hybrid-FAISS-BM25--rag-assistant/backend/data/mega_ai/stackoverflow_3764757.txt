The problem when the browser is in compatibility view. (as suggested by taylorjes) When the page is displayed in normal view, the cells are horizontal. When displayed in compatibility view, the cells are vertical. As I said in my comment, I would highly discourage the display:(table/table-row/table-cell) CSS property. It is not well supported and is bound to have quirks. Honestly if what you are displaying is tabular data, then use a table . Tables are only evil when used for layout .
