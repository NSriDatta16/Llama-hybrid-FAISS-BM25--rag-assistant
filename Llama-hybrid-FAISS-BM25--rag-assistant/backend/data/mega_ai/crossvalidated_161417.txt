PCA dataset to test my implementation

I'm trying to find a dataset with examples of data matrices and their principal components. I know that I could construct my own dataset using standard implementations found in python, or octave libs, but I want to find a dataset done for other people and maybe already used on other works because I want make sure people will not think that I generated some data that "helps" my implementation. Searching on the internet, I have found some datasets like this one , but they don't have the principal components calculated. So, does anyone here know such dataset?
