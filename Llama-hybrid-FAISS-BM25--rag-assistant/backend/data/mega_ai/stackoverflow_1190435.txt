Is there a way to ignore Visual Studio errors thrown by XAML?

I know you can do it in CodeBehind with something like this... #pragma warning disable 67 ... #pragma warning restore 67 But is there a way to do this type of thing in XAML? For example, I have the following in my App.xaml... Verdana And it keeps throwing me these VS errors (even though it builds successfully)... Error 1 Type 'FontFamily' is not usable as an object element because it is not public or does not define a public parameterless constructor or a type converter. C:\Users\jed.hunsaker\Documents\Work\NextGen\src\ESO.App.Reporting\ESO.App.Reporting.UI.Silverlight\App.xaml 8 4 ESO.App.Reporting.UI.Silverlight and... Error 2 The type 'FontFamily' does not support direct content. C:\Users\jed.hunsaker\Documents\Work\NextGen\src\ESO.App.Reporting\ESO.App.Reporting.UI.Silverlight\App.xaml 8 42 ESO.App.Reporting.UI.Silverlight Unless you guys know a better way to store a FontFamily in your App.xaml, I'm all ears!
