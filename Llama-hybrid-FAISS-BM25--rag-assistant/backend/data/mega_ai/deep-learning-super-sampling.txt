Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) is a suite of real-time deep learning image enhancement and upscaling technologies developed by Nvidia that are available in a number of video games. The goal of these technologies is to allow the majority of the graphics pipeline to run at a lower resolution for increased performance, and then infer a higher resolution image from this that approximates the same level of detail as if the image had been rendered at this higher resolution. This allows for higher graphical settings and/or frame rates for a given output resolution, depending on user preference. All generations of DLSS are available on all RTX-branded cards from Nvidia in supported titles. However, the Frame Generation feature is only supported on 40 series GPUs or newer and Multi Frame Generation is only available on 50 series GPUs. History Nvidia advertised DLSS as a key feature of the GeForce 20 series cards when they launched in September 2018. At that time, the results were limited to a few video games, namely Battlefield V, or Metro Exodus, because the algorithm had to be trained specifically on each game on which it was applied and the results were usually not as good as simple resolution upscaling. In 2019, the video game Control shipped with real-time ray tracing and an image processing algorithm that approximated DLSS, which did not use the Tensor Cores. In April 2020, Nvidia advertised and shipped an improved version of DLSS named DLSS 2.0 with driver version 445.75. DLSS 2.0 was available for a few existing games including Control and Wolfenstein: Youngblood, and would later be added to many newly released games and game engines such as Unreal Engine and Unity. This time Nvidia said that it used the Tensor Cores again, and that the AI did not need to be trained specifically on each game. Despite sharing the DLSS branding, the two iterations of DLSS differ significantly and are not backwards-compatible. In January 2025, Nvidia stated that there are over 540 games and apps supporting DLSS, and that over 80% of Nvidia RTX users activate DLSS. In March 2025, there were more than 100 games that support DLSS 4, according to Nvidia. By May 2025, over 125 games supported DLSS 4. The first video game console to use DLSS, the Nintendo Switch 2, was released on June 5, 2025. Release history Quality presets When using DLSS, depending on the game, users have access to various quality presets in addition to the option to set the internally rendered, upscaled resolution manually: Implementation DLSS 1.0 The first iteration of DLSS is a predominantly spatial image upscaler with two stages, both relying on convolutional auto-encoder neural networks. The first step is an image enhancement network which uses the current frame and motion vectors to perform edge enhancement, and spatial anti-aliasing. The second stage is an image upscaling step which uses the single raw, low-resolution frame to upscale the image to the desired output resolution. Using just a single frame for upscaling means the neural network itself must generate a large amount of new information to produce the high resolution output, this can result in slight hallucinations such as leaves that differ in style to the source content. The neural networks are trained on a per-game basis by generating a "perfect frame" using traditional supersampling to 64 samples per pixel, as well as the motion vectors for each frame. The data collected must be as comprehensive as possible, including as many levels, times of day, graphical settings, resolutions, etc. as possible. This data is also augmented using common augmentations such as rotations, colour changes, and random noise to help generalize the test data. Training is performed on Nvidia's Saturn V supercomputer. This first iteration received a mixed response, with many criticizing the often soft appearance and artifacts in certain situations; likely a side effect of the limited data from only using a single frame input to the n
