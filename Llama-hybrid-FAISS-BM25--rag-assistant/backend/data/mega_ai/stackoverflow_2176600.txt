The best approach to safe write to a DB is to use the PDO abstraction layer and make use of prepared statements. http://www.php.net/manual/en/intro.pdo.php A good tutorial (I learned from this one) is http://www.phpro.org/tutorials/Introduction-to-PHP-PDO.html However, you might have to rewrite alot of your site just to implement this. But this is no doubt the most elegant method than having to make use of all those functions. Plus, prepared statements are becoming the de facto now. Another benefit of this is that you do not have to rewrite your queries if you switch to a different database (such as from MySQL to PostgreSQL). But I would say consider this if you plan to scale your site.
