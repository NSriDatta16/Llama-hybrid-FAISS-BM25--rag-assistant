How to use intermediate neural network layers for model chaining

I have a neural network structured like this: inputs -> neural network layers -> intermediary output -> more layers -> output I would like to use the features from the intermediary output for a different downstream task, but I don't want the features to be overfit. When model chaining with other methods I would use k-fold cross validation to solve this problem, however in the case of my neural network there is no requirement for the k- feature vectors to look anything alike, which is a problem for the downstream task. How should I proceed here?
