Can logistic regression be used when the dataset has observations from the same users but are unique per day

I have a dataset that captures user information by day (the users are unique per day but often have observations on multiple days) and I want to analyze a binary outcome. Is there a more appropriate model than logistic regression or can I control for date or user? How can I do so? This is what I have in Python as you can see the model fit is not ideal. I did not include user or date in my model. model = smf.logit('flag~C(variable1)+variable2+variable3+C(variable4)',data=df).fit() Logit Regression Results Dep.
