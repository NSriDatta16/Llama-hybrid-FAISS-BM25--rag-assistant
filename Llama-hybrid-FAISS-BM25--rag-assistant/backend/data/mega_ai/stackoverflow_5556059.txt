When using an object database, how do you handle significant changes to your object model?

If you use an object database, what happens when you need to change the structure of your object model? For instance, I'm playing around with the Google App Engine. While I'm developing my app, I've realized that in some cases, I mis-named a class, and I want to change the name. And I have two classes that I think I need to consolidate. However,I don't think I can, because the name of the class in intuitively tied into the datastore, and there is actual data stored under those class names. I suppose the good thing about the "old way" of abstracting the object model from the data storage is that the data storage doesn't know anything about the object model --it's just data. So, you can change your object model and just load the data out of the datastore differently. So, in general, when using a datastore which is intimate with your data model...how do you change things around?
