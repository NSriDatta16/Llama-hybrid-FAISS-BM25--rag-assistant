How can I iterate in reverse over a map in C++?

I'm having trouble iterating in reverse over a map in GCC C++. When I use a reverse iterator, it seems I can't assign anything to it - the compiler complains. I'm working around it with some awkward code using a forward iterator, but it's not very elegant. Any thoughts?
