Is it possible to use ordinary least square (OLS) when the dependant variable is a “percentage” with a range from zero to hundred?

I have data set of different school in a certain area to assess the cause of reason behind student's cause of failure in the English exam. Data set has several kind of variable like continuous, categorical, variable with percentage value 0 to 100 etc. DV : Percentage of student pass in the English exam (0 to 100) IV : - No of students in class (Discrete value) - Average age of the teacher (Discrete value) - Percentage of teacher has masters degree or higher (0 to 100) - Quartile rank of students economic condition (1-4, poor to rich) - Percentage of students get free meal at the school (0 to 100) etc. I want to run a ordinary least square regression in the data set, is it possible to run this on the above mentioned variables or I need some modification before analysis. I have already run the linear regression for the model and surprisingly got all are statistically significant. So my questions are 1. Is it correct? If not what are the flaws? 2. Does it necessary to use logistic regression by converting to category?
