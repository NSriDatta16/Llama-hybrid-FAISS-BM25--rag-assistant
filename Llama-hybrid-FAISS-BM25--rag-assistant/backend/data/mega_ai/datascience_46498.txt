Your assumption is correct. However, some additional details need to be specified e.g. eigenvector of what ? What characterizes the principal component eigenvector i.e. what criteria must it satisfy ? As explained in the authoritative reference book by Bishop, the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) provides a set of mutually orthogonal directions, called principal components , which maximize the variance of the projections of the data points, when it is projected successively on respective directions as axes. Here, the underlying assumption is the data points are considered elements of a Vector Space equipped with standard inner product. Illustrating using first principal component, which say is specified by unit vector, $\mathbf{u_1}$ for a dataset, $\{ \mathbf{x_n} \}, \text{n} = 1, \dots, N$ then Projection of $ \mathbf{x_n} $ = $ \mathbf{u_1}^T \mathbf{x_n} $ Mean of Projections, $ \mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{u_1}}(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{u_1}^T \bar{\mathbf{x}} $ where $ \bar{\mathbf{x}} = \frac{1}{N} \sum^N_{n=1} \mathbf{x_n} $ Variance of Projections, $ Var_{\mathbf{u_1}}(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{1}{N} \sum^N_{n=1} ( \mathbf{u_1}^T \mathbf{x_n} - \mathbf{u_1}^T \bar{\mathbf{x}} )^2 = \mathbf{u_1}^T \mathbf{S} \mathbf{u_1} $ where $\mathbf{S}$ is the Data Covariance matrix given by $ \mathbf{S} = \frac{1}{N} \sum^N_{n=1} ( \mathbf{x_n} - \mathbf{\bar{x}} ) ( \mathbf{x_n} - \mathbf{\bar{x}} )^T $ Maximizing $ Var(\mathbf{x}) $ subject to unit vector constraint, $ \mathbf{u_1}^T \mathbf{u_1} = 1 $ , applying Lagrange multiplier we get optimization problem $ \text{max}_{ \mathbf{u_1}^T \mathbf{u_1} = 1 } \mathbf{u_1}^T \mathbf{S} \mathbf{u_1} = \text{max}_{ \mathbf{u_1} } \mathbf{u_1}^T \mathbf{S} \mathbf{u_1} + \lambda_1 ( \mathbf{u_1}^T \mathbf{u_1} - 1 ) $ At maxima, we get $ \mathbf{S} \mathbf{u_1} = \lambda_1 \mathbf{u_1} \implies \lambda_1 = \mathbf{u_1}^T \mathbf{S} \mathbf{u_1} = Var_{\mathbf{u_1}}(\mathbf{x}) $ Hence, principal eigenvectors e.g. $\mathbf{u_1}$ are eigenvectors of Covariance matrix, $\mathbf{S}$ with corresponding eigenvalues e.g. $\lambda_1$ as Variance of projections along corresponding eigenvector
