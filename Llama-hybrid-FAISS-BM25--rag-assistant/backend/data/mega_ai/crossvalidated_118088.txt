On the Occurrence of Standardized Regression Coefficients Greater Than One. Educational and Psychological Measurement , 38, No. 4, 873-888. "If there is a single predictor or multiple predictors that are uncorrelated, then the beta values will be confined to the bounds of (-1,1). However, if there are 2 or more predictors that are correlated, positively or negatively, then the beta values may exceed those bounds." In other words, you probably have multicollinearity issues.
