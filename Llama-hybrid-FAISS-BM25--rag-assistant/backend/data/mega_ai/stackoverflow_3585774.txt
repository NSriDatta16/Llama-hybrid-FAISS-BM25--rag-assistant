How to pass data from a QDialog?

In Qt, what is the most elegant way to pass data from a QDialog subclass to the component that started the dialog in the cases where you need to pass down something more complex than a boolean or an integer return code? I'm thinking emit a custom signal from the accept() slot but is there something else?
