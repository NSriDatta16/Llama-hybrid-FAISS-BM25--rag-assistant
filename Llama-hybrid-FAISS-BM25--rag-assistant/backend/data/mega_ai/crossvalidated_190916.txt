Machine learning analysis of differences

I'm very new to machine learning, and have a problem I'm trying to solve but don't know where to get started. I've got a set of feature vectors that are "matched pairs," so D={(x1,y1), (x2,y2), ..., (xn,yn)} where each xi and yi are vectors of some length. xi and yi have the same length, but different pairs of xi and yi may have different lengths. I want to have some algorithm learn the difference of x's and y's, such that, if I have another vector, I want to predict whether it's more like x's or more like y's. Can someone point me in the right direction that I might try? I'm not sure what types of algorithms or methods I should be looking into, so even just the names of appropriate algorithms or methods would be great.
