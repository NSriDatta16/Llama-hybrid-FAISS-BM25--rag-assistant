Estimate ARMA coefficients through ACF and PACF inspection

How do you estimate the appropriate forecast model for a time series by visual inspection of the ACF and PACF plots? Which one (i.e., ACF or PACF) tells the AR or the MA (or do they both)? Which part of the graphs tell you the seasonal and non-seasonal part for a seasonal ARIMA? Consider the ACF and PCF functions displayed below. They are from a log transformed series that's been differenced twice, one simple difference and one seasonal ( original data , log transformed data ). How would you characterize the series? What model best fits it?
