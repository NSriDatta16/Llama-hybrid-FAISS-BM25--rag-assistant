How to programmatically cancel an embedded MsBuild build

I'm embedding MSBuild directly into a more complex build tool. The relevant code looks roughly like this: // assume 'using Microsoft.Build.BuildEngine;' Engine e = Engine(); BuildPropertyGroup props = new BuildPropertyGroup(); props.SetProperty( "Configuration", Config.BuildConfig ); e.BuildProjectFile( projectFile, new string[] { "Build" }, props ) My question is how to cancel this build once it's started, without doing something drastic like terminating the thread. Also, if the project being built is a C++ project, the build will involve at least one sub-process, so canceling the thread isn't even going to really cancel the build. I don't see any cancel method on the Engine class - does someone know of a way?
