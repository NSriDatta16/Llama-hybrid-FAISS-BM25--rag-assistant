Comparison of coefficients within one regression

I am running a multiple regression model based on panel data that investigates the effect of different types of firm ownership on a certain dependent variable (OLS-estimators). The two independent variables of interest are both in a percentage form, thus have the same scale (think of it as share of ownership category A and B) The regression equation is therefore as follows: $$Y= \beta_0 + \beta_1*\text{Share_ownershipcategoryA} + \beta_2*\text{Share_ownershipcategoryB} + \text{Controlvariables} + u$$ The estimated $\hat{\beta}_1$ is slightly higher than $\hat{\beta}_2$. Now I would like to test whether or not the difference between the two categories of ownership is indeed significant; thus if ownership of category A is really better than category B. Can I just use the normal test as indicated below? $$\frac{\hat{\beta}_1 - \hat{\beta}_2}{\sqrt{SE(\hat{\beta}_1)^2+SE(\hat{\beta}_2)^2}}$$ I would have argued yes since both estimates are based on the same sample, have the same error term and are of the same scale. Nevertheless, I am not sure and my web search could not provide the necessary evidence. If I am wrong with my suggestion, is there an alternative to execute such a test. Thank you for your time and your feedback!
