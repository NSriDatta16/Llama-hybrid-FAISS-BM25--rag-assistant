Taking the average for regression

Let's assume you conduct a survey about some topic. After that, you want to analyze the responses and perform a regression. For example: IV: Age Percentage that every traveled to country X When I plot all responses the, chart is messy with responses all over the place. When I plot the average response per age it looks similar to the chart below. I would now like to run a regression to predict the response per age category. I would have usually taken all the responses and use them for my regression. However, in the book "Regression and other stories" I saw the following chart where they took averages. Is it reasonable to take the mean response per age?
