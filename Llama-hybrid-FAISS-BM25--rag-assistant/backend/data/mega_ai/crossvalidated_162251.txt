How to specify logistic regression as transformed linear regression?

I am trying to reproduce the following example of logistic regression with a transformed linear regression: am.glm The equation for the probability of $Y=1$ is the following: $$ P(Y=1) = {1 \over 1+e^{-(b_0+\sum{(b_iX_i)})}} $$ So I tried something like this: am.lm So this is obviously wrong! (I also tried transforming the given value but nothing worked so far). My question How would I have to set up logistic regression with explicitly specifying the formula for the non-linear transformation of the linear model?
