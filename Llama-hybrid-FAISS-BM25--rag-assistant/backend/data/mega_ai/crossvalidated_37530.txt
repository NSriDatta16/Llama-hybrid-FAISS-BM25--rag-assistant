You present a very Ã§lean situation, but the real world is often not really clean. Are the k subjects really fungible? Are the sample sizes a function of the subjects? In any case, the average of the p values for each subject would be less influenced by the subjects with larger n's. That might be a conservative approach. You might calculate the p's both ways and see if they differ. If they differ, you might try to find out why. If the situation is as clean as you describe, the first approach would be best, since it uses all the information. In any case, the SD of p = sqrt (pq/n) if you are sampling from an infinite binomial distribution.
