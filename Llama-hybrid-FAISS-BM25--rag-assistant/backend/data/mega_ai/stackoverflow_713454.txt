Instead of using arrays and then worrying about passing them to STL functions (what one might call 'forwards compatibility', and is therefore fragile), IMO you should use std::vector and use its (stable and dependable) backwards compatibility with functions that take arrays, should you ever need to use them. So your code becomes: #include #include #include #include using namespace std; int main() { vector a(3); a[0] = 9; a[1] = 8; a[2] = 7; cerr ()) And if you ever need to pass 'a' to a C API you can do so, thanks to vectors binary compatibility with arrays.
