Minor confusion on using PC features for classification

I have what I believe to be a simple question. I have also browsed some of the PCA related materials here. I have an unlabeled $M$ by $N$ data matrix, consisting of $M=1000$ points, and $N=500$ features. I standardize my matrix, perform PCA, and decide to use the top two PC's. Let us assume that those turn out to be fantastic features to use, and I decide to run a (k=3)-means, get my nice decision space, etc, all is good in the world. The question: When I have a new data point that I want to classify as belonging to one of those three clusters: It seems to be that I have to always retain the first two columns of my $U$ matrix that I used in the PCA, forever, so that I can always project my new point unto them. Is this correct? When I did PCA, I had to standardize my data, that is, remove the mean of the features, and make their std's unity. So, isnt there something I should also do to this new data point now that I have it? Thank you.
