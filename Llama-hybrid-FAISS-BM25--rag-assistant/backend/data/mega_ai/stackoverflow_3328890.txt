Music recognition/retrieval is an extremely difficult and almost entirely unsolved AI problem. Try to extract the frequency from a signal file of someone playing a single unwavering note one time - it's much more difficult than just "apply Fourier transform, read off solution". Compound that with polyphony, noise, rubato, vibrato/portamento, plus the fact that (contrary to speech recognition) we don't even have a working a-priori model of what music actually is, and you begin to see the difficulty. There are absolutely fascinating research papers and even entire conferences on the topic, but in the short term, you're just plain out of luck.
