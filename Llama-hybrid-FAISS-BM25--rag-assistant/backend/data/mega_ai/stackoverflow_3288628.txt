Well I'm answering my own question, and it's not a brilliant answer but it does sort of fulfil the requirements of my question. What you can do is connect to an EJB from an external java application, if the bean provides access to your database then by using it you will be making use of the connection pooling provided by glassfish. You can find info on how to do this here - https://glassfish.dev.java.net/javaee5/ejb/EJB_FAQ.html In terms of efficiency I'm not sure if this is a good idea since it may put excess strain on your web application, in my initial idea I was thinking to bypass the webapp completely and communicate directly with glassfish, any comments on this would be appreciated.
