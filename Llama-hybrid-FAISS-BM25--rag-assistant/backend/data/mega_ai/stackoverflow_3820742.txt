Free. Lightweight. Local DB storage in file. Great for testing (in memory DB FTW). If you're using NHibernate, it's completely interchangeable with anything else (with a few exceptions that I've found). Using a local SQL Express DB requires all of the necessary SQL Express stuff to be installed on the server and be running as services. SQLite has no services that run. If it meets your needs, go for it. If you need more horsepower, use something bigger.
