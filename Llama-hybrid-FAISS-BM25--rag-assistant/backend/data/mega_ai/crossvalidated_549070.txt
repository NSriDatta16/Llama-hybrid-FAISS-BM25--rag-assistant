Since your LSTM is stochastic, there is no "the" accuracy. One possibility is to train it multiple times and average the resulting accuracies (which estimated the expected accuracy). An alternative, as Dave comments, is to set an RNG seed, so your LSTM is not stochastic any more, and then you indeed can report "the" accuracy.
