How to deal with ties in Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test

I'm using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test to compare two related samples of non-normally-distributed data. The data contains some ties, so when I run the test in R, I get this warning: wilcox.test(data$valueA, data$valueB, paired=T) Wilcoxon signed rank test with continuity correction data: isnapRequests$fullMean and isnapRequests$template V = 181, p-value = 0.07691 alternative hypothesis: true location shift is not equal to 0 Warning message: In wilcox.test.default(wilcox.test(data$valueA, data$valueB, paired=T, : cannot compute exact p-value with zeroes I understand why the warning is given, since the test assumes a continuous distribution and my data is discrete (analogous to survey data). I also assume that the p-value reported by R is conservative, in the sense that the ties make it more difficult to reject the null hypothesis. I read on this forum that one way around this problem is to jitter the data and run multiple trials to estimate what the p-value would be without these ties: ps This seems to be sufficient evidence that the null hypothesis should be rejected, but I'm not very familiar with this process, so I have three questions: Is this procedure acceptable and is my interpretation reasonable? I'm not trying to "p-hack", but I also want to report the difference if it's real. This process seems difficult to report in a scientific paper. Is there a commonly accepted way of describing this procedure that won't raise eyebrows? How would you report the test? As an averaged p-value? Would you also average test statistics? And then you have the SD of the p-value as well... This seems messy. If there's a better way to approach this, I'm open to suggestions as well. Thanks!
