I think Ben is on target here. What's the point in throwing different exceptions if you're not going to catch them? If you really want to throw a different one I would at least have a common "PreconditionFailedException" base class that they all derive from, and try to organize them into some sort of heirachy so you can catch groups of them. Personlly, I'd not have different ones and just have a common exception you throw with the details of the failure in each one.
