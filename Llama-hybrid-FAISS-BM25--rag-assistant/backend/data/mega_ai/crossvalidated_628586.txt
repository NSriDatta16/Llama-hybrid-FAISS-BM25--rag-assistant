If I could pick apart the quoted text: "different kinds of trends" is not well defined. If we define "different kinds of trends" as $E[Y_{0,t}] \ne E[Y_{1,t}]$ for two repeatedly sampled time series, $Y_0$ and $Y_1$ , at any time point $t$ , then you can still test the grand hypothesis whether $\mathcal{H}_0: E[Y_0] = E[Y_1]$ using methods for independent data if the design is well balanced. That is, a plain old t-test won't hurt you. However, the choice to model the time trend can increase the power of this analysis. Consider this simulated design n Here's a picture to explain: Here time functions as a "blocking" factor using classic experimental design language. Even though we have defined time to be entirely random and unrelated to treatment, you can see that in groups stratified by the times 1 through 4, the observable difference between groups is far more noticeable than in the crude or aggregate scenario. This corresponds to more precise inference in ANOVA or linear regression using $p$ -values: In my simulation, the Type 3 SS test statistic for inference on the $x$ factor without adjustment for $t$ is 4 and after factor adjustment for time, it increases to 31.
