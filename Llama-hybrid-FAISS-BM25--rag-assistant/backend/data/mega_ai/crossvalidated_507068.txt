Definitely recommend survival model.perhaps intuitively, linear regression builds off constant slope. Survival models build off constant proportion surviving. If you work in 1 month blocks, and say probability of return in one month is p. Then probability of not returning after 3 months is (1-p)^3.i would suggest using a discrete survival model predicting return after each month (or weeks etc). You can use logistic regression to predict each month and then multiply together survival prediction s of each month to get survival curve. assuming your original data is 1 row per person, you convert to 1 row per person-period ( person-x 2 month after) see link for R code and example. you can add any additional predictors you want eg p(survive_month n|survive up to month n -1) ~ elapsed_months + age + gender + .... so to get survival curve $p(survive up to month n)$ , use the formula $p(\text{survive up to month n}) = p(\text{survive_month 1}|\text{survive month 0}) x ... p(\text{survive_month n}|\text{survive up to month n -1})$ and plug in the predictions for each separate month from your logistic regression. https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/r/faq/how-can-i-convert-from-person-level-to-person-period/ see eg https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/57196/
