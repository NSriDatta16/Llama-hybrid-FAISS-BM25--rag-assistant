Do you want to catch the exception and handle it? Or do you want to prevent the Yellow Screen Of Death? If you are trying to prevent the Yellow Screen Of Death, look at handling the Error event on the HttpApplication (in other words, in your Global.asax). See the following MSDN page for more details: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.httpapplication.error.aspx Specifically this paragraph: The exception that raises the Error event can be accessed by a call to the GetLastError method. If your application generates custom error output, suppress the default error message that is generated by ASP.NET by a call to the ClearError method.
