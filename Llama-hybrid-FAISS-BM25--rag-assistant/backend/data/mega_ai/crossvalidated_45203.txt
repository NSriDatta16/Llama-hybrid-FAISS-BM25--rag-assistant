Mixed effects count modeling

I am trying to predict the probability that someone's vehicle fails its emission inspection a discrete number of times using a Poisson count model (actually a negative binomial hurdle model, but the same logic applies), $$ P(y_i | X_i) = \dfrac{\exp(-e^{X\beta})(e^{X\beta})^{y_i} }{y_i!} $$ where the probability of vehicle $i$ failing emissions $y$ times is a function of different predictors. This is a straightforward problem. What is not straightforward is that households frequently own multiple vehicles, and I need to accommodate the within-household effects. In some ways I can think of this this as an unbalanced panel. HH | VEH | FAILURES | X A 1 0 x_a1 A 2 0 x_a2 B 1 2 x_b1 C 1 1 x_c1 C 1 0 x_c2 ....... It looks like a panel, but $y_t$ has no practical relationship to $y_{t-1}$, nor does the $X$ for different vehicles. Most panel methods I know involve taking the differences of one variable or another. Is there some other way to incorporate correlated observations that would help me with this problem? Update: There are two packages for R that claim to do this; MCMCglmm and glmmADMB . The latter appears to have a simpler call syntax, as the former requires conversational ability in Bayesian inference. Unfortunately, I cannot get the example scripts for glmmADMB to run on my system (OSX 10.7, R 2.15.2), because they crash with a matrix type error.
