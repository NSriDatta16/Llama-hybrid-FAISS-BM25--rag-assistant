Declare an action method in your controller's header, then save the header file. Then, in IB, ctrl-drag from the menu item to the controller, and choose the action you just declared. [Edit from the year 2013: Or, in Xcode 4, open the nib in a main editor and the header—or implementation file with a class extension in it—in an assistant editor, then ctrl-drag from the menu item to the @interface and create an action using the resulting popover.] Then, in the controller's implementation file, implement the action method. You'll need to create either an OSAScript (using OSAKit.framework—no docs; you'll need to read its headers) or an NSAppleScript (using AppKit) instance and tell it to execute.
