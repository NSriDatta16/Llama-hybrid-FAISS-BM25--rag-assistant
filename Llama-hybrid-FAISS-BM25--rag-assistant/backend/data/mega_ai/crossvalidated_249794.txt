The difficulty you are facing is from the implied mathematics. A center of location estimator, or an interval estimator, can be thought of as the minimization of a cost function over a distribution. The sample mean over the Gaussian minimizes quadratic loss, while the median minimizes the absolute linear loss function over the Gaussian. Even though in the population they are located at the same point, they are discovered using different cost functions. We give you an algorithm and say "do this," but before the algorithm was developed someone solved an optimization problem. You have applied four different cost functions giving you three intervals and a point estimator. Since the cost functions are different, they provide you different points and intervals. There is nothing to be done about it except to manually unify the methodology. You need to find the underlying papers and look at the underlying code to understand which ones map to what types of problems. Sorry to say this, but you were betrayed by the software. It did its job, and on average this works out great, but you got the sample where the software won't work. Or, rather, it is working perfectly and you need to actually work your way backward through the literature to determine what it is really doing.
