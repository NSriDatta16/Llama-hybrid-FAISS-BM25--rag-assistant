What is single deep neural network?

What does single deep neural network means? I did an object detection project using tensorflow though I am certainly lacking in knowledge about how it works. I am new to machine learning and I've been reading about CNN recently while doing my project and I am now trying to understand how SSD works and I've read about single deep neural network. Does SSD also uses CNN with many hidden layer or is the same with single neural network with only one hidden layer (though I have read somewhere that deep neural net is called "deep" because of its many hidden layer)? edit : Of course I searched and read some topics online before posting a question. I also get the difference between a neural network and a deep neural neural network but what I don't get is what is single deep neural network ? Based on what I've read, a deep neural network is a network composed of a many hidden layers. How can it be "deep" if it is only a single network?
