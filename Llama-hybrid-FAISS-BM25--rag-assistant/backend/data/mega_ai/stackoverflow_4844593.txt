Create a scalable database schema for storing golf scores

I am trying to design a database to store all my friends and my golf scores. As you probably know, a golf score is comprised of 18 hole individual scores. I can think of two ways to design the schema: Create a table that has one column for each hole (e.g. h1 to h18), the table has FK player_id, round_id and course_id that referenced other tables. It has a total column, which is the sum of columns h1 to h18. If I change a hole score, I will need to manually update total column. Create a table that has a column for hole score, a column for hole index, a column for player_id, course_id, and round_id. To get the total score for a round, I will need to do a SUM query on round_id, player_id. For now, the database would probably store scores from less than 20 people, so either approach should be fine. But what if I want to store scores for 20,000 people, which approach is more scalable? I am using MySQL 5, with PHP5. Thanks. Update> Examples of queries: 1. Reading the 9/18 scores from all players for a round and building a scorecard. 2. Basic stats like finding the lowest/average/highest total scores for a player for the last X rounds. 3. More advanced stats like average score of any hole for the last X rounds.
