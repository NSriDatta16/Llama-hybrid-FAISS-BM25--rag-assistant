A VERY non-technical answer A simple linear model fits a straight line through a set of points. The line is the best possible straight line (at least, for one sensible definition of best) A loess model fits a complicated curve through a set of points. In some ways, it can be thought of as a complicated moving average. It is the best possible curve (at least, for one sensible definition of best)
