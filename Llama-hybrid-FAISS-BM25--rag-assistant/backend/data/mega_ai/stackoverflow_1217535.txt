Do you bill enough hours that you could consider hiring a program manager/product owner type person at least part time to do most of your customer interaction? Because if you do, you can abstract the "design/code" questions away from the customer; let the program manager really focus on figuring out what the customer wants built. It sounds like your average customer isn't that technically savvy. If that's the case, figure out a way to speak their language (which most experienced program managers can do). They really don't care about the difference between a designer, a developer, and a tooth fairy that shows up and delivers the site that they want. It's also worth considering whether you really want to take on projects that are mostly web design. If not, you should work on improving your marketing materials to focus on what you do best (interactive line of business web applications, or whatever). You can steer the conversation toward what business problem the customer wants to solve, and propose the statement of work that best matches their objective. I think this will do the most good, and then it's never a question of misleading them. It's about packaging up a solution that matches what they want.
