Half-Normal Plot of Coefficients from Binary Factorial Experiments

After I wrote this all up I debated whether or not I should post it because I think I know the answer to this question (after looking at the two models I'd end up with), but since I don't really know or understand the why here you go... Can (or maybe should) half-normal probability plotting to determine significance of effects in unreplicated $2^k$ and $2^{k-p}$ factorial and fractional factorial designs be extended to experiments where the response is binary? Consider the following data set where p is the proportion of successes out of 1,000 trials. (This data set is from the article Analysis of Factorial Experiments with Defects or Defectives as the Response by Bisgaard and Fuller. If I can't find the answer in other readings, at some point I'll post another question as to why they chose the regression approach they did over using logistic regression.)

Below is my half-normal probability plot function for R . ##################################################################################### half.norm Here is my code for creating the logit model and the resulting half-normal probability plot. logistic Or would that approach not be sound and we would want to reduce the model based on p-values such as looking at the results from anova.glm(logistic, test="Chisq") ?
