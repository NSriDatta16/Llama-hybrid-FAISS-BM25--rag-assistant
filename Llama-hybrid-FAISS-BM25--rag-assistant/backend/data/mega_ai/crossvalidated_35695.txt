Both A and B have a $1/2$ chance to be ahead after any odd number of trials $t$ (odd to avoid ties). However, these events are related. Whichever is ahead after $t=1$ has a $3/4$ chance to be ahead after $t=3$, and this gets more dramatic as $t$ increases. The average number of lead changes does grow to infinity as the total number of trials increases, but slowly. A random walk without drift in $1$ dimension is recurrent, so however far you may be in the lead, the chance you will be tied at some point in the future (with an infinite number of trials) is $1$. However, even if you lead by only one, the expected time until you are even again is infinite. There is a significant chance that it will take an extremely long time to get back to even. That said, the mode is being used to exaggerate the effect . It actually would be a surprise to see no lead changes at all in $20,000$ trials. If you would like to compute some of the probabilities, you have to count something akin to lattice walks which don't cross the diagonal. There is a great combinatorial method which applies to random walks (and to Brownian motion) which don't cross such a line, called the reflection principle or reflection method . This is one method to determine the Catalan numbers . Here are two other applications: The number of sequences so that $A$ ends up ahead $10,200-9,800$ is $20,000 \choose 9,800$. In each sequence ending up at $(10,200, 9,800)$, either $B$ is never in the lead, or there is some point at which $B$ is first in the lead. If $B$ gains the lead, then if you reverse the later trials, you get a sequence ending up at $(9,799, 10,201)$, and this is a bijection. So, the number of sequences which end up at $(10,200, 9,800)$ so that $B$ was never in the lead is ${20,000 \choose 9,800} - {20,000 \choose 10,201} = {20,000 \choose 9,800} - {20,000 \choose 9,799} = {20,000 \choose 9,800} \frac{401}{10,201}.$ So, you can see that the chance $B$ was ahead at some point, given that you end up at $(10,200, 9,800),$ is about $96\%$. The total number of sequences with any endpoint so that $A$ is never behind is ${20,000 \choose 10,000} \approx 2^{20,000}/\sqrt{10,000 \pi}.$ So, the probability that $A$ is never behind is about $\frac{1}{100 \sqrt{\pi}}$. The chance that the lead never changes is about $\frac{1}{50 \sqrt{\pi}} \approx 1/89.$ The average number of lead changes is about $56$.
