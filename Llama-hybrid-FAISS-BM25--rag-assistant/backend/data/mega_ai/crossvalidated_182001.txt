Late answer, but... Liblinear (standalone) The authors recently released a new, faster version. A multi-threaded implementation is also available. LIBLINEAR is a linear classifier for data with millions of instances and features. It supports : L2-regularized classifiers L2-loss linear SVM, L1-loss linear SVM, and logistic regression (LR) L1-regularized classifiers L2-loss linear SVM and logistic regression (LR) L2-regularized support vector regression L2-loss linear SVR and L1-loss linear SVR. Sofia (R, standalone) Google released Sofia , which is also callable from R through RSofia . It performs regressions, classification and ranking through: Pegasos SVM Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) SVM Passive-Aggressive Perceptron Perceptron with Margins ROMMA Logistic Regression (with Pegasos Projection) There is an implementation of online kmeans , which is available in the source code, but not in the R package. Online random forests (Python, standalone) Some implementation of online random forests are available on git. To mention a few : here is a C standalone implementation and here is a python implementation . Note that the theory is at its early stages, new implementations may come latter.
