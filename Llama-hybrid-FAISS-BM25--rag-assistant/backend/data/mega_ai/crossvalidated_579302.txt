Calculating Potential Usefulness of Acquiring Additional Data

Imagine Anne has a labeled training dataset for a machine learning prediction problem. There is an opportunity to acquire more data from an agent, at a cost. However, before she decides to acquire that data by paying the cost, she wants to know if that additional data is likely to improve her model or not. You can assume that there exists a black-box mechanism that allows Anne to perform some low cost computations on that additional data or the combined data (to explore the usefulness of that data). But she can NOT train a new machine learning model using the new data before she pays the non-refundable cost. What kind of computations Anne should consider to get an idea/intuition of the added value this new data may bring? For example, if she could calculate a few metrics on the additional data or on the combined data, what should those metrics be? How would your answer change if this was an unsupervised machine learning problem (e.g. clustering), and the datasets were unlabelled. A few examples: Anne may be particularly interested in acquiring additional data to improve her model where it is weak. For e.g. this may be due to the fact that her original data may only cover a part of the feature space or distribution. Another example can be that her original data may have non-random missingness, which additional data may help with. It may also be useful to acquire more data points near the decision boundary etc. I understand that the answers may vary depending on a lot of factors like the type of data, type of algorithm, the evaluation method, test distribution etc. But please feel free to make simplifying assumptions. T he question is intentionally very general because I want to elicit answers from perspectives that I may not be aware of. You can also assume that Anne is indeed using the right model and the right learning algorithm, and there is scope to improve the model if she gets the right data.
