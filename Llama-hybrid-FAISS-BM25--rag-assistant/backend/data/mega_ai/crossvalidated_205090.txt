What is the best way to determine which proteins are significantly bound on a testing chip?

I've got a question about the data from a biological experiment. Three times the same 1024 different proteins are spotted on one testing chip. Target of the experiment is to see whether certain proteins in the lysate bind to particular proteins on the chip. They are spotted three times to increase reliability. The chip is graphically analysed after radioactive ATP made a print by a third party. After analysis I get a matrix of 3 columns and 1024 rows, where the rows are the values of the same protein, but they differ a bit. Depicted below is are the highest data points in a boxplot, plotted on their lowest measured value. The first 600 are similar to the ones on the left on the chart; they run almost in a flat line. In brown there is the median, in blue the median + 3*MAD, in yellow the Inter Quartile Range * 2,2 (note, there is 1,5 in the title, it should be 2,2) To tell if a protein is bound (gets and "ON-call"). I use the Median Absolute Deviation-method on the lowest values of the measurements. I use this method because the number of on-calls might be significant (200 of 1024 proteins), and greatly influence the mean in other outlier detection methods â€” like you can see it does with the IQR. This gives me a criterion: median + 3*(1,4826*MAD). I have taken the 1,4826 factor from literature. If a value is higher, it is an outlier; in this case that means the protein is bound. The question: Since I only use the lowest values of the measurements, I basically ignore the other values. In particular I am unsure of the measurements of a protein, where the lowest point is under the criterion, but the average is not. After removing outliers the data is normalish distributed (a tat skewed). Or maybe I am completely wrong and there is an entirely other way to detect values that correspond to bound proteins. Please tell me what you think! In general: how to detect outliers between points after three measurements?
