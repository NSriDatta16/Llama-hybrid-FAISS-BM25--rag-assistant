My first answer was wrong, so I'm deleting it. (I hit the delete button, apparently you vote to delete). Magento is an ecommerce solution that supports multiple currency, internationalization, and different tax rates. We've used it before for Versatile Hangars . The base locale for this site is US, but Magento supports multiple site on one install. I haven't played around with a shared user list between to sites, but I'm sure it could be fudged. Sorry for the quick answer before. I hope this works for you.
