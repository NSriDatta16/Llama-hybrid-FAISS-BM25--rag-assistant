First, I would suggest that you force developers to clean up their own messes, not do it for them. By doing it for them, you are only encouraging them to stay ignorant. By all mean, be a resource and provide help for them, but make them do it themselves . They will quickly learn what they have to. Second, there are few options that have the kind of integration with VS that most developers would like. SVN is one of them. Team System is another (but a much more expensive and complciated solution). Visual Source Safe is also an option, but it's really an old, out of date system that hasn't been updated since 2005 (and even that, that was largely a patch job to a system that hadn't been updated in 7 years before it). If you want free, there is nothing worth using that is simpler than Subversion. Everything else will be ancient technology (like CVS) that will have even more problems. There are several free SCM's that are more powerful, like git and Mercurial, but you would have even more problems. If you're willing to pay, then many third party tools have better merge and visualization tools. One I like is AccuRev . There are also some better commercial SVN plug-ins for visual studio that may help as well. I've not used any of them, but they may improve the developers use of SVN.
