Depends on your audience imho. If you're targeting the "average Joe" users, I'd say catch your mother-exception on top-level. Terminate the application and tell the user that something has gone wrong (please don't use a "call us" or "report bug" sentence - They are useless). If you're targeting developers (a lรก in-house development) an unhandled exception is okay-ish IMHO, but the best thing would be to print and / or log the stack-trace and all other information you got available along with a link to a site where it say's who's responsible for the application and who to contact if the problem persists.
