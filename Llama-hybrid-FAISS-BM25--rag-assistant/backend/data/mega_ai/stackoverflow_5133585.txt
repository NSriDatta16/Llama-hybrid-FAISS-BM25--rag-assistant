This is too long for a comment but who set that webpage? You? From what I can see it doesn't look correct. Here's what you get back: $ telnet latata.pl 80 Trying 91.205.74.65... Connected to latata.pl. Escape character is '^]'. GET /pl.php HTTP/1.0 Host: latata.pl HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Sun, 27 Feb 2011 13:49:19 GMT Server: Apache/2 X-Powered-By: PHP/5.2.16 Vary: Accept-Encoding,User-Agent Content-Length: 10 Connection: close Content-Type: text/html ����ʣ��Connection closed by foreign host. The HTML is simply: ±ê³ó¿¡Ê£¯¬ And that's how your page appears from a browser. Is there a valid reason why no charset is specified in that HTML page?
