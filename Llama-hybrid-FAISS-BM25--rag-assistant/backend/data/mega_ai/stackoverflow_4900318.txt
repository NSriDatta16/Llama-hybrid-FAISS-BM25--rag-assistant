Learning Qt - Creating a QApplication

I'm re-learning c++ (I have 10 years Java experience) and I'm also learning Qt in the process... I'm used to creating objects (in Java) via: MyObject o = new MyObject(); But when creating a QApplication in c++, the examples simply show: QApplication app(argc, argv); app.setOrganizationName("My Company"); app.setApplicationName("The App"); So suddenly, I have a reference to "app" and no obvious (to me) assignment to app... Is this pattern a c++ thing or specific to Qt? What is this pattern called? Thanks!
