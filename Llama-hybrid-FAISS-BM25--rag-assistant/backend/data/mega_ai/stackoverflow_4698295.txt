IMO, in order to have the mouseover event to be fired up frequently would be binding the mouseover event to the parent element of all the affected elements, or perhaps to the document itself, since events get bubbled up, they are probably the only elements that can fire the mouseover events. Then further, write a hit method in your mouseover event and actively check the position of your mouse cursor, see whether it's going under the target element's boundary. Tradeoff in usability and performance. You choose. My 2cents. Or perhaps, you can reverse engineer jQuery UI to see how they implement the drag element. Haven't check thou, but I think there should be a wiser way.
