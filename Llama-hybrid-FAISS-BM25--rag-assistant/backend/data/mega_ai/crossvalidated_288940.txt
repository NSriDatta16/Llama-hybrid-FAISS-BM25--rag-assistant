Logistic regression is not a classification method. And you don't need two levels of data splitting for this problem. You can use the Efron-Gong "optimism" bootstrap (see for example the R rms package validate.lrm function) for the validation. Logistic regression is a probability estimation model, and indexes of predictive ability for it should be chosen from among the class of proper probability accuracy scores and the $c$-index (concordance probability; area under the ROC curve).
