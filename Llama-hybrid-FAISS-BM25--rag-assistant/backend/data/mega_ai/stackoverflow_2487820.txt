I don't think it's possible to answer this question without your code and (if possible) a link to your development page. However if you want a tree view you should be using sortable instead of draggable/droppable. [Link removed because I can only paste one link!] OR, best of all, use a Tree plugin. This page links to the better ones. http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138128/Tree
