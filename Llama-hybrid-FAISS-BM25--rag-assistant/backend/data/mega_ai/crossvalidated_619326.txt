Theory Bonett (2006) proposed an approximate confidence interval for the variance and standard deviation of nonnormal distributions. It's based on a variance-stabilizing transformation for $\hat{\sigma}^2$ that is $\log(\hat{\sigma}^2)$ and the application of the delta method. Specifically, $\operatorname{Var}(\log(\hat{\sigma}^2))\approx\{\gamma_{4} - (n-3)/n\}/(n - 1)$ where $\gamma_4 = \mu^4/\sigma^4$ and $\mu^4$ is the population fourth central moment. In practice, $\gamma_4$ is unknown and has to be estimated. Bonett suggested $$ \bar{\gamma_4}=n\sum(Y_i - m)^4/\left(\sum(Y_i - \hat{\mu})^2\right)^2 $$ where $m$ is a trimmed mean with trim-proportion of $1/\left\{2(n - 4)^{1/2}\right\}$ . Curto (2021) proposed to modify the above estimator by replacing $m$ with the median $\hat{\mu}_{med}$ . Bonett's 100(1- $\alpha$ )% confidence interval for $\sigma^2$ is given by $$ \exp\left\{\log(c\hat{\sigma}^2)\pm z_{1-\alpha/2}\operatorname{se}\right\}\tag{1} $$ where $z_{1-\alpha/2}$ is the two-sided critical $z$ -value from the standard normal distribution, $\operatorname{se} = c\left[\left\{\bar{\gamma_4} - (n - 3)/n\right\}/(n - 1)\right]^{1/2}$ and $c=n/(n - z_{1-\alpha/2})$ is an empirically determined small-sample adjustment factor. Taking the square root of the endpoints of $(1)$ gives a confidence interval for $\sigma$ . Burch (2017) suggested yet another method which is more complicated than the one detailed here. Example Using the trimodal distribution given by @Ben, we have set.seed(142857) x So an approximate 95% confidence interval for the population variance is $(19.47;\,26.81)$ . Simulation Let's see how well the interval $(1)$ performs. I will use the same distribution ( rmydist ) as @knrumsey did with $n=200$ .

The confidence interval proposed by @Ben has a simulated coverage of $0.919$ with an average width of $4.39$ . library(stat.extend) set.seed(142857) res 8.612, 1, 0), ci_tmp$Upper - ci_tmp$Lower) }) rowMeans(res) [1] 0.919100 4.387456 R code The following R code implements Bonett's method gamma4 The function VarCI from the DescTools package implements a number of different methods, including the one from Bonett described above.
