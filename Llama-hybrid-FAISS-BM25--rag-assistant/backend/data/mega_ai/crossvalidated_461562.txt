The confusion stems mainly from the predicted vs actual plot for the prices, which is a common source of confusion and not particularly useful in any case for time series problems in general. If you take a closer look, you'll see that your forecasts "look like" the actuals but that they lag behind them. That's because your forecast hasn't really captured any structure at all: your forecast is essentially the current value plus some tiny, meaningless adjustment coming from your complicated model. The proof of this is how bad the forecast in terms of returns is. The random walk probably does just about the same as the more complicated models. This is actually about the best you can expect from trying to forecast stock prices based on their history alone. Due to the way collective expectations about future stock prices quickly feed back into their current value, there is in general little to no "forecastable" part that remains. This is a fundamental property of the application domain. If you are interested in learning how forecasting works, it might be more fruitful to look at other application domains. One alternate approach is to consider related information (other than the price itself) which is private, or which is not private but not widely known to be related to the performance of a particular stock (which could be literally anything until enough people find out about it). There are others.
