java cvs,svn file structure

I have recently learnt how to program in java, I was looking at some open source programs from sourceforge.net and after downloading these programs I don't understand the file structure most of the programs follow. Pretty much every program has src,bin,lib etc folders, how do I know the standard way of organizing my program. Is there any book or resource which explains this? also how do I compile this source code once I have downloaded it, to make a jar file from it thanks
