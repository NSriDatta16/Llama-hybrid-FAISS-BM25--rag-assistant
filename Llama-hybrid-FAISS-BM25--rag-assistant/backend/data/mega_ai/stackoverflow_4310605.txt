Execute Java main method from within a Java desktop app in a different JVM

I have a desktop app and when someone presses a button I want it to kick off another JVM that executes a class' main method. My desktop app already depends on the jar that contains the class with the main method that I want to execute. Currently I've got the following code, however, I was hoping their was a more elegant way of doing this: Runtime runtime = Runtime.getRuntime(); Process process = runtime.exec("java -jar another.jar"); I know I can use ProcessBuilder too. Is there no way such as (excuse the pseudo code): Jvm.execute(Main.class); Since the Main class that I want to call already exists in my classpath, it just feels weird to have to run the java command via Runtime.
