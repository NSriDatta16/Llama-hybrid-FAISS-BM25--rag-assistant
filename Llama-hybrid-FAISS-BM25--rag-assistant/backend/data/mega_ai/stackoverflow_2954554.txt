How can I import code from LaunchPad.net?

I want to import code from Launchpad.net. How can I do it? Is that using SVN? Can I use SVN to keep updated with the code changes? Thank you so much, Robert FYI: this is the code I want to import https://code.launchpad.net/~openerp-commiter/openobject-addons/trunk-extra-addons
