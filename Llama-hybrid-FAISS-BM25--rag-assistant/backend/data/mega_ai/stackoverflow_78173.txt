Given that you're going to be writing some server code anyway, it makes sense to keep storage on the server for a lot of domains (address books, poker scores, gui configuration, etc.,.) For anything the size of what you'll get in Webkit or Gears, you can probably also keep it on your server. The advantage of keeping it on your server is two-fold: You can integrate it fairly simply as a Model layer in a typical MVC framework, and, Users get a consistent view without being tied to their browser/PC, or in a less-than-ideal environment (Internet Caf√©s). The server code for handling this can also be fairly trivial, particularly if it's written with this task in mind, so it's not a huge cognitive burden.
