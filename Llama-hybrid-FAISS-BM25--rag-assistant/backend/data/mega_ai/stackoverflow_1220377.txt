Latitude/Longitude storage and compression in C

Does anyone know the most efficient representation for lat/long coordinates? Accuracy level should be enough for consumer GPS devices. Most implementations seem to use double for each unit, but I'm suspicious that a float or fixed point format should be sufficient. I'd be curious to hear from anyone who has tried to compress and or store large arrays of these values. EDIT: In other words, whats the minimum accuracy required to represent lat/long for a consumer level device?
