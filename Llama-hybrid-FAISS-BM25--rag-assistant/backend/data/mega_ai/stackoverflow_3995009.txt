How to make a window Draggable(C# Winforms)?

I have form. I have enabled the transparency on the form and I have removed it's Title Bar and Border. Inside that i have created a Custom UI, Which have the same features like a window. Basically, my idea is to create custom window. Everything is working as expected but only the windows dragging is not working. I am not sure how to enable it. I googled for this. But i didn't find any useful info for me. Please help me to implement this window dragging.
