Filter XML stream using SAX

I have an XML stream I want to parse using SAX. What I actually want to do is simply echo out the XML stream to an output stream, but optionally filter out some of the tags or alter some of the attributes. Is there already a convenient "Echo" ContentHandler I can leverage to do this?
