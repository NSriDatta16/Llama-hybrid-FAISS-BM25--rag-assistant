Obtain timestamp of items from FTP file list

In Java, I'm trying to log into an FTP server and find all the files newer than x for retrieval. Currently I have an input stream that's reading in the directory contents and printing them out, line by line, which is all well and good, but the output is fairly vague... it looks like this... -rw------- 1 vuser 4773 Jun 10 2008 .bash_history -rw-r--r-- 1 vuser 1012 Dec 9 2007 .bashrc lrwxrwxrwx 1 root 7 Dec 9 2007 .profile -> .bashrc drwx------ 2 vuser 4096 Jan 30 01:08 .spamassassin drwxr-xr-x 2 vuser 4096 Dec 9 2007 backup.upgrade_3_7 dr-xr-xr-x 2 root 4096 Dec 10 2007 bin etc... however, I need the actual timestamp in seconds or milliseconds so that I can determine if I want that file or not. I assume this has something to do with the FTP server's configuration? but I'm kind of stumped.
