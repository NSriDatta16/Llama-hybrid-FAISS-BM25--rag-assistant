I think, the first thing to start would be usecases. What features do you intend to support? After that you can think about the classes you want to make. On a glance the thing that comes at me is how come message isn't an Object. If it was an object it would be way easier to manipulate (for example deleting or hiding would be way more elegant). However since I don't know your use case I'm not sure how that works. Also your Topics and Forums should be in Many-To-One relationship if you want Forums to contain Topics . Again I'm not sure about your use cases but one suggestion would be to give each forum a list of sub-forums (i mean Forum[] subforums ) and an optional link to higher forum. so you could organize your forums hierarchically.
