Can you help me explain what is meaning of these table? Why it is the same results for the Age and Age+20? But differences in the Intercept? What does intercept meaning in this case? I'm using an example here based on linear regression, but the concept can be generalized to logistic regression. Here we add a constant of 20 to the independent variable mpg . Both regression lines using the original and the new one with extra 20 are shown: sysuse auto, clear gen mpg20 = mpg + 20 twoway (lfit price mpg) (lfit price mpg20), xtitle(Mile per gallon) /// legend(label(1 "Origianl") label (2 "Original + 20")) scheme(sj) As you can see, adding a constant to the independent variable merely moves to the line horizontally with out changing the slope. So, that's why your slopes are the same. As for the intercept, if you lengthen the lines in the illustration, you'll see them hitting the y-axis (aka intercept) at different points. That's why your intercepts are different. As to what does it mean for an intercept of 1.17 in your model 2, it's the predicted logit of even when your (age + 20) = 0, in other words, when age = -20. [...] we want to do the test like, we will consider whether, 20 years old differences between the subjects [...] Is the code we wrote correct? No, it's not the correct code to answer that question. There is a couple ways to do that. First, you may use contrast to test the coefficient of Age in model 1 versus 20 times the same coefficient. Another simpler way is to change your age's unit to "20-year" by dividing them age with 20 (not add.) Here is the same example using original mpg: . gen mpgInUnit20 = mpg / 20 . . reg price mpg Source | SS df MS Number of obs = 74 -------------+------------------------------ F( 1, 72) = 20.26 Model | 139449474 1 139449474 Prob > F = 0.0000 Residual | 495615923 72 6883554.48 R-squared = 0.2196 -------------+------------------------------ Adj R-squared = 0.2087 Total | 635065396 73 8699525.97 Root MSE = 2623.7 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ price | Coef.

Std. Err. t P>|t| [95% Conf. Interval] -------------+---------------------------------------------------------------- mpgInUnit20 | -4777.887 1061.534 -4.50 0.000 -6894.016 -2661.758 _cons | 11253.06 1170.813 9.61 0.000 8919.088 13587.03 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ The first model's coefficient -238.9 corresponds to the unit of "mile per gallon." The second model's coefficient -4777.9 corresponds to the unit of "20 miles per gallon." The p-value of mpgInUnit20 is then testing if an increment of 1 "20 miles per gallon" is statistically significant. Lastly, please double check your sample sizes in the two model, from your coefficient it seems the difference is something closer to 21 years instead of 20.
