Well you have missing data ... From your tags I'm guessing that you're trying to do a logistic regression. If you set gender up as a binary variable then you have the option of marking both your binary variables as False where gender is missing if that makes sense in your model. E.g. interpret Gender as "The gender is known to be M/F" thus False just means that the statement isn't true, hence you could mark both variables as False in the event of missing data. Otherwise you'll just have to take out all the rows with missing data which may make your model worse overall given that you've got other variables in the mix.
