How do I predict continuous value from time series data?

I have a glove that have 2 IMUs (Inertial Measurement Unit) attached to it. It can give the rotation value as Quaternion (x,y,z,w) and acceleration of the hand (x,y,z). I put it on my left hand and I want to predict the position of the hand relative to some fixed point on my body (e.g. my head). When I collect the data, I just use the Vive controller to track my hand. Right now I just feed the value into a simple model like SVM to predict (x,y,z) of the hand relative to my head. The problem is that the output is jumpy as the sensors are not stable enough. And because it doesn't take into account data in the previous timestep. I want to utilize time series data as my data is time series in nature. Which algorithms I should use if I'm treating my data as time series? You can suggest me things I should learn about too.
