A perfect model in this case will map the inputs (whatever covariates you have) to the outputs (the rank of the student in the class). Another way to think of this is by mapping first to the scores, and then mapping those scores to the rank. I'm going to ignore error for now. test score: $y = \sum \beta x$ rank: $ r = R(y)$ In which $R$ is the ranking function. The problem is that $R$ is a non-linear function that depends entirely on the data itself. If we assume that we have an infinite amount of data, then we know the complete distribution of $y$, and $R(y)$ is essentially the cumulative density function. It tells you what percent of people scored worse than you on the test, the area to the left of your score. This appears to be quite similar to the functional form of the generalized linear model. I think this is why the logistic regression approach was proposed by @Mike Anderson. If your exam scores were logistically distributed, then the link function to use would be the logit (its inverse is the cumulative density function we care about). Similarly, if the scores were normally distributed, the probit function would be the link function. For your regression, the only way to estimate ranks is to say "given that my data are distributed as X, this point is in the 34th percentile". Otherwise, how do you know what a two point increase in your test score translates to in terms of rank? The caveat is that you have to estimate that distribution in order to choose your link function (certain functional forms will make your life a lot easier). Furthermore, this model isn't going to say "you were the 6th best out of a class of 38", rather "if the test scores were distributed how we think they are, your score would put you in the 15th percentile."
