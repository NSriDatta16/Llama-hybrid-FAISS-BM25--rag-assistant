Averaging averages and standard deviations

I am comparing exam scores for different subjects: physics, biology, english. I am looking at what proportion of the curriculum is spent on each subject. The number of students is fixed: the same for all classes. physics mechanics score av = 10; sd = 2 physics electricity score av = 15; sd = 5 biology score av = 10; sd = 3 english score av = 12; sd = 6 physics proportion av = 0.5 biology A proportion av = 0.1 biology B proportion av = 0.2 english proportion av = 0.2 Obviously I can say that english was taught 0.2 of the time and has a score of 12 with sd 6. However, biology and physics aren't so straightforward. Is the following reasonable: For physics, I average the scores (again, same number of students): to get physics = 12.5. To get the standard deviation, I sqrt(2*2+5*5)=5.4. Therefore my physics score is 12.5 with std 5.4, and I compare that with the physics proportion, 0.5. Lastly, for biology, I know my score is 12 and my standard deviation is 6. To see what proportion of the time is spent on biology, I simply add: 0.2 + 0.1 = 0.3. I therefore have: physics (0.5) --> 12.5, 5.4 biology (0.3) --> 12, 6 english (0.2) --> 12, 6 I am wondering if my method for combining the averages and standard deviations (essentially, averaging them) for physics and for combing the proportions (adding them) for biology were reasonable for this problem specifically.
