a. Why do you need using a transformation, and why manipulating the $log$ transformation? Try to think if there's any other way. b. No, this constant doesn't have to be the same, but try to add one transformation at a time and check each time that you are really improving the model. c. Of course coefficients will be affected. In logistic regression the output variable is $\hat{\pi}_i=P(y_i=1|x_i)$ but don't forget it is the sigmoid of $\hat{\theta}_i$ : $$\hat{\pi}_i=\frac{e^{\hat{\theta_i}}}{1+e^{\hat{\theta_i}}}=\frac{e^{\hat{\beta}^Tx_i}}{1+e^{\hat{\beta}^Tx_i}}$$ As you transform a variable, the corresponding coefficient is bound to change as the MLE solution still tries to optimize the solution with respect to $y_i$ .
