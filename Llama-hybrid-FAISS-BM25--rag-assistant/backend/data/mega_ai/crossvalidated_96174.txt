Standardizing data with categorical and quantitative data

I'm analyzing a data set as a final project. This is a categorical data analysis course so I will be focusing on a logistic regression analysis. I scrapped together the data set from flight data and weather data. Data is for flights coming into ORD. I want to model flight delay (whether a flight is delayed or not). Here is the a summary of the variables involved: > summary(flight_data) DAY_OF_MONTH DAY_OF_WEEK AIRLINE_ID CRS_DEP_TIME DEP_DELAY TAXI_OUT TAXI_IN Min. : 1.00 Min. :1.000 19977 :7838 Min. : 333.0 Min. :-21.000 Min. : 1.00 Min. : 1.000 1st Qu.: 6.00 1st Qu.:2.000 19805 :6082 1st Qu.: 510.0 1st Qu.: -4.000 1st Qu.: 10.00 1st Qu.: 5.000 Median :17.00 Median :4.000 20398 :3974 Median : 761.0 Median : -1.000 Median : 12.00 Median : 7.000 Mean :15.17 Mean :4.058 19386 : 576 Mean : 760.2 Mean : 9.072 Mean : 15.23 Mean : 8.009 3rd Qu.:24.00 3rd Qu.:6.000 19790 : 553 3rd Qu.: 985.0 3rd Qu.: 7.000 3rd Qu.: 17.00 3rd Qu.: 9.000 Max. :30.00 Max. :7.000 20355 : 453 Max. :1439.0 Max. :931.000 Max. :301.00 Max. :179.000 (Other): 866 CRS_ARR_TIME AIR_TIME DISTANCE Weather.Type Wind.Speed Wind.Dir region Min. : 1.0 Min. : 11.0 Min. : 67.0 DRIZZLE : 219 Min. : 0.000 Min. : 1.00 midwest :5856 1st Qu.: 625.0 1st Qu.: 55.0 1st Qu.: 334.0 FOG : 35 1st Qu.: 6.000 1st Qu.: 8.00 northeast:4487 Median : 865.0 Median : 99.0 Median : 647.0 MIST : 569 Median : 8.000 Median :20.00 south :5833 Mean : 849.9 Mean :105.8 Mean : 762.1 None :17823 Mean : 8.462 Mean :19.16 west :4166 3rd Qu.:1075.0 3rd Qu.:130.0 3rd Qu.: 925.0 RAIN : 1420 3rd Qu.:11.000 3rd Qu.:29.75 Max. :1438.0 Max. :486.0 Max. :4244.0 THUNDERSTORM: 276 Max. :25.000 Max. :37.00 I have a few questions: I have categorical variables, as well as quantitative variables. Clearly many of the variables are on different scales (time, degrees, etc). Should I standardize my variables? Does it matter? Do I do this to just the quantitative ones? We learned a bit about GAMs in our class. I would like to check whether some of my variables appear to be linear in the log-odds of arrival-delay (if not that would justify use of a GAM). Is this the following code an appropriate approach to this question? Windspeed: logodds
