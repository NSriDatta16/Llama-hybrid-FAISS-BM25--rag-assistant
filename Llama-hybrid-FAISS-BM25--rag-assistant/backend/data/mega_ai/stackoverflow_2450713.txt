In general the approach I recommend is to Unit Test the hell out of it. Build up your tests so that they're all passing on the 32-bit implementation and then start building and testing on 64-bit. It's worth devoting particular attention to any parts of your code where you do any of the following: Stream data across the network (especially for types such as size_t which will now be a different size. Go through this code and change things like size_t and long to explicit 32 or 64-bit typedefs) Load/save binary data to file (ditto re: size_t/long) Do bit-twiddling with hardcoded values such as 0xFFFFFFFF There really are no shortcuts except to test as many code paths as you can. How easy the job will be will depend on how portably the code was written. You might be lucky...
