JQueryUI: automatically add .accordion(); functionality to any new elements with class="accordion"

I'm using the JQuery-UI Accordion, but I'm trying to find a way to not have to initialize it any time any new element is added. Using AJAX I'm inserting html into a page, but on any page load I am having to re-initialize any accordions- // .ajax handler success: function(xml) { // find accordions $("div.accordion").accordion(); } Is there any way I can automatically have this run any time the DOM has changed? I know there is the livequery plugin -- but is there a simpler more elegant method?
