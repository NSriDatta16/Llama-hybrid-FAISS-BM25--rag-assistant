If you specify the time series to have frequency=1 , you are explicitly ruling out seasonal patterns in them, and also ruling out seasonal models in auto.arima . That is, SARIMA models will not be considered during the model selection process in auto.arima . If you have seasonal data, you should specify the number of periods in a full seasonal cycle, e.g. frequency=12 for monthly data. When supplied to auto.arima , such a series would allow for SARIMA models to be considered and hence for forecasts reflecting seasonality. (In principle, even yearly data could be seasonal if there were something special about every odd year but not even year. Then you could try specifying frequency=2 .This is just an example.)
