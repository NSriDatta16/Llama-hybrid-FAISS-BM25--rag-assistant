What do you mean it changes the URL? Does it try and access the url http://www.example.com/id=123&amp;place=123 ? Or does it still try and access http://www.example.com/id=123&place=123 ? When I try your example pointing to localhost instead of example.com , and record the request from Safari 5, I get the ampersand & , not &amp; $ nc -l 4242 GET /?id=123&place=123 HTTP/1.1 Host: localhost:4242 User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_5_8; en-us) AppleWebKit/533.17.8 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/5.0.1 Safari/533.17.8 Accept: application/xml,application/xhtml+xml,text/html;q=0.9,text/plain;q=0.8,image/png,*/*;q=0.5 Referer: http://livedom.validator.nu/blank.html Accept-Language: en-us Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Connection: keep-alive Note that using &amp; in the URL in your source is actually the correct way to write it; if you write & , browsers will try to interpret the following text as an entity. If it cannot find a matching entity, then it will assume that you incorrectly used a raw & and will use that, but you need to be careful because you could accidentally form an entity instead of the actual ampersand you were requesting. So, to avoid possible mistakes, you actually should write &amp; in your code. If you are inspecting or serializing the DOM, such as through innerHTML , Safari may be rewriting the URL for you to correctly use &amp; , to avoid this sort of error.
