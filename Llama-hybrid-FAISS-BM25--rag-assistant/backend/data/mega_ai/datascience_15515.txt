If you use RMSE for classification, then effectively every squared error will be a 1 . The mean squared error will be your misclassification rate and the RMSE the square root of that. Other Helpful Information The square root of the mean/average of the square of all of the error. The use of RMSE is very common and it makes an excellent general purpose error metric for numerical predictions. Compared to the similar Mean Absolute Error, RMSE amplifies and severely punishes large errors. $$RMSE = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}((y_{i} - \hat{y}_{i})^2)}$$ MATLAB Code RMSE = sqrt(mean((y-y_pred).^2)); R Code RMSE Python (Scikit Learn) from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error RMSE = mean_squared_error(y, y_pred)**0.5
