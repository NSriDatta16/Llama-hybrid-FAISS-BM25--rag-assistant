magento cutom module to edit product tab

Ok so i built a module now I need to move it so it shows up as a tab in edit product I tried creating directory app/code/local/mycompanyname/adminhtml/Catalog/Product with all the same sub directories and file structure of my original module and in each of the files change the classes for example edit.php from class _ _Block_Adminhtml_ _Edit extends Mage_Adminhtml_Block_Widget_Form_Container { //clip } to class _ _Block_Adminhtml_Catalog_Product_Edit extends Mage_Adminhtml_Block_Catalog_Product_Widget_Form_Container but nothing is showing up in my edit product ?? { //clip }
