How to tie a project to a slave node in Hudson CI server?

I'm trying to set up a Hudson slave node. Following Hudson -- Step by step guide to set up master and slave machines one eventually finds the instruction to "Check the 'Tie this project to node' check box" on a project. I don't find this check box, nor any other way to tell a project that the new slave node exists. How is this done? (I have actually followed the approach of http://i-proving.com/2009/02/17/setting-up-a-hudson-slave/ , using JNLP, not SSH, but still have no way to tie a project to a node.)
