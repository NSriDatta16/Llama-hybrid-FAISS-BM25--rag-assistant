Diodeus has a good point. The stack overflow community is to help specific questions, not to write programs for each other. You have a number of needs, and I will try to help you sort them out: Embedded Video Lightbox Automatic Popup Stored State Embedding videos can be a challenge. Quickly searching TheGoogle (embed a video) gives me this link: http://www.hunlock.com/blogs/Everything_You_Ever_Needed_To_Know_About_Video_Embedding I did not read it, but the point is you can find many resources for video embedding. Lightbox There are many lightbox scripts ( http://www.lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/ ), you will have to slog through them to find one that you like. Automatic Popup If you're using jQuery I would suggest the jQuery.ready function. Stored State To see if a user has visited the homepage before, I would suggest setting a cookie. http://www.quirksmode.org/js/cookies.html
