The purpose of the guard is to prevent the file from being re included in the same .cpp file more than once. It does not protect against including the file in more than one .cpp file. If you are sure that a header file isn't included in another header file, then the guard is not required. but it's still good form. even better form is to use #pragma once if your compiler supports it.
