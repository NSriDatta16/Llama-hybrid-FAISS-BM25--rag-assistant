Best way to delete a duplicateMovieClip?

ham_mc.onPress=function(){ startDrag(this); _root.ham_mc.swapDepths(getNextHighestDepth()); } ham_mc.onRelease=ham_mc.onReleaseOutside=function(){ stopDrag(); _root.ham_mc.duplicateMovieClip("ham_mc"+x,_root.getNextHighestDepth()); x++ } This code just generates a new ham_mc where the user releases the original (drag and drop). The original returns to its starting point. I have the same code for a movieclip called cheese_mc, the user can drag and drop cheese too. So, if more than one of these ham_mc's and cheese_mc's are created, what is the best way to delete the last one created? I would like a simple button, lets call it delete_mc. The button is pressed, reversing the last duplicateMovieClip action. How do I implement this?
