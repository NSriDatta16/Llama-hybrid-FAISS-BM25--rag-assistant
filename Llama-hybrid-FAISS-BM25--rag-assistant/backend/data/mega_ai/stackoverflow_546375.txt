User interface for reordering a list items

I have a list of items as a part of a web application. The question is how user can manipulate the order of items in the list (not the list sort order). The typical way is to use arrow buttons to move items up or down. The other way is the drag-and-drop. But are there any other ways for a user interface for list reordering?
