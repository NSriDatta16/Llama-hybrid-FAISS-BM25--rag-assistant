You are essentially looking for a prediction-interval , specifically for a $[0,0.75]$ interval. Equivalently, you could read up on quantile forecasts for a 75% quantile. There are many ways to calculate such a quantile prediction, including: parametric approaches, as in ARIMA: you assume normal noise in the data generating process, predict both the mean and the variance and extract the percentile from the predictive density resampling-based approaches, as in most Bayesian treatments: you derive a predictive density and sample from that "direct" approaches, where you directly predict your quantile as a point forecast (e.g., Gneiting, 2011 ) Whether either one of these is successful will depend on your training data and on the percentiles you are aiming at. Very high (or low) percentiles are typically harder.
