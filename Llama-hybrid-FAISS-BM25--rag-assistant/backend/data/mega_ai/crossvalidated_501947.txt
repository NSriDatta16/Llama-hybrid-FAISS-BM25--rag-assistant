Linear Regression of Two Non-Stationary Series

I am working with two time series that are non-stationary. I would like to regress one to another (Y = Global Temperature Anomalies, X = C02 emissions) to see the relationship. However, I was wondering that the fact they are not stationary may cause some problems in the results. More, I read that cointegration may take an important role in this topic but not sure how to use it. Could anyone clarify? Thank you.
