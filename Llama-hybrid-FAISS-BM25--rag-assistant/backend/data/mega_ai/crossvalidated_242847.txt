Perplexity of the following example

This example is from Stanford's lecture about Language Models. A system has to recognise An operator ($P=\frac{1}{4}$) Sales ($P=\frac{1}{4}$) Technical Support ($P=\frac{1}{4}$) 30000 Names ($P=\frac{1}{120,000}$) The answer is given as 53. However, when I calculate it, it turns out to be around 56. This is how I did it: $$Perplexity \ = \ (4\times 4 \times 4 \times 120000)^{\frac {1}{4}}$$. What am I doing wrong? It's on page 34 here: https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs124/lec/languagemodeling.pdf
