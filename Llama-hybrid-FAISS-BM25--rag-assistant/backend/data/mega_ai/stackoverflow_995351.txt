Getting RegExp result after being used in if-statement

I've seen people do the following: if (/Firefox\/(\+S)/.test(userAgent)) { firefox = RegExp.$1; } I know (sorta) what the regexp does, but I'm not really sure how it can be accessed with RegExp.$1 . And as a side note: if (/Win(?:dows )?([^do]{2})\s?(\d+\.\d+)?/.test(ua)) { if (RegExp.$1 == "NT") { switch (RegExp.$2) { What's the difference between $1 and $2 ?
