I don't know about an architecture being definitively the best, but there are some best practices you can follow. Check out these papers: Learning to Generate Images with Perceptual Similarity Metrics Push it to the Limit: Discover Edge-Cases in Image Data with Autoencoders Walking the Tightrope: An Investigation of the Convolutional Autoencoder Bottleneck To sum it up, residual blocks in between downsampling, SSIM as a loss function, and larger feature map sizes in the bottleneck seem to improve reconstruction quality significantly. How that translates to the latent space is not entirely clear yet.
