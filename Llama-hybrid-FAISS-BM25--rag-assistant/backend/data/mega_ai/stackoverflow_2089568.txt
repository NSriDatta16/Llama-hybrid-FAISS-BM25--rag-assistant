You are performing two very distinctive operations using this method, and I would discourage this sort of query. The fully proper way to do this is to make it into two separate queries, and run them separately. If you want, you could simply run the second query WITHOUT the count, and then get a count of the rows returned at the application level, and that would be acceptable, and THAT count would be equal to 0 where no rows are returned.
