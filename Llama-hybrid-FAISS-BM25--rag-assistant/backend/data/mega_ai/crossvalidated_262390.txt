Application of Machine Learning to the Automated Theorem Proving

I am very interested in developing a machine-learning algorithm that could learn from the axioms, properties, and examples of the mathematical conjectures of interest to generate possible key properties of possible proofs, which AI could then deduce the proof sketches. I am curious what kind of research has been done on those topics as I have an impression that there has not been many research since recent years. If I would like to come up with a proof for Jacobian Conjecture, does learning algorithm have to learn everything about the prerequisite materials, such as commutative algebra, set theory, and analysis? How does it work?
