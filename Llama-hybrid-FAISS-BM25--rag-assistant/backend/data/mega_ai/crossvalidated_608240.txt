Binary probability models: considering event probability above the prior probability

Consider a model of the probability of a binary, yes/no-type of event. The event is infrequent, say it happens only once every thousand times. In that regard, the prior probability of the event is $0.001$ . Consequently, if a predictive model like a logistic regression predicts a probability of $0.05$ given a certain situation (the model features), while there is still only a $5\%$ chance of the event happening, the event is $50$ -times more likely to occur than usual. $$ \dfrac{0.05}{0.001} $$ If that event is something catastrophic, I would want to know if the chance of it happening if $50$ times higher than usual, even if the event remains unlikely ( $5\%$ ). What drawbacks might there be to looking at predicted probability in this way? My reservation is that I don't want to get hung up on something like, "The chance of it happening is up from ultra-super-duper-unlikely to ultra-unlikely," something like a change in probability from a prior of $0.000001$ to $0.0001$ . At the same time, a $100$ -fold increase in event probability seems like a big deal, even if the event remains unlikely.
