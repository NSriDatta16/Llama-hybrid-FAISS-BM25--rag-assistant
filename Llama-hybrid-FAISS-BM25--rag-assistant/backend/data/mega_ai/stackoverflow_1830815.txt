The documentation page of Net_Geo::Net_Geo() says that : The method accepts two parameters : bool Net_Geo() ( string $applicationName = '' , string $alternateServerUrl = '' ) And those parameters are : string $applicationName - Optional application name to use in UserAgent when polling Netgeo string $alternateServerUrl - URL to Netgeo service script, will be set to " http://netgeo.caida.org/perl/netgeo.cgi " unless changed You are not passing any of those parameters -- which means the default Netgeo service URL is used... ... And if you try to open it ( http://netgeo.caida.org/perl/netgeo.cgi ), you'll see it doesn't work ; my Firefox says it cannot connect to the server. This probably explains why your code doesn't produce any expected output : if it relies on a geolocalition server, and that server doesn't work anymore... As a sidenote : according to the index of pear packages in the Networking section , Net_Geo is not maintained anymore, and the last version was released in 2006-03-29 ; which is quite not a good sign... If you can install PECL packages (you'll probably need to be admin of your server) , maybe the GeoIP package would interest you.
