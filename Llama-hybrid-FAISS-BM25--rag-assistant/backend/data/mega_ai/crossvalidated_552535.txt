What is the best way to validate whether a set of given scores are a good predictor of a success metric?

For example, I have a table of items each with the given scores (no unit) and success metric (quantity value). The success metric is the real-life performance indicating number of items sold, etc. whereas the given scores were the predicted success (unitless metric). What is a good data science method for validating whether these scores do a good job indicating the success metric? I can create a prediction model with mediocre accuracy. Are there other methods that can be used specifically to validate as in this case? Item ID Score Success Metric 1 60 982 2 88 1000 3 46 70
