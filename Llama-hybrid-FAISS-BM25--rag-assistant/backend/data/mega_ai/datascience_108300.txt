What method can I use to interpolate a low frequency time series to a high frequency one, using the pattern from a higher resolution time series?

I have a low temporal frequency irregular dataset with a value available every 40 to 48 days. I have another set of time-series data over the same period at 12 day frequency. The pattern of the two datasets are related (but not the values), and I'd like to use the pattern of the 12-day dataset to interpolate the 40-48 day data to a higher temporal resolution (e.g. daily or 10 days). I'll be implementing the analysis in Python (or R would be fine too), but I'm not sure of which method I should be looking to use. Any advice would be much appreciated.
