Add a summary row to MS Access query

I have a query stored in MS Access which is doing a standard select from an Access table. I would like to add a summary row at the end showing sums for some of the data above. I have looked at DSum() but it isn't suitable as I would have to include the running total on each row as opposed to just the end. Also, note that I don't want to sum data in column a - I would like to get an empty field for the summary of column a. Example: a | b | c ------------- 0 | 1 | 2 1 | 1 | 9 | 2 | 11 Does anyone know how this problem can be solved in Access? An alternative might be to define a second query which does the aggregation and then merge it with the recordset of the first one, but this doesn't seem particularly elegant to me. In SQL server it is apparently possible to use "COMPUTE" or "ROLLUP" but these are not supported under MS Access.
