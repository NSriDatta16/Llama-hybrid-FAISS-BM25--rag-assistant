I-Jetty or Jetty

I have a web application to be hosted on android device. I am currently using the emulator available with android sdk. My application will serve both static as well as dynamic data. I am currently using jetty version 6.1.22. I wanted to ask what will be a better option to be used. 1. Jetty webserver with stripped off code. 2. I-Jetty. My application uses following features- ResourceHandler to serve static resources. A Generic servlet to serve synchronous data requests. An extension to CometServlet to serve asynchronous data requests. I am looking forward to following criteria for comparison. Application size. Size of apk which will contain the code. Memory and CPU usage under a maximum load of 30 requests/sec. These are short bursts which occur very few times in app-life cycle. The average load would be approximately 5 requests/sec. Ease of maintenance. Including important upgrades of Jetty in application. Any other side-effects which I probably am missing out at.
