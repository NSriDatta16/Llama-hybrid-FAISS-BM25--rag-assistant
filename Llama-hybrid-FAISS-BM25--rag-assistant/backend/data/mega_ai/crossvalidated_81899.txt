I was going to suggest Levene's test , but Wikipedia seems to imply that the Brown-Forsythe test would be better for your heavily skewed variables. Levene's test might be a little more powerful for the normally distributed ones. If you only have two time points corresponding to each time the task was performed, I think this should be pretty straightforward. If you have other time intervals (during which no task was performed) that you want to pool with when the task was performed without feedback, and then compare that pooled variance with the variance during the feedback-assisted task, that might be a little trickier. Hopefully I'm just reading too much into "regular time intervals," and you can ignore this paragraph!
