Add incremented property to IEnumerable by group using LINQ

To simplify the scenario, let's say we have a list of People with FirstName and LastName properties. Our data looks like this: Bob Smith Jane Smith Todd Grover Larry Lewis Jill Lewis Frank Lewis The first step would be to add an Integer property that gets incremented for each item: Bob Smith 1 Jane Smith 2 Todd Grover 3 Larry Lewis 4 Jill Lewis 5 Frank Lewis 6 Ideally, I'd like to reset the counter for every new group to achieve this: Bob Smith 1 Jane Smith 2 Todd Grover 1 Larry Lewis 1 Jill Lewis 2 Frank Lewis 3 Maybe LINQ isn't appropriate. It just seems like LINQ should be able to do this elegantly.
