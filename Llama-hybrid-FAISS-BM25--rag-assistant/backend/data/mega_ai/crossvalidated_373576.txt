Since this looks like a homework question, I will nudge in the right direction rather than answering outright. There are many ways to create or represent timeseries data in R, so I will stick to the most basic one. The R ts function takes in a vector, not a dataframe. To convert your data into a timeseries using this function you would need to filter to the relevant Route and look at the load column as a vector. Since the question asks about monthly predictions, you may want to aggregate to the month level. A package such as xts can simplify this, but I would recommend doing it manually for the first few times. Keep in mind what 'load' would even mean in an aggregated sense. v Note that since you do not pass dates into the ts function, it assumes that there is no missingness in the data. Since these routes appear to run May - Nov, You will need to think about how to handle this based on modifying v , f , and/or p . Once you have a timeseries object, you should be able to leverage the forecast library.
