A potentially dangerous Request.Form value was detected from the client

Every time a user posts something containing or > in a page in my web application, I get this exception thrown. I don't want to go into the discussion about the smartness of throwing an exception or crashing an entire web application because somebody entered a character in a text box, but I am looking for an elegant way to handle this. Trapping the exception and showing An error has occurred please go back and re-type your entire form again, but this time please do not use doesn't seem professional enough to me. Disabling post validation ( validateRequest="false" ) will definitely avoid this error, but it will leave the page vulnerable to a number of attacks. Ideally: When a post back occurs containing HTML restricted characters, that posted value in the Form collection will be automatically HTML encoded. So the .Text property of my text-box will be something & lt; html & gt; Is there a way I can do this from a handler?
