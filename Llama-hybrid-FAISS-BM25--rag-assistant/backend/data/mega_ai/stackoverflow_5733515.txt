Access android assets from XML

I have lots of images in my Android app and was trying to get them organized in folders under the assets directory as opposed to having them all site in the drawable directory. My question is how can I access the assets directory through XML. For instance: Does not work. Is there something I can put in the src string to make this work? Or are assets only accessible using the AssetManager in code.
