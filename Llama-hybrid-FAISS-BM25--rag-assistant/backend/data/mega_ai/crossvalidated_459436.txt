What is the difference between probabilistic graphical model and graphical model?

In this note: Lecture 1: Introduction to Graphical Models , it reads that Next, we will elaborate on the difference between Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGM) and Graphical Models (GM). In brief, a PGM adds structure to a multivariate statistical distribution, while a GM adds structure to any multivariate objective function. What are the "multivariate statistical distribution" and "multivariate objective function"? Is the probabilistic graphical model just the directed acyclic graph or Bayesian network? To quote from this paper: Getting Started in Probabilistic Graphical Models : A number of scholars choose to refer to PGMs that can be represented as directed acyclic graphs, with nodes corresponding to discrete-valued random variables, encoding observed measurements, and no latent variables as Bayesian networks.) But in this blog: A Gentle Introduction to Bayesian Belief Networks , it states that A probabilistic graphical model (PGM), or simply “graphical model” for short, is a way of representing a probabilistic model with a graph structure. And in this tag description it also writes that Also called Probabilistic Graphical Model, used for statistical models expressed via graphs, causal or not. (Nb, "graph" as in graph theory, not as in figure or plot). They just use PGM's as a synonym of graphical models. Am I missing something? Thanks in advance.
