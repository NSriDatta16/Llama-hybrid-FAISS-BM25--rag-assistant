I would recommend using a web debugger like Fiddler to see what exactly your application is sending in the GET request and compare it to your browser. You might be missing an important header or something, and Fiddler makes it really easy to slowly strip down your browser's request to the essential elements (just drag a request to clone it, then take out headers).
