Matt, As a former VSS user who has moved to SVN, I can understand your frustration. However, I believe that you have already answered your own question. You've indicated that you are struggling with the shift from the "lock/edit/unlock" mindset to the "update/edit/commit" mindset and this is really the source of your frustration. I know, because I have been there myself. Fundamentally I think that the problem you are trying to solve is based on the "lock/edit/unlock" mindset... which (as has previously stated by other answers here) is the "restrictive security model", ie we want to protect you from doing something harmful so we will restrict your level of access. The "update/edit/commit" mindset basically takes the approach that 90% of the time the user (in this case the developer) is trustworthy and knows what they are doing and so we will allow you to do what you want and provide you the tools to deal with the small number of times when you get yourself into trouble. If I may be so bold as to restate the problem you are attempting to solve is: "Sometimes developers are in a rush to deploy a new change. They might forget to commit a change back to the repository that is critical for the new change to work. This will mean that the Build / Release process will fail due to this missing change. The Build / Release process needs to know if there are any files the Developer intended to change, but whose changes have not yet been saved back to the repository." The resolution to this problem would then be for the developer to commit the change they've overlooked and re-initiate the build process for a successful outcome. Can I ask, how many times has this actually happened for you? After doing it once, how many times would a developer do it a second (or subsequent time)? If they were a continual offender, how many times would you as a Team Leader / Manager allow it to happen before that Developer was "encouraged to seek external career opportunities"? So, basically, my answer is... train your developers to not forget and deal with the occasional instance where they forget. I assume that by asking the question if it is possible "to view a list of checked-out (or locked) files?" that you are intending to enforce exclusive locking of all files in the repository (otherwise there is no concept of a 'locked' file in SVN)? This then severely limits one of the big advantages of SVN (or any other "update/change/commit" model SCM) over VSS (or any other "lock/edit/unlock" model SCM). Cheers Richard
