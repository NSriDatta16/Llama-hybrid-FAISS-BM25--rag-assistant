If you are simply INSERTing the data each time, you could switch to REPLACE instead. This will then replace the existing data (if the data matches). Personally, I'd change your database setup code, though. One easy thing to use is the user_version pragma. This allows you to get or set a database "version" for your database. It defaults to 0, so you could check it at app start and if it is 0, initialize the DB and then set it to 1. Subsequent app starts would then skip the database initialization. PRAGMA user_version PRAGMA user_version = 1
