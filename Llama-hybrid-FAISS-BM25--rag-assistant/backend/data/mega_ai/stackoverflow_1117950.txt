XNA and DirectX 9 require a current logged in user in order to compile the Content folder. The solution is simple, set up a build agent machine (real physical machine) with the pre-reqs for XNA (VS2008, XNA Game Studio 3.0, etc) and make it log in on startup, then create a script to run the team server agent when logged in (by placing a shortcut to the agent run script in the start up folder in the start menu). This way the agent will run as the local user and can build as normal. I have done this and can confirm that it works.
