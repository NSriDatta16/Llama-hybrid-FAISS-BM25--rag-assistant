Is there a portable python interpreter that will run on Mac OS X 10.6 from a USB key?

I've been running myself ragged trying to find a portable interpreter that I can run from a USB key on my work computer. Work comp is running Mac OS X 10.6, fairly restricted environment, no access to terminal, can't install apps but I do know that portable apps can be run from a USB drive. I've been using shell in a box to serve remote access to my comp at home over the web but out of respect for their network integrity I'd prefer not to. I've also just come across ideone.com which seems promising and I plan to give it a go tomorrow. Ideally though, I'd like to have the code running locally. Any help would be greatly appreciated by myself and, I'm sure, a few others that might be in the same situation.
