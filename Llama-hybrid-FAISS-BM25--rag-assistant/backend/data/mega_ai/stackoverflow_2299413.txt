It seems like you're really tightly coupling the definition of GameController to the inheritance hierarchy of Game and GameType; similarly with Game to Player and PlayerType. I would encourage you to couple that relationship significantly more loosely; composition, as other posters are suggesting, is almost certainly the right way to go here, since you're describing as "has-a" relationship.
