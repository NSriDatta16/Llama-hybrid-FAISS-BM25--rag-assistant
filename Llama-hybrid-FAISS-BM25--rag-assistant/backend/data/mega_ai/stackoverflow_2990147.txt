While Hibernate may be overkill for what you're doing, you may still want to check it out. If you're going to end up doing much more than retrieval, it may be worth investing a bit of time into (it may save you a ton of work later). Depending on what you're doing with the records, you could leave them in your recordset, iterate over them and do whatever you want with them. If you need to do some work with them, then yes, put each one in an object and put those objects into a collection of some type (ArrayList will keep them sorted for you).
