Describing the spread of outcomes from simulations

In general, what is the term to describe the 5th and 95th percentiles of outcomes coming from a simulation study? Say we obtain a vector of outcomes y . In R we can obtain the 5th and 95th percentiles as: quantile(y, probs=c(0.025, 0.975)) Would this interval be called the 95% confidence interval, 95% credible interval, 95% percentile interval, 95% quantile? In my case I am using an agent-based model where the input parameter values for simulation are sampled from a posterior distribution, in case that makes a difference.
