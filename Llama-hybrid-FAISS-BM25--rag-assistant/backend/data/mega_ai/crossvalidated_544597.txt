That's an interesting approach and I think you can try it. If indeed VAE works as expected, the latent space has to be the multivariate normal distribution, after all the objects are generated by sampling random numbers from this distribution, i.e., after the training, the input to the decoder is random numbers sampled from a normal distribution. So one approach is to pass your object to the encoder, and check how far this output is from a normal distribution. You can use a t-test for that. see here for more details regarding the t-test for multivariate normal distribution. Another approach can be to use a similar approach to VAE-VQ. In this approach, the output of the encoder is clustered using a vector quantizer. After having the clusters you can check the distance from these clusters. See more details here .
