Generating ComponentGroups of ComponentRefs

So, I'm trying to use heat to generate fragments for the files in my project. Looking at files I generated in the past, and various WiX articles from around the net, I see that I have Fragments of Directory/Component's and then a Fragment defining a ComponentGroup using ComponentRef's. Isn't Heat supposed to generate this ComponentGroup fragment? Or did I do it manually and forgot I did so? The various Heat examples I find around the web seem to indicate that Heat does generate this fragment. I'm doing something like: heat dir . -gg -g1 -cg WhatThe -out test.wxs which produces Fragments of ComponentGroup/Component - nary a ComponentRef to be found: What am I missing? Besides medium-term memory? Thanks
