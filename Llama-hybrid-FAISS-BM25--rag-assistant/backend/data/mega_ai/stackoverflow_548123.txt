Sam, the update needs a table so you could try something like: TableType table = (TableType) stagingGrid.DataSource; myStagingTableAdapter.Update(table); where you'll have to substitute TableType with something appropriate. But a better approach would be to use drag-and-drop and learn form the code. Select Data|View Datasources. Your dataset should be visible in the DataSources Window. Drag a table to a (new) form. VS2005 will add a load of components and a few lines of code. The form will now have a instance of the dataset and that is your reference point for Adapter.Fill and .Update methods.
