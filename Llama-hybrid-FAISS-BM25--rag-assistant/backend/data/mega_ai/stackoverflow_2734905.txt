SQL Complex Select - Trouble forming query

I have three tables, Customers, Sales and Products. Sales links a CustomerID with a ProductID and has a SalesPrice. select Products.Category, AVG(SalePrice) from Sales inner join Products on Products.ProductID = Sales.ProductID group by Products.Category This lets me see the average price for all sales by category. However, I only want to include customers that have more than 3 sales records or more in the DB. I am not sure the best way, or any way, to go about this. Ideas?
