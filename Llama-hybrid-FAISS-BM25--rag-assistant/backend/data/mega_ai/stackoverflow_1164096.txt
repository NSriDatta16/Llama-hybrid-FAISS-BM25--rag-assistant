woah, you will not be able to get any usefull information out of such simple code in Java, least not that I know of. The code you have makes a lot of assumptions that, even in C actually, may or may not be true. It will depend on the platform and OS that is running your program. In Java you will be completely dependent on the JVM's implementation for addressing and as such will not be able to do this. My first answer would be to use a profiler. You can also create your own profiling agent using the API provided (JVMTI) for this purpose. It is a lot more complex certainly than your approach but you shouldbe able to get what you need. There is also this page at IBM that can be of help. This is pretty much all I have on the subject, I hope it will help you
