Both heteroscedasticity and heavy-tailedness can be considered violations of the distributional assumptions of a standard linear model. If the distribution is nonetheless symmetrical, and the relationship is between $x$ and $y$ is rectilinear, your model should not be biased. Instead, interval estimates and inferences would be incorrect. With enough data, they may be approximately right anyway. Unfortunately, it is difficult to know how much data would be 'enough', and the amount may be prohibitively large without your awareness one way or the other. Thus, you need methods that do not rely on the standard distributional assumptions. @AdamO's suggestions are viable. Two additional approaches jump to mind: You could bootstrap your model to get better confidence intervals and p-values. The advantage here is that your model is otherwise similar (particularly with respect to interpretability). The disadvantages are that you need enough data to adequately represent the population, and that this probably requires you to write original code (i.e., there may not be convenient routines already). The ultimate distribution-free regression method is to use ordinal logistic regression . Ordinal models do not make any assumptions about the conditional distribution, they only require that you can claim, say, that a $7$ is $>$ a $6$. That is not very restrictive. The upside is considerable robustness, and there will be convenient functions for this in your software of choice. The downside is that OLR models tend to be hard to interpret.
