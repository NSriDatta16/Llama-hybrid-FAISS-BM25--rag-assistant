This could be a problem of the structure of the chain. Where you end up depends on where you start. To use MCMC you want the chain to be recurrent which means that no matter where you start you can get to every other state in the state space. If the chain is not recurrent you can be trapped in a subset of the state space. The idea of MCMC is to have an existing stationary distribution that the chain will eventually wind up in. This stationary distribution usually has a positive probability for being in any of the states in the chain and not wind up trapped at a single point as you described. I can't check your algorithm but maybe you have a mistake in it. It is also possible that you have defined a problem where your Markov chain is not recurrent. If you want to get knowledgeable in MCMC I recommend that you take a look at the Handbook of Markov Chain Monte Carlo which has articles that describe every aspect of MCMC. It was published by CRC Press in 2011.
