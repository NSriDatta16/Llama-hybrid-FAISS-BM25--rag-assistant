Can I use output of classifier A as feature for classifier B?

This is likely to be a confused question, but I'm curious if this is a valid way to combine classifiers. I have a classification data set, i.e. column of labels and N columns of features, and I use a classifier (A) to generate a column of predicted labels. Can I turn around and use those labels as another feature for a second classifier (B)? That is, can I classify using classifier B with N+1 features, where the +1 feature is the output of classifier A? ( Question 1 ) A similar question was asked here about neural networks , but I think the answer was geared to unsupervised learning. I'm wondering if this is a valid way to combine classifiers for supervised learning, and why / why not. If it is valid, is there any advantage / disadvantage to this "sequential" combination compared to simply combining the predictions of classifiers A and B "after the fact"? That is, predict labels with A, predict labels with B, and average or otherwise combine the predictions. ( Question 2 )
