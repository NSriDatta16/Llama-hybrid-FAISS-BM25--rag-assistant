The lrm function in the R rms package is devoted to binary and ordinal logistic regression, and my help, once you understand the rms documentation. Detailed case studies using rms may be found in course notes at http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/rms . However there are more important issues. Categorizing continuous variables leads to erroneous conclusions, underfitting, and residual confounding (here, temperature and perhaps respiratory rate). One R coding convention suggestion: Set up your data frame the way you want to treat the variables in later modeling steps. For example if variables are really factors, give them descriptive levels and make them factors once and for all. The rms package almost requires this. If you do use rms you will find its summary, Predict, plot, contrast, and nomogram functions handy for interpreting the model, once the model properly uses continuous variables.
