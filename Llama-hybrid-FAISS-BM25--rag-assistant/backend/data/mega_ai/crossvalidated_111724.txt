Here is an example using logistic regression. You would need to adapt this for other models. For example, if the model needs the predictors to be on the same scale, then you would need to add another step in the fit and predict functions to normalize all the predictors. Also, you could make the number of components a tuning variable (see the other example that you mentioned on the package website). set.seed(1) dat = .5, modelFit$obsLevels[2], modelFit$obsLevels[1]) } set.seed(2) mod For this example: > mod Generalized Linear Model 200 samples 15 predictor 2 classes: 'Class1', 'Class2' No pre-processing Resampling: Cross-Validated (10 fold) Summary of sample sizes: 180, 180, 180, 180, 180, 180, ...
