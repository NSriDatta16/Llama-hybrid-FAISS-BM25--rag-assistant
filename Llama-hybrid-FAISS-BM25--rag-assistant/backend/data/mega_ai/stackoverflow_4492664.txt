skip nodes with specific values

Still having a hard time grasping some of the harder templates any help would be great. Right now I am using a simple for-each loop that sorts and shows the data in a table. I want to do the same thing but skip over all the nodes where attribute State is "Talking Out" . Below is my current style sheet and below that is my XML. I was thinking I could add a for-each inside of the current loop that ignores the nodes that meet my criteria. I am escaping single quotes since it is part of a larger php script. Agent Name State Time #cccccc here is my XML MCCALLISTER AARON Talking Out 9 APPELHANS BARRY Talking Out 1 ARREDONDO KARLA Talking Out 0 WOOTERS CHAD Talking In 5 LANDINI EUGENE Not Ready TRAINING 16 BROWN EYES JONETTE Not Ready TRAINING 13
