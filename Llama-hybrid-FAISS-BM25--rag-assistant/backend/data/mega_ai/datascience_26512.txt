Like Toros91 explained, it is a raw data format. You want to convert 5 PCS into There are 5 pieces . How does you know PCS means pieces ? You have a link somewhere in your brain that tells this. You have to do the same in programming. Create a dictionary which tells the machine that wherever it encounters PCS in line, PCS means pieces (it can be a model name also, you have to take care of that). The number just before PCS is the value. All this you have to code manually. There is no shortcut here. And of course you have to use NLP to achieve your task. Pre-Processing your raw data is the hard task, using ML algorithm on a formatted data is easy one.
