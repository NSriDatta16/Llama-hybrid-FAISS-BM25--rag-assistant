Different Resource Representations (REST API)

I'm developing a REST API and I have a question about resource representations. Suppose I have the "person" resource under the /app/person/{id} URI. I need an XML representation, that basically is all the object fields as XML nodes under the root. Now, requirements indicate that we must also support another kind of XML representation enforced by a proprietary schema. My question: is it in accordance with REST best practices to support a proprietary content type like text/my-type for the same resource? Note that both are XML but formatted differently, and most importantly they don't carry the same information (e.g. one representation may include other fields like modified-since ). Important! - I know that being pragmatic and keeping it simple is more important than guides and "best practices" but I just wanted to know if this is the way to go under a RESTful architecture.
