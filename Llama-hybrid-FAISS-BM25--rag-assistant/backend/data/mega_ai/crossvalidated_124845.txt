The following paragraph is excerpted from Section 13.2 in Time Series: Theory and Methods (2nd edition) by P. J. Brockwell and R. A. Davis: An ARMA process $\{X_t\}$ is often referred to as a short memory process since the covariance (or dependence) between $X_1$ and $X_{1+k}$ decreases rapidly as $k \to \infty$ . In fact we know from Chapter 3 that the autocorrelation function is geometrically bounded, i.e. $$\left|\rho(k)\right| \leq Cr^k \quad k = 1, 2, ... $$ where $C > 0$ and $0 . A long memory process is a stationary process for which $$\rho(k) \sim Ck^{2d-1} \text{ as } k \to \infty$$ where $C \neq 0$ and $d . Intuitively, the "short memory (or term, in your words)" and "long memory" time series correspond to the correlation between two observations with lag $k$ are "small" (with geometric decreasing order) and "large" (with power function order, but is still decreasing to zero slowly), respectively. Consequently, a short/long term forecasting is the forecasting for which the underlying time series model is short/long memory time series.
