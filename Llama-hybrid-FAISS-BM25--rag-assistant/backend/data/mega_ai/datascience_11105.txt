Data science after a physics degree?

I'm currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in physics from a university in the UK. Most data science jobs here have a strong preference for people with PhDs in numerate degrees like physics and maths. I don't understand the point of spending 5 years of my life doing research in something I don't want to pursue a career in. I'm confused about what master's degree I should choose if I want to apply for a job straight after graduating. A physics degree kind of leaves me hanging in the middle in terms of skills. I have done some analysis for experimental data using Python, but only very basic stuff. A bit of predictive modelling and C++, lots of maths, but barely any statistics. So I could either get a degree in CS to get better at programming or get one in statistics. Which one would give me the skills most relevant to data science? Also, would you recommend that I get a diploma/certification in machine learning?
