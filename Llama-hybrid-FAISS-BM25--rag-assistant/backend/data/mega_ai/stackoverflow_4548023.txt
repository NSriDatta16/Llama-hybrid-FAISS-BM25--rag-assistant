Yes, it's not only possible but in my opinion sometimes advisable. On a small system, you need to be very aware of the costs of how you choose to do things. At the same time, there can be some real advantages of "lightweight" object orientation for organizing your code, particularly if you need to make a flexible toolkit for quickly implementing customizations, or even to permit runtime hotplugging. A do-it-yourself lightweight object implementation (done for example with structs and function pointers) in C can be a good compromise. Perhaps the best known example of this is the linux kernel.
