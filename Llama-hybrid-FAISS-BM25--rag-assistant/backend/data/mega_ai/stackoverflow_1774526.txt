I'm not sure if i'm reading this correctly. You DON'T want Search to include parts of your site in the index, but you DO want it to go into that section and follow any links in it? I think the best way is to indeed exclude those section based on user agent (i.e. add them to a usercontrol and if the user agent is MS Search you don't render the section). Seeing as these sections would be the same on every page, it's okay to exclude them when the search crawler comes by. Just create ONE page (i.e. a sitemap :-D). that does include all the links a normal user would see in the footer / header / etc. The crawler could then use that page to follow links deeper into your site. This would be a performance boost as well, seeing as the crawler only encounters the links once instead of on every page.
