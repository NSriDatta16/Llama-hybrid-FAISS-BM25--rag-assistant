The purpose of data analysis isn't usually to try to find the strongest correlation possible, it's to answer a question about the world. In your case, these two possible tests correspond to two quite different questions: a) is there is an association between average annual temperature and total annual rainfall?, and b) is there is an association between average monthly temperature and total monthly rainfall? Which question are you trying to answer?
