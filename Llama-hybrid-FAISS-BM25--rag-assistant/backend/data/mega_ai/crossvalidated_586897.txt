You are mixing two different concepts: model selection and regularization. AIC and BIC are used for model selection . Model selection is not that different between frequentist and Bayesian settings, though they may use different tools and methods. You can easily search for Bayesian model selection to learn more. Another thing is regularization . In a frequentist setting, you could use regularization to penalize the number of parameters (e.g. ridge or lasso regression), the same is done in a Bayesian setup with choosing sparsity introducing priors that drag the parameters towards zero. You either need to choose the priors based on what you know about the problem or choose a hyperprior that would be used to learn the priors.
