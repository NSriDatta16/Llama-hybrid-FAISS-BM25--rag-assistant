Optimal construction of day feature in neural networks

Working on regression problem I started to think about representation of "day of a week" feature. I wonder which approach would perform better: one feature; value 1/7 for Monday; 2/7 for Tuesday... 7 features: (1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) for Monday; (0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) for Tuesday... It's hard to measure it due to network configuration differences. (Additional six features should be reflected in number of hidden nodes I believe.) Number of all features is about 20. I use simple backprop to learn ordinary feed-forward neural network.
