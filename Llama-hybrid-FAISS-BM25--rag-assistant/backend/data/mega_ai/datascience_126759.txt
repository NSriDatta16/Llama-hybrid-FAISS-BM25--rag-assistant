Why is dictionary-based approach a heuristic method?

In How can the accuracy of the dictionary-based approach be measured and improved? , one user says that: dictionary-based approach is a heuristic method Isn't that this approach is a type of rule-based approach, which on its turn is simply catching keywords using regex? Then shouldn't it be the most accurate approach, comparing to statistic-based approaches? Research on the internet give me mixed results: The article Heuristic vs. Rule-Based Approaches in NLP: Whatâ€™s the Difference? | by Ajay Verma | Artificial Intelligence in Plain English compares heuristic approach as opposite to rule-based approach. It says: heuristic approaches use general, flexible guidelines rather than rigid, predefined rules. These guidelines are often based on common-sense knowledge and intuition, making them adaptable to various scenarios. The article The power of Natural Language Processing - TPXimpact compares rule/heuristics-based category as opposite to data-driven category. It says: heuristics-based approaches use rules created and programmed into machines (e.g., using templates, grammars or regular expressions) So which one is correct?
