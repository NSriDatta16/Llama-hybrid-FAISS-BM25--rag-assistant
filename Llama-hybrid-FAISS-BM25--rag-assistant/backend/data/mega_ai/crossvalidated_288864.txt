Yes, this can be done. Usually, when you switch from classification to regression, you may "decapitate" the CNN by chopping off the top few layers including the softmax, and putting on new fully connected layers you need for regression. Therefore you would be using the pretrained weights for the rest of the layers, but you would need to start training the new layers you tacked on from scratch. The procedure for doing this in practice depends very much on which framework you are using. In keras, I believe you can just load the entire model with all the weights, and then just pop off the top few layers and add on your new layers. In tensorflow, you want to build your new regression first, then load only the weights from the old layers, making use of variable scopes to specify which weights should be restored. https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/variables#choosing_which_variables_to_save_and_restore
