We use the persistent store API because it is truly persistent, even across device reboots. In fact it's almost TOO persistent as your persisted data is not deleted from the device when the app is deleted (unless you persist custom objects, I think). The storage space is limited only to the available flash memory - there are no per-application quotas. EDIT: removed inaccurate comment about RMS
