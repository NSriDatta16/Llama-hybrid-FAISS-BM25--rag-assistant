If you order by ascending, -1 should already be at the top of the list, because it is the smallest value. However, more generally, if you still wanted to apply different sorting to subsets of the data, I don't think there would be a more elegant way, because that's exactly what you are doing and the union is logically accurate. You're trying to pull two seperate subset of the data out, sort them differently, and then merge them together, which is one of the things what I union is to be used for.
