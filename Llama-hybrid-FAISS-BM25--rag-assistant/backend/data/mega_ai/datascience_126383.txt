If you use transformers example scripts, for example, summarization , you can control padding and truncation with command line arguments --pad_to_max_length , --max_source_length , --max_target_length (which are just passed as Trainer or tokenizer parameters). Of course, if you set --max_source_length unreasonably high, you will soon run out of your GPU memory. To use your own dataset, specify --train_file and --validation_file as described in their README. If you want to use this in your own Python code, you can see how it is implemented in run_summarization.py . For other types of tasks explore the content of other examples in this repository.
