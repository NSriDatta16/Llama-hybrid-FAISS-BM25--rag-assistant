Clustering with groups in data related to cluster label

I want to predict which device got used in which room. Therefore I've got device and sensor data. My idea was to create a feature vector lie this: ---------------------------------------------------------- Data-Vector: | u_1 u_2 u_3 | x_1 ... x_7 | y_1 ... y_12 | z_1 ... z_4 | ---------------------------------------------------------- Categories: | device_data | room 1 data | room 2 data | room 3 data | ---------------------------------------------------------- My device data contains amongst other things: + timestamps when the device got turned on/off + average power consumption and divergences My room data contains for example: + sensor data of motion detector and timestamps + sensor data of lamps (turned on/off) and timestamps + weather data In the feature vector I've got the room data closest to the turn on/off timestamp. All data points itself are floats. My idea was to use k-means for clustering. My problems are: 1. When using k-means, how can I tell which cluster correlates to which room label (room1, room2 or room3)? 2. I think it could be beneficial if I add somehow the information: which sensor is which room. Can I manipulate the data in k-means algorithm so it will only consider: the device data and room 1 data for the first cluster and sets everything else to zero the device data and room 2 data for the second cluster and so on... This way I could tell that cluster x correlates to room x. Or will this somehow break the k-means algorithm?
