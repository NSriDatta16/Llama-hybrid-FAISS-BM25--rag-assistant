Organising domain in WebLogic

I’m working with a client that has its WebLogic (version is 11g) domains organised in terms of usegage – so one for production, one for test, one for dev, and all applications have to share a single domain. It has a lot of applications/domain (around 20 in all). I’ve not seen this done before and was wondering how common it is. I can see some disadvantages (like you can’t configure domain level settings in a manner appropriate an app), but can’t think of many (any) advantages. So two questions: 1. How common is this? 2. What are the pros and cons of it as an approach?
