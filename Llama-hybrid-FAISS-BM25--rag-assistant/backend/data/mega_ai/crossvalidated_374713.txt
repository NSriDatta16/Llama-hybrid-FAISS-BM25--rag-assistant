Fit a mixed effect logistic regression. Data format: Eco plot day Y 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 ..... 5 15 6 0 Totally, there are 15*6 = 90 lines of data. The model $$\log\left(\frac {\Pr(Y=1)}{\Pr(Y=0)}\right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 E_1 + \beta_2E_2 +\beta_3E_3 + \beta_4E_4 +\beta_5T + \gamma_s $$ where $E_i=I(\text{Eco} =i)$ , T = time (1,2,...6), and $\gamma_s \sim N(0.\sigma^2)$ is the slot specific random intercept. Maybe you need exclude the data from ECO = 1 and March? 15 (first day), because all of the $Y$ s are y. Of cause, you can modify the fixed effect part, for example, you can treat day as categorical, instead of continuous, you can add the interaction between day and Eco.
