If you're trying to read those deep linking URLs on the server side (which I assume you are), know that it's not possible. Those deep linking systems use the fragment part of URLs (the part that comes after the hash ( # ) symbol) for designating specific parts of the flash apps in the browser URL and fragments are not sent to the web server by browsers when making requests -- they're simply meant for browsers to be able to move to a certain part of the page by themselves. So in order to access full deep linking URLs, you'll have to write a client-side solution (e.g. with Javascript or AS3).
