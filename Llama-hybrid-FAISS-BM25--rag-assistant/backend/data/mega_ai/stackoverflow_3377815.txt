How do I best use a library whose directory may change occasionally?

I am writing Perl scripts and when I have too many functions, I usually move them all into a library (also good for code reuse). So I usually create a package (e.g. my_lib.pm ) and add use lib 'path/to/lib'; use my_lib; to my script. I wonder if it's possible to skip the use lib 'path/to/lib'; , which sometimes gives me trouble since I reorganize my directory hierarchy, and make Perl look for packages in the same dir where the script is running from. Thank you.
