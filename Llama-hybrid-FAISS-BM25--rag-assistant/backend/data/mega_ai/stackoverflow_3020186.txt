.net configurable business error messages

I need to implement some kind of solution such that in our business logic layer when certain conditions are met an error message is returned. That error message should be configurable either in a file or table that can be edited at run time if needed. I've seen it done before a few ways and it always ends up something like "This error message is {0}" and then when the dev goes the use the message they dont neccesarily know how many (if any) parameters the message needs. Just hoping to leverage off something that may have already been done, I dont think there is a provider or anything already in the .net framework.
