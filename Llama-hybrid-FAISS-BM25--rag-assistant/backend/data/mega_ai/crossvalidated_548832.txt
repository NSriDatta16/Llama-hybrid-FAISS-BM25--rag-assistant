Judgment in testing anticipation effect in Diff-in-Diff?

Regarding Difference-in-Difference , there is one important assumption of concern is "no anticipation effect" . I read the paper of Borusyak, 2021 and I saw that he identified it in the Assumption 2 (page 8). After running the test, I have the result is as below ( in this case I shift the actual event year to 3 years before. tau0 represents the average estimate for relative year = -3, tau1 relative toyear = -2, ..., tau3 for relative year = 0 I do not know how to explain this result properly about whether the anticipation effect exists? Should we use the joint null test for tau0, tau1, and tau2?
