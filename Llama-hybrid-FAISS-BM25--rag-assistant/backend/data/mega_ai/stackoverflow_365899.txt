In Biostatics (at the U of Minnesota), we did a lot of simulation, in areas like Bayesian statistics, genetics, and others. Any strongly analytical program is a good candidate for teaching the skills you want, including: econ, econometrics, agronomics, statistical genetics... etc., etc., :) While you're waiting, pick up R, Matlab (Octave is the free implementation), or your Turing-Complete language of choice, dig into Wikipedia, and get to work :)
