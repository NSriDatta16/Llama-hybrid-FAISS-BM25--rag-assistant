Same coefficient in multivariate regression with dummy variables

Hello Data Science community, I have a model with 1 quantitative variable (y) and 2 categorical variables. In order to work with the categorical variables I have created dummy variables (binary) for the first one this is binary by nature so I still have one variable No = 0, Yes = 1, but for the second categorical value I have 48 different inputs (locations), so I've created 47 new dummy variables in which 1 = if it is that location (ref. prnt.sc/payj7q ) But the problem I'm getting know is that my output for the coefficients, looks the same for all of the x's, like this... ( prnt.sc/payio0 ) I'm doing something wrong here or where should I look to improve the model? Again, thank you so much for your support. Here's the code I'm using... import pandas as pd import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import seaborn as seabornInstance from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression from sklearn import metrics %matplotlib inline # Main files dataset = pd.read_csv('namaste_econ_model.csv') dataset.shape dataset.describe() dataset.isnull().any() #Dividing data into "attributes" and "labels". X variable contains all the attributes and y variable contains labels. X = dataset[['Read?', 'x1', 'x2', 'x3', 'x4', 'x5', 'x6' , 'x7','x8','x9','x10','x11','x12','x13','x14','x15','x16','x17','x18','x19','x20','x21','x22','x23','x24','x25','x26','x27','x28','x29','x30','x31','x32','x33','x34','x35','x36','x37','x38','x39','x40','x41','x42','x43','x44','x45','x46','x47']].values y = dataset['Change in Profit (BP)'].values #Place columns back on df X_df = pd.DataFrame(X, columns = dataset[['Read?', 'x1', 'x2', 'x3', 'x4', 'x5', 'x6' , 'x7','x8','x9','x10','x11','x12','x13','x14','x15','x16','x17','x18','x19','x20','x21','x22','x23','x24','x25','x26','x27','x28','x29','x30','x31','x32','x33','x34','x35','x36','x37','x38','x39','x40','x41','x42','x43','x44','x45','x46','x47']].columns) #Plot 'Change in Profit (BP)' plt.figure(figsize=(15,10)) plt.tight_layout() seabornInstance.distplot(dataset['Change in Profit (BP)']) X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_df, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0) regressor = LinearRegression() #Train the algorithm regressor.fit(X_train, y_train) coeff_df = pd.DataFrame(regressor.coef_, X_df.columns, columns=['Coefficient']) coeff_df print(regressor.coef_) Thank you in advance for the support!
