Should the mean of NN's predicted values match the mean of the original values?

I built a neural network model in R using the Keras' package and for some reason, the mean of the predicted values of the neural network doesn't match the mean of the original values. For every other model I've built, this is never the case. Am I doing something wrong, or is this a possibility?
