UniVerse learning materials

I've recently come in contact with a proprietary descendant of UniVerse. Does anyone know where I can get a good tutorial or brush up on the syntactic quirks of its more popular parent? I can't figure out how to even get a table listing. Navigating my way around is difficult, and I don't see any man pages. UPDATED with the official Rocket Software links: Special attention needs to be given to SQL Reference , SQL Administration for DBAs , and User Reference . There is also a link at the bottom of both of these pages to a zip with all of the docs. There is also a demo on Rocket Software (personal information required) for Universe 10.3, but it only works with RHEL. And, even though it is statically linked it segfaults for me using Ubuntu 8.10. These links are official from Rocket Software (current owner of Uni* line of products) UniVerse 10.3 Demo latest Guide to installing it on Ubuntu 9.10 UniVerse 10.3 Documentation latest Supporting whitepapers and theory Manual index page Servers & Tools Here is one that predates Rocket Software's aquisition of the product line: Old IBM ftp repository of U2 stuff IBM ZIP of 10.1 Documentation
