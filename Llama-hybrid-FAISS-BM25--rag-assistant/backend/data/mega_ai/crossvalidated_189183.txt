Confidence Levels for Mean of measured distribution

I have measured some values. These values are already aggregates (in principle average values). The values have a "non-nice" distribution, for example . They come from different sources with different setups, however they all measure the same quantity. I now want to calculate different things. mean of the distribution - easy, done. statistical error of the overall mean . Is it just $\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$ with $\sigma = \sqrt{Var(\text{value})}$? If so, why? I have a physics background and there we argued that natural quantities are always Gaussian-distributed. Now this here is a technical measurement. I do not see how I could apply the Gaussian errors or the central limit theorem here as we don't sum independent random variables. CLs for the mean . How would I calculate CLs that would say something like "with 95% confidence, the mean of the distribution lies within $[x-\sigma_-,x+\sigma_+]$". As you can see, I would like to have asymmetric CLs because our measurements can have upper and lower technical limits (for example, speed measurements will always be > 0) and I don't want the CLs to span the impossible value range. And as I had some discussion with my colleagues about it (probably a new question, but still...): how can subsampling affect the calculated quantities (errors and CLs) and when should I do it? (short explanation is enough) Thank you so much. xo.
