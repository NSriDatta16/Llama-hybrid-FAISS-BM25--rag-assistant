dependending on your sample size, the analysis can be (1) exact logistic regression or (2) two-way contingency tables with Fisher's exact test OR try a bayesian approach. For contingency tables, one method is to estimate the expected frequencies as distributions and the other is to estimate parameters values for the terms in hierarchical log-linear models.
