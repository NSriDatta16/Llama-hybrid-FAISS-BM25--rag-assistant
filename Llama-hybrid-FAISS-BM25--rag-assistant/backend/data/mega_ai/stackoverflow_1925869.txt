OK, I'm guessing it's because you're using a tag as the target of a link. Properly, named tags that are the target of links to a location in a page are also tags, your syntax is similar to About Leonie and Stef Palmer Here's the source: source This creates an anchor around the text "This is the location of anchor one.". Usually, the contents of A are not rendered in any special way when A defines an anchor only. Having defined the anchor, we may link to it from the same or another document. URIs that designate anchors contain a "#" character followed by the anchor name (the fragment identifier). Here are some examples of such URIs: An absolute URI: http://www.mycompany.com/one.html#anchor-one A relative URI: ./one.html#anchor-one or one.html#anchor-one When the link is defined in the same document: #anchor-one Just to be safe, you might want to make the link in your navbar to the full document: About Not only is this one of the use cases described above, it saves Apache some work. Including the full path lets the browser go straight to the page, whereas not including the name of the document means the browser has to ask Apache on your server what the name of the page is and then go there - 2 connections for the price of 1
