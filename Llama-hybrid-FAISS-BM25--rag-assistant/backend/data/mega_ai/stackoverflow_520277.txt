So I actually got this working by compiling all projects to target platform x86. So x64 does not work with VirtualStore on Vista 64 and neither does compiling to "Any CPU". And I had to set it for the entire solution (in the Configuration Manager), just setting it for each individual project didn't work. Time to rewrite it using AppData folder or IsolatedStorage. Thanks for all the help!
