I have no real experience with Java web start other than looking at it a few years back. How about start your application with a parameter that you define than you set when the app is started via Java web start. If you want to pass in arguments to your app, you have to add them to the start-up file (aka JNLP descriptor) using or elements. Then check to see if these properties are set. Again this is a suggestion I have not coded for JWS and it may not be this easy.
