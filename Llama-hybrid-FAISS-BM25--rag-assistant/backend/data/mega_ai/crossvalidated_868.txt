Training a Logistic Regression Model

I created a quick fun Excel Spreadsheet tonight to try and predict which video games I'll enjoy if I buy them. I'm wondering if this quick example makes sense from a Logistic Regression perspective and if I am computing all of the values correctly. Unfortunately, if I did everything correctly I doubt I have much to look forward to on my XBOX or PS3 ;) I laid out a few categories and weighted them like so (Real spreadsheet lists twice as many or so): 4 4 3 1 Visually Stunning Exhilirating Artistic Sporty Then I went through some games I have and rated them in each category (ratings of 0-4). I then set a separate cell to be the value of Beta_0 and tuned that until the resulting percentages all looked about right. Next I entered in my expected ratings for the new games I was looking forward to and got percentages for those. Example: Beta_0 := -35 4 4 3 1 Visually Stunning Exhilirating Artistic Sporty 4 4 0 1 Would be calculated as P = 1 / [1 + e^(-35 + (4*4 + 4*4 + 3*0 + 1*1)] P = 88.1% If I were to automate the regression am I correct in thinking I'd be tuning Beta_0 to make it so the positive training examples come out high and the negative training examples come out low? I'm completely new to this (just started today thanks to this site actually!) so please have no concern about bruising my ego, I'm eager to learn more. Thanks!
