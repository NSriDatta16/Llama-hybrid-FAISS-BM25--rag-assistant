Depending on the rest of the page, doing that "extra work" in an $.ajaxStop handler might be a more elegant option. However, it wouldn't be appropriate if the user is able and/or likely to trigger subsequent $.ajax() calls while those initial calls are in progress. In that case, their manually triggered calls may prolong the $.ajaxStop event further than intended.
