You might consider the way it was done in the .NET framework. It invariably declares a static class (Module in VB.NET) named NativeMethods that contains the P/Invoke declarations. You could be more organized than the Microsoft programmers, there are many duplicate declarations. Different teams working on different parts of the framework. However, if you want to share this among all projects you have to declare these declarations Public instead of Friend. Which isn't great, it ought to be an implementation detail. I think you can solve that by re-using the source code file in every project that needs it. Normally taboo but okay in this case, I think. I personally declare them as needed in the source code file that needs them, making them Private. That also really helps when lying about the argument types, especially for SendMessage.
