For your specific case one(1) repository is perfect. You will save a lot of money. I always encourage people to use a single repository. Because it is similar to a single filesystem: It is easier You will have a single place where you look for code You will have a single authorisation You will have a single commit number(ever tried to build a project which is spread over 3 repos?) You can better reuse common libraries and track your progress in these libs(svn:externals are PITA and will not solve all problems) Projects planned as fully different items, can grow together and share functions and interfaces. This will be very difficult to achieve in multiple repos. There is a single point for multiple repositories: administration of huge repos is uncomfortable. Dumping/loading huge repos takes a lot of time. But as you do not do any administration, I think it will not be your concern ;) SVN scales very well with bigger repositories, there is no slowdown even on huge (>100GB) repositories. So you will have less hassle with a single repository. But you really should think about the repo layout!
