You need to search for 'Bayesian adaptive designs'. The basic idea is as follows: You initialize the prior for the parameters of interest. Before any data collection your priors would be diffuse. As additional data comes in you re-set the prior to be the posterior that corresponds to the 'prior + data till that point in time'. Collect data. Compute the posterior based on data + priors. The posterior is then used as the prior in step 1 if you actually collect additional data. Assess whether your stopping criteria are met Stopping criteria could include something like the 95% credible interval should not be bigger than $\pm \epsilon$ units for the parameters of interest. You could also have more formal loss functions associated with the parameters of interest and compute expected loss with respect to the posterior distribution for the parameter of interest. You then repeat steps 1, 2 and 3 till your stopping criteria from step 4 are met.
