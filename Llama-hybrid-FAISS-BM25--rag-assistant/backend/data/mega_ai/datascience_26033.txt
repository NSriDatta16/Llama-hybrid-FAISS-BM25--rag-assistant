What is the tag mapping for entity recognition in nltk?

When doing entity recognition using NLTK, one gets as a result a Tree with a bunch of words mapped to tags (eg. Mark -> NNP , first -> JJ , ...). It's not at all clear what all the tags stand for at first glance and I was unable to find any documentation about these tags in the NLTK docs. >>> from nltk import word_tokenize, pos_tag, ne_chunk >>> sentence = "Mark and John are the first to work at Google from one years old in 39 years." >>> print ne_chunk(pos_tag(word_tokenize(sentence))) (S (PERSON Mark/NNP) and/CC (PERSON John/NNP) are/VBP the/DT first/JJ to/TO work/VB at/IN (ORGANIZATION Google/NNP) from/IN one/CD years/NNS old/JJ in/IN 39/CD years/NNS ./.) I ended up looking into the source code to get the mapping. Posting in case anyone else runs into the same problem.
