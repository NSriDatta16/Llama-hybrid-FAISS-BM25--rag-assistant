From here : Definition and Usage The tag provides no visual change by itself. The tag provides a way to add a hook to a part of a text or a part of a document. When the text is hooked in a span element you can add styles to the content, or manipulate the content with for example JavaScript. So, the short version is, it's to style some text (without a paragraph or linebreak which is different from tag)
