The optimal policy refers to the actual value, not the estimated value -- in fact, some reinforcement learning agents might not even attempt to estimate the value of a given state. do we still call the estimated optimal policy the optimal policy? If not, what do we call this policy? Is it the greedy policy? Yes, greedy policy is the commonly used term for picking the action which maximizes the estimated value.
