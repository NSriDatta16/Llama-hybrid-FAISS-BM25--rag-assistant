Implementation of Bayes Weighted average formula for my new website

Im planning to implement Bayes weighted average formula (which imdb uses) for my new reviews and ratings website for mobile phones. The formula is under S=wR+(1âˆ’w)C where S= score of the product R= average of user ratings for the product. C= average of user ratings for all products. W= weight assigned to R and computed as v/(v+m), where v is the number of user ratings for that product, and m is average number of ratings for all products. Im contemplating to divide the mobile phones into price segments and calculate the bayesian scores for phones in those segment unlike the way IMDb does. Q Going about segment wise, am I correct in doing it ? Or should I take the whole mobile phones segment of all the products to arrive at the bayesian estimate since two of the aspects of bayesian estimate are average ratings for all phones and the prior m calculated as = average number of ratings for all phones. I need to define what the term 'all phones mean'.
