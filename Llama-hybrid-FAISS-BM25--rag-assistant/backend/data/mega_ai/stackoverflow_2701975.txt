Well, you could use JSON or BERT . JSON is easily reable by humans, as it is ASCII only. To send binary data, you need to encode them (e.g. with base64). Another solution would be using BERT. BERT is based on the "erlang external binary format" for serialization, so the erlang side is pretty simple ;) python: http://github.com/samuel/python-bert Erlang: http://github.com/mojombo/bert.erl
