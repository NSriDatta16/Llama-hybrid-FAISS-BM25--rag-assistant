which application domains are not well suited to deep learning?

Deep learning seems to be the new cool thing in AI/machine learning and it works well in many domains, but I want to know- what are the specific application areas where deep learning is not the best approach and what is the reason for that? Has some evaluation been made? Is there a particular class of problems? If so- what solutions are superior in solving that task?
