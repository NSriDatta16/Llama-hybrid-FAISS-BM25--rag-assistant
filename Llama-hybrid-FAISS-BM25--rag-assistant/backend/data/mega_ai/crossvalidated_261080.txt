I would use difference in differences (DID or DD for short) : Difference in differences is a statistical technique used in econometrics and quantitative research in the social sciences that attempts to mimic an experimental research design using observational study data, by studying the differential effect of a treatment on a 'treatment group' versus a 'control group' in a natural experiment. It calculates the effect of a treatment (i.e., an explanatory variable or an independent variable) on an outcome (i.e., a response variable or dependent variable) by comparing the average change over time in the outcome variable for the treatment group, compared to the average change over time for the control group. Source: wikipedia In your example: The independent variable are taxes The dependent variable is consumption The treatment and control groups may be similar countries or geographies, such as UK and Australia
