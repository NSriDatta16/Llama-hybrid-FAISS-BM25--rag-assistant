how to visualize samples from posterior probability density function?

I am doing Bayesian parameter estimation/regression and I have formulated the posterior p.d.f. and is able to sample from it. Except of credibility intervals around MAP (as a gray zone around solid line), I don't know what other appropriate plots I can show and what it may mean. Can I get help please. I am using MATLAB.
