Well this looks extremely like neuronal spiking... What I can recommend is to construct a kernel that sketches the shape of each 'shock'. Then you can transform your data into an array of discrete 'shock' events. Equivalently, your original signal is the convolution of event markers and kernel. $Sig(t)=(Shock*kernel)(t)=\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}Shock(\tau)kernel(t-\tau)d\tau$ since you said you can already identify the initial dates, getting kernel is essentially just taking the average of the signal pieces aligned to each initial date. hope it answers your question.
