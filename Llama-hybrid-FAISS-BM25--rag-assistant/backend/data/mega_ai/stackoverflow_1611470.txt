Embedding SVG in XUL

I want to Embed SVG into XUL. I tried to use the this tutorial which requires pasting of the SVG code in XUL application and it works but this is not clean. I want to keep SVG and XUL files separate, further I will like to use a separate CSS file for SVG part, any examples how we can do this?
