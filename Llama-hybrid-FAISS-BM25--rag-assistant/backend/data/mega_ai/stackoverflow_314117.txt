What tools does your team use for writing user manuals?

Basic requests are: human readable / text format (for easy version control) online (for collaboration) easy formatting (markdown ok, html is too much) strict formatting (so authors don't invent new types of titles, bullets etc.) exportable to PDF, HTML easy backup and deployment (so we can "deploy" to customers site as read only version) We are thinking about using some kind of wiki engine, but it would need to use files for storage or have other means of "deployment" to customer and be easy to install/maintan. Also, it would have to be free / cheap (confluence is way too expensive) Any suggestions? Edit: I'm not looking for tools to document code, we have that covered using Sandcastle.
