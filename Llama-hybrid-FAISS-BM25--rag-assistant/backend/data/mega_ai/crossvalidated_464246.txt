Can granger testing help to predict? what is the difference between the task of prediction and the task of determine casuality

Hi I have two time series $A_t$ and $B_t$ , and I want to use the past values of $A_t$ where $t=1,...,T$ to predict $B_t$ where $t=T+1$ . To do this, at first I looked for spearman correlation, if the value of $A_t$ goes down then I infer that $B_t$ will goes down as well. But I found that the causality can not be inferred from correlation. Thus I stepped into casual inference. But what I found in the posts (which I include them in the down below) here is that we can not infer causality from data using any statistical technique and we have to do an experience to test this. I am very confused of this. If so, then what Granger testing for? Here are some related materials: https://www.researchgate.net/post/Any_recommended_techniques_for_testing_causal_relations https://www.researchgate.net/post/How_to_test_for_causation Granger Causality vs. Forecasting
