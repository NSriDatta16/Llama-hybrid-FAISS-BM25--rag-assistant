What is the statistical power of a test when the true population mean is unspecified?

I have been given the following homework problem: To improve the reading scores of its students, a school district randomly selects 50 students to participate in a new program. The mean reading score for all students was 49. The students using the new program had an average score of 52.6 and a standard deviation of 5.1. If Î± = 0.05, what is the power to detect that scores really do increase to 52.6 using the new program? I can only see how statistical power can be computed if the problem also provides me with some "true" mean score $\mu_t$ for students in the new program. Is it easy to see what the flaw in my thinking could be?
