jQuery Snap to Grid Question

I've read somewhere that you can snap the object after it has been moved, but how can I incorporate that code into my own? I found this code: stop: function(event, ui) { t = parseInt($(this).css(top); l = parseInt($(this).css(left); $(this).css(top , t - t % 30); $(this).css(left, l - l % 30); } But where would I put that in this:? $('.box').draggable({grid: [10,10]}).resizable({grid: 50}); Thanks!
