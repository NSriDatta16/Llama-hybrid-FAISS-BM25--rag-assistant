There is no SQL client for silverlight. Also the user can delete your data from Isolated storage - right-click the running silverlight app and go to the "Application storage" tab. So just use it for user settings and for cached data that the app can work without, even if it is slower. If you need to cache data locally, your best bet is to store it as XML in the isolated storage, reading and writing it using LINQ to XML. If there's too much data for this, or the data is too complex to make this easy, then keep the data on your server and the silverlight client should then just access it over the net.
