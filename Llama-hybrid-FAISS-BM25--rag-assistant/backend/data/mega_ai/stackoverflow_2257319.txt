How does PDF417 barcode decoding recover from damaged labels?

I recently learned about PDF417 barcodes and I was astonished that I can still read the barcode after I ripped it in half and scanned only a fragment of the original label. How can the barcode decoding be that robust? Which (types of) algorithms are used during encoding and decoding? EDIT: I understand the general philosophy of introducing redundancy to create robustness, but I'm interested in more details, i.e. how this is done with PDF417.
