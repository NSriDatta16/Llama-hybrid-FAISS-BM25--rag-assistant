HOLY COW. I figure it out. Okay, before I say what I found, I did want to correct my own original wording: the modal ad has never worked in the simulator, but always on devices. I know the simulator can have its quirks, so I never thought anything of it, especially since it always worked on the devices. I know this is an important detail that was missing for this discussion, but it's been a couple of weeks since I worked on this project, and I'd forgotten all about it until today. Now then... While tinkering with things, I noticed the AdView.xib was not in my project file list. I expanded a few folders thinking maybe it was accidentally dragged into one of them, but it was not listed at all. This really has me puzzled, though -- Xcode NEVER complained about a missing resource (no warnings or errors; always a perfect compile). So, I navigated to the physical location and added the AdView.xib into the project. Now, the modal ad is displayed in the simulator, which is a first. I figure that since now the app works correctly in the simulator, it should work fine in the distribution build (odd correlation to make, but it's all I got until my update hits the App Store). Obviously, I'll be submitting an update, so I won't accept my own answer until after the update hits the App Store (assuming I have actually fixed it).
