I tracked it down. I had a redirect on /users to redirect back to /users/login if the user was not logged in. I wasn't saving the result of Zend_Auth in storage, thus giving me the impression login was doing nothing. POST http://localhost/users/login (302 Found) GET http://localhost/users GET http://localhost/users/login
