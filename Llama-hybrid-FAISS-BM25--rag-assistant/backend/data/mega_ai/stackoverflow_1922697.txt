Not able to understand how to use different density images for 1.6+?

I'm trying to understand how the res/drawables images should work with different screen densities. Right now I've got a 1.5 app, and for example, I have an image that is 100x100 pixels. When used on the Droid, it scales this image so it appears to be the same size relatively on that device (all other layout scaling is handled by me, using dip units). So now I need to update my project and add three folders, right?: drawable-ldpi drawable-mdpi drawable-hdpi so I'm going to put my 100x100 image in the -mdpi folder. If I want to make a version for the -hdpi folder - how do I know how much larger to scale it by? I mean it looks like by default it should be 1.5x bigger. But what happens if I make it 2.0x bigger, or the device I'm running on doesn't happen to have a density 1.5x that of the baseline G1? Won't my layouts start looking different on those devices? Thanks
