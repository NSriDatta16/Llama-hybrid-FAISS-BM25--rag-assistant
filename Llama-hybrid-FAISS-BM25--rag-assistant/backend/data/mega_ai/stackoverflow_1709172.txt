Adding text / input box rendering to Access for a guided user interface experience

For software used in a call centre guiding agents through a set script they must follow while on telephone calls, with the script branching dependant on answers to questions given - My system uses a MS Access / VBA front end (isnt web based due to speed, phone integration), 'call scripting' is coded in VBA when needed, but what if i want move to a more complete solution? Is hosting a HTML/ms webbrowser control the obvious platform to build call scripting on? A manager view will also be needed allowing managers to create scripts, divide it into parts, specify routing rules that determines the path through the script, link input boxes (ie question answers) back to database fields, specify validation rules as well. Thinking about the complexities of building the manager view that translates the intended script into HTML/Javascript, is creating my own simple doc description language with tags for just the features i need and a 'rendering engine' in VBA a solution you might consider for this? Ive thought about creating scripts out of standard Access controls, using relational table structure to hold the info of what controls relate to what parts of scripts, validation, routing options etc but i think due to Access' lack of runtime control creation this will be more painful than a rendering engine that takes a script written in my own doc desc language and displaying it. What suggestions have you for the implementation of this?
