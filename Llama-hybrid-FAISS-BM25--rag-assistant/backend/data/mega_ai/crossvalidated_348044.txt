Extremely large confidence intervals- what to do?

I ran a logistic regression for my dissertation and one of my variables came out with extremely large confidence intervals (e.g., CI95 .41 to 560.45) while all my other independent variables had very normal CIs. The variable I have large CIs with was log transformed. I transformed some of my other IVs and had no problem. My variable with large CIs was non-significant. How should I proceed?
