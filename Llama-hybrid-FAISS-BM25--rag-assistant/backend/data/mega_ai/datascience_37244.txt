I am currently training a neural network and I cannot decide which to use to implement my Early Stopping criteria: validation loss or a metrics like accuracy/f1score/auc/whatever calculated on the validation set. If you are training a deep network, I highly recommend you not to use early stop. In deep learning, it is not very customary. Instead, you can employ other techniques like drop out for generalizing well. If you insist on that, choosing criterion depends on your task. If you have unbalanced data, you have to employ F1 score and evaluate it on your cross-validation data. If you have balanced data, try to use accuracy on your cross-validation data. Other techniques highly depend on your task. I highly encourage you to find a model which fits your data very well and employ drop out after that. This is the most customary thing people use for deep models.
