The single best current resource is Hadley Wickham and Garret Grolemund's book R for Data Science . It's incomplete. If you know everything in it, you will be in excellent shape. It can be difficult to learn R, partly because there are many ways of doing the same thing. And some of those ways are better than others, but when learning you cannot judge the quality of an approach. If you have any knowledge of programming then (as mentioned) Hadley Wickham's Advanced-R book is incredible. You do not really understand R unless you are familiar with the topics that the books covers. Many of the "gotchas" and "tripwires" in R become clear and logical after reading Advanced-R.
