Manipulate the shape of each character in a string using Java graphics

I've figured out how to get the shape of a text string before drawing it on this screen in Java, for example by using the TextLayout class [1]. However I could only find a way to get the Shape of the whole text. I need a Shape for each character in the text. Does anybody know an elegant way of how to obtain the Shape per character?
