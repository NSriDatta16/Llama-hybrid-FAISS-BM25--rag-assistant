Android: how can I prevent a drag from being interpreted as a long press

When I inserted code to display a context menu it worked fine except that the menu appeared not only after a stationary long press but also (unwanted) at the end of a drag. I have been able to prevent this by: adding a ScrollInProgress flag to the View, by checking this flag at the beginning of the onCreateContextMenu(...) method, and if the flag is set by by-passing the code which adds items to the context menu. However, I wonder if there is a simpler way of preventing the creation of a context menu when the screen is dragged.
