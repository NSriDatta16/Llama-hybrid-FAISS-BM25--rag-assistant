One promising avenue to consider is to make better proposals that are more likely to be accepted in such a way that you still get a valid Markov Chain. One of the proposals for this is Hamiltonian ABC, but see this critical discussion . Another approach could be to make the simulation differentiable. That is obviously not directly possible, but if you can create a neural network that approximates your simulations well, then you would have a differentiable system. This might have to be a somewhat bespoke solution for each individual case, because you are presumably somewhat limited in how many simulations you can perform and would (probably?) have to not just simulate once for each parameter value, but repeatedly to capture the extent of variability for the same inputs. Thus, you'd want to reflect as many constraints of the real system, as possible. Related to that idea, I saw this paper .
