Scroll to fragment identifier on new page at load w/ JQuery?

I'm trying to see if its possible to have some simple HTML markup like so: ...and then, have it scroll down to the ID #location1 when the new page loads with a simple JQuery script of some sort? Or if this is something that could be achieved with the scrollTo plugin, how might I go about that instead? The catch is that the link exists on pageXXX, and the ID to be scrolled to is on ALL pages, ie. pageXXX, page1, page2, page3, etc......Ideally, if there's also a way to remove the hash mark and the identifier from the URL that would be great too, but at the moment just having it smoothly scroll down to the ID on the new page is all I'm after.
