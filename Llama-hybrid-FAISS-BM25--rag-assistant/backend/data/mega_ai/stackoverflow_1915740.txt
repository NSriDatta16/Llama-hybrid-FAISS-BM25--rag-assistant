It can be dependent on your OS, environment, page reads, CPU ticks per second and so on. The most realistic way is to run an execution path several thousand times and take the average. However, if that logging class is only called occasionally and it logs to disk, that is quite likely to be a slow-down factor if it has to seek on the drive first. A read of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profiling_%28computer_programming%29 may give you an insight into more techniques for determining slowdowns in your applications, while a list of profiling tools that you may find useful is at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Studio_Team_System_Profiler specifically http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Studio_Team_System_Profiler if you're doing c# stuff. Hope that helps!
