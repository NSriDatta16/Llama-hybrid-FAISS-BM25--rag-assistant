Grails AppEngine file upload using GAEVFS

I'm working on Grails web application and need to upload files. I have a form (simplified here): and in Controller code (I know that this should not be in controller but this is just to make it work and than will be designed better): def save = { GaeVFS.setRootPath( servletContext.getRealPath( "/" ) ); FileSystemManager fsManager = GaeVFS.getManager(); FileObject tmpFolder = fsManager.resolveFile( "gae://WEB-INF/upload_files" ); if ( !tmpFolder.exists() ) { tmpFolder.createFolder(); } //I NEED CODE HERE TO SAVE THE IMAGE IN THE BIGTABLE VIA GAEVFS } So I have two problems: A. When save create button is pressed a get exception since it tries to use Apache Commons FileUpload that tries to save to file system. How do I disable it? Exception is: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: java.rmi.server.UID is a restricted class. Please see the Google App Engine developer's guide for more details. at com.google.appengine.tools.development.agent.runtime.Runtime.reject(Runtime.java:51) at org.apache.commons.fileupload.disk.DiskFileItem.(DiskFileItem.java:103) at org.apache.commons.fileupload.disk.DiskFileItemFactory.createItem(DiskFileItemFactory.java:196) at org.apache.commons.fileupload.FileUploadBase.parseRequest(FileUploadBase.java:358) B. I need the code example to save image via gaevfs I have seen example in GaeVfsServlet but I still don't know how exactly it should look in my case. Any kind of help is welcome.
