SQL table structure

I posted a week or so about a database structure that I am trying to build. I didn't quite get into the complexity of it, so that's why I'm reposting. In the example, I used a CD collection as an example. I understand that I need a lookup table for say my genres or publishers. That's not a big deal to manage. But there are eight lookup tables in this project and some of the tables have 150 entries in them. As I understand what was suggested, I need a separate entry for CD and its permutations of data. So if I have say 20 entries on average in a lookup table, that's 20 x 20 x 20 x 20 x 20 x 20 x 20 x 20 permutations per CD. Or am I misunderstanding? How can I effectively create a master table to pull in all of the data without have a separate row for each permutation. Do I need to write some more complex SQL to manage all of this? Help!
