It is the UTF-8 BOM , which is actually discouraged by the Unicode standard: http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode5.0.0/ch02.pdf Use of a BOM is neither required nor recommended for UTF-8, but may be encountered in contexts where UTF-8 data is converted from other encoding forms that use a BOM or where the BOM is used as a UTF-8 signature You may disable it using: var sw = new IO.StreamWriter(path, new System.Text.UTF8Encoding(false)); doc.Save(sw); sw.Close();
