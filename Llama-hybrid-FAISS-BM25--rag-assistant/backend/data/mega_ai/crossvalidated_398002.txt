How to know whether a random effect or a cluster effect is necessary for a mixed effect logistic regression?

I have 8 variables in my model out of which I have a group which is definitely not a fixed effect. I tried checking the random effect on the basis of the log-likehood test and it seems significant. I am not sure how to determine whether it is a cluster effect or the random effect. Please help me understand these two concepts.
