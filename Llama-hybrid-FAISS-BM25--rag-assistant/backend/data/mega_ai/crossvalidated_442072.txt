If you want to compare two samples, you should not be doing a one sample test. A one sample test where you take the first sample as if they were population figures leads the test to have a higher actual type I error rate than you chose. However, with time series you also have the additional issue that the usual assumption of independence is unlikely to hold (and indeed, if you don't have stationarity you have additional issues).
