People measure predictive accuracy on the test set and not on the training set for good reasons. If both models deliver 65% on the test set, I'd say they're both of pretty much the same prediction quality, and the fact that the Random Forest (RF) has a much higher value on the training set wouldn't bother me much. It does say that the RF overfits the training set, but that in itself isn't a big problem if the test set performance is fine. Obviously it all to some extent depends on other things such as the size of your test set (if that's too small whatever you observe doesn't mean too much). Also the test set needs to be independent of the training set.
