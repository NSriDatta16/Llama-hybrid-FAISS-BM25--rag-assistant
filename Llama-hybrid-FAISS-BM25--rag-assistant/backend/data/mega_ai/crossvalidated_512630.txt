Ways to compare feature selection methods

Context: A hyperspectral image is taken (here Indiana Pines) which needs to be reduced to a lower dimension from 200 bands for this GSA is to be used. What will be possible metrics to grade various dimension reductions? Work attempted so far: Using KMeans clustering as a measure for the distribution. Problem is KMeans is highly dependent on the random_state and a simple relabelling would result in poor results; Using the inter-point distance matrix to compare results. Problem is there are $\approx 2 * 10^4$ points So the matrix is of size $\approx 2 * 10^8$ which is computationally heavy; Using a SVM over the data and grading based on accuracy. Problem is again fitting the SVM and scoring is computationally heavy so is not suitable metric for dimension reduction; fraction of variance of the data points preserved. Problem: doesn't hold all data Compute distance to neighbours and compare the original vs reduced dimensional distance matrices. Problem: not a normalized value Any help will be appreciated.
