A discrete Markov chain $\theta_1, \theta_2, \ldots$ with transition pmf $k(\theta_{t+1} \mid \theta_t)$ is reversible if joint pmfs for two consecutive time points are "symmetric", or in other words $$ p(\theta_{t+1} = a, \theta_{t} =b) = p(\theta_{t+1} = b, \theta_{t} =a) $$ for any $a,b$ in the state space. You can think of it as the probability of starting in $b$ and going to $a$ is the same as the probability of starting in $a$ and going to $b$. The order doesn't matter. When we write it with the transition pmf and stationary distribution $\pi_{\theta}(\cdot )$ we get something closer to your notation: $$ k(a \mid b) \pi(b) = k(b \mid a)\pi(a). $$ Any measure $\pi$ that satisfies reversibility must also satisfy stationarity. This can be seen if we sum both sides over all possible values of $a$: $$ \pi(b) = \sum_{a} k(b \mid a) \pi(a). $$
