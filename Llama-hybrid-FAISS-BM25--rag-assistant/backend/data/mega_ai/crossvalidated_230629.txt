calculate likelihood with only one observation of data

I quote the whole related documents about Bayesian theory, and I am confused by a specific part "from the Bayesian viewpoint there is only a single data set D (namely the one that is actually observed)". My question is, suppose we have a few choices for values of parameter w , but we only have one observation of data set D , and if data set D is limited and bias, there is possible no co-existence of some possible value of w and D together, when how do we calculate in such case P(D|w) ? Thanks. For example, if we want to calculate P(D = win lottery | w = women) and in observed data set D , there is no data about women, how do we going to do? Treating it as zero posterior ( P(w = woman| D = win lottery) ) seems not very perfect? regards, Lin
