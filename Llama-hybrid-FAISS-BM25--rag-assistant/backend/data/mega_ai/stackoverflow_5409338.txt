pure c support/util library

I am searching a library in C/pragma/.. for basic programming tasks. Something for handling and creating Lists and hasmaps and arrays and souch stuff. So i dont have to reinvent the wheel again and again and write the same structures again and again. But has to be pure C library . Thanks for any help.
