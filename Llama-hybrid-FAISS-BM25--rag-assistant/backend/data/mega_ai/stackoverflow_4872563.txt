Where does Visual Studio save code blocks that are dragged on the Toolbox

You can drag and drop code blocks from the Codeeditor to the Toolbox of VisualStudio, but where does Visual Studio save those code blocks. Are they globally available (for other projects) or only available in the solution/project they are dragged?
