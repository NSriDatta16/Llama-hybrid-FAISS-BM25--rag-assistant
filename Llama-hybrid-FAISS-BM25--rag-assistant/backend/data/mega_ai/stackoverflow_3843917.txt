how to connect the UIImageView in interface builder with the outlet created in xcode named myUIImageView: close interface builder and open up xcode. Heres what you need to write correctly in the following two files. in XCode .h file @interface FirstViewController : UIViewController { IBOutlet UIImageView *myUIImageView; } @property(retain, nonatomic) IBOutlet UIImageView *myUIImageView; @end .m file after implementation you write @synthesize myUIImageView; release in your dealloc and viewDidUnload. save the file in xcode then open up the xib file that is connected to the .h and .m files. For example i have firstViewcontroller.h and firstViewController.m then i have a .xib file called firstView.xib. in Interface Builder Now on the view drag a UIImageView and then in the document dialog you will see the file owners icon. click on that and press CMD+2 to open up the inspector. Go to the connections tab and there will be an outlet named myUIImageView that we created in xcode. next to it is a circle which you click and drag to your UIImageView. This will connect the outlet in xcode with the imageview in interface builder. Now save the file. close interface builder and rebuild your project. Thats the first question answered once you ellaborated on question two i will help you with that. Let me know if you need any more help. PK
