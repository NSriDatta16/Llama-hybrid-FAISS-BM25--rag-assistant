Determining seasonal differencing order

I have a situation where I want to automate the process of determining the order of seasonal differencing for time series data. The problem is I have been solving this in python and I didn't find any seasonal unit root tests written in Python. I didn't even find any way of ARIMA order(seasonal) determination technique written in statsmodels for weekly data. So is there any simple and effective way to automate the the seasonal differencing order determining process.
