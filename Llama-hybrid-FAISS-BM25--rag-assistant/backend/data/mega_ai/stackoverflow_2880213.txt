Tim, Are you really "just" trying to retrieve the Session ID string or do you maybe lose all session information when switching to SSL? this would be a quite common problem, because the session on serverside is lost when using "InProc" session storage, and the session cookie on the client might be lost when not stored in a common domain. Therefore, you should switch to state server or sql server session management in Web.config file, for example: Beside that, I don't really know why you shouldn't be able to retrieve HttpContext.Current.Session.SessionID also in SSL mode as well. Some MSDN Links: MSDN: HttpSessionState.SessionID Property MSDN: ASP.NET Session State Overview Maybe this helps somehow. Best regards
