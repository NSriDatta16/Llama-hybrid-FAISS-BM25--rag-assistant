Interpreting VECM result

X1 , X2 , X3 and X4 are time series which are stationary at level. I want to establish long term relation between them. I am planning to use it as forecasting model for my work. I want to create this model in terms of equation. I have tested all of them for KPSS test and got p=0.01 for all of them. After reading few articles, I decided to go with VECM instead of VAR (Though I was not 100% sure). I implemented that code in R and got below result. Could someone please help me to interpret this result? How can I put below result in equation or do I need to perform another operation to achieve equation. Please let me know if my approach is wrong. mysample
