So, you are asking what would be a good statistics to compute accuracy without being too sensible to outliers. Besides from what you already tried, i.e., calculating the average of the sum of the squares of the distances, you can try the Mean Absolute Error , which is less sensible to outliers as it does not square the deviations. See below: $$\text{MAE} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}|e_i|$$ where $|e_i|$ are the distances from the multiple services locations to the point of interest (POI). Regarding algorithms for calculating the MAE statistics from large-data (if is the case), this CV post might help.
