Unfortunately you are probably out of luck. On Error Resume Next is a legacy option that is generally heavily discouraged, and does not have an equivalent to my knowledge in C#. I would recommend leaving the code in VB (It sounds like that was the source, given your specific request for OnError ResumeNext) and interfacing with or from a C# dll or exe that implements whatever new code you need. Then preform refactoring to cause the code to be safe, and convert this safe code to C# as you do this.
