Specifying frequency parameter in the absence of occurrences

Let's say I have a process where the occurrences are independent, proportional to time. I made $n$ observations for which I only observed no occurrences. My goal is to define a frequency parameter and characterize the unknown value. By characterizing I mean being able to give a level of confidence on the value, given a threshold. Something like "given $n=100$ observations without occurrence, I can say with 95,76% "confidence" that the frequency parameter is below the given threshold of $0.04$ ". Given the description of the process, I intuitively modelized my process as sequence of independent Poisson random variables. Under the Poisson law, the probability of observing $k$ events in an interval is given by the equation $P(k{\text{ events in interval}})=e^{-\lambda }{\frac {\lambda ^{k}}{k!}}$ Apart from a guess that the parameter $\lambda$ for the Poisson law is somewhat low I haven't much information about it. Given that $\lambda$ appears to be really low, I also considered a simpler approach with only two possibilities: the realisation of one event or not, at each time step. This approach appears to be a Bernoulli trial, which can be modelised as following : $P(\text{event})= \lambda $ $P(\text{no event})= 1-\lambda $ I understand that there are then two distinct approaches: frequentist and Bayesian. I understand that the Bayesian approach requires more information on the prior distribution. 1) In a Bayesian approach, would it make sense to take the given threshold mentioned above to determine the prior? How do I get from the prior to the posterior? In the frequentist approach we can define estimators $\hat{\lambda}$ . My problem is that the Maximum Likelihood Estimator gives $\hat{\lambda}_{MLE}=0$ in both case as we have no occurrences. 2) Are there other estimators that would give a different result? How do I define and use the distribution of these estimators to build the wanted confidence level? Is this approach equivalent to making the assumption that $\lambda$ is below the given threshold and testing for it?
