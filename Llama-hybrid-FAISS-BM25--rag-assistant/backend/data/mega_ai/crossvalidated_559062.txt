Here is R code: emotions Set control parameters (I'll assume you want gender balance): n_participants Assign your IDs to modes and genders (shuffling both, so we don't have the first $k$ IDs both Female and Omni): modes Expand the emotion by ID grid: dataset Add the information about modes and genders, as per the settings above: dataset $Microphone_mode ID)] dataset $Gender ID)] Finally, add an amplitude. This simply models an influence of emotion, none of mode or gender. It's not the most elegant way of simulating this, but it's definitely the easiest to understand, and to extend if you want to simulate a more complex influence: dataset $Amplitude Emotion=="Sad"; dataset $Amplitude[index] Emotion=="Neutral"; dataset $Amplitude[index] Emotion=="Happy"; dataset$Amplitude[index] Result: > head(dataset) Emotion ID Microphone_mode Gender Amplitude 1 Happy 1 Uni Male 71.22821 2 Sad 1 Uni Male 58.12064 3 Neutral 1 Uni Male 63.13890 4 Happy 2 Uni Female 75.06662 5 Sad 2 Uni Female 60.55093 6 Neutral 2 Uni Female 65.12635
