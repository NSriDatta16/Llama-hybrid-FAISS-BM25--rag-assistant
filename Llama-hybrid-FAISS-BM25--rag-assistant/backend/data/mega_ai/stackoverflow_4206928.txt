Is an Email Service an appropriate "service" in a SOA?

Does it make sense to create a service whose only responsibility is to send emails for other services? Let me try to express my doubts more clearly and give a little bit of context. BTW, you can ignore the term "SOA" if you like. My intent in including it was to communicate that I am talking about a distributed system that is partitioned by function. The reasons why I am uncertain as to whether an "Email Service" is appropriate or not are: It provides a technical function rather than an organization function. It doesn't compose the email messages, it just processes them. Would it make sense to have the Email Service compose the messages by responding to domain events? Would this be beneficial or harmful? It seems to introduce dependencies into all other services which utilize it. Particularly, I can't see how one could avoid RPCish interactions between the client and the Email Service. Even if you use messaging, the messages would be of the command style (telling the Email Service to send an email) which as I understand it are inappropriate for communications between services since they increase coupling due to the knowledge the client has to have about the service it is consuming in order for it to tell it what to do. Unless of course the Email Service composes the messages in response to domain events from other services (see point 1). It is questionable how much "service" it provides. In other words, isn't the SMTP server already the "Email Service"? Of course, the custom "Email Service" might provide things like queuing and parsing of delivery reports. How much and what should be in the Email Service for it to really be necessary? The alternative would be to have each service within the organization be responsible for sending out it's own email messages. However, this would mean that each service would have to be dependent on the SMTP server, but is that any different from being dependent on a custom "Email Service"? It would also mean that each service would be responsible for queuing and delivery management. Is this beneficial or harmful? In addition, the email messages are considered domain entities, meaning that the organization is interested in the messages themselves in addition to the events that initiated them and the information that they carried. This means that users will be interested in viewing the messages that were sent out within context. For example you might look at a customer's account and ask to view the messages that were sent to that customer (these messages might include: account created confirmation, order placed confirmation, order shipped notification, experience feedback request, etc.). I apologize if my question makes certain assumptions or is unclear, but based on what I've written, can anyone suggest an approach or discuss an approach that they have taken and how it worked out? I've already looked around SO for similar questions and googled on the topic but did not find anything that really applied, but if anyone can point out any resources I would greatly appreciate it. I would also be interested in answers that point out things that I might be overlooking or misunderstanding. Any sort of discussion on the matter seems valuable to me.
