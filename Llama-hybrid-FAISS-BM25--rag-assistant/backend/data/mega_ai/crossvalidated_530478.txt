Oversampling the minority class (eg. defaulted customers) will just cause the intercept ( $\beta_0$ ) to artificially increase. You can correct this intercept (estimated based on the oversampled data) as described in section 4.1 of this paper . That said, logistic regression behaves well even when the minority class is only a small fraction of the sample. If you went with your recalibration approach based on the Points (ie. fitting $\ln(p_i/(1-p_i)) = \beta'_0 + \beta'_1\text{Points}_i$ ), you'd find that $\beta'_1$ would be close to 1, and $\beta'_0$ would be negative (to adjust the intercept estimated based on the oversampled data).
