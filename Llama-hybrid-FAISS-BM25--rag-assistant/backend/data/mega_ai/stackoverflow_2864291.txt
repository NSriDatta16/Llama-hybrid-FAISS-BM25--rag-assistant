Mouse events not firing when databinding to a Silverlight ContentControl

I am in the process of taking a Silverlight 4 UserControl containing a canvas which has a number of FrameworkElements on it and converting this to use databinding. The XAML for my original canvas was: This displays the rectangle and image and the MouseLeftButtonDown event fires which then deals with operations such as dragging and resizing. In order to get this working with databinding I created an object called CanvasElement: public class CanvasElement { public CanvasElement(int id, object elementContent, double width, double height, int left, int top) { Id = id; ElementContent = elementContent; Width = width; Height = height; Left = left; Top = top; } public int Id { get; set; } public object ElementContent { get; set; } public double Width { get; set; } public double Height { get; set; } public int Left { get; set; } public int Top { get; set; } } The ElementContent is used to store the Rectangle or Image. I populate an ObservableCollection called CanvasElements and assign the DataContext of the control. I have changed my XAML to: My elements appear but the CanvasElement_MouseLeftButtonDown does not fire. I have also used ContentControl within the ItemsControl. My questions are: Is this is sensible way to go? Why is MouseLeftButtonDown not firing?
