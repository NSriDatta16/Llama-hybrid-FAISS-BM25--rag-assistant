Multivariate time series for multiple objects

I have a dataset containing a few variables like this: +-----+------+--------+-----------+---------+----------+--+ | id | year | week_n | price_avg | traffic | quantity | | +-----+------+--------+-----------+---------+----------+--+ | 123 | 2012 | 1 | 60.0 | 800 | 400 | | | 123 | 2012 | 2 | 68.0 | 1000 | 560 | | | 123 | 2012 | 3 | 54.0 | 760 | 390 | | | 456 | 2014 | 4 | 44.0 | 750 | 370 | | | 456 | 2014 | 5 | 48.0 | 820 | 404 | | | 456 | 2014 | 6 | 54.0 | 800 | 410 | | +-----+------+--------+-----------+---------+----------+--+ Representing different locations with the number of products sold for each location in a given week of the year, along with some other predictors. I need to apply a multivariate model able to predict the variable quantity for n future weeks. I was thinking about applying some ARMA models, or ARIMA , as the series is stationary with a Dickey-Fuller p-value of 0.15. As in the exercise, it is asked to me to first compute a multivariate regression model, and then predict the variable quantity for the next 10 weeks. I am a bit confused and I don't know exactly which would be a good approach in R to solve this problem.
