Generally you would pre-specify your analysis before conducting the RCT to maximise credibility. One approach, depending on your outcome (continous with reasonably normal residuals, binary, time-to-event, count data), is to do some regression (e.g. ANCOVA, logistic regression, Cox regression, negative binomial) adjusting for key covariates (ideally with the functional form pre-specified or as a factor by meaningful cuts). Once you have non-multiplicity-adjusted p-values, for many group versus one control, there are a number of useful tests. E.g. Dunnett's test, the weighted version (if one hypothesis was more plausible than the others before seeing the data), Dunnett-Tamahane (slightly more powerful than the original test), weighted versions thereof and there have been further publications trying for some further small improvements. They all try to exploit that you know (at least for the continous data case - in the other cases you may have to estimate it from the data) the exact correlation between the test statistics.
