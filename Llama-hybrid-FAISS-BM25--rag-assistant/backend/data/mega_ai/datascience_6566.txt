I assume the feature you use to detect abnormality is one row of data in a logfile. If so, Sklearn is your good friend and you can use it as a blackbox. Check the tutorial of one-class SVM and Novelty detection . However, in case that your feature is an entire logfile, you need to first summarize it to some feature of same dimension, and then apply Novealty detection.
