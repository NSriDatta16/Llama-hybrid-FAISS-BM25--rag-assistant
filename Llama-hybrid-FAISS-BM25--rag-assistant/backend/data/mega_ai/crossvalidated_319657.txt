This example is confusing because it suggests (though never states) that the input variables $x_1,x_2$ are discrete, and they probabilities are not really conditional probabilities. Logistic regression takes input from a continuous variable and maps that to a probability of belong to a discrete output (a binary classification of either 0 or 1). For some (previously unseen) value $X=x$, it returns a value $P(Y=1)$. Since there are only two classes, $P(Y=0)$ follows trivially: $$P(Y=0) = 1-P(X=1).$$ These are not conditional probabilities in the sense that $$P(Y=1 \, \cap \, X=x) \neq P(Y=1 |X=x)P(X=x),$$ so I'm going to go ahead and call this out as an abuse of notation. My proposal would be to replace the bar with a semicolon: $P(Y=1|x) \rightarrow P(Y=1;x)$. The fact that the odds multiply is really just a feature of the logistic model; you won't be able to see it as a consequence of the laws of probability. If you're concerned about $x_1$ and $x_2$ being correlated, I would plot them together and check the covariance matrix. Detecting and quantifying the effect of correlated independent variables is beyond the scope of this answer; see What is the effect of having correlated predictors in a multiple regression model?
