What approach can be take to design a food menu intelligently?

I am given following problem, for which I am seeking for advice. Problem Statement Suppose you are given a catalogue of dishes with their cost and calories. Can you design an algorithm/model which can generate a menu of item such that items in menu has cost less than certain( say X) dollar and calories (say Y) approx equal to certain value. X = 800 Y = 20 menu_items = method(calories=Y, cost=X) # Generate a menu under 20$ and approx 800 calories. Dataset can look like Item Type Cost Calories A Bread 1.5 300 B Gravy 6 500 C Bread 1 100 D Salad 5 100 E Dessert 3 400 What I am looking for I am looking for advice that what kind of models I can look into to solve this problem, since it is neither classification nor regression nor clusterring. If their is any related research paper that you know, i will be more than happy to read that out. Note : I tried to ask chatGpt the same question Question : Can you generate a menu under 5$ with 800 calories? ChatGPT gave me the menu but since i want to have similar behaviour on my own data-set so I need to comeup with custom model.
