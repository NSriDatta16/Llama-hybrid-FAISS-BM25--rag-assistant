Is appropriate to use empirical Bayes (EB) in this way?

Background. I have data from a study where participants make a series of judgments (a series of decisions with a binomial outcome, either $y=1$ or $y=0$ ). I have a model of the underlying decision-making process, which has free parameters that can be estimated from the data. My interest is ultimately comparing these parameters across different groups of participants. I have a relatively small number of observations on each participant, so I am using a hierarchical Bayesian approach (I wrote my model in Stan) to pool data across individuals. The problem. For the comparison to be accurate I need to take into account that some of the responses might be purely "random", in the sense that they are not predictable (e.g. participant is distracted and pushes either one of the two buttons with probability 0.5). In other words, the likelihood of the observed responses is a mixture between complete chance, $\frac{1}{2}$ , and the probability predicted by the model, call it $p^*$ . The mixture is governed by a parameter $\lambda$ which basically correspond to the probability of giving a "random" response (often referred to as "lapse" of attention). In other words the probability of observing $y=1$ in any trial is given by $\lambda \cdot \frac{1}{2} + \left(1 -\lambda \right) \cdot p^* $ . More formally, the model could be expressed as $$ P\left(y_i=1 \mid j\right) = \frac{\lambda_j}{2} + \left( 1- \lambda_j\right)\cdot\Phi\left[\beta_0 + u_{j0} + \left(\beta_1 + u_{j1} \right)x_i\right] $$ where $j$ indicate the participant, $\beta_0, \beta_1$ are fixed-effects; $u_0, u_1$ are participant-specific random effects; and $\lambda_j$ is the lapse rate of subject $j$ . To have an idea of how frequently these lapses occur, I have included few "catch" trials, that is decisions where the correct answer is so obvious that we can safely assume that participants would make a mistake only if they responded at chance. Thus the frequency of errors in these catch trials could be taken as an estimate of the lapse rate, although I have only have few catch trials (either 6 or 12, depending on the participant). I want to use a multilevel approach also for the parameter $\lambda$ , specifically by assuming a beta distribution, $\lambda \sim \text{Beta} \left(a, b \right)$ . However, while I can assign sensible hyper-priors to all other parameters, I have difficulty deciding and justifying on an appropriate hyper-prior for $a$ and $b$ . Note that I am not interested in the lapse rates per se, I just want to control for the probability of lapses them while estimating and comparing the other parameters across groups. Questions. I was considering using an approach which I think could be defined as empirical Bayes, where for each participant $j$ I estimate the lapse rate $\hat \lambda_j$ as simply the ratio of the number of errors (in catch trials) to the number of catch trials; then I estimate the values of $a$ and $b$ via MLE (by maximizing the likelihood of $\hat \lambda_j$ under a Beta distribution; see the plot below), and then plugging in these estimates in the multilevel model above, as a prior distribution for the participant-specific lapse rates. Is this approach legit? I have zero experience in empirical Bayes (EB), but I have the impression that in most cases it is implemented as an iterative process resembling expectation maximization, whereas in my case I wouldn't do any iterations. Is that still a valid way of applying EB? (Pointers to relevant references are appreciated!) Is it a problem if in my model I would have some parameters with an "empirical" prior, and some others with standard Bayesian priors and hyper-priors?
