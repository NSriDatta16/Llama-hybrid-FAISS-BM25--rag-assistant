Parametric bootstrap in generating returns and hypothesis testing

I am trying to test a hypothesis of a statistic calculated from portfolio returns. To do so I estimate a model on the original returns series and want to obtain 100 bootstrapped series using parametric bootstrap. I am conflicted about two approaches. But first let me say that I obtain the new returns as a mean plus a series of resampled residuals $r = \mu + \varepsilon$ So the two approaches I am considering: Estimate the model using the original returns Obtain a new series of returns by using the mean and resampled residuals from the model Estimate the model on the new series Obtain the new series and so on... In short I am resampling the new returns each time, so I am obtaining a single new series with each iteration. Estimate the model on the original returns Obtain 100 new return series by using the mean and resampled residuals from the model (each resampled series is different of course) I am wondering which of the approaches is a correct method of parametric bootstrap. I am not including any details on the models and test statistics to keep the post simple, as only the method of obtaining the new return series is important here. edit: I have found a paper that is doing a similar thing to my research, however, it uses a strange bootstrap method, as in some steps it uses the original returns and in some the bootstrapped ones. Equation (1)-(3) mentioned in the fragment are those of a GJR-GARCH model. Is this iterative approach, somehow similar to the one I described as point 1. correct, with taking the original returns in some steps and the new bootstrapped series in other steps?
