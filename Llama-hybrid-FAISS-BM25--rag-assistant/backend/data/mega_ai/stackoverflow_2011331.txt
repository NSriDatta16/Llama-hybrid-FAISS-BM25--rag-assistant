Suggestions for building a clothing exchange site with Joomla/virtuemart

I want to build a website to allow users exchange clothes with each other.The website will be similar to an online auction site and a book exchange. This will be a point-based exchange community. The website allows users to 1) register for a private account 2) list items based on a specific, yet simple form that they can keep track of in their account 3) Rate items that they have received based on three simple criteria 4) Admin can add/delete products and also categorise them 5) Sizes labels etc can be assigned to products 6) Other users can upload their products/categorize them assign 7) users can perform faceted search on the products and filter by size, label etc.. One main point here is that there is no payment involved. I was thinking to use virtuemart over joomla for this kinda website and needed an opinion on how tough would it be customize virtuemart/joomla to meet the requirements. Can you please suggest some other architecture if you think that the above arechitecture is not feasible to build this sorta website? Magento is not an option. Thanks.
