Don't use display:none for preloading. Because an element set to display:none doesn't render any of its physical attributes, the browser doesn't bother downloading it until it's made visible. An alternative is to use visibility:hidden , but you run the risk of running into a user agent that does pretty much the same thing. visibility:hidden requires that the browser compute the box model for the image, which requires that image is loaded (to get the dimensions). I don't believe this works in IE6, though. The last technique (and my favorite) is to create a div directly before your tag. Position it absolute with left: -99999999px; top: -99999999px . The browser is forced to render the images (and consequently load them) and there's no messy Javascript to deal with. Now, to integrate this with your issue, put the code for your Google map after your "preload div". Your browser will be forced to load the images before it runs the code to create the map. This should solve your problem. Hope this helps!
