The idea is that the ScrollViewer is a decorator for the thing that it scrolls and clips. The thing being scrolled is completely unaware of the scrolling. This is simple and elegant - why is it not sufficient in your case? Having said that, if the ScrollViewer does not do what you want, I suggest that you create ScrollBar controls and handle the events generated by it, moving the content that you wish to scroll in the event handlers. You may even be able to do some fancy data binding to avoid writing event handlers. I'm not sure how you are going to clip the content correctly, but that's a new can of worms. If you need to layout one control on top of another, use a canvas control.
