I'm pretty sure it's for range retrieval requests, i.e. requesting part of a document (resuming a file download, for example). 14.35.2 Range Retrieval Requests HTTP retrieval requests using conditional or unconditional GET methods MAY request one or more sub-ranges of the entity, instead of the entire entity, using the Range request header, which applies to the entity returned as the result of the request: If the ETag is weak (starts with W/ ) then it can't be used for a range retrieval - only strong validators can be used for that or the client may end up with an inconsistent file.
