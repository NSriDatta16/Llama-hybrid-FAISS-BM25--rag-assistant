Comparing the means of two groups with different sizes

I am doing an statistical study over ultra-marathon runners (100 km distance) where I have a large number of data points (race records) corresponding to the average race speed of different runners from different countries. I want to respond to the following question: "what country has the fastest runners?" I have grouped the race records by country and calculated the arithmetic average (mean) of each of the groups. Below is an excerpt of the results table obtained: As you can see, RUS has a mean race speed of 9.232564 km/h with a sample size of 4408 samples. And LTU has a mean race speed of 10.122746 but a smaller sample size of 365. So which country has the fastest runners?
