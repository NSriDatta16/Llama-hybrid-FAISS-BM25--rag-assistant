Statsmodels ZeroInflatedPoisson - Unable To Converge

I've been asked to fit a ZeroInflatedPoisson model on a dataset to predict Y (count data) for an assignment. First, I did this manually: Create a binary variable (Y_IND) based on Y where Y_IND = 0 if Y = 0, and 1 if Y >=1. Fit a statsmodels Logistic Regression model using X variables to predict the binary variable Y_IND with no problem. Fit a statsmodel Poisson Regression model on the subset of data where Y_IND = 1, using X variables to predict Y, which also worked without issue. However, when I tried to fit a model using statsmodels ZeroInflatedPoisson to predict Y, I received error messages stating: "ConvergenceWarning: Maximum Likelihood optimization failed to converge. Check mle_retvals ConvergenceWarning)" This is my code: sm.ZeroInflatedPoisson(endog=y, exog=X, exog_infl=X, inflation='logit').fit(maxiter=100) I assume the warning message is referring to the Logistic Regression step, but I'm not sure why since it was able to fit a Logistic Regression model independently on the same dataset. Is it unable to converge because it is trying predict Y instead of the binary Y_IND? If so, how can I get around this issue?
