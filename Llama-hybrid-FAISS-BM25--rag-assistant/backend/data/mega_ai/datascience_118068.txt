Probability distribution of probabilities

We can get the prediction probabilities of a binary classifier from sklearn's API using the predict_proba method. Is it reasonable to expect that the shape of a histogram plotted for the prediction probabilities of let's say the '1' class to approximate a normal distribution? What is the statistical theory that allows for this? I noticed this instance for a logistic regression model I trained.
