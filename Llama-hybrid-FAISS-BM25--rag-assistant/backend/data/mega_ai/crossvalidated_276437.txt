As mentioned by Matthew Gunn in comments Lagrange used the multivariate normal in 1776 [1] ( Memoir on the usefulness of the method of taking the mean ) as a limit of the multinomial, described in Stigler (1986) [2]: the multivariate normal distribution was far from unknown in 1892. One appearance as a limit to the multinomial distribution, could be found in work published over a century earlier by Lagrange (1776). The next earliest use I'm aware of is Adrain (1808) [3] where he makes use of multivariate normal errors. An account of what he did (and some criticism of part of it) can be seen in Gorroochurn (2016) [4] (for example you can see him discussing contours of constant probability being elliptical in the bivariate case in the paper). In the same paper Adrain also discusses least squares estimation. Subsequently it was discussed by Laplace in 1812. To answer your other question, Gauss did work on the normal distribution in 1809, deriving it and using it with astronomical observations. [1] Lagrange, J.L.
