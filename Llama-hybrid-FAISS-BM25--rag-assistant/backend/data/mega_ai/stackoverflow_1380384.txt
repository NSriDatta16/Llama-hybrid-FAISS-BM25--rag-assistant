Not all side comments are bad. For instance, in my answer to How do I check for a sub-subdirectory in Perl , they stay out of the way and allow people to see the parallel structure in the code more easily. That's why we put them over to the side: they are minor players that enhance a statement without calling a lot of attention to it. I use comments on lines by their own for much more detailed explanations of motivation, special cases, and so on. I use these to interrupt the code flow to ensure the developer reads them because they have very important extra-code information. And, if you are using Perl::Critic, you're going to want the side comments sometimes :) ....; ## no critic
