Some friends have told me that Maven is a bit like NetBeans: both suffer from a certain stigma that was once deserved but no longer entirely valid. I hated Maven 1.x due to a lack of documentation and due to XML/Jelly. The latter issue may be resolved, as Maven 2 is much more Java-oriented. The stigma of poor documentation remains, but I don't know if it is fair. ( If it is still fair, then the Maven team has truly dropped the ball.) Both the POM and dependency management are cool ideas, but one wonders if they will be assimilated by a newer tool, in the same way that C++ led the way to newer languages. A final note: the dichotomy between Ant and Maven is somewhat false. Gradle and Gant are build tools in the Groovy space that have a lot to offer, even for straight-up Java projects. Because they use Groovy, the simple tasks are truly simple (in contrast to the painful XML constructions in Ant); yet they have strong integration with Ant, so there is a rich set of "hard" tasks.
