The google maps api v3 has a directions rederer. You can render a pollyline between two points and have the pollyline be dragable i.e. you can pick a pint along the route and reposition it as a waypoint. see the api documentation. alternativly you can capture click events on the map add push the location into an array of stopovers to pass on the the routing request.
