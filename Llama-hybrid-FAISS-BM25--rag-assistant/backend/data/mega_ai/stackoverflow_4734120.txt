Silverlight TextBlock: Convert Text to InlineCollection

Consider the following markup declaration: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz 0123456789 I want to bind any data to a TextBlock and convert this data to an InlineCollection. It would be very elegant to do this with Data Binding. The other way is to observe my Data Source and use the Inlines-Property from the TextBlock class in Code Behind. I tried the following but it didn't work: What I want to do is achieve auto font-scaling by encapsulating my TextBlock in a ViewBox, but also generating LineBreaks after an arbitrary letter count. Thanks in advance for any help. Best regards.
