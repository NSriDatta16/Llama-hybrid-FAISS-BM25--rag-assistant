JavaScript: Capturing right click and disabling menu only within certain element

I have coded a jquery script where there is a small grid on screen and using drag and drop users can place tiles on the grid (snaps in place). Currently if you hover over a tile it fades in the option to rotate, but I would much prefer it if you could right click to rotate (making it more natural). I understand blocking right click completely is often frowned upon so was wondering if it was possible just within a particular element, then capturing that event, doing something in JS and disabling the context menu? - that works in every browser. On a side note, currently I am using jQuery for effects and custom javascript for drag and drop, is it worth looking at a jQuery plugin for drag and drop? Many thanks,
