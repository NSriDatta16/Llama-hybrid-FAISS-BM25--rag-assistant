F1 score vs accuracy, which metric is more important?

I have two multiclass classification models for making predictions (number of classes is three to be precise). One is Keras neural network, other is Gradient Boosted Classifier from Scikit Learn library. I have noticed that after training on same data GBC has higher accuracy score, while Keras model has higher F1 score. Which model should I use for making predictions on future data? Which metric is more important?
