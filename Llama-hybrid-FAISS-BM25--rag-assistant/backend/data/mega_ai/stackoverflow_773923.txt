RTS Vehicle grid movement

I don't know how to implement good 2D grid movement. It is easy to implement movement for units like soldiers, but I don't know how to turn vehicle in elegant way. The movement should be like in C&C Red Alert (not 3, because it's 3D, I want just 2D). EDIT: I don't ask any code, neither links to pathfinding algorithms, because they're easy to find. But the grid movement isn't. I don't know how "exactly" move from one tile to another, especially with diagonal movement (even though it's "longer" move than orthogonal move).
