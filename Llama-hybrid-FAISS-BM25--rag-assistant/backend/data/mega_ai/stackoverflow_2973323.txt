Using a framework saves you a ton of time and helps you to organise your app mroe logically. If the app is small then frameworks like CodeIgniter or Kohana are ideal. If you are building a bigger app that needs to scale the Symfony or possiby Zend are the ones to look at. If you were to start your app in Symfony you would instanly get: url rewriting using routes a form framework for handling everything to do with your web forms internationalisation and localisation emailing caching admin area generator, to help you add data quickly unit testing framework Plus the whole framework is extendable and custmisable to suit your needs. Starting without a framework you'd have to write all of this yourself. Or integrate several disparate open source modules. Hope this helps.
