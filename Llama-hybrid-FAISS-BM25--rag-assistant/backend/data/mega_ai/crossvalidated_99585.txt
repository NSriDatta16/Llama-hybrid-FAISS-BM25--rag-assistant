Regression would be a way of tackling it, and it would take the form of a multivariate regression on your parameters. The main advantages are that it would have a unique solution and that is implemented in a large number of software suites; the main disadvantage is that you would have to assume some functional dependence on the parameters. Maybe a multivariate linear regression would be a good way to start exploring your data, but I am not sure it could give a definitive answer to the question you posed. A rather different approach is to try to understand if the data can be collapsed into a smaller number of dimensions that it has. You could try PCA or factor analysis and conclude if most of the variability can be explained by a smaller number of vectors/components than the parameters + dependent variable you feed it. The main problem will be the interpretation of the principal vectors obtained, but it could certainly shed some light on the degree of correlation among your parameters and between each and the dependent variable.
