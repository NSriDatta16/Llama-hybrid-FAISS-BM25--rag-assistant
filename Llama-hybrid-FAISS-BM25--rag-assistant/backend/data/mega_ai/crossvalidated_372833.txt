Comment continued. We have a population $\mathsf{Norm}(\mu_w = 65,\, \sigma_w = 3.5)$ of women's heights and a population $\mathsf{Norm}(\mu_m = 70,\, \sigma_m = 4)$ of men's heights. Assuming half men and half women in the population, a histogram of 10,000 people from the combined population is shown below, along with (scaled) density curves for women (maroon) and men (blue). Now, I take many samples of size $n = 100$ from each population and take the mean (average) of each sample. The histograms (along with corresponding theoretical density plots) show the separation in means and the reduced variability of these averages.
