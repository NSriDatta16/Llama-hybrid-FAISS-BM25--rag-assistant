If you on occasion need to retrieve an image and it has to be available on several different web servers. But I think that's pretty much it. If it doesn't have to be available on several servers, it's always better to put them in the file system. If it has to be available on several servers and there's actually some kind of load in the system, you'll need some kind of distributed storage. We're talking an edge case here, where you can avoid adding an additional level of complexity to your system by leveraging the database. Other than that, don't do it.
