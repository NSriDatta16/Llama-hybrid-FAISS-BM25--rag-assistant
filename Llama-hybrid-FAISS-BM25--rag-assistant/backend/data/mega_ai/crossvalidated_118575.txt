You could possibly do a seperate logistic model for each covar and check the percent of variation explained (R 2 ). For logistic regression the procedure is a little bit different, and a simply R 2 will not be sufficient, so you will have to look at pseudo-R 2 s like Nagelkerke's . By doing this you will see how much each of your covariates explains in your response variable and you can then rank them accordingly. I hope to see some other people chime in here, just one idea. Note that when comparing pseudo-R 2 s you will want to give them a 95% CI through permutation tests like boostrapping. Google has lots more specifically for R, but for background . And yes you can assign numbers to your categorical factors, but you must make sure they are coded as factors and not numericals . In R this is simple -- given dataset "dataset" and categorical data "data": dataset$data Good luck!
