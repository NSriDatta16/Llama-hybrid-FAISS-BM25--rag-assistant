Important update The flash CS5 AIR for android functionality was never out of beta. And sadly as adobe is famous for, the functionality has been discontinued for flash CS5 so that the full working/updated version will become a selling feature for CS6 or CS5.5. I have many, many feelings about this as a customer who has spent literally MANY THOUSANDS of dollars on adobe products but I'll keep this about information and not my burning rage towards adobe feelings. For proof of this see: http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/flashpro_extensionforair/ So it is most likely that this is one of many bugs left unfixed in AIR for android in CS5. This is not a surprise, as when I bought CS4 master collection which promised AIR 1.5, even AIR 1.5 was left broken and all bug fixes were rolled into 2.0, which was only available for CS5. One of the biggest bugs they never fixed in CS4 AIR 1.5 was a major, crippling bug in webkit which nearly rendered any use of webkit in AIR non-functional. In fact when I worked for Webkinz.com, a major project was completely thrown out the window and I was actually ridiculed for proposing using AIR, touting all it's amazingness and then left looking like an idiot in front of all my peers when these bugs appeared. Literally I'm not kidding the head of my 180+ developer division centered me out in a meeting around a gigantic table with every major player in that company. Anyway perhaps my update did bleed into somewhat of a rant but it's good information I think and a good lesson to be learned, which is always assume the worst with Adobe products. Fortunately, as mentioned in my answer, it's not a dead end and there are ways around their "business model." Original Answer It's a bug in AIR for Android: http://forums.adobe.com/thread/753977 That post is dated, but I've seen several more around the same time frame and enough that I'd call it a fact. Have you updated flash CS5? ( Go to Help->Updates). To be honest I don't even know if they have patched/addressed this bug yet but your best bet of finding out is to grab the very latest Flex SDK and try manually packaging your SWF into an APK using it. Instructions: http://help.adobe.com/en_US/air/build/WS901d38e593cd1bac25d3d8c712b2d86751e-8000.html#WS901d38e593cd1bac25d3d8c712b2d86751e-7ffb More detailed/tutorial-like instructions: http://thulasiramsoft.wordpress.com/2011/01/16/build-apps-for-android-using-as3-without-a-device-using-flex-air/ If this is a bug this is where you're going to see the fix appear first. Try packaging your SWF into an APK manually using the above methods and ensure you've updated the AIR for android on the device to AIR 2.6 (latest, just go to the market to update). This will either fix the problem or eliminate it as a possibility both on the compiler and runtime side.
