The short answer is that process capability ($C_p$/$C_{pk}$) and Shewhardt charts are two separate questions and should not be displayed at the same time. It is entirely possible for a process to be in "statistical control" but not "capable" or for a process to be "capable" while not being in "statistical control." Statistical control charts use modified time series charts to detect variation between units or subgroups with charts related to associated ranges between units or subgroups. Control limits are based upon the variation in the process. Process capability is based upon a histogram with limits defined by engineering or the customer . In regards to the long answer of "which estimate for the standard deviation is 'right'," Gregory Roth II in his 2005 article "Capability Indexes: Mystery Solved" discusses the fact that none of the standards define which version of a standard deviation should be used, and the many methods available each provide different answers. He compared estimates for $s$ of $\sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n\left(X_i-\overline{X}\right)^2}{n}}$, $\sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n\left(X_i-\overline{X}\right)^2}{n-1}}$, $\frac{\overline{R}}{d_2}$, and $\sqrt[i]{\frac{\sum f\left(d'\right)^2}{n}-\left(\frac{\sum|fd'}{n}\right)^2}$, along with the results of proprietary software outputs, which may include adaptations of $\sqrt{\frac{\sum x^2 - \frac{\left( \sum x \right )^2}{n}}{n-1}}$ (a computational equivalent to the sample standard deviation). Roth's suggestion was to simply use a calculated sample standard deviation based upon all the data regardless of the application because modern computing power eliminates the need to shortcut the process by using tables from a control chart. Mahmoud et al in their 2010 Journal of Quality Technology article "Estimating the Standard Deviation in Quality-Control Applications" discuss a wide variety of estimates for standard deviation which may be worth researching. These methods include $s/c_4$, $c_4s$, $(\sqrt{n-1/n})s$, $\overline{s}/c_4$, $S_{pooled}$, and $c_4 S_{pooled}$. The pooled sample standard deviation, $S_{pooled}$, is defined based upon a series of samples, $S^2_i$, the $i$th sample variance, and $n_i$, the $i$th sample size (which does not need to be constant): $S_{pooled}=\sqrt{\frac{\sum^m_{i=1} \left (n_i-1 \right )S^2_i}{\sum^m_{i=1}\left ( n_i-1 \right )}}$. According to Bissell (Bissell, A. F. How reliable is your capability index? Appl. Stat. 1990, 39, 331-340.), the preferred method for estimating the central tendency of the process is to use $\overline{\overline{x}}$ defined within a minimum of 50 consecutive items spread over $k$ subgroups: $\overline{\overline{x}}=\frac{1}{k}\sum_{j=1}^{k}\overline{x}_j$. There are additional various version of the estimate for the central tendency which will impact your results for your capability analysis. Any of these point estimators should be given with their confidence intervals. For $C_p$, the confidence interval $c=C_p\sqrt{\frac{\chi^2_{1-\gamma,n-1}}{n-1}}$; for $C_{pk}$, a good estimate for the confidence interval is $c=\hat{C}_{pk}\pm Z_{1-\alpha/2}\sqrt{\frac{1}{9n}+\frac{\hat{C}_{pk}^2}{2\left(n-1\right)}}$. This approximation is valid for $n\geq 25$ and is most appropriate for $n\geq 100$.
