This problem has been a long standing issue in our programming shop too. The funny thing is that programmers tend to look at this from the wrong optimization angle: "keep everything in one place". In my opinion, you have two main issues: The changes' descriptions must be easy to read ("So what's new?") The process should be optimized for writing of the specification to agree upon, and then get to work already! Imagine how this problem is solved in another environment: government law making. The lawbook is not rewritten with "track changes" turned on every time the government adds another law, or changes one... The best way is to never touch a released document. Don't stuff everything into the same file, you'll get the: dreaded version history table eternal status "draft" , scattered inconsistencies, horribly rushed sentences, and foul smelling blend of authors' styles Instead, release an addendum, describing only the changes in detail, and possibly replacing full paragraphs/pages of the original. With the size of our project, this can never work, can it? In my biggest project so far, I released one base spec, and 5 consecutive addenda. Each of around 5 pages. Worked like a charm!
