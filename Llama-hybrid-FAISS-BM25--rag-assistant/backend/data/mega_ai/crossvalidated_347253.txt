Heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation tests

I am currently analysing my regression model and I'm trying to test for autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity. The model I'm analysing is: Y = b_0 + b_1x_1 + b_2x_2 + e where Y is the current salary level, x_1 is years of education, b_i is the OLS estimations and x_2 is the wage level after college and e is the error term. Now to test for heteroskedasticity I am using the Breusch - Pagan test. The way it works is that i regress the squared residuals on the same model. So: e^2 = b_0 + b_1x_1 + b_2x_2 + r image1 My first question is what should I look at here to see if we have heteroskedasticity? The p-value is over 0.05 does that mean we have homoskedasticity? In the same model I am also looking for autocorrelation. A test I found was a Durbin-Watson Test. image2 This is the result i got from it. My second question: So we are below 0.05 does that mean we can reject the hypothesis of autocorrelation? Or is this test only to be used for Time series analysis?
