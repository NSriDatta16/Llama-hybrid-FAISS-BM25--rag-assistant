Averaging an average in mySQL

I have a table car id | person_id | mpg ------------------------ 4 | 1 | 50 5 | 1 | 15 6 | 2 | 10 7 | 2 | 28 8 | 3 | 33 I need to get an average of each person's mpg and then an average for the group. person 1 avg = (50 + 15) / 2 = 32.5 person 2 avg = (10 + 28) / 2 = 19 person 3 avg = 33 group average = 32.5 + 19 + 33 / 3 = 28.1 Is there a query that will do what I need?
