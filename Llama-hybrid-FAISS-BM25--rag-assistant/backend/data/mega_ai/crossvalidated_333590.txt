Just for the sake of argument, why not just compare the activations of the two images at that layer? Is it because a straight comparison of activations represents content? Is it simply too simplistic for something like "style"? But suddenly when we're comparing pairs of activations, now it's sufficiently complex to be style? Suppose you have a layer with 16 channels of 1000x1000 activations. The "straight comparison" would be norm of differences of 16 million of activations. The style cost first calculates the correlations in pairs of layers. Each pairwise correlation is over the 1 million activations, and you end up with 16x16 correlation matrix, or 256 elements over which you get the norm of differences. So, what you're suggesting is to lump all channels into one big pile, and just compare the ultimate activations of the layer ignoring the channel assignment of neurons. In contrast, the style transfer recognizes the channels are higher level abstractions of features themselves, then you see how the channels are correlated with each other. You seem to be focusing on the fact that correlations are calculated pair-wise, but that's not essential. Just like in a correlation matrix in statistics each cell is a pair-wise correlation, here you have pair-wise channel correlation. However, in both cases it is the matrix in its entirety that represents the correlation structure of your data. My analogy is with correlation analysis in pedometers. Suppose you have several sensors in the pedometer such as gyro, inertial etc. You get a sample of 1 minute length at 100Hz sampling rate. Let's say we have 10 sensors in this pedometer. This means that we get 10 time series of 6,000 observations of each sensor. We could obtain the 10x10 correlation matrix of these sensors. We could obtain another sample of the same length, and get another correlation matrix. It's possible that thee correlation matrices would reflect the mode of movement of the person wearing the pedometer, such as walking, sitting and running. We could also, identify different 10x10 matrices that correspond to different modes. So, if we applied what you suggested instead we'd be comparing a big pile of 60,000 observations. How likely these to be informative of the mode of movement? Unlikely. You can keep walking, and each 1 minute sample would be very different from another.
