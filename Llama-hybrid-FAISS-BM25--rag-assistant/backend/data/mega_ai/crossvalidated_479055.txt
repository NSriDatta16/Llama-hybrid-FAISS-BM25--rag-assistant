Vaitsiakhovich, T., Drichel, D., Herold, C., Lacour, A., & Becker, T. (2015). METAINTER: meta-analysis of multiple regression models in genome-wide association studies . Bioinformatics, 31(2), 151-157. This paper provides an introduction to software to carry out meta-analysis of regression models. It's made for bioinformatics/genomics where people cannot do a full OLS model fit because there are often >100k or >1M predictors ( SNPs ) and many fewer cases (persons) in the study. In this case, what researchers do is carry out a lot of small regressions, 1 SNP at a time along with controls if desired (e.g. age, sex, ancestry from principal components analysis) and then combine that in a meta-analysis, which they then call a genome-wide association study (GWAS) . They could also just do penalized regression with the full dataset, but this is usually not possible because researchers are not legally allowed to share the case-level data with each other, hence the need to do meta-analysis on the summary statistics from regression models ( this paper however developed a method ( lassosum ) to use the lasso (L1 penalization) on summary statistics with ~90% efficiency of case-level data). If, on the other hand, you have a situation with a single dataset with too many variables and many models, you might instead want to run a ton of different models on that one dataset and then meta-analyze those. In this case, in economics, they use something called Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) also called Bayesian Averaging of Classical Estimates (BACE) that allows some analyses of this situation. The classic paper on this is Sala-i-Martin et al 2004 who used it for modeling economic growth between countries where there are too many variables to model jointly.
