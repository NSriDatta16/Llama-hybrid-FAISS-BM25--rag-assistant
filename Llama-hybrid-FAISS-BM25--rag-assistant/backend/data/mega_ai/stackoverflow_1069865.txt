MS-Access has the TRANSFORM command (which does a pivot), so you could use ADO.NET to query a ms-access mdb file, then use passthrough queries there to get to the data source that can't pivot (usually MS-SQL/T-SQL). I did a proof of concept of this and it worked and was about 5000 LOC shorter than the VBScript implementation that did the pivot using arrays. The usual disparaging remarks about MS-Access don't apply here because you aren't actually storing data in MS-Access.
