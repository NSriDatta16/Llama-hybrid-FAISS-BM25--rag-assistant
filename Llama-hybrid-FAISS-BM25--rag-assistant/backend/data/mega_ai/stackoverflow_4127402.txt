You can use a technique called "auditing". You would set up audit tables. Then you would either write it into your code or setup triggers on the DB side so that every time a change is made, an entry is added into the appropriate audit table. Then you can go back through the audit table and see things like: "Oh, yesterday Sue went in and fixed a typo" "Uh oh, steve wiped out an entire paragraph by accident earlier today while trying to rewrite this section" Your primary table that stores the data doesn't keep all that data, so it can stay slim. If you ever need to look at that data and say roll stuff back, you can go look in your audit table and do that. You can setup the audit table however you want, so each audit row can have the entire content BEFORE edit, and not just what was edited. That should make "rolling back" fairly easy.
