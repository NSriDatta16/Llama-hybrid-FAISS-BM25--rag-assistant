You can retrieve the path of an isolated storage file on disk by accessing a private field of the IsolatedStorageFileStream class, by using reflection. Here's an example: // Create a file in isolated storage. IsolatedStorageFile store = IsolatedStorageFile.GetStore(IsolatedStorageScope.User | IsolatedStorageScope.Assembly, null, null); IsolatedStorageFileStream stream = new IsolatedStorageFileStream("test.txt", FileMode.Create, store); StreamWriter writer = new StreamWriter(stream); writer.WriteLine("Hello"); writer.Close(); stream.Close(); // Retrieve the actual path of the file using reflection. string path = stream.GetType().GetField("m_FullPath", BindingFlags.Instance | BindingFlags.NonPublic).GetValue(stream).ToString(); I'm not sure that's a recommended practice though. Keep in mind that the location on disk depends on the version of the operation system and that you will need to make sure your other application has the permissions to access that location.
