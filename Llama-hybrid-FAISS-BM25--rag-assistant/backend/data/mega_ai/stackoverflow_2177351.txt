haven't ever done this, but here are some thoughts: 1) find the length of the uncompressed string... strlen() function ought to work 2) compress the string... you've already done this part 3) pack both together for storage in mysql, formatting the number as mysql wants it: php's pack function : sounds like you need to use format value "V" for the length (unsigned long... 32 bit, little endian byte order)
