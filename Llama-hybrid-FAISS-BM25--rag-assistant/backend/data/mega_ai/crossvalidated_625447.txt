Reporting AIC values for model fits with multiple runs - report the min or the average?

I have a model that I fit with NLL minimization. I fit that model n times with random starting values, to try to avoid local minima. When reporting the results, it seems reasonable to me to report the lowest AIC value (since this most likely represents the best estimate of the true parameters), but a collaborator thinks that we should report the average AIC value and a summary of the variability of the AIC values. What is standard practice? (links to papers showing examples of how this is reported - very welcome!)
