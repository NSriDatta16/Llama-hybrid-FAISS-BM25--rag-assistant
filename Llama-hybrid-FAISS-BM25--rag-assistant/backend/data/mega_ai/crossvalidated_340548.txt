You haven't stated what the criteria are for assigning labels of -1, 0, or 1. Also, if you are trading on the second time scale, then the price change per bar will be quite low. If the price change is +0.01 for a bar, and the asset price is \$1 per share (\$100 per trade for 100 shares), then then your profit will be \$1 from that trade, which won't cover the \$4.95 commission. If you are trading 100 shares per second, where on Earth are you going to find a brokerage that will process your Sell trade alerts/signals for a given second and settle the trade in milliseconds, so that if the next bar (second) is a Buy, the proceeds will be available to make the purchase? Overall, for very low price changes on short time scales (seconds, ticks) you have trade thousands of shares for each alert in order to be profitable. But trading so many shares on a short time scale can result in a lack of sufficient funds very quickly since sell and cover trades won't get filled as quickly as the unit of time scale you are on. Next, if you are training a deep learning ANN with several hidden layers, which will require hundreds of iterations to determine whether to go long (Buy) or short for each second's bar, how are you going to be able to run your input through the ANNs architecture and trained connection weights to make the prediction before the next bar? Overall, there are some trading issues which could be disastrous based on what you want to do, such that trade settlements will become clogged up and insufficient funds will occur for future trades (selling shares can take many seconds).
