You can use the dot product to determine the cosine of the angle (in radians) between the current orientation and the point you want to face. Assume the agent doing the viewing is locate at the origin and oriented to face some direction given by the angle θ relative to the Y-Axis (i.e. 0 degrees is "up" or "north"). You want to find the angular difference θ' between that direction and facing a point (x, y). That is given by: θ' = cos -1 [(x*sin(θ) + y*cos(θ)) / sqrt(x 2 + y 2 )] Subtracting θ' from θ will orient the agent towards the target. If the agent is not at the origin, simply subtract the position of the agent from the object to view to bring it into the form above.
