I would personally go with a jsonp approach, that has escaped html. something like someFunc('%3Cdiv%20class%3D%22style1%22%3Esmdrager%27s%20example%20content%3C/div%3E'); then in the browser, you would have a function: function someFunc(content){ var el = document.getElementById('myDiv'); el.innerHTML = unescape(content); }
