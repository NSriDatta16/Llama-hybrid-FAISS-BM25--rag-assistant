Should I use arithmetic or geometric mean here?

So I have monthly indices (Consumer Price Indices for 12 months) for a given country. I want to calculate the annual average for each country in order to have an average Consumer Price Index for a given year, not month. Do I calculate the annual average by simply summing all 12 monthly data points (i.e. monthly indices) and divide by 12; or should I be using the geometric mean here?
