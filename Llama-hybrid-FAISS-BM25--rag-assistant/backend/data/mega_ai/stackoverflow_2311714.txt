Why shouldn't I use unix commands from php?

Why would you prefer to keep from using bash commands via exec() in php? I do not consider portability issue (I definitely will not port it to run on Windows). That's just a matter of a good way of writing scripts. On the one hand: I need to write much more lines in php then in bash to accomplish the same task. For example, when I need to filter some lines in a file, I just can't imaging using something instead of cat file | grep string > new_file . This would take much more time and effort to do in php. I do not want to analyze all situations when something might go wrong. I will just show bash command output to the user, so he would know what exactly happened. I do not need to write another wrapper around filesystem functions and use it. It is much more efficient to leverage the OS for file searching, manipulation etc. On the other hand: Calling unix command with exec() might be inefficient in most cases. It is quite expensive to spawn a separate process. Not talking about scripts running under apache, which is even much less efficient than spawning from command line scripts. Sometimes it turns out to be 'black magic-like' and perl-like scripting. Though it can be avoided via detailed comments. Maybe I'm just trying to use two different tools together when they are not supposed to. Each tool has its own application and should not be mixed together. Even though I'm sure users will not try to run script will malicious purposes, using exec() is a potential security threat. In most cases user data can be escaped with escapeshellarg() , but it is still an issue to take into account.
