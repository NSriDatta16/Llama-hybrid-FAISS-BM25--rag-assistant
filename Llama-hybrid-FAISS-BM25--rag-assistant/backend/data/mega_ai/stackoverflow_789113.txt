Using re is the best solution even if you think it's complicated. To replace all occurrences of 'abc' , 'ABC' , 'Abc' , etc., with 'Python' , say: re.sub(r'(?i)abc', 'Python', a) Example session: >>> a = 'abc asd Abc asd ABCDE XXAbCXX' >>> import re >>> re.sub(r'(?i)abc', 'Python', a) 'Python asd Python asd PythonDE XXPythonXX' >>> Note how embedding (?i) at the start of the regexp makes it case sensitive. Also note the r'...' string literal for the regexp (which in this specific case is redundant but helps as soon as your regexp has backslashes (\) in them.
