How to do sed like text replace with python?

I would like to enable all apt repositories in this file cat /etc/apt/sources.list ## Note, this file is written by cloud-init on first boot of an instance ## modifications made here will not survive a re-bundle. ## if you wish to make changes you can: ## a.) add 'apt_preserve_sources_list: true' to /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg ## or do the same in user-data ## b.) add sources in /etc/apt/sources.list.d # # See http://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes for how to upgrade to # newer versions of the distribution. deb http://us-east-1.ec2.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ maverick main deb-src http://us-east-1.ec2.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ maverick main ## Major bug fix updates produced after the final release of the ## distribution. deb http://us-east-1.ec2.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ maverick-updates main deb-src http://us-east-1.ec2.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ maverick-updates main ## N.B. software from this repository is ENTIRELY UNSUPPORTED by the Ubuntu ## team.
