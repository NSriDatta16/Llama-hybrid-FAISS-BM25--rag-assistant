Your schema seems somewhat strange to me...but anyhow.. If you want to list all the organizations in the select and have the current one be defaulted try this: The client.organization_id that is current should be selected if this is a restful edit action. See below. From the docs: http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/FormOptionsHelper.html#M002302 Example with @post.person_id => 1: select("post", "person_id", Person.all.collect {|p| [ p.name, p.id ] }, { :include_blank => true }) could become: David Sam Tobias
