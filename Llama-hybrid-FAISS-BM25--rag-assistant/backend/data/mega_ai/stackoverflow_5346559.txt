Yeah, you are using those correctly. How much data are you testing with? If the data set is too small, you might not get good test results, because there might be special case optimizations coming into play that skew the results. For your timing, you should average the time over many test runs to be sure CPU load spikes and other resource spikes are averaged out. I don't know for sure, but I would suggest trying different volumes of test data - maybe increase by factors of 10 and see if you see a linear change in performance. For example, you could test each list with 100 items, 1000, 10000, 100000, and 1000000 and see if the difference is linear and how the implementations compare. It might be interesting to test the time it takes to insert an item into the middle of the list, in addition to inserting at the beginning and end.
