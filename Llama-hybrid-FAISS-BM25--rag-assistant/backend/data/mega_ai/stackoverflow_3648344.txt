IMHO, It is a non-sense in any modern language/ide. This kind of notation is a relic of Microsoft COM coding standards. It was very common among Visual C++ developer but nowadays even Microsoft discourages the use of this kind of "Hungarian notation" habits . Using a modern IDE, if I want to know if a "class" is an "interface", I can look at the icons near the name of the "class". I do not need anymore confusing prefix before the class names. In addition, this coding convention is error prone. It requires human attention and, probably, someone that checks if some "I" was forgot.
