Hashing is for spreading as good as possible , not for uniqueness! Of course, reaching uniqueness is a reaching a 100% spreading, but that's often not possible, no matter how good your hashing algorithm. Striking example : C# for example provide an Int32 code for each object as HashCode... So also for Int64 : Int64 a = Int64.MaxValue; Int32 myHash = a.GetHashCode(); Conclusion here : there are 2^64 different possible instances of Int64, but only 2^32 hashcodes for them!! So : each hashvalue for an Int64 is shared by (average) 4 294 967 295 other Int64's! So much for uniqueness hey :-)
