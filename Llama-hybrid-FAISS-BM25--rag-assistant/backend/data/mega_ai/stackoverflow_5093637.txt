Core Data and Three20 won't have any specific implementation. They are tools that you can use to achieve the specific implementation yourself. You use Three20 to display the data you have in Core Data. I suggest you dump Three20 and learn the basics of programming a standard table view controller first. You can see the very basics of a Core Data driven table view controller by simply creating a new iPhone app in Xcode and selecting "Use Core Data for storage". The template code will point you in the right direction at least and should help you grok MVC a bit better which will help you with a Three20 implementation. Meanwhile, you should also look into using mogenerator+xmo'd . It's the only way to fly when it comes to creating custom managed objects. When in doubt, consult the master and ask specific Core Data questions here on SO.
