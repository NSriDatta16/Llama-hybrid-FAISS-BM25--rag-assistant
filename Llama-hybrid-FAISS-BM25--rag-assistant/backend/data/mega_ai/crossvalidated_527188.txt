It turns out that the "empirical FDR," the number of false discoveries / number of discoveries, is the false discovery proportion (FDP), and FDR=E(FDP), so averaging the FDP is the correct method to estimate the FDR. (The definition of FDP and that FDR=E(FDP) is in page 13 of https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~genovese/talks/hannover1-04.pdf .)
