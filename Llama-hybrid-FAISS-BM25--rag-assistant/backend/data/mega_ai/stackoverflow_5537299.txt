Configuration of a Dependeny Injection container

Hey! First post for me but long time reader of Stackoverflow. Anyway, got a tricky problem wich is getting on my nerves. It's questions about how configurable should a DIC (Dependency Injection Container) be. I'm working on a session handler for our framework we are setting up. The session handler is dependent on a storage service, some simple configuration parameters and is the one that generates a session id with a salt. Session handler is loaded by our container wich takes all the settings, either as a configurator object or an array of parameters. The container checks the setting for what storage service is called for and loads the service and injects it to the session handler. The storage service does not take any constructor settings at the moment. Session handler in it's turn generates the session id from the settings it got injected. And from there injects the session id and other settings relevant to the that storage service. My questions are: Is it proper to let the Session Handler inject settings to storage service? It's like a 2 step rocket. Should I inject the session id and other parameters from start when I load the storage service in the container? Wich in the end leaves me with the problem of generating the session ID and have to rely on the storage service to do it. What problems would arise if I did either way from above proposals? Am I breaking anything "holy" :)
