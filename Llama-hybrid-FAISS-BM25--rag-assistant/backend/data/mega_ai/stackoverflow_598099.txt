If it truly takes that long to run, you could schedule the process to run using SQL Agent, and have the output go to a table, then change the web application to read the table rather than execute the stored procedure. You'd have to decide how often to run the refresh, and deal with the requests that occur while it is being refreshed, but that can be dealt with as well by having two output files, one live and one for the latest refresh. But I would take another look at the procedure, look at the execution plan and see where it is slow, make sure it is not doing full table scans.
