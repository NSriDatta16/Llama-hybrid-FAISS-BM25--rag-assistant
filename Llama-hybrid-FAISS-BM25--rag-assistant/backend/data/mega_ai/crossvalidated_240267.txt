Matrix dimensions of the svd() output in R

From the second paragraph here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition SVD of an m x n matrix M with m columns and n rows = UDV* where U is m x m D is m x n V is n x n using some dummy data and R M =data.frame(x = seq(1,100,1), y = seq(101,200,1), z =seq(301,400,1)) dim(M) # here m=3 and n = 100 D = diag(svd(M)$d) # singular vectors percentVariance2 = svd(M)$d^2/sum(svd(M)$d^2) U = svd(M)$u # right singular vectors --eigenvectors V = svd(M)$v # left singular vectors dim(U) # 100x3 dim(D) # 3x3 dim(V) # 3x3 So when I run SVD in R on M which is m=3 and n =100 I get U is n x m D is m x m V is m x m Why are the dimensions different from the reference? Notice the original data can still be obtained using U,D and V recompose_M = U %*% D %*% t(V) head(recompose_M) head(M)
