One repository for your projects is probably sufficient. I like the typical approach that indexes the layout by project (see this section from the O'Reilly Subversion book ): /first-project/trunk /first-project/branches /first-project/tags /another-project/trunk /another-project/branches /another-project/tags /common-stuff/trunk /common-stuff/branches /common-stuff/tags Keep in mind that you can always reorganize the repository later. Also, for in-house stuff, I prefer FSFS for the data-store, as opposed to Berkeley DB. FSFS is more resilient and the speed of checkouts is not much concern for small teams/projects. You can compare and decide for yourself. Other standard parts of the recipe include Trac and a minimal Linux server to host the repository on the LAN.
