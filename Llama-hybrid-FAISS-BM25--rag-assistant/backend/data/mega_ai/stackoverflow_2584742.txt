Embedding a Bitmap in ASP.NET's WebResource

I am generating a System.Drawing.Bitmap on the fly in an ASP.NET Custom Web Server Control, and then I want to serve this bitmap as part of the WebResource, because I do not want to save it on the hosting computer. Is there a way to instruct ASP.NET to serve the generated System.Drawing.Bitmap as part of it's WebResource? (therefore making it an "Embedded Resource")
