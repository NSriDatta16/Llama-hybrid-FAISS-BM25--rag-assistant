There is a lot of confusion about ARIMAX vs. regression with ARIMA errors. Rob Hyndman's R packages use the latter. Take a look at his The ARIMAX model muddle . I can think of a number of cases where modeling regression residuals in a time series situation (i.e., regression with ARIMA errors, per above) would be problematic: Missing data. ARIMA is not happy about missing data, so you would need to impute. If a lot of data is missing (e.g., retail data with long periods where a product is simply not sold), this becomes very dubious indeed. Long seasonal periods. SARIMA has problems in this case, it may either take a long time, or fail to converge altogether. For example, retail data often exhibits yearly seasonality, so daily data has a seasonal period of 365. Short time series. If you have observed a small number of seasonal cycles, SARIMA becomes rather dubious to use. Retail data, for instance, often has short time series because of the frequent introduction of new products. multiple-seasonalities , which SARIMA can't model at all (unless you again add Fourier terms, so you are back to a regression). You could of course use specialized methods for this. Retail data, to use a random example, often exhibits both year-over-year and week-over-week seasonalities. I will let you guess what kind of time series I forecast, and whether I use regression with ARIMA errors.
