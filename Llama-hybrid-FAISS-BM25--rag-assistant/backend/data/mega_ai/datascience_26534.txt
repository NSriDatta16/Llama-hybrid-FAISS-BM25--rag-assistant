How to use a Neural Network to classify a very large number/bit string?

How would I set up a NN to classify a cryptographic key for asymmetric cryptography, or generally a VERY large number/bit string? I could split this bit string into bytes/16bit/32bit/64bit numbers to use as NN inputs, but that does not seem like a good idea, since I am not looking for relationships and patterns between the bytes or blocks. I am looking for structure in the whole key. In this exact case I want to classify an almost 20000-bit string into 2 classes. What would be the correct approach?
