Technically, there's nothing to stop you putting stuff in deploy\jboss-web.deployer\ROOT.war , and it'll be served from the root, but you're strongly discouraged from doing so. You should really package your content into a WAR and deploy that. Remember, JBossAS is a JavaEE application server first, and a web server second.
