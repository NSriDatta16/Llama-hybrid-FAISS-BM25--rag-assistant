What machine learning algorithms to use for unsupervised POS tagging?

I am interested in an unsupervised approach to training a POS-tagger. Labeling is very difficult and I would like to test a tagger for my specific domain (chats) where users typically write in lower cases etc. If it matters, the data is mostly in German. I read about about old techniques like HMM, but maybe there are newer and better ways?
