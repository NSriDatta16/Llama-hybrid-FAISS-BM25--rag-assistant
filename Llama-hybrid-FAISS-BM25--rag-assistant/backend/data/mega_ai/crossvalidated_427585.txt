Detecting change point in a time series

I'm dealing with time series from satellite imagery, where I have a sudden change (drop), that I can see from the plot, but I need a statistical test to detect it. I already checked for stationarity using Dickey-Fuller, and this test doesn't detect the change. Basically the time series has a first part with a certain average, and the second part with a lower average, and I need to detect where (when) the change occurs. The time series also have seasonality. Thanks for any pointers Edit: this is a sample of the data, that may or may not have a change point: https://pastebin.com/bVSsxVtR
