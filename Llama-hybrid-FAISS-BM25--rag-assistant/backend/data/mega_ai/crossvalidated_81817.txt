Normalization of attributes in test set for a neural network

I have built a neural network classification model and each attribute is z-normalized when building the model by the following X=(x-training set sample mean)/training set sample deviation. If I now have new instances that I want to classify, how should I normalize the row data? Doing the same transformation by using the training set sample mean and sample deviation? What is the best practices in handling this type of issue?
