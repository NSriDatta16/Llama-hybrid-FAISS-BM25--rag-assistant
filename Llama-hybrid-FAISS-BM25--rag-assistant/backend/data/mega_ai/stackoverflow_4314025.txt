doesn't this come down to two operations select and connect. you'd select some group of people or places via a number of different paths string search, time, space, or such and then you'd connect them by creating some record note that useful relations aren't just between one person and another or one place and a person or just one place and another although when storing these they can all be reduced to a->b tuples but this can be ignored if the relations you have only have one person place and time this sort of reminds me of Entity Workspace but in that case they were dealing with data collection in the domain of crime investigation so they had names addresses phone numbers dates and such as base types which in their setup were drag and drop on to cards so if you took that you could have a center file and a list of people after some filtering to add that one to this set you'd drag it from the list and like wise from the places you'd have another list to drag from commonly referenced ones might be shown in another place and this would work a bit like putting the toppings on a pizza and when your done you put it in the oven or commit it if you want to later undo this it would keep the set together so you can remove it later if you didn't want it or you can add something and this wouldn't have any of the dialogs you suggest and as such it could be called mode-less
