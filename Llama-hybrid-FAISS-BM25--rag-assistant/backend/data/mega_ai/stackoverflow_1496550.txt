JQuery Ajax request not working on iPhone device browser

We are in the process of developing an iPhone web app using extensive jquery AJAX calls to extract data from an XML web service. When developing and testing on my Mac on Safari, the calls work beautifully. Problem is, as soon as we test on the iPhone emulator, or on the actual device, we are not getting anything back from the web service. I have turned on the 'Develop' menu and changed the 'User Agent' to Mobile Safari to see if that makes a difference, but it still works on the PC side of things. I don't think it is a cross site restriction, as all the ajax calls etc. are made from the same server and port number. Is there a way we can do javascript debugging on the emulator to see where the call is failing? Thanks, Devan
