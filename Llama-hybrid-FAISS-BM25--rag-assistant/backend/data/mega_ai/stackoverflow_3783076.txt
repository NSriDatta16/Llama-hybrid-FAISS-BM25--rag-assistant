You should create 3 different versions of your texture and place them in the ldpi, mdpi and hdpi folders appropriately. You can find more on the different densities here . In order to create a background drawable, create an XML file like it is described here: http://developer.android.com/resources/articles/window-bg-speed.html The attribute android:tileMode="repeat" will do the magic stuff for you. :-)
