The output of your program is implementation-defined. A string literal has the type const char[N] (that is, it's an array). Whether or not each string literal in your program is represented by a unique array is implementation-defined . (ยง2.13.4/2) When you do the comparison, the arrays decay into pointers (to the first element), and you do a pointer comparison. If the compiler decides to store both string literals as the same array, the pointers compare true; if they each have their own storage, they compare false. To compare string's, use std::strcmp() , like this: if (std::strcmp("Maya", "Maya") == 0) // same Typically you'd use the standard string class, std::string . It defines operator== . You'd need to make one of your literals a std::string to use that operator: if (std::string("Maya") == "Maya") // same
