over the years, i began hating PHP, since i had to work a lot with it until i found good alternatives, so the first question i ask you is: does it have to be PHP? but staying with PHP i'd add the following: most people like Drupal a lot because of it's extensibility ... that's fine, but it still has some design problems ... it's is very potent and flexible and has a huge user base -> lot of plugins, big community to ask for advice etc. when it comes to Joomla, one has to say, that in the past, this has been a really a complete mess ... but in version 1.5 the whole thing was redesigned and is now very clean ... i always laughed down at joomla, but recently i had a talk with some other developer i had worked with on several occasion, who quite conviced me, that it has become a developer friendly software ... plus, it is soooooooo damn easy to administrate ... i know no other CMS that is so easy to use (and is a "real" CMS, not a forum or blogging engine) you might wanna have a look at Vanilla CMS ... very sexy, still slick and powerful ... use a CMS based on a good PHP framework ... typo3 (Flow3 (IMHO really the most funky PHP framework)), something based on symfony (can't find anything, but this should be a good start), mambo (CakePHP) or maybe something based on code igniter ... you will always need to get familiar with the framework, but a) this is always good, b) if the framework is good, the app is likely to be good and extensible, c) you yourself will have a high productivity when building extensions since the framework will do a lot for you ... finally, you might wanna have a look at opensourcecms ... always helpful ... good luck with your choice then ... ;) greetz back2dos
