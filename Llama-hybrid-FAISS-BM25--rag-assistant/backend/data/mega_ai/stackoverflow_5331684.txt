This is something that Magento does not do by default. Additionally, beware of trying to change this through cleverness, as Magento has significant validation for prices once items are added to the cart (e.g. it will try to recalibrate them to the database on every page load). It sounds like trying to restructure the flow so that you aren't trying to use the shopping cart rules might be the best bet here. Would it be possible to use some other mechanism to give discounts, like a coupon code?
