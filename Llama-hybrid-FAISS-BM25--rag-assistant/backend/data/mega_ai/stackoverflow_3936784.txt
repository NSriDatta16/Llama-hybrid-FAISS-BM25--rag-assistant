vim select paragraph -- how to redefine paragraph boundaries?

In vim, vip selects "inner paragraph" :help v_ip, however it is of limited use. vim paragraph boundary is hard coded, a paragraph is separated by 2 or more blank lines. :help paragraph Some archaic marcos like .IP, also seem to be supported as paragraph separators, but it is all hard coded. I want to specify my own paragraph separators to easily select paragraphs of text in vim. Like perl in paragraph mode using an regexp splitter. I tried setting paragraphs to be delimited by blank lines or braces: :set paragraph+={ cpoptions+={ but does NOT work as documented, braces are ignored by 'vip' selection command. The solution I want should work for all paragraphs commands like vip, vap, dip, dap, {, }.
