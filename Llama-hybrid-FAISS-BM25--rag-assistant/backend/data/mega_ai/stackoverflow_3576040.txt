j2me touch gui looking like android

i would like to remake a program i made for android in android it looks pretty nice and is very touch friendly now i need to make it for symbian what would be the best approach to achieve similar graphics and functionality i tried searching in j2me but the graphics look so very outdated :( here are some screens of the android interface http://i77.photobucket.com/albums/j74/bertyhell/krist/datacheck.png http://i77.photobucket.com/albums/j74/bertyhell/krist/datacheck1.png i just need to make sure the buttons are big enough and that scrolling can be done with hand gestures any suggestions?
