Designing Databases is a separate field of study and expertise. It cannot be condensed into one answer. Since you are interested in tutorials, look at the section on Database Design in any text book on Database Management Systems. I would recommend Database System Concepts, 5e, Abraham Silberschatz, Henry F.Korth, Sudarshan In database design, remember the following 1) You are identifying the important objects of interest in your home network. Try to avoid excessive indulgence in the processes themselves though they are important to identify the important data units that you need to capture 2) Use ER/UML modelling techniques to come up with a Data Model Diagram/design. There are many case tools that can help you in drawing this. 3) Use the principles of Database Normalization to fine tune your schema to avoid data redundancies. Redundant data leads to the following side effects: Inability to maintain consistency among redundant data, Inability to store some data in an elegant manner 3) Forward engineer your design to DDL statements for the DB of your choice. Most case tools support this. Case tools: Microsoft Visio ER Studio (very expensive) TOAD data modeller There are many open source tools too. You can try Dia. This does not support forward engineering
