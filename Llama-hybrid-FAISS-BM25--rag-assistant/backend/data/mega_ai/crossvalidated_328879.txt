In my experience, gradient clamping seems to work fine for exploding gradients: you basically set the gradient = grad_max * (unit vector along your gradient) if the |gradient|>grad_max. The ideas relating to exploding gradients in RNNs, and the solutions are described in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1211.5063.pdf (This is one of the first notable papers on the subject; I am sure there are many more). In particular see Figure 6 and the ideas underlying algorithm 1
