How do the predict() and predict_proba() for xgbClassifier() work?

I am using xgboost classifier for a binary classification problem. I used the predict() to get the class predictions (0/1) but I also used the predict_proba() method to get the class probabilities (my intention for doing so is to play around with the probability-threshold a bit). However, when I examined the false positives (and false negatives) and their corresponding predict_proba() outputs, I noticed that in many cases, even though probability for class 0 is **higher than 0.5** , the predict() outputs a class 1 (and similarly for false negatives). I am confused. I thought predict() methods utilizes a default threshold of 0.5 to put the datapoint in class 0 or 1. Here is an example: 0 1 2022-04-02 06:58 0.647819 0.352181 2023-02-10 22:12 0.717162 0.282838 2023-02-10 15:18 0.692320 0.307680 while the predict() outputted class 1 . Can someone explain this apparent discrepancy in the output (OR it could be my misunderstanding of how predict() works)? Thanks.
