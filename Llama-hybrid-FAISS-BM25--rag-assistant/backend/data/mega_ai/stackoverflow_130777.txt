The .dat and .idx files are associated with C-ISAM, or, when organized in a directory called dbase.dbs (where dbase is the name of your database), the .dat and .idx files are associated with Informix Standard Engine, aka Informix SE. SE uses C-ISAM to manage its storage. SE is rather different from (and much simpler than) Informix Dynamic Server (IDS). It is not impossible that the .dat and .idx files are associated with IDS; it is just extremely unlikely. From the information available, it sounds as though your production server is running SE. To get the data from SE to IDS, you will probably want to use DB-Export at the SE end and DB-Import at the Linux/IDS end. Certainly, that is the simplest way to do it. There are other possible solutions - C-ISAM datablade being one such - but they are more expensive and probably not warranted. There are other possible loading solutions, such as HPL (High-Performance Loader). For more information about Informix, either use the various web sites already referenced ( http://www.informix.com is a link to the Informix section of IBM's web site), or use the International Informix User Group (IIUG) web site. There are mailing lists available (which require you to belong, but membership is free) for discussing Informix in detail.
