Understanding comment about correlation

In a paper that I'm supposed to be deep reading the author's make the statement: "We performed a cross-correlation test among the four measures composing it and found an average cross-correlation of $r= 0.40$ . The strong cross-correlation scores ... justify our decision to equally weight the four socioeconomic measures." My understanding is that having features/measures that are highly correlated is not a great thing. Also if they are highly correlated wouldnt the weighting be meaningless since the measures will tend to move in sync with each other? So if you weight them equally or totally unequal, or even removed a feature you would end up with a similar response/answer. Also in this context is cross-correlation and correlation the same thing? My google search gave me the impression that cross-correlation is specific to signal related data like time-series or audio. Additional Info: The four measures are Income, Age, Education, and Rent. They weighted them equally (sum and divide by 4) to come up with a 'neighborhood index' on how affluent that neighborhood based on census data. There are two different time windows 2000 and 2015. They subtract the two neighborhood indexes to get a 'gentrification score' which is a measure of how much the neighborhood has changed socio-economically in those 15 years.
