First of all, a picture should not be taken to define if there are or no groups on your data, since no matter what projection you use (linear with PCA or manifold with tSNE), you are reducing a 64-dimensional space into a 2-dimensional space, that's a lot of information lost. Secondly, as far as I know, no theorem guarantees you can find clusters on any given X matrix, probably the opposite yes as per An Impossibility Theorem for Clustering . So to your first question, I sadly would say no. So I would give you two pieces of advice to validate if there are such groups in your data: You can try using a projection algorithm before clustering like you already have, but I recommend using UMAP instead of tSNE or PCA. Use a metric to evaluate cluster separation like inertia if you use K-Means or silhouette if using any other. This metric should be a good measure that tells you whether or not you have groups and hopefully how many (according to your metrics and caring the number of clusters) Once you have found both an algorithm and a number of clusters with good metrics, you can run a clustering profiling (analyse a central tendency measure like the average for each feature across clusters) to make some insights based on the cluster's features characteristics. Then you can plot again your 2D scatter but this time, adding the cluster id like the colour would be more insightful. Hope it helps
