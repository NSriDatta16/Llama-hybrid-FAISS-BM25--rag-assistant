The difficulty with your situation is that you do not have randomly missing data which a mixed effects can smear over. You have NO data past a certain time point for some groups. Remember what your basic model is. The group comparison is the comparison of the groups AVERAGED OVER ALL TIMES! If some groups have no values on those times AND there is a TIME effect then your comparisons of "just" groups will be tremendously biased. And your model suggests that you believe, at minimum, that there is a time effect. So you can no longer discuss "just" a group effect because the failure to have values over time in that group destroys the meaning of the group effect. You will have to model these missing design cells or you will have to partition your analyses to avoid them. Partitioning: Analyze the data up to seven days for all groups. This may achieve what you want. Modeling: You will need to include an indicator variable in the analysis and/or custom contrasts so that you analyze only meaningful contrasts.
