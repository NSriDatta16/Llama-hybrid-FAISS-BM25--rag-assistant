Why is multiple imputation not used more widely in Data Science?

I posted this question a few days ago on datascience.SE because I thought it was more relevant there: Why is multiple imputation not used more widely in Data Science? I have a background in statistics. Multiple imputation is very commonly used to handle missing data, and if it is not used it almost always results in serious criticism. Recently I have been interviewing for data scientist roles and so far none of the employers appear to use multiple imputation. A quick search for "multiple imputation" on this site resulted in only 27 matches ! Of course I understand that using MI requires more time and effort, but is that the only reason why ? For categorical data I can see the appeal of having a "missing" category, but what about numeric data? It appears that mean (or median) imputation is quite common in DS, but in statistics, this very much frowned upon since it is changing the distribution of the data often leading to bias. However I was mildly surprised to receive rather few responses and those responses were not of high quality (eg. "...bias not being as much of a problem if your main task is prediction." ). Therefore I am posting it here as I know we have a lot of great data scientists here on CV. Fingers crossed :)
