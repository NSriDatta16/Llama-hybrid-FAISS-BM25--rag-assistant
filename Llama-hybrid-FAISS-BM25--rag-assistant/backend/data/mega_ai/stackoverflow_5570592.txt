Cakephp Auth component malfunctioning

I got trouble with auth component in cakephp, on ovh host. When i log in, no session variable are set : print_r($this_session) only show : Array ( [Config] => Array ( [userAgent] => [time] => 1302122401 [timeout] => 10 ) ) The weird part of this issue, is that sometimes it works... I used to connect correctly from my house, less from my work. Here is the code i use. It really simple. One app_controller : Auth->fields = array('username' => 'name', 'password' => 'password'); $this->Auth->loginAction = array('action' => 'login'); $this->Auth->loginRedirect = array('controller' => 'discs', 'action' => 'hello'); $this->Auth->logoutRedirect = '/'; $this->Auth->loginError = 'Invalid name / password combination. Please try again'; } } ?> In user_controller : function login() { } function logout() { $this->redirect($this->Auth->logout()); } I try to modify the sessions configuration : - trying php or cake managed - trying security level from low to medium - trying to change the session cookie name - trying set checkAgent to false. Any idea ?
