Smoothing time series with Adjusted R2-weighted averages

I have two parameters (a,b) resulting from an exponential estimation of a curve. I have estimated this curve every hour for one month. In other words, I have a total of 720 parameters a and b, and I also have their adjusted R2 and their RMSE. I want to make a monthly weighted average of each parameter where I will give more weight to the parameters with a higher R2. Is there a term in econometrics that talks about this? I am trying to look for the term, but I don't know if it exists. Also, do you recommend using R2 or RMSE and why? Thanks in advance!
