I don’t think you should rely on the article “The fallacy of placing confidence in confidence intervals” as the last word on frequentist confidence intervals as the description is both limited and one-sided. Find a standard text first. Let’s be specific to your problem. There is an unknown population proportion p. Suppose I construct a standard binomial 95% confidence interval for p then we know in advance that 95% of the random samples that could be drawn will produce CIs that contain p. We also know that the CI from a particular sample is either right or wrong. For example, suppose a random sample is drawn and the observed CI is 0.22 There is an important caveat regarding such confidence claims. Confidence would be undermined if it was known that the confidence interval procedure that I was using had poor conditional properties. In such circumstances, it is better to base confidence claims on appropriate conditional probabilities rather than on the unconditional probability. As far as I know, the standard binomial CI procedure does not have any dramatic shortcomings in this regard. Regarding Bayesian credible intervals, suppose for some prior you were to generate a 95% credible interval, say 0.23 Finally, if you are considering such large sample sizes, then perhaps you should think about raising the desired confidence level.
