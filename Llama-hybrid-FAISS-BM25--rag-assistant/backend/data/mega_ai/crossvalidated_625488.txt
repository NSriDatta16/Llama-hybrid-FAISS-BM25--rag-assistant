A time-series where the average of the difference depends only on the interval

Consider a time-series: $\{X_1,X_2,\ldots,X_T\}$ . Then, we can think of the difference like $X_{t+r}-X_{t}$ , where $r$ is an integer. Here, I am wondering whether there is any time-series process that satisfies a property that the average of $X_{t+r}-X_t$ (i.e. $E[X_{t+r}-X_t]$ ) depends only on the interval $r$ . I am checking if some famous processes such as AR(1) are those kinds of processes. But, I am not sure about the answer yet.
