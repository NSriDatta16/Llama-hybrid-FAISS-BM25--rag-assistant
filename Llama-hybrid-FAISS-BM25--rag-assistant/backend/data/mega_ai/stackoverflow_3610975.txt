How to structure simple Android apps

I've run into an organizational problem with an application I am working on, on the Android platform. The application uses sensors as input and OpenGL as output. The traditional method is something like organizing the project into an MVC where I have the main activity class load an OpenGL view and a sensor handling class and will then probably register some callbacks or possibly do it on a clock. The sloppy alternative is having a single class that implements GLSurfaceView and SensorEventListener and then offload the logic into other classes. Assume very simple drawing code and somewhat complex control system code that will attempt to refresh at 60ish Hz. I am looking for performance, maintainability and easy of development implications, so any and all input is valuable. Also I am a complete novice when it comes to Android or mobile development so if you can show me the light with a third alternative that'd be great too.
