(As mentioned in the comments) the most basic assumptions for a Poisson distribution are that Events are independent. The rate of events per unit time is fixed. The variance of events per unit time is equal to the average events per unit time. Or, with mathematics: if $X \sim Po(\lambda)$ is the variable we think we are observing with our sample of $(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)$, then: $x_i$ represent the number of events counted in some fixed time, $t$ The value observed in $x_i$ has no influence on that observed in $x_j$ The $x_i$ and $x_j$ both came from $Po(\lambda)$ -- this is unfortunately circular $\hat{\mu} \approx \hat{\sigma}^2$ That is, $$ \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \approx \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \hat{\mu})^2 $$ Disregarding the last sentence -- which I cannot admit to understand -- you can rest assured that if your data satisfies points 0, 1, 2, & 4, it's probably safe to model it with a Poisson distribution. Edit: As mentioned in this answer's comments, a strict adherence to point #1 would necessitate that you "redefine" a month to be some fixed number of days (e.g. a "month" is 30 calendar days)... Edit2: It should also be stated that while point #3 is unhelpful, I can clarify it in the context of your data. #3 merely says that you believe that the process that made your data, isn't affected by the calendar month. So, if you data were counts of purchased cars, per month, #3 says that the counts you observe in, say, June and February, came from the same underlying distribution. In particular, that there are no seasonal affects. For most consumer/biological data, seasonal affects are highly non-trivial, and make month-level Poisson models fairly na√Øve. An alternative way to go could be to model event occurrence on a day-by-day basis, but at a "seasonal level". E.g. estimate 12 Poisson parameters, $\lambda$, for each month of data...
