UIView is a subclass of UIResponder , which has the following methods that might help: -touchesBegan:withEvent: , -touchesEnded:withEvent: , -touchesCancelled:withEvent: and -touchesMoved:withEvent: . The first parameter of each of those is an NSSet of UITouch objects. UITouch has a -locationInView: instance method which should yield the position of the tap in your view.
