You might be interested in Appcelerator's Titanium . It's an alternative to Adobe AIR that lets you build native mobile and desktop apps using HTML and JS (with the WebKit rendering engine, so you can take full advantage of HTML5 and CSS3). It also satisfies your two sticking points: SQLite is available for persistence storage. There are no restrictions on cross-domain requests. I used Titanium Desktop for a recent project and it was a relatively smooth development process. It's also open source so you have access to the full application at all times. Check it out and let me know if it works for you.
