If you want to create a complex vector with a strictly real spectrum, just add an imaginary component of 0.0 to every sample. Depending on your data format, this may be as easy as creating a double length memory array, zeroing it, and copying from every element of the source into every other element of the destination. If you want to convert a complex vector containing complex data (non-zero imaginary components above your required minimum noise floor) into a real vector, you will need to double your bandwidth in order to not lose information, which may or may not make sense, unless you are modulating, demodulating or filtering the signal. If you want to produce a one-sided signal with a complex spectrum from a real vector, you can use a Hilbert transform (or filter) to create an imaginary component with the same spectrum but conjugate phase (except for DC). This would probably not be both fast and accurate.
