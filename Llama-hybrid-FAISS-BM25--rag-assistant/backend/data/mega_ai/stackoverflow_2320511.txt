You can try and install WTP through the main Ganymede update site: http://download.eclipse.org/releases/ganymede/ Or you can download the latest Java EE bundle and use that instead of your current Eclipse (do NOT unpack it on top of your current Eclipse, but unpack it elsewhere, to test that second installation: it will come with WTP inside) Note: check then " How do I start Eclipse " to point to your existing workspace in order to see all your previous project in your new Eclipse installation. As mentioned in your link, XSL Tools is now part of WTP (for Eclipse 3.5 Galileo ), and that may explain why your Eclipse Ganymede (3.4) might not interpret correctly the P2 update site for WTP (P2 being the new Eclipse provisioning mechanism introduced late in the 3.4 release cycle) For Eclipse 3.5, you have an XSL Tools installation illustrated here: But Eclipse3.4 is more likely to be compatible with XSLT0.5 and you will need a separate installation, because "XSL Tools" wasn't yet part of WTP. I am not sure, however, where to find such an installation package within the Eclipse projects .
