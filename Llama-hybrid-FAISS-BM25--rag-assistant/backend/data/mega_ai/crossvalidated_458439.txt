Determining average duration between input and output (example - CoVID-19 sickness)

Let us assume there are given two sets on data, input and output of a process. For an example, daily number of infected people by CoVID-19 and daily number of resolved cases, be it death or healing. We cannot know illness duration for individual patients, only daily cumulative numbers. Assuming that illness duration is described with log-normal distribution, how would one determine its parameters?
