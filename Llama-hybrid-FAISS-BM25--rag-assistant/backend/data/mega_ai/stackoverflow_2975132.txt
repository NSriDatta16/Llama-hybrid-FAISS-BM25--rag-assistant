From the drop event documentation : This event is triggered when an accepted draggable is dropped 'over' (within the tolerance of) this droppable. In the callback, $(this) represents the droppable the draggable is dropped on. While ui.draggable represents the draggable. So: $("#dock").droppable({ drop: function(event, ui) { // do something with the dock $(this).doSomething(); // do something with the draggable item $(ui.draggable).doSomething(); } });
