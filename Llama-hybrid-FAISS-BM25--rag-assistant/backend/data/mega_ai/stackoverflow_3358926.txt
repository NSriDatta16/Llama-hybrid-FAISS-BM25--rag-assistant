I suppose you could change the inheritance of Zend_View_Helper_Placeholder_Container or Zend_View_Helper_Placeholder_Container_Abstract to supply your own implementation of ArrayObject::ksort . Something like: class CompatibilityArrayObject extends ArrayObject { public function ksort () { // here be dragons } } abstract class Zend_View_Helper_Placeholder_Container_Abstract extends CompatibilityArrayObject { ... } You don't know how many more problems there are though. If the requirement says PHP 5.2.4, that's what you should run it on.
