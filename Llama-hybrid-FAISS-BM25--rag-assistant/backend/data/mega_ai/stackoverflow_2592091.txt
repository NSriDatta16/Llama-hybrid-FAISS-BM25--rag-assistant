WCF - (504) The server did not return a response for this request

I have a JSONP WCF service,using back end as MySql.It is working properly when i run it locally with visual studio. Now we have hosted it in Windows Server 2003. Now there is very strange problem occurring.. When I do a request with fiddler which does not require much processing internally, it gives me result 200 OK with desired output as response, But when I do a request which requires some internal data processing, it gives me 504 error(gateway time out error). I also looked at C:\WINDOWS\system32\LogFiles to see if it logs any error but it shows ok result in fiddler request which is as follows: Fields: date time s-sitename s-ip cs-method cs-uri-stem cs-uri-query s-port cs-username c-ip cs(User-Agent) sc-status sc-substatus sc-win32-status 2010-04-07 10:08:06 W3SVC490896353 s-ip GET /InitialState.svc/GetInitialState reference=1&pageId=18 8080 - c-ip Fiddler 200 0 64 Can anyone please help me to resolve the problem ?? Or any ideas i can try to find out why it is happening ?? Any help will be appreciated...
