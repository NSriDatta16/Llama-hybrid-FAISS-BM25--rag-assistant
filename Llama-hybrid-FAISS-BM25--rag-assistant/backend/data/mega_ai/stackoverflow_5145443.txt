One of the quick ways I would solve it would be to use a hidden field which would be computed onclick of the Submit button. So, the total.value would eventually look like Sundae,$20;Sandwich,$10... Since hidden fields are transmitted as part of form submission, you should be able to do request.getParameterValues("total") and then unmarshall it in the Java code. For a more elegant solution, JSON should help.
