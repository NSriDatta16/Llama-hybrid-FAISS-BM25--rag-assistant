Are the RandomForest and Ranger libraries the same?

After being stuck in this question, I found another way to perform random forest. I'm trying to compare a normal random forest model (train & test/predicted) and time series data. My data have date columns, my target variable plus another predictor. I used the train() function from the ranger package for my target variable with the predictor. Based on my understanding ranger is a random forest. However, after converting my data to time series (ts) I got error when I ran train() from ranger on my time series data, but it worked when I ran the randomForest() function. Are ranger and randomForest the same? I know in my case if I applied random forest and train() from ranger I won't get the same results because one is time series and one have more variables but If I applied the same dataset to randomForest() and train() will I get the same result?
