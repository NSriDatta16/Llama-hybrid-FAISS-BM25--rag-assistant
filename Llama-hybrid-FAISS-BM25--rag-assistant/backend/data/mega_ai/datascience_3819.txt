Being able to aggregate data based on date segments is a piece of cake using Tableau software. You would simply plug your data into the tool, and then you can drag and drop both the metric and date dimensions onto a report body space. Tableau will instantaneously whip up aggregate visualizations and/or detail data tables, on the fly. You can group/sum by year, quarter, month, week, day, hour, etc. (standard, built in, out of the box functionality offered by the tool) Also, if you wanted to incorporate additional data later on (which I assume is what you meant by 'unknown properties'), you can import another data set and easily append it onto the first one, as long as it also offers dates. I would recommend checking out the free version, which I believe is called Tableau Public.
