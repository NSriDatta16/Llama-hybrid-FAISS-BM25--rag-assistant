You have several options you can use. Stripping, scrubbing HTML comes very useful also when you have to render screen scrapped web content. Your case might be simpler, as you don't "expect unexpected" content gathered from web crawls. You can use strip_tags which removes the tags from the string: strip_tags("Strip these tags!") # => Strip these tags! strip_tags(" Bold no more! See more here ...") # => Bold no more! See more here... strip_tags(" Welcome to my website! ") # => Welcome to my website! The sanitize method should escape some and remove other tags. To more about rails sanitization, go here . If you need more control check out sanitize or loofah . I prefer loofah, but sanitize might meet your tastes maybe more. Loofah is built on nokogiri, you can define fine grained rules how you want to massage the HTML or HTML fragments. Except of whitelisting, stripping you can also do scrubbing of tags: span2div = Loofah::Scrubber.new do |node| node.name = "div" if node.name == "span" end .. which changes spans to divs.
