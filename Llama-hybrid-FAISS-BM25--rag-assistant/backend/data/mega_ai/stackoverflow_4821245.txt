Buttons are the first responder and their uitouchup or other event will fire first and won't propogate to the backing view. You can subclass your buttons and have the touchesbegan/moved/ended do: [self.nextResponder touchesBegan:touches withEvent:event]; to have your backing view handle all their events for them in which case your gesture code should work.
