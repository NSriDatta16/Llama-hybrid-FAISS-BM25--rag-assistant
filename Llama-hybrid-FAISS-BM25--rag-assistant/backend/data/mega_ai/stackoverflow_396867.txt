Ã“lafur, you mentioned that "the studio makes a CMS system that is hosted on hundreds of sites." This itself may be the carrot that you need. If the team is often deploying updates to these hundreds of sites, then using branches inside a version control system may make this process much easier for everyone. That could be a huge time-saver and thus would provide an incentive for people to learn the version control system. It sounds like these sites are all related -- customized versions of the same CMS. In that case, you should put all of the sites in the same repository, in addition to the un-customized CMS product. Then you can configure them all as branches of the same central product. If you use separate repositories, there aren't easy ways to create branches to relate the customizations to the main product. (I think you can do it with Subversion, and most likely others, but it's complicated and unnecessary if all the developers work for the same organization.)
