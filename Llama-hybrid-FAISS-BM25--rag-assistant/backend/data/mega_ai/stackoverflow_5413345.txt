The original question was about finding suitable libraries, I know, but from as far as using speech recognition good enough for real dictation, there seems to be nothing out there for Linux (though I am sure it will change in time, I suspect it will take a while,as I am not sure that many people are interested). At the moment I am trying to promote Dragon NaturallySpeaking as a supported product by CodeWeavers ... so if you are interested as a user it would help if you would cast a vote ... http://www.codeweavers.com/compatibility/browse/name/?app_id=8427
