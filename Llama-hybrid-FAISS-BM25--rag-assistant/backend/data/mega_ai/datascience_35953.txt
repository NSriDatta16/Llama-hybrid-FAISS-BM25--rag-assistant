Aggregating standard deviations

Imagine I have a collection of data, let's say the travel time for a road segment. On this collection I want to calculate the mean and the standard deviation. Nothing hard so far. Now imagine that instead of having my collection of values for one road segment, I have multiple collections of values that correspond to the multiple sub segments that compose the road segment. For each of these collections, I know the average and the standard deviation. From that, I want to aggregate these multiple average and standard deviation in order to get the average and standard deviation for the whole road segment. For example, let's suppose I have the following dataset : subSegmentA , subSegmentB , subSegmentC , subSegmentD values 20 45 25 70 30 55 10 60 10 10 10 80 15 50 30 75 15 40 15 75 20 40 20 80 30 45 20 65 10 40 25 70 average 18.75 40.625 19.375 71.875 stddev 7.90569415 13.47948176 7.288689869 7.039429766 expected_global_average : 150.625 expected_global_stddev : 18.40758772 For the average there is no problem, a simple sum do the job, but I have trouble with the global_stddev. I tried multiple solutions from here , without success. Edit : After further research, it seems mathematicaly impossible to calculate the standard deviation of a set based only from the standard deviation and average of subsets. So I am trying to calculate a new metric, that would approximate this global standard deviation. To do so, I can use in addition to the avg/stddev per subsegments, the length ratio of the subsegment to the road.
