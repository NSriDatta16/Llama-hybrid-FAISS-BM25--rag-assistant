Granger Causality with or without VAR

I would like to test two stationary time series (say a and b) for Granger Causality. I am familiar with the method of running two regressions: a=const+a[-1]+e_1 a=const+a[-1]+b[-1]+e_1 And then using an F Test (I omitted the degrees of freedom): (R2f-R2r)/(1-R2r) Afterwards I do the same the other way around: b=const+b[-1]e_2 b=const+b[-1]+a[-1]+e_2 This would then tell me which of them Granger causes the other one. How is a VAR different from this (or is the set up above basically already a VAR)?
