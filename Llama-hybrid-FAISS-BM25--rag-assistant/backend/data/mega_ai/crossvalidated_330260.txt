When you have time series data such as $x_t$, it is the representation of the data in time domain $t$. You can apply Fourier transform, and bring this series into the frequency space: $$s_w=F(x_t)\equiv\int e^{iwt}x_tdt$$ The new series $s_w$ is called a spectrum, hence, this is the representation of the same data in the spectral domain. Convolution is an operator such as: $$(x*y)_t=\int x_{t+h} y_hdh$$ You can easily show that $$F((x*y)_t)=s_w F(y_t)$$ In other words instead of an expensive operation of convolution in time space (two nested loops), you get a simple multiplication in spectral space (a single loop)
