Showing that a Gamma distribution converges to a Normal distribution

Consider $G = \operatorname{Gamma}(p)$ . As $p$ goes to $\infty$ , the Gamma becomes more and more bell-shaped. How do I show that $\frac{G - p}{\sqrt{p}} \to Z \sim N(0,1)$ as $p \to \infty$ ? I started with the CDF of the Gamma and began taking the limit, but it got very messy.
