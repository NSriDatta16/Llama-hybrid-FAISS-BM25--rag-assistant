I'm with gbn on this. Typically in star schema data warehouses, the dimension IDs are int, which is 4 bytes. Not only are all your dimensions larger than that, the nvarchar are both varying and using wide characters. As far as indexing, just one clustering index may be fine since in the case of your fact table, you really don't have many facts. As gbn says, with your particular example, your index needs to be in the order of the columns which you are going to be providing so that the index can actually be used. In a real-world case of a fact table with a number of facts, your clustered index is simply for data organization - you'll probably be expecting some non-clustered indexes for specific usages. But I'm worried that your query specifies an ID parameter. Typically in a DW environment, you don't know the IDs, for selective queries, you select based on the dimensions, and the ids are meaningless surrogates: SELECT * FROM fact INNER JOIN dim1 ON fact.dim1id = dim1.id WHERE dim1.attribute = '' Have you looked at Kimball's books on dimensional modeling? I think if you are going to a star schema, you should probably be familiar with his design techniques, as well as the various pitfalls he discusses with the too many and too few dimensions.
