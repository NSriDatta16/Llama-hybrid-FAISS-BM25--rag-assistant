I think of classes as the framework, and id's as the finishing touches. Classes can be recycled over and over again, but id's are usable only once (I think most browsers let you use them multiple times though, which isn't very helpful). I mainly use classes to organize my elements: .red { color: rgb(255, 0, 0); } .underline { text-decoration: underline; } #floatRight { float: right; clear: both; padding: 30px; } #redBorder { border: 2px solid rgb(255, 0, 0); } This would be valid CSS, as expected. The cool thing is that you can use classes multiple times inside of an element, but id's are single-use: Hello! This would produce a red block of text that's underlined and floating to the right. Hello! This shouldn't make a red border, as id's are unique to a single element (JavaScript uses that to find elements). Id's are like license plates: they identify certain cars. It would be useless to let people use identical license plates for multiple cars, so id's are the same way. You use them uniquely. I'm not sure if that explains it...
