As the user above points out, this is not simply an issue of choosing a machine learning method and letting it go wild on the data. Particularly, the introduction of decision theory (even in a basic form) is vital. While the inclusion of something like "decision theory" might seem a bit complex, this really only means in your case that you are not simply estimating a quantity and figuring out if you are right; that is, not every wrong solution is "equally wrong", in the sense that you'll need to take into account your profit and your funds left in reserve. A general approach is difficult to recommend without intimate knowledge of the data. However, it sounds like you'll need to formalize the aspects of your model. Think about the following questions as you decide on your model: What is the quantity I am trying to predict? (In this case, it sounds like you are looking for the particular markup at which you should sell, and/or the price at which to buy so that a profit can be made, which is just as much optimization as it is machine learning). What examples can I use to train my model, and what are my inputs? What market factors can I train my model with to predict the quantities in (1)? As a final point, it is really quite unlikely that reinforcement learning is the approach you'll want to take in this case. Reinforcement learning is quite powerful in certain situations, but is somewhat unpredictable (depending on the particular formulation), and tends to make an awful lot of errors before it gets anything right (something that likely is not an option when there is money on the line). As I said, try to figure out which quantities you want to estimate, then figure out what market factors might affect those quantities.
