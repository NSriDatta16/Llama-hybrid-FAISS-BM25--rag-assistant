Use of term 'likely' without log regression in corporate survey data

I work in the corporate research space producing white papers from survey data. When writing up results of these investigations, our writers are inclined to use the term 'likely' when referring to differing proportions among binomials variables. Example: Group A: 28.6%, Group B: 22.4% "Group A is more likely to engage in XYZ than group B." Now, without having conducting logistic regression on the actually likelihood of the event arising under either condition I tend to be quick to stifle this terminology in favor of more context-appropriate wording. Am I being over-sensitive to their creative license given that this isn't an academic paper, or is this appropriate?
