Neural network for predicting a non-linear function

I want to build a neural network to predict $f(x)=\exp(-x)$ for every $x$ in the interval $(0, 5)$ . I randomly generated the training set uniformly in the given interval with 500K training examples, then we generate the target exactly with $f$ . Which model would be best suited for this simple task? I understand this is not generally the best use case for Neural Nets. I have tried a bunch of networks and they do alright. I want to get extremely precise accuracy. Any tips or words of advice?
