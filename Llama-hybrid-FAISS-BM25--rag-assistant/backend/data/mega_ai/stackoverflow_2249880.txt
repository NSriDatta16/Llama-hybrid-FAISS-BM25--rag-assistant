Can Indy run Javascript?

There is a software product called AnyChart which is great for embedding Flashed based charts in web pages. AnyCharts can also export to PNG file format. Here is an example: // My ultimate goal is to make a automated service to export the AnyChart charts to PNG format. So I made a service with Indy which calls pages containing the AnyChart javascript. But the problem seems to be that Indy cannot execute the javascript. Is there a way to enable Indy to execute javascript?
