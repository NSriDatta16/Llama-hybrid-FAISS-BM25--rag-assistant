I think there are a number of methods that suit what you're looking for - some options are: 1. kernel smoothing 2. spline smoothing 3. moving average There are many more, but I think those three are good candidates. Here is a very nice visual explanation of several smoothing techniques. The problem is that technically, between $t_a$ and $t_b$, the temperature could take on any value on your measurement scale. Fortunately, since we can probably assume at least moderate time-dependence, the temp at $t_b$ should at be at least partially related to the temp at $t_a$. Choosing a good smoothing method and parameters depends on how strong you think the time dependent effects are, how smooth you want your smoothing function to be, how variable you think think the temp is during the unobserved period. Hope that helps!
