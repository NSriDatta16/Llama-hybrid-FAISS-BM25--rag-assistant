Don't expect miracles, but the random forest may have better error rate than just one decision tree. If your cross-validated error rate is, say, 40%, and you want to decrease it to, say, 25%, it may do the trick. Also, k nearest neighbours, with properly scaled features (that is, how much one feature is scaled versus the other) may be good for your problem.
