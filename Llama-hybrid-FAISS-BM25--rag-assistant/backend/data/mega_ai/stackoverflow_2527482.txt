CMS common Architecture

I know this is a weird question to ask, but I would like to know if there is any documentation/blog-article out there that explains the architecture of a Website content management system? More particularly, I am interested to learn more about how "widgets" are implemented. I can't remember which system it was that I've seen tis one, but in the "Page Layout view" it had the ability to allow the end user to select a widget (thumbnail gallery, contact form, etc) from a list, and drag and drop it onto custom areas of the page. I know that this is not directly a programming question, but please could I seek advice/feedback on this. Thanks!
