Missing data in a logistic regression analysis

I am performing a logistic regression analysis with all my data dichotomized (0/1). My problem is that I have a lot of missing data and the analysis eliminates participants listwise (i.e., eliminates a participant even if they have only 1 missing at any variable). I do not want to impute the missing data but I am wondering if the analysis could be run for different number of participants per variable. For instance, gender and bullying has 500 complete cases but nationality has 450 complete cases and 50 missing. If bullying is my dependent variable, gender comparisons would include 500 participants but nationality would include 450. What do you think?
