Well I think there are a couple things that need to be fixed. For one It does not appear that the FSOut is ever actually used now that you have changed the FSOut to FSIn. You seem to be using one or the other but from the structure of the code I would think your intent was to take a file In and encrypt or decrypt the data to another file. Consider starting from scratch on this one using http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.security.cryptography.rijndael.aspx as a jumping off point and if your intent is for it to read from one file and write to another modify it as you see fit or consider having a helper method that creates a copy of the file in memory, encrypts the file, moves it and replaces the in memory file to the starting location, doing it this way allows u to leverage this code for either case and doesn't really incur much extra overhead.
