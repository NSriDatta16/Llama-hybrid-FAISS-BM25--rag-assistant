Javascript only works in Safari with alert

I am a newbie to javascript and am having trouble getting my script to work in Safari. I have done numerous google searches to find a solution, but haven't found anything that worked. I have an HTML page that uses javascript to load an swf and a caption from two separate arrays. There is a next button that will load another SWF and a new caption upon being clicked. It works perfectly in IE and Firefox, but in Safari the new SWF does not display. In the Safari debugger it shows the correct new SWF file name, but displays the original SWF on screen. The only way I have gotten it to work is if I have an alert after the code. I have tried adjusting the order of events in my function, but that has not solved anything. Any ideas? (I apologize if I've provided too much code, I just want to give you the full picture.) Javascript (located in the header): var swfFrame=new Array(); swfFrame[0]='frame_01.swf'; swfFrame[1]='frame_02.swf'; swfFrame[2]='frame_03.swf'; var paragraphTxt=new Array(); paragraphTxt[0]='caption 1'; paragraphTxt[1]='caption 2'; paragraphTxt[2]='caption 3'; function nextFrame(x){ i = i+x; if(i>=swfFrame.length){ i=i-1; window.open('quiz.html'); }else{ document.getElementById("framenum").innerHTML = (i+1) + " of " + swfFrame.length; document.getElementById("paragraph").innerHTML = paragraphTxt[i]; // IE document.getElementById("flashPlayer").movie = "swf/" + swfFrame[i]; // FIREFOX et al --> document.getElementById("flashPlayer").data = "swf/" + swfFrame[i]; // ALERT (doesn't work in Safari if alert is off) alert(document.getElementById("flashPlayer").data); } if(i>0){ document.getElementById("button_Bck").style.visibility = "visible"; }else{ hideBack(); } } function hideBack(){ document.getElementById("button_Bck").style.visibility = "hidden"; } Code for button used to advance to the next swf: Next
