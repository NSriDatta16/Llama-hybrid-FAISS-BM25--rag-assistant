Is it normal size for MongoDB?

I just import my Mysql database (size 2,8 Mio) in my new Mongo database with very simple php script i build, import was ok without error but when i look my Mongo database (with RockMongo) i can see this : Data Size 8.01m, Storage Size 13.7m. MongoDB is bigger than Mysql for the same amount of data, is this normal ? Thanks for your help and sorry for my english.
