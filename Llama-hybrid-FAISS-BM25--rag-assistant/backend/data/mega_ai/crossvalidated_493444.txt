The marginal effect of $X$ for a unit $i$ is the change in the probability of the event if you were to change $X$ by a very small amount from its value for unit $i$ while keeping all other covariates that the same value for unit $i$ . That is, it's the change in probability if you were to change $X$ by a very small amount but not change anything else (measured) about that unit. The average marginal effect of $X$ is the average of the marginal effects of $X$ across all units in the sample. It's not the marginal effect at the mean , which is what you would get if you were to plug in the means of all the covariates into the logit function to calculate $p(y=1|X=\bar x)$ , as you suggested. You need to calculate $p(y_i=1|X=x_i)$ and $p(y_i=0|X=x_i) = 1- p(y_i=1|X=x_i)$ for every unit $i$ in your sample, then compute the average of $p(y_i=1|X=x_i)\times p(y_i=0|X=x_i)$ across all units, and multiply that average by $\beta$ . This is the average marginal effect of the (continuous) predictor with coefficient $\beta$ (note the procedure is different for binary predictors). In a formula, this would be: $$ \beta \frac{1}{N} \sum^N_{i=1} p(y_i=1|X=x_i) \times p(y_i=0|X=x_i) $$ To do this manually, one unit at a time, compute their $p(y_i=1|X=x_i)$ and $p(y_i=0|X=x_i)$ by plugging in their values of $X$ (i.e., the covariates, including the focal covariate, e.g., education) into the logistic equation with the estimated coefficients. Do this for all units. Then take the average of $p(y_i=1|X=x_i) \times p(y_i=0|X=x_i)$ and multiply that average by the coefficient $\beta$ for the focal covariate. You can get the average marginal effect for other continuous covariates simply by substituting the corresponding $\beta$ .
