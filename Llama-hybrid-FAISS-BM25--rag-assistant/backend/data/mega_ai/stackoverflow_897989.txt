Using Fiddler to check IIS Compression

How do I see if IIS Compression is working using Fiddler ? I have a page that, when viewed through Port80Software or GID Network's tool it appears to be coming across compressed. However, when I watch the call in Fiddler, I see the 'Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate' in the request header, but I don't see the 'Content-Encoding: gzip' or 'deflate' in the response header. Also, in the Transformer section, 'No Compression' is selected. Thanks! Chris
