Normally distributed values range from $-\infty$ to $\infty$, so you obviously want to generate values from truncated normal distribution . This could be achieved using a number of different methods, e.g. simulating values from normal distribution and dropping those that fall out of the range, inverse transform, using uniformly distributed variable $U$ $ x = \Phi^{-1}( \Phi(\alpha) + U \times (\Phi(\beta)-\Phi(\alpha)))\sigma + \mu $, using specialized algorithms as e.g. the one described by Robert (1995). If you choose such $\sigma$ that makes $98\%$ of normally distributed values fall into $(\alpha, \beta)$ interval (i.e. $\mu \pm 2.33\sigma$), then since your data would come from truncated normal distribution, this would obviously lead to situation where $100\%$ of generated values fall into the prespecified range.
