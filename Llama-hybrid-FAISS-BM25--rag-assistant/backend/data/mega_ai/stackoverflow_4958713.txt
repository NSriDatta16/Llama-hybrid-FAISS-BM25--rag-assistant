I used jquery with great results. This is the official link with a couple of great examples http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/ You should find everything you need there EDIT Download the jquery ui and include the following files in your project and this code in the page //These include tags have to be in this exact order because the lower one depend on the first ones $(document).ready(function() { dragAndDrop(); Sys.WebForms.PageRequestManager.getInstance().add_endRequest(dragAndDrop); //this makes the javascript method execute after an ajax action on the page }); function dragAndDrop() { $( ".draggable" ).draggable(); } Now simply add a class to your pannel like this If everything is done correctly it should work
