Correlation between different types of variables

I am running a logistic regression on a data set containing Continuous, Ordinal, Categorical and Dichotomic variables. I would like to know how to calculate the correlation for all possible combinations (see matrix below - cases marked with an X do not occur in my data set) in order to check for colinearity. I can do this either with SAS or R. Continuous Ordinal Categorical Dichotomic Continuous X 1 2 3 Ordinal 5 6 7 Categorical 8 9 Dichotomic X Case 8 I use proc freq data=data chisq ; to return Cramer's V. As for the rest I am unsure - is it possible for cases 3, 7 and 9 to consider a dichotomic variable as categorical in two classes in order to compute Cramer's V?
