Pattern Clustering

I have data of daily time spent in studying for around 2000 students. I need to make clusters based on the pattern of hour spent in a week, not by average hour spent.For example some students are studying for 5 hours a day during weekdays & in weekend it is 7 hours,for some students 2 hours in weekdays & weekend it is 4 hours & for some students 0 hour in weekend & 6-8 hours in weekdays.I want to cluster these patterns along with some other macro economic variables. Can you please suggest me the logic for pattern clustering or link to read about pattern clustering? Thanks in advance
