HTML ist just a markup language to describe the meaning of (textual) contents. For example, Foobar just means Foobar is a first level heading but doesn’t tell anything about the style it should to be displayed. For styling a HTML document the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) has been introduced. But CSS is also just a describtive language and doesn’t know anything about the user agent . (You could just describe that specific elements should be displayed with a specific width and so on.) But JavaScript does know the user agent. You could use the screen object to obtain the width and height of the screen or the available viewport .
