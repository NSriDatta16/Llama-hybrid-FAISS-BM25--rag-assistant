Using short tags should be avoided when developing applications or libraries that are meant for redistribution, or deployment on PHP servers which are not under your control, because short tags may not be supported on the target server. For portable, redistributable code, be sure not to use short tags. And also note that if you are embedding PHP within XML or XHTML you will need to use the tags to remain compliant with standards.
