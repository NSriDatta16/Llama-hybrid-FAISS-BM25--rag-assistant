Download the index file If it's really huge, it may be worth reading a chunk at a time; otherwise it's probably easier to just grab the whole thing into memory. Extract the list of files to get If the list is xml or html, use a proper parser; else if there is much string processing to do, use regex; else use simple string methods. Again, you can parse it all-at-once or incrementally. Incrementally is somewhat more efficient and elegant, but unless you are processing multiple tens of thousands of lines it's probably not critical. For each file, download it and save it to a file. If you want to try to speed things up, you could try running multiple download threads; another (significantly faster) approach might be to delegate the work to a dedicated downloader program like Aria2 http://aria2.sourceforge.net/ - note that Aria2 can be run as a service and controlled via XMLRPC, see http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/aria2/wiki/XmlrpcInterface#InteractWitharia2UsingPython
