After i 've set a virtual host in httpd.conf, why i still have to set the virtual host in domain registration organization? These are two separate tasks because they touch entirely different areas. DNS records tell the world that domain A is now reachable on IP address B (Imperfect real world analogy: an entry in the phone book) The VirtualHost directive tells the server software running on the server how to deal with incoming requests to that domain. (Imperfect real world analogy: Your name on the doorbell of a large house, and on your mail box in the hallway of the house.)
