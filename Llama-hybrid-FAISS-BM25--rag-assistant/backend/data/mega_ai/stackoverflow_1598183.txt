First, you need to separate the issue of data storage vs. handling as a hyperlink. The hyperlink data type in Access is actually a memo field with the hyperlink embedded in it in a particular format, precisely because the largest text field Access/Jet/ACE can handle is 255 characters, so you need a memo field to handle even reasonable URLs. I don't know exactly what format you end up with via an SSMA import operation. I would prefer plain old text because you don't need a hyperlink field in order to use the FollowHyperlink method to open the target file. I'd suggest you start by checking the help file for "hyperlinks." I think you'd want to start with "About hyperlinks," particularly the sections on PARTS OF A HYPERLINK ADDRESS and EXAMPLES OF HYPERLINK ADDRESSES. You should then check the help for the FollowHyperlink method. Together this should give you enough information to figure out how to handle them. But I am assuming a non-complex storage in your back end, i.e., plain text, or something that Access can easily parse into plain text.
