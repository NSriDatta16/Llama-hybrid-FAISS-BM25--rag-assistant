Explicit form of L2 regularization in sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegressionCV

I am using LogisticRegressionCV of sklearn, and I would like to know the explicit form of the L2 regularization in Logistic Regression. In the official page of LogisticRegressionCV , it is written $Cs$ is "inverse of regularization strength", but it is not clear what is the explicit form of the regularization term. In the lecture note of Ridge regression , the first equation in 5.3, it is written the regularization term of Ridge regression is $-\frac{1}{2}\lambda \bf{\beta}^T \bf{\beta}$ , but I am not sure how this $\lambda$ is related to the $Cs$ above. Could anyone help me on this question? (I also posted the same question in Stack Overflow ) Additional Clarification: I was noted that this question is similar to this , but I am not sure what is the explicit relationship between $Cs$ and $\lambda$ . Is $Cs=\frac{1}{\lambda}$ , $Cs=\frac{1}{\frac{1}{2}\lambda}$ , or else?
