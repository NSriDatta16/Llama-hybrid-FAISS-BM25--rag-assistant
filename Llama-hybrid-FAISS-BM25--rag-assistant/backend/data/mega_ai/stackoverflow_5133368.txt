I might've missed a memo, but I think you need to decorate your model classes with DataContractAttribute and your properties with DataMemberAttribute, like so: [DataContract( Namespace = "http://example.com" )] public class Ticket { [DataMember] public Agent TicketAgent { get; set; } [DataMember] public Client Owner { get; set; } [DataMember] public PendingReason TicketPendingReason { get; set; } } This is why you probably want to set up a DTO layer, to avoid polluting your model classes. As for ExtensionData, it's used for forward-compatibility: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms731083.aspx
