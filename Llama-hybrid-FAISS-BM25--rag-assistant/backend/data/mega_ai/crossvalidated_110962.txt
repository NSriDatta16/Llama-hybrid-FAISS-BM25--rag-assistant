I've read Dynamic Linear Models with R (good book), the final chapter deals with sequential Monte Carlo / particle filtering. It also includes some R code; however, in the concluding remarks of chapter 5 they explicitly warn that SMC becomes increasingly unreliable as additional time passes because the errors accumulate. Thus, they recommend "refreshing" the particle filter with the posterior distribution from a full MCMC sample every $T$ periods. Perhaps I misread their warnings, but this would seem to imply that you are better off with the rolling window MCMC. However, I would think there are substantial computer processing constraints with that method. For example, assuming you had 1,000 different univariate time series with 50 observations each and it took you 10 minutes to run a full MCMC Gibbs sampler. Then, it would take you 340 days ($(1000 \times (50-1) \times 10) \div 60 \div 24$) of continuous processing to estimate the parameters without look-ahead bias. Maybe my estimate of the time it takes to run the MCMC is wildly off, but I think it's a conservative but reasonable estimate. It's been several years since you asked the question, so I'd be curious if you yourself have an answer now.
