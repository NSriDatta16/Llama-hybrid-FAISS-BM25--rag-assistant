I am trying to create a substr method with a pointer.... is there a more elegant solution?

Here's the deal. I am doing some string manipulation and I am using the substr method often. However, the way I need to use it, is more like a php fread method. Whereas, my substr needs to be guided by a pointer. The process needs to act like this: var string='Loremipsumdolorsitamet,consectetur' and if I read in, 'Lorem'.....as my first substr call as such: string.substr(offset,strLenth)//0,5 then my next substr call should automatically start with an offset starting at this position in my string: offset pointer starts here now=>ipsumdolorsitamet,consectetur' If you haven't noticed, the offset needs to know, to start at the sixth position in the string. Soooo... I came up with this working solution, and I want to know if it is a good solution or if anyone has any recommendations to add to it?: var _offSetPointer=0 var _substrTest={ _offset:function(){return _offSetPointer+=getLength} }; //usage, where p is the length in bytes of the substring you want to capture. string.substr(_substrTest._offset(getLength=p),p)
