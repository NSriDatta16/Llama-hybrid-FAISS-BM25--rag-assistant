Let's assume we've centered the data at zero. For any point $x$ in $p$ dimensions you can write the squared distance to zero, $\|x-0\|_2^2$ , as the squared distance in the projected two dimensions plus the (residual) squared distance at right angles to the page. That's Pythagoras' theorem. Averaging over all the points, the mean squared distance to the points in the original $p$ -dimensional space (which is fixed at whatever it is) is the sum of the mean squared distance in the two-dimensional projection and the mean squared residual error of the projection. Since the sum is fixed, when you minimise the second of these, you maximise the first.
