Drag and drop between ListBox items and Grid cells in WPF?

There is a list box with some items in it. Also there is a grid with 3x3 matrix. The user will be dragging an item and dropping on one the cells of grid. Most of the samples I found are about dragging-dropping from one listbox to another listbox. But I want to drop in one cell of grid. How can I achieve this? Please advise. thanks PJ
