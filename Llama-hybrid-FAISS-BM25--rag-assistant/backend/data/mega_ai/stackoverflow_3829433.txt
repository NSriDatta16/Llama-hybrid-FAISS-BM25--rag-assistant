The AJAX call is asynchronous, which means that the call returns immediately, and the callback function is called when the data arrives. As your GetMetaData method has already finished, the value that the callback returns is ignored. You could make the call synchonous, but you should avoid that if possible, as it freezes the browser until the response arrives. The usual way is to use a callback function. Add a callback to the method: var stats = { GetMetaData : function(callback) { var url = 'http://www.bungie.net/api/reach/reachapijson.svc/game/metadata/'+storage.get('apikey'); $.ajax({ url: url, success: callback }); } } Call it using: stats.GetMetaData(function(data){ // do something with the data });
