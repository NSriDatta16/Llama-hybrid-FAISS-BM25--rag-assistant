I read this question and Dr. Bolker's answer, and tried to replicate the data (not caring much, frankly, about what "length" represents in biological terms or units, and then fit the model as above. I'm posting the results here to share and seek feedback as to the probable presence of misunderstandings. The code I used to generate this fictional data can be found here , and the data set has the inner structure of the OP: site tree treatment organ sample tissue length 1 L LT01 T root 1 phloem 108.21230 2 L LT01 T root 1 xylem 138.54267 3 L LT01 T root 2 phloem 68.88804 4 L LT01 T root 2 xylem 107.91239 5 L LT01 T root 3 phloem 96.78523 6 L LT01 T root 3 xylem 88.93194 7 L LT01 T stem 1 phloem 101.84103 8 L LT01 T stem 1 xylem 118.30319 The structure is as follows: 'data.frame': 360 obs. of 7 variables: $ site : Factor w/ 2 levels "L","R": 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... $ tree : Factor w/ 30 levels "LT01","LT02",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... $ treatment: Factor w/ 2 levels "C","T": 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 ... $ organ : Factor w/ 2 levels "root","stem": 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 ... $ sample : num 1 1 2 2 3 3 1 1 2 2 ... $ tissue : Factor w/ 2 levels "phloem","xylem": 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 ... $ length : num 108.2 138.5 68.9 107.9 96.8 ... The data set was "rigged" (feedback here would be welcome) as follows: For treatment , there is a fixed effect with two distinct intercepts for treatment versus controls ( 100 versus 70 ), and no random effects. I set the values for tissue with prominent fixed effects with very different intercepts for phloem versus xylem ( 3 versus 6 ), and random effects with a sd = 3 . For organ there are two random intercept "contributions" from a $N(0,3)$ (i.e. sd = 3 ) with a fixed effect contribution to the intercept of 6 for both root and stem . For tree we just have random effects with a sd = 7 . For sample I tried to set up only random effects with sd = 5 . For for site also just random eff's with sd = 3 . There were no slopes set up, due to the categorical nature of the variables. The results of the mixed effects model: fit were: Random effects: Groups Name Variance Std.Dev. sample:(organ:tree) (Intercept) 9.534e-14 3.088e-07 organ:tree (Intercept) 0.000e+00 0.000e+00 tree (Intercept) 4.939e+01 7.027e+00 Residual 3.603e+02 1.898e+01 Number of obs: 360, groups: sample:(organ:tree), 180; organ:tree, 60; tree, 30 Fixed effects: Estimate Std. Error df t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 79.8623 2.7011 52.5000 29.567 How did it work out: For treatment the intercept without treatment was 79.8623 (I set up a mean of 70 ), and with treatment it was 79.8623 + 21.4368 = 101.2991 (we set up a mean of 100 . For tissue there was a 3.1820 contribution to the intercept courtesy of xylem , and I had set up a difference between phloem and xylem of 3 . The random effects were not part of the model. For organ , samples from the stem increased the intercept by 0.1856 - I had set up no difference in fixed effects between stem and root . The standard deviation of what I wanted to act as random effects was not reflected. The tree random effects with a sd of 7 surfaced nicely as 7.027 . As for sample , the initial sd of 5 was underemphasized as 3.088 . site was not part of the model. So, overall, it seems as though the model matches the structure of the data.
