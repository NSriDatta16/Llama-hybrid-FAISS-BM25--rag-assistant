In cluster analysis, can you use Gower's coefficient of similarity with a k-means clustering method?

I am researching cluster analysis, and I am interested in variables that are both categorical and continuous, for which I have read that a Gower's similarity coefficient is a good proximity measure. I have read that Gower's similarity coefficient is generally not compatible with Ward's method, so I was planning to initially cluster using average linkage, but I was also seeking to compare the cluster structure (for content validity purposes) with another clustering method, specifically the k-means method, using the number of clusters and initial centers obtained in the average linkage method. Is Gower's coefficient of similarity a compatible proximity measure for k-means method?
