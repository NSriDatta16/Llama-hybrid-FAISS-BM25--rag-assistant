ARIMA with increasing variance

my time series data looks like that: I would like to use ARIMA model to forecast next steps in time series. Unfortunately because of increasing variance data is non-stationary. Is there any way to transform my data to get rid of this variance? In addition before training I normalised data. Is normalisation required by ARIMA model?
