I think I understand your question now, and the following should be closer to what you are after. To start, I will use the example from your comment. Assume we have a set of machines that measure blood pressure, where a measurement from machine $k$ is given by $$M_k[x] = a_kx + b_k + \sigma_k\epsilon$$ where $x$ is the (unknown) blood pressure, $(a_k,b_k,\sigma_k)$ are machine-dependent constants, and $\epsilon$ is "noise". For simplicity, I will ignore finite-sample effects. The standard "regression" assumptions are then $$\langle\epsilon\rangle=0, \sigma_{x,\epsilon}=0, \sigma_{\epsilon_i\epsilon_j}=\delta_{i,j}$$ where angle brackets denote an average and $\sigma$'s are covariances. Then we have $$R_k = \frac{a_k^2\sigma_x^2}{a_k^2\sigma_x^2+\sigma_k^2}$$ and $$R_{ij}^2 = \frac{a_i^2a_j^2\sigma_x^4}{(a_i^2\sigma_x^2+\sigma_i^2)(a_j^2\sigma_x^2+\sigma_j^2)} = R_iR_j$$ Now if we have three machines $M_1,M_2,M_3$, and $R_{ij}^4 = R_i^2R_j^2$ for any pair of them, this implies $$R_k^4 = \frac{R_{ik}^4R_{jk}^4}{R_{ij}^4}$$ for any distinct $i,j,k$. So expanding out, and using symmetry of $R_{ij}$, the answer is then $$R_1^4 = \frac{R_{12}^4R_{13}^4}{R_{23}^4}, R_2^4 = \frac{R_{12}^4R_{23}^4}{R_{13}^4}, R_3^4 = \frac{R_{13}^4R_{23}^4}{R_{12}^4}$$ I checked this out numerically for finite samples, and it seems to hold reasonably (i.e. small error for large sample sizes). Hope this helps!
