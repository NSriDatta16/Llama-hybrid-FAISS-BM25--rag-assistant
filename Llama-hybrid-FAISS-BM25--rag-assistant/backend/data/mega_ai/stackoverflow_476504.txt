AKU's answer should help you out: .NET namespaces He links to Microsoft's guidelines: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/893ke618(VS.71).aspx You should consider reading the the rest of the guidelines starting here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/czefa0ke(VS.71).aspx The remainder of the post is also very informative: .NET namespaces In your case you would go with: CompanyName.ProductName CompanyName.ProductName.ClassName CompanyName.ClassName.IsUpperCase(string str) The .NET guidelines don't follow the Java style of using reversed FQ domain names to specify namespaces, and I've yet to see a commercial component such as Telerik or Infragistics for example follow anything other the guidelines than the MS ones.
