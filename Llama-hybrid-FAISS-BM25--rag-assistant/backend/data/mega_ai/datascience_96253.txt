Video has two information i.e. Images(Frames) and a temporal sense(moving Frame). To identify an object in each frame, treating each frame as separate image will work. To read the temporal sense of the video i.e. Running or Skipping , will need to treat the video as Sequence of images and work accordingly. This topic is pretty well covered in the online course of " University of Michigan " Course Link Check lecture 17,18.
