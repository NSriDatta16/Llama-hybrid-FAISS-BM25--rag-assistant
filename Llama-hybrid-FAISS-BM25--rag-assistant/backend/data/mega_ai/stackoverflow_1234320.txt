The Best Way To Represent key/value Pairs In HTML Class Names

I am binding things to HTML objects using javascript and need a slightly more sophisticated mechanism than just class names. My first approach was to use class names like structure declarations where the binding is on name position as so: Definition = identifier: foo bar baz Encoding some class name with this definition gives This can then be read as: {foo: bish, bar: bash, baz: bosh}; {foo: heebie, bar: jeebie} Note that the bindings have different numbers of parameters. This is very fragile. I can't decorate any html elements with additional names (for instance to add jquery behaviours like drag and drop, etc, etc) and is generally a bit shoddy... What I would like to do is represent them as key value pairs like so: Which allows me to have random positioning and random length of class names on elements provided my id is a sorta GUID (but I can 'make that so' manually easily enough...) Now, in theory , classnames are CDATA, so everything should be tickety-boo, but I hae ma doots! particularly on the old cross-browser side... Advice, suggestions, prior art, best practice on the best syntax for KV pairs in class names all gratefully received.
