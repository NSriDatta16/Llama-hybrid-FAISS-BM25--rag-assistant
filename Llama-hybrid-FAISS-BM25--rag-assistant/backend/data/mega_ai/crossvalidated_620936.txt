Data are never "drawn from a distribution." Real data are outcomes from measurements, and hence ontological. Probability distributions come from models; they exist only in our heads, hence epistemological. We can adopt one as a working hypothesis, but we are never certain whether they are true. There are no random variables in Bayesian theory, only probability distributions. However, when you adopt a probability distribution, of course, you can draw random samples from it, and analyze them as if they were data. But beware that these are not real data. Real data are different; they hide unexpected quirks. Bishop's PRML is an excellent book for learning a lot of Bayesian methods. However, in Chapter 1, Bishop adopts a frequentist approach, which does a disservice to the remainder of his book.
