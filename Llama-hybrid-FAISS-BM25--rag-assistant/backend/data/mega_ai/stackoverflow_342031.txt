.Net SQL Server Database Monitoring - Insert, Update, Delete

Does anyone know of a way to monitor table record changes in a SQL Server (2005 or 2008) database from a .Net application? It needs to be able to support multiple clients at a time. Each client will "subscribe" when it starts, and "unsubscribe" when it exits. Multiple users could be accessing the system at once and I want to reflect their changes on the other users client. Then when the client handles the change event, it could update it's local object representing that record. Kind of similar to how Access updates records that are modified are reflected in each form referencing it. I know microsoft has their Microsoft.SqlServer libraries for interacting with a SQL Server. But I'm not sure which concept applies to what I want to do (or what could be bent to apply to what I want to do). The ones that sound like they might be useful are the Management ones or the Replication one. In anticipation of someone asking, "why don't you just requery the table occasionally to look for new information?" I have a large number of tables that I want to monitor and that would be a pain in the butt. Plus if I'm looking for something a bit more elegant. I'm open to suggestions...
