Comment about nitpicks corner: If you're really concerned with absolute performance, putting a break in and removing the "&& !found" will give you theoretically better performance on #1. Two less binary ops to worry about every iteration. If you wanted to get really anal about optimization without using breaks then boolean notFound = true; for(int i = 0; notFound && i will run faster in the average case than the existing option #1. And of course it's personal preference, but I prefer to never put any extra evaluations inside the head of a for loop. I find it can cause confusion while reading code, because it's easy to miss. If I can't get the desired behavior using break/continues I will use a while or do/while loop instead.
