Including many images in iPhone application without slowing down xcode

I have an application where I query a database and load a large number of small images. Currently, I add images as a resource in my iPhone project in xcode (by dragging it into the resources folder under the appropriate group). However, I am attempting to now add feature which adds an additional 8000 images to the project. After adding these images, I notice that interface builder become extremely slow to load the image previews. It results in IB being extremely unresponsive, using a lot of CPU. If I disable syncing with xcode it doesn't load the image previews at all. Is there any way to include and reference these images in an efficient way that won't slow down the UI. I'd like for my UI not to slow down based on the number of images in my project.
