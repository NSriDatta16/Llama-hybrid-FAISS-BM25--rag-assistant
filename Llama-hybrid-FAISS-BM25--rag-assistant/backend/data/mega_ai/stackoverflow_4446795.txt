Yeah, its not easy. But if you work with it (Eclipse that is) long enough and you'll figure out the tricks to make things work well. With complex screens the biggest problem is that they tend not to scale up/down as well as simpler screens. So you may end up designing the screen a few different ways to support multiple screen sizes. Interestingly enough, for iPhone screen design, the layout part is extremely easy due to the fact that absolute positioning is used, so you just drag stuff exactly where you want it. So for complex Android screens maybe use absolute layout. Most people will tell you this is a bad approach, and I've never used it myself, but who knows. Just keep in mind they myriad of screen sizes that your app will be shown on.
