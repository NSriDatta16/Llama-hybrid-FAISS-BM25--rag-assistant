Time series analysis refers to any analysis performed on a time series dataset (as opposed to on cross-sections, panels, and pooled cross sections). These analyses can be univariate (one time series) or multivariate (many time series). Econometrics is the statistical analysis performed by economists, who - given the nature of the discipline - are interested in both causal and predictive applications. Econometrics analysis of time series data is both econometrics and time series analysis. Time series analysis is very different from cross-sectional analysis and more challenging mainly because the independence assumption commonly made in cross-sections does not hold in time series. Time series analysis is different and in many ways more challenging than panel data or pooled cross-section analysis because we work with only 1 observation at a point in time per time series and thus have to make the most assumptions about the process that may have generated our time series.
