How do you customize transliterations in a Rails 3 app?

Ultimately, I would like to use Inflector.parameterize to create slugs for article heading that have a bunch of unicode chars in them (e.g. "ḤellẒ no" => "hellz-no"). According to http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveSupport/Inflector.html#method-i-transliterate it says to put them in the locales/en.yml file. # Store the transliterations in locales/en.yml i18n: transliterate: rule: Ḥ: "h" Ẓ: "z" I tried that but the following does not work: "ḤellẒ no".parameterize # => "ell-no" However, when I change it in Ruby like the second paragraph suggests, it works. I18n.backend.store_translations(:en, :i18n => { :transliterate => { :rule => { "Ḥ" => "H", "Ẓ" => "Z" } } }) "ḤellẒ no".parameterize # => "hellz-no" I guess I would like to know why putting the custom transliterations in locales/en.yml doesn't work. And even if someone give the answer for that, being a Rails noob, I would also like to know where one usually puts code like the second block to manually set the I18n.backend.store_translations?
