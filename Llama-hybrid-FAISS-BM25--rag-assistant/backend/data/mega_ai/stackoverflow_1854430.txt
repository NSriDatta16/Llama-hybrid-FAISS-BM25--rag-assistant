The API to return you an image returns you the raw data from the camera, or an image converted to raw data from the library. As you surmised, the JPG process is lossy, so even if the images are the same size the raw data will differ. You would probably be better off taking an average of an area at a few fixed locations and using that as a checksum, though of course that can easily generate false positives so you need to be careful how you do it.
