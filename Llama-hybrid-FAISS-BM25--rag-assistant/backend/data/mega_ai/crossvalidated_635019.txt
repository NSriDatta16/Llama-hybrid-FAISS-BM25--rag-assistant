Estimator of variance for a binomially distributed sample

I want to run some Bayesian analysis on some data. Suppose we have a sample that we believe comes from a binomial population. We have $m$ observations $$X_i \sim \text{Bin}(n,p) \quad \quad \quad \text{ for } i \in \{1,2,\dots,m\}.$$ I have chosen my prior to be a beta distribution. I'm unsure how to pick parameters to make my distribution better suited to my beliefs. I assume I would take the sample mean and set the mean of the beta prior equal to this number, but I'm not sure what to do about working out the variance. Can anyone offer a suggestion?
