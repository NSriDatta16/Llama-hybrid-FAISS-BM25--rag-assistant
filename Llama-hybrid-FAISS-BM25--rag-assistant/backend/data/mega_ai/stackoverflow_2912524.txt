The buffer variable is constructed exactly on that line: Vector buffer(fragmentEnd * 3 + 1); Walking through the steps that the compiler takes, it first ensures that there are sizeof(Vector ) bytes of space on the stack into which it can construct the Vector buffer object. It then calls a Vector constructor that can take an int (because fragmentEnd * 3 + 1 is an int ) on the storage in the stack. In the current Vector sources, there is no constructor that takes an int . However, there is a constructor that takes a size_t (an unsigned int ), so the compiler will statically cast the result fragmentEnd * 3 + 1 to a size_t and invoke that constructor.
