Good old LWP allows you to process the result as a stream. E.g., here's a callback to yourFunc, reading/passing byte_count bytes to each call to yourFunc (you can drop that param if you don't care how large the data is to each call, and just want to process the stream as fast as possible): use LWP; ... $browser = LWP::UserAgent->new(); $response = $browser->get($url, ':content_cb' => \&yourFunc, ':read_size_hint' => byte_count,); ... sub yourFunc { my($data, $response) = @_; # do your magic with $data # $respose will be a response object created once/if get() returns }
