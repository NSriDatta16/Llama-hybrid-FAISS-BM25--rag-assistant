This Code is Invalid in C but valid in C++ : C - http://www.ideone.com/mxgMo Error Reason -: initializer element is not constant C++ - http://www.ideone.com/XzoeU Works . Because: The C++ Standard states: 3.6.1 Main function [basic.start.main] 1 A program shall contain a global function called main, which is the designated start of the program. It is implementation defined whether a program in a freestanding environment is required to define a main function. [ Note: in a freestanding environment, start-up and termination is implementation-defined; start-up contains the execution of constructors for objects of namespace scope with static storage duration; termination contains the execution of destructors for objects with static storage duration . â€”end note ] However, C99 says this: 56.7.8 Initialization 4 All the expressions in an initializer for an object that has static storage duration shall be constant expressions or string literals. So not just the code you posted, but something like this will also be invalid in C : #include int needint(void); int i =needint(); int needint(void) { return 1; } int main() { int j = i; printf("i=%d , j=%d\n", i , j); } See here .
