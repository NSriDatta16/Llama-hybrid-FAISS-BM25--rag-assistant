You certainly can poorly implement PCA wrt. missing data, but you can also spend a bit on extra thought on how to handle missing data, and how to estimate covariance in this case. However, PCA may react badly to non-continuous values... Projecting the data is also more difficult, and you will have to do some kind of missing value imputation then. But didn't the clustering with Gower's suffer from the same problem, too? How did you solve it there? By any means, don't expect magic to happen. Your data is very dirty and the systematic missing values may require you to do a rather complex missing value estimation, not just some default library call.
