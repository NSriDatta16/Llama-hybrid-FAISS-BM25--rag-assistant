Such time series are usually hard to model using ARIMA. But I suggest you plot the ACf and PACF of the series and see. It may require differencing. You can also test to see if the variance is constant; if it is not you transform. Once the data is stationary you can make sense out of it. As Nick has said splitting the series will generate two different processes and more information is needed. The series might appear to be oscillating: if that's the case the best thing to do is to try spectral analysis.
