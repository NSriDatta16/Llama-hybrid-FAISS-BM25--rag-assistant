Autosizing boxes and positioning in Cocoa

I'm creating an application, from which a part looks like this: boo http://img188.imageshack.us/img188/7808/schermafbeelding2010021y.png I all dragged them to a window in IB, but the problem is that the NSImageView, Action Buttons (Suggest, Send, Poke etc...), Information NSBox, and Friends NSTabView can all vary in height. They should always be placed below each other, with a margin of 8px. Just like on Facebook. I thought of a very modified NSSplitView, but maybe there are easier ways. Can anyone help me out? Edit: I have placed the action buttons in a Custom View with class NSView. Thanks
