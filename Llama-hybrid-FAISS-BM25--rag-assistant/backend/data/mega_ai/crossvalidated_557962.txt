Imbalanced data output better than balanced data

I'm currently doing sentiment anaylisis with SVM algorithm linear kernel and TF-IDF. My data is not balanced not balanced: and I balanced data using SMOTE balanced data: output without balanced data: output with balanced data: Why output without balanced data is more better than balanced data?
