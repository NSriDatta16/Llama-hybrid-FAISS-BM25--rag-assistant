I am showing details of a similar example because I think there is a mistake in the statement of your problem. The general formulas in the next paragraph are true for any distribution with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$ --not just normal distributions. If $X$ has $E(X) = \mu$ and $Var(X) = \sigma^2,$ and $Y = aX+b,$ for $a>0, b> 0,$ then $E(Y) = a\mu +b,$ $Var(Y)=a^2\sigma^2.$ and $SD(Y) = a\sigma.$ Demonstration by simulation (in R): With a (normal) sample of a million, sample means and standard deviations should match corresponding population expectations and standard deviations to about one decimal place. (Variances have squared units and so accuracy may be limited to a few significant digits.) set.seed(2021) x = rnorm(10^6, 100, 15) # normal sample of one million mean(x); var(x); sd(x) [1] 100.0071 # aprx E(X) = 100 [1] 225.5395 # aprx Var(X) = 225 [1] 15.01797 # aprx SD(X) = 15 y = 2*x + 5 mean(y); var(y); sd(y) [1] 205.0143 # aprx E(Y) = 2(100) + 5 = 205 [1] 902.1579 # aprx Var(Y) = 4(225) = 900 [1] 30.03594 # aprx SD(Y) = 2(15) = 30 The figure below shows histograms (blue) for samples along with the corresponding population density functions (red). R code for figure: par(mfrow = c(1,2)) hist(x, prob=T, br=30, col="skyblue2", main="NORM(100, 15)") curve(dnorm(x, 100, 15), add=T, lwd=2, col="red") hist(y, prob=T, br=30, col="skyblue2", main="NORM(105, 30)") curve(dnorm(x, 205, 30), add=T, lwd=2, col="red") par(mfrow = c(1,1))
