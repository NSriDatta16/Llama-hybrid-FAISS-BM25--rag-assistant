Simple Markov Chains Memoryless Property Question

I have a sequential data from time T1 to T6 . The rows contain the sequence of states for 50 customers. There are only 3 states in my data. For example, it looks like this: T1 T2 T3 T4 T5 T6 Cust1 C B C A A C My transition matrix X looks like this: A B C A 0.3 0.6 0.1 B 0.5 0.2 0.3 C 0.7 0.1 0.2 Now, we see that at time T6 the state is at C which corresponds to c=[0 0 1] vector. I am now predicting T7 by doing the matrix multiplication: c * X which gives me [0.7 0.1 0.2] . Based on this, I decide that the state at T7 would be A (highest prob. value). For T8 , I use the result of the probability vector I got above and do [0.7 0.1 0.2]*X = [0.4 0.44 0.14] and decide that the state is B . My question is: Am I doing something wrong? Am I contradicting the memoryless property of the Markov Chains?
