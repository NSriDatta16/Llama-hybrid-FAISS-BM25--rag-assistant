Chi-square test for multiple rows contingency table

I was trying to figure out if/how I can apply a chi-square test to my problem. I know how to deal with and interpret a case where I have only 2 mutually excluding groups, like male/female, and I want to determine whether a certain disease is more common in one of the groups. The null hypotheses is that there's no difference in the distribution of the disease between males and females. I can organize the data this way: | disease no_disease ----------------------------------- male | 25 6 female | 8 15 and, after using a chi-square test, I can reject the null hypothesis, since I get a chi2 (11.686) higher than the critical value (3.841) for a significance of 0.05. However, I'm trying to figure out how to deal with a situation where I have patients with multiple symptoms, so something like: | disease no_disease | TOT --------------------------------------------- symptom 01 | 20 20 | 40 symptom 02 | 10 5 | 15 symptom 03 | 10 15 | 25 symptom 04 | 10 5 | 15 ----------------------------------------- TOT 50 45 | 95 the symptoms are mutually exclusive , and I'd like to figure out which ones are better indicators of the presence of the disease, but I'm not sure about how to approach the problem. I don't think performing a chi2 test on the whole table as it is would make sense, right? I was thinking I could treat them separately. For each symptom, I could create a single contingency table, considering the patients with the current symptom as a first category, and grouping together all the other ones not presenting the current symptom in a second category...so, something like: | disease no_disease | TOT --------------------------------------------- symptom 01 | 20 20 | 40 no sympt01 | 30 25 | 55 ----------------------------------------- TOT 50 45 | 95 | disease no_disease | TOT --------------------------------------------- symptom 02 | 10 5 | 15 no sympt02 | 40 40 | 80 ----------------------------------------- TOT 50 45 | 95 | disease no_disease | TOT --------------------------------------------- symptom 03 | 10 15 | 25 no sympt03 | 40 30 | 70 ----------------------------------------- TOT 50 45 | 95 | disease no_disease | TOT --------------------------------------------- symptom 04 | 10 5 | 15 no sympt04 | 40 40 | 80 ----------------------------------------- TOT 50 45 | 95 and then perform chi2 tests on each table, to evaluate how much each symptom is an indicator of the presence of the disease. But again, I don't know if it would be a correct approach.
