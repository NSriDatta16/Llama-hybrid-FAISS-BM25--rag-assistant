So on a page reload you can fetch the session, while not if redirecting? Are you redirecting on a different Domain-Name? Then it might be an issues with the Cookies and you'd need to manually set session.cookie_domain ini variable. Check if the cookie named PHPSESSID has been properly been set and if it's being sent to the server on every page request? Is it constant or does it change on every request? Also, you might want to check if the session data is being properly saved to the disk. The sessions can be found in the directory defined by the ini variable session.save_path . Is the file corresponding to your PHPSESSID there and does it contain a meaningful entry? In my case it contains root@ip-10-226-50-144:~# less /var/lib/php5/sess_081fee38856c59a563cc320899f6021f foo_auth|a:1:{s:7:"storage";a:1:{s:9:"user_id";s:2:"77";}}
