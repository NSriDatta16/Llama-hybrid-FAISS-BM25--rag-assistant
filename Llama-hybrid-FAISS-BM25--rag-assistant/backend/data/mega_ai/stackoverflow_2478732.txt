Restricting your users isn't always a good idea. Just documenting that copying may be expensive is enough. If a user really wants to copy, then using the native syntax of C++ by providing a copy constructor is a much cleaner approach. Therefore, I think the real answer depends on the context. Perhaps the real class you're writing (not the imaginary Shape) shouldn't be copied, perhaps it should. But as a general approach, I certainly can't say that one should discourage users from copying large objects by forcing them to use explicit method calls.
