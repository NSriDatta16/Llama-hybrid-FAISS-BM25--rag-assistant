For equations (2) and (3) I think you would be worried about potential correlation between the residuals $e_t$ and $u_t$ and the instruments $z_{t2}$ and $z_{t1}$ respectively. In the case that the instruments are correlated with the first stage errors, the 2SLS estimates will be inconsistent. I think that in the context of your specific example of a demand equation, your first stage is not valid. Let $y_t$ be quantity demanded of good 1, $x_{1t}$ and $x_{2t}$ be the consumer prices of goods 1 and 2, and $z_{1t}$ and $z_{2t}$ be the input prices (or marginal costs) of goods 1 and 2 respectively. Without loss of generality, assume goods 1 and 2 are complements. Then they exhibit negative cross-elasticity of demand in which case a rise in $z_{2t}$ will generally result in a rise of $x_{2t}$ and in turn a fall in $y_{t}$ holding all else fixed . However, there is an endogeneity here, because in Bertrand or Stackelberg competition or in another collusive game, the company pricing good 1 would react to a rise in $x_{2t}$ by changing $x_{1t}$ to maximize profit (see Tirole). In such a case we expect there to be a causal relationship between $z_{2t}$ and $x_{1t}$. So a first stage of the form $$ \begin{bmatrix} x_{1t} \\ x_{2t} \end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix} b_{1} \\ a_{1} \end{bmatrix}+\begin{bmatrix} b_2 & b_3 & b_4 \\ a_2 & a_3 & a_4 \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} z_{1t} \\ z_{2t} \\w_t \end{bmatrix}+\begin{bmatrix} e_t \\ u_t \end{bmatrix} \quad (1)$$ would be more appropriate. Furthermore, for the more general case of IV regression, the consistency of the 2SLS estimates does not depend directly on correct specification of the first stage (Angrist and Pischke pg 191). So while you may still believe that the first stage equation (1) may be misspecified, it will still yield consistent 2SLS estimates so long as the 2 key assumptions (that the instruments are (1) exogenous and (2) correlated with $x$'s) hold true. For a formal proof of this see Greene ch 8. Since structuring the first stage differently can yield different IV estimates, and because the above first stage is guaranteed consistency, IV with the first stage specified in equation (1) is generally accepted by the literature as the 2SLS estimate (see Wooldridge Ch 15).
