What are some good natural language parsing tools for Perl?

I've heard that Perl is used a lot for NLP, but I can't find almost any good NLP tools for Perl. What are some good Perl NLP tools/resources? Python has NLTK. Java has OpenNLP. Does Perl have anything similar? This is really a general question, but if someone could also specifically address chunking and POS-tagging, that would be awesome!
