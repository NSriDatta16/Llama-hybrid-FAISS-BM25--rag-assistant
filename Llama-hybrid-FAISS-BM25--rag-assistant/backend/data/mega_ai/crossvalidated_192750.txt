If you type help pca you will see loads of information about the function. If you only output one argument, it will return the principal coefficients, sometimes called the loadings. The $27578\times151$ matrix you received contains the first loading in the first row, the second in the second row and so on. If you ask for two outputs, you obtain [V, U] = pca(X); where V contains the loadings and U the score values. You reconstruct the input data by U*V' . In order to perform dimensionality reduction, you must select the first n components of both matrices as U(:, 1:n) and V(:, 1:n) and perform the approximated reconstruction as U(:, 1:n)*V(:, 1:n)' .
