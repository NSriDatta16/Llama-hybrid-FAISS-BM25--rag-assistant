I personally keep a list of project directories with somewhat similar structure. Each has a tasklist.org, a tracking subdirectory (where I do project estimates and time tracking and always maintain a diary which is the main thing for the project - it will have links to other files for the project), a docs subdirectory which usually consist of stuff I'm going to publish (docs for the project, proposals etc.). I get my agenda-files to the tasklist.org in each of the subdirectories so that my agenda works fine. I think the organisation of the data would change a little in your case (perhaps topics like "functional programming" etc.). I'm sceptical of how much a hierarchical structure would help since that would confine you into one way of looking at things (tags vs. folders again). Here are some things that come to mind. Keep a 'master' org file that has links to all the 'interesting' top level pieces of the other content (similar to the diary I mentioned above). Tag all your material properly (you'll settle on a set of useful tags after a while) and then use the Tag search feature to search through the files quickly. This assumes that all the files are in your agenda-files though. Finally, if your data is too exotic to put into a structure, you can consider using a full text indexer (like xapian) and integrate that into your Emacs. There was some discussion of this over here . Update : 26/Nov/2019 I recently came across the hyperbole package which claims to be a information organiser. I haven't used it but I'm quite tempted to and will update this when I do.
