SignedXml does not recognize u:Id as a valid XML ID, and the XML Signature does require it to be an XML ID. You can either use the Schema (http://docs.oasis-open.org/wss/2004/01/oasis-200401-wss-wssecurity-utility-1.0.xsd if your trying to use a WS-Security Id) or add an DTD to the XML fragment. ( ]> for an XML fragment). Adding a DTD to just your LoadXml will make SignedXml recognize the Id, but since SOAP does not allow DTD's, don't include the DTD in your on-the-wire SOAP.
