How to calculate SE for interaction in GLM

I am struggling mightily trying to figure out how to calculate the SE related to an odds ratio for a linear combination of two factors in a logistic regression model with an interaction term included. Consider the following.... set.seed(123) height =median(survived),1,0)) mod1 Here, the height (tall/short) and weight (big/small) of an animal determines its survival, and there is an interaction between those two factors. mod1 is a simple logistic model using the cross-product notation, whereas mod2 fits a derived variable that specifies each of the possible combinations of height/weight, with short/small as the reference. MOD1 Call: glm(formula = Survived ~ Height * Weight, family = "binomial", data = dat) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.83369 -0.95247 -0.07909 1.06245 1.60944 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -0.9751 0.1444 -6.751 1.47e-11 *** HeightTall 1.2517 0.1909 6.558 5.45e-11 *** WeightBig 0.4199 0.1926 2.180 0.02922 * HeightTall:WeightBig 0.7787 0.2850 2.732 0.00629 ** --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 (Dispersion parameter for binomial family taken to be 1) Null deviance: 1386.3 on 999 degrees of freedom Residual deviance: 1212.3 on 996 degrees of freedom AIC: 1220.3 Number of Fisher Scoring iterations: 4 MOD2 Call: glm(formula = Survived ~ interaction(Height, Weight), family = "binomial", data = dat) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.83369 -0.95247 -0.07909 1.06245 1.60944 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -0.9751 0.1444 -6.751 1.47e-11 *** interaction(Height, Weight)Tall.Small 1.2517 0.1909 6.558 5.45e-11 *** interaction(Height, Weight)Short.Big 0.4199 0.1926 2.180 0.0292 * interaction(Height, Weight)Tall.Big 2.4504 0.2224 11.020 I would like to know what the odds ratio of survival would be for a tall/big animal vs. small/short. I can easily follow the math in mod1 to see that it is exp(1.2517+0.4199+0.7787) or 11.59. mod2 tells me that up front, along with the unexponentiated SE (0.2224), but how do I get to the SE of 0.2224 from mod1 ? I've followed posts such as Standard errors and p-values for interaction effects with GLM , but I can't seem to get my calculated SE to match that from mod2 . Many thanks ahead of time!
