From the paper: First step: understanding what type of data is available. Educational data is usually in the form of either numeric or categorical. So it would seem the authors intended "mixed variables" to mean datasets entailing both numeric and categorical data. Though, it's worth mentioning that categorical data can be transformed to numeric via one-hot encoding. On this site, related questions abound on this very topic, and this example from one (prominent) open source SVM implementation uses it to predict flower category. It's not really clear why the authors presented these methods as not supporting categorical data. (Perhaps the implementations they had available at the time did not support transformation.)
