One other thing to note is that you probably not only want to display errors, you want to log them to file/database. Just showing errors to your users in the production environment is not enough; asking them to report the problems will lead to you not knowing what's wrong with your server until it's too late. In your base error and exception handler, make sure to have logic that records the issue (as much debugging info as possible - stack trace, user IP, browser, application version, etc) into persistent storage.
