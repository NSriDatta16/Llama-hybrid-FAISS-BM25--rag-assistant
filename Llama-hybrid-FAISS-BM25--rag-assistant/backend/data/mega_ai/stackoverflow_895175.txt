You certainly could reinvent the wheel. There are a lot of complications added to the stream operators to handle international character sets. After having looked at it reasonably deeply I really didn't care for it much. It's very complicated and completely destroys any chance of easily using inheritance. It works and is available though. (I wanted to change the behavior of the storage it uses during conversions)
