Your company, like every other probably has one place to store all of their employee information. You should apply the same principle on your web application, meaning you should have one central database for all employees with privilegies information so that you can define employee's access to each department. If you apply the above principle (one database for all users containing privilegies information) it should be pretty easy to redirect users to other departments if that is what you'r asking here. You should split your project into smaller pieces so that you can identify the core part of your project and share that part among all departments. There are many ways to accomplish this but copy-pasting your code for every department is not efficient and it will get in your way later on. Even with three departments it is tedious to copy-paste changes to each one. Also note that if you use separate databases for departments you wont be able to share data among them (at least not in a nice, elegant way). What you should do is leave your programming language on side for a couple of hours/days and write some design documents about that project. It doesn't have to be too detailed, just enough so you can see how modular it will be and what you can and shouldn't do to make it more modular. With that said, you should wait for more answers as I'm not as professional as others on SO :-) And excuse my bad english.
