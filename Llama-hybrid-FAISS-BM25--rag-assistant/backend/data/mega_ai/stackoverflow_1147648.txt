You're right, ruby methods on your model are not accesible to sphinx. However you can re-create the method as a sphinx attribute. These can easily be made using SQL fragments like so: class Person start_date and now() :active, :type => :boolean end ... end Using a string to specify a field or attribute like this is the same as specifying a custom column when building an SQL query.
