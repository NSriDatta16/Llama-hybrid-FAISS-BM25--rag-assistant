How to know where to put bias terms in neural nets?

I've read different places that talk about bias terms in neural nets like this Importance of the bias node in neural networks But I still have trouble understanding what it is used for and how it affects the neural network. In a neural network, where would you place it? There can be hundreds of neurons, how do you know which one to link it to? And how many bias terms do you need? How do you know you need one? Can anyone explain?
