I would like to provide several references to answer your question. I would argue that depending on data, boosted stumps are not necessary better than deep trees. They are different. A visualization on difference can be found here How does linear base learner works in boosting? And how does it works in the xgboost library? Do all machine learning algorithms separate data linearly? for the discussions on boosting with linear model, my first link gives answer. In additon, @Matthew Drury had a good answer here. Gradient Boosting for Linear Regression - why does it not work?
