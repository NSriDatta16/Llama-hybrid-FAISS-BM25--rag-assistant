Trend detection in a time series can be done simply wrong or more aggressively. A series can have values that exhibit a trend, e.g. 1,2,3,4,5 , and then a change in trend at one or more points in time, e.g. 7,9,11,13,15,... Another example is 1,1,1,1,1,2,3,4,5,6 where no trend is present for the first 5 readings, and then a trend ensues. A series like 1,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2 is said to have a level shift (change in intercept). AUTOBOX is a piece of software that uniquely (to my knowledge) incorporates analytics to detect, test and incorporate time trends. I was one of the developers and extended the analytics in this particular area. The procedure that you are trying to use (incorrectly in my opinion) is model presumptive, i.e. no pulses, no level shifts, no seasonal pulses, no ARIMA structure, constant error variance, etc. Another possible bad example of an assumed model is to use $[1-B]y(t)=\theta_0 +[MA/AR]a(t)$, as again, one is assuming a particular structure. The idea here is that the ARIMA model might be incorrect or that $\theta_0$ is changing (thus different trends) at different points in time. The whole idea is to let the data "speak" and the analysis "listen" and detect the "correct model" or at least a "useful model". Orson Bean – or maybe it was somebody else – once said, “A trend is a trend…until it bends, and when the trend bends, the trend is at an end." Local time trends in time series require identification of the break points and then estimation of the local trend.
