Why robust PCA is giving varying output and how to stabilize it?

I see that if I repeatedly try following 2 commands, the biplots remain the same: pc and: pc However, if I try following code of robust PCA (taken from help text of ?princomp in R), the output biplot keeps varying: pc.rob It is not just rotation or horizontal/vertical inversion of plot but actual relative directions of arrows and position of individual points relative to each other also change. I had expected a 'robust' plot to be more stable! There is no problem in R code. It is running without any error or even warnings. Why does the biplot keep varying and how can I have a stable, reliable biplot output for robust PCA? Thanks for your help.
