Finetuning means taking weights of a trained neural network and use it as initialization for a new model being trained on data from the same domain (often e.g. images). It is used to: speed up the training overcome small dataset size There are various strategies, such as training the whole initialized network or "freezing" some of the pre-trained weights (usually whole layers). The article A Comprehensive guide to Fine-tuning Deep Learning Models in Keras provides a good insight into this. Also have a look at the following threads: Fine Tuning vs Joint Training vs Feature Extraction CNN: ReTraining and Fine Tuning
