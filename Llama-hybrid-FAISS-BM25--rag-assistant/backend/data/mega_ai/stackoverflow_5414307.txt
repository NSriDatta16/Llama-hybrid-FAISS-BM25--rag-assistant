I think your best bet would be to combine some of the non-obtrusive techniques and tools already available to handle the actual bot/spam detection. After you identify a possible risk, you can then prompt your visitor for a CAPTCHA validation before proceeding. I do not know of an out-of-box CAPTCHA solution that will display itself based on certain criteria. This could be because what defines a 'bot' or 'spam' is largely subjective and is always changing. Furthermore, most modern bots have no problem identifying themselves as your garden-variety user agent. That said, if you end up having to "roll your own", I would recommend showing the CAPTCHA if any of the following are true: HttpContext.Current.Request.Browser.Crawler returns true Akismet (http://akismetapi.codeplex.com/) returns a positive match for any input text A HoneyPot returns a positive match Excessive hammering (count postbacks and/or page_loads in Session) Excessive sign-in attempts NoBot returns a positive match Hope this helps
