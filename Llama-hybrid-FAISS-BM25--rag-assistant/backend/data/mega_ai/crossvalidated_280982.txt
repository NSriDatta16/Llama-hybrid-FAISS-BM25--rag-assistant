You should not really do either. In order to take the uncertainty around the model and the variables into account, your process will need to do both in parallel. It does not matter so much how you do it, whether it is by bootstrapping your whole process, model averaging, Bayesian approaches with shrinkage priors, some kind of cross-validation approach or any of the other possible approaches. To do anything else gives you overly certain inference (confidence and prediction intervals do not have nominal coverage, p-values are invalid, estimates may be severely biased etc.).
