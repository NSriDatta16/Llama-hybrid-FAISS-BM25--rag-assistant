mb14 gave you the best answer. You want something automatically executed? Then use the standard organization: here the plugin/ subdirectory. Otherwise, :runtime would have been your friend: :runtime! vimrc.d/*.vim :source barks when its parameter doesn't exist while :runtime silently source nothing. :source can source only one file while :runtime! can source any number of files. :source takes an absolute pathname, or a pathname relative to the current directory while :runtime takes a pathname relative to the 'runtimepath' option, which shouldn't be a problem as long as you respect vim conventions.
