I'm not a Bayesian or hierarchical expert (only done an introductory course) but I would probably model the problem like this $$ X_{ij} \sim N( \mu_{ij} , \sigma ) \\ \mu_{ij} = \mu_0 + \alpha_i + \beta_j \\ \alpha_i \sim N(0 , \sigma_a ) \\ \beta_i \sim N(0 , \sigma_b ) $$ Where $X_{ij}$ is the number of item i sold from shop j $\alpha_i$ is the change in number of mean sales associated to item i $\beta_i$ is the change in number of mean sales associated to shop j $\mu_0$ is some global average mean sales number I would then start by placing flat priors on $\mu_0$ , $\sigma_a$ and $\sigma_b$. Obviously this is quite a basic model in that it assumes complete independence of sales between shop and item. You could extend this by letting $\alpha_i$ and $\beta_j$ come from a bi-variate normal distribution where you attempt to model the correlation between the two, for example if a shop is particularly amazing at selling items they might have less of a per item difference. Or alternatively you might want to include an interaction term as certain shops might be bad at selling certain items and you might want to capture this. EDIT: The above model has 2 glaring flaws though, the first being that all items share a common variance parameter which is just highly unlikely for example imagine the variance of the number of tv sales vs the number of apple sales. The second is that currently we fit a flat increase/decrease per shop regardless of what the item is. In order to attempt to address these issues we could fit the following model: $$ X_{ij} \sim N( \mu_{ij} , \sigma_i ) \\ \mu_{ij} = \mu_0 + \alpha_i + \beta_{ij} \\ \begin{bmatrix} \beta_{1j} \\ \beta_{2j} \\ \vdots \\ \beta_{Ij} \end{bmatrix} \sim N_I( 0 , \Sigma) \\ \sigma_i \sim \Gamma(a,b) \\ \alpha_i \sim N( 0 , \sigma_a) \\ $$ Under this model you get a global mean for each individual item as $ \mu_0 + \alpha_i$ and then some adjustment to this mean based upon which item it is and which shop its being sold from $\beta_{ij}$. The specification of $\Sigma$ defines the relationship and correlation between each item and shop. A high covariance would imply that shops that are good at selling 1 item are good at selling others.
