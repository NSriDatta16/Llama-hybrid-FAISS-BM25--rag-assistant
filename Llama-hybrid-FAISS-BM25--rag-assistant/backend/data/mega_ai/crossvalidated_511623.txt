If you google "change point analysis" you will find tons of pointers. It is not clear to me from your question whether you want to check for a change at a suspected, fixed point in time or rather you want to screen your time series for possible changes at some (unspecified) point of time. In the first case you might search for "intervention analysis" or "interrupted time series" (which seems to be a popular name for the same thing in medical and biological literature).
