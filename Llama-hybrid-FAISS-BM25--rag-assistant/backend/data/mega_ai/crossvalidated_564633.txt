Data analysis on radicle length?

I am doing an experiment on the effect of different soaking time on radicle length. I have five treatments: 6 hr, 12 hr, 18 hr, 24 hr and 30 hr. Each treatment has 5 replicates/repetitions. And each trial/replicate has about 5 seeds in them. Time of soaking-independent variable; length of radicle-dependent variable. Consider that I have 5 seeds in each trial/replicate. I am measuring the length of the radicle of each seed and it results in 5 radicle lengths in each trial. So for 5 trials, I have about 25 radicle lengths in total. In order to calculate the standard deviation and to perform the ANOVA test, do I need to average the 5 radicle lengths in each trial (do that for the rest of the four trials) and then use the 5 mean radicle lengths? Opposed to this, what I did was I took the standard deviation of the 25 radicle lengths (combined all trials into one unit) rather than the 5 average radicle lengths (5 trials). The standard deviation of the 25 radical lengths was immensely different from the standard deviation of the 5 average radical lengths. What do you think is the correct way to do this?
