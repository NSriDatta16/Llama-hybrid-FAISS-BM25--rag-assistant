Well you seem to be short of assistance ... I don't know a pcap from a kneecap, so all I can do is try to help you help yourself. Suggestions: (1) Have you had a look at line 105 of pcap.py? I guess that the "KeyError: 138" means that it is trying to access a dictionary, but the dictionary doesn't have 138 (or "138") as a key. What is the variable containing 138? A byte from a packet? (2) Consider asking the author/maintainer of pcap. (3) Consider providing a URL for pcap.
