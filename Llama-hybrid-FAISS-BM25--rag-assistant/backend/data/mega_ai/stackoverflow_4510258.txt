After Piskvor assured me that it was something to do with the applet itself, I opened up the source code for ptviewer and discovered that it sends its own user-agent in the header. CodeIgniter's session library (1.7.2) does a security check to make sure the user-agent matches. Commenting out lines 185-189 in Session.php solves this problem.
