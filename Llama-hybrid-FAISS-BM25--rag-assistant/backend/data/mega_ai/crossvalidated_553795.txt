A picture says it all. The scatter of values around any possible reasonably smooth curve through these points is so great as to obscure any underlying trend in their average value (conditional expectation). The right hand plot shows that if data could be generated (collected) for a wider range of the explanatory values x1 , the (quadratic) variation in the regression might become detectable. If you remain limited to the original narrow range, you would need a sample of size $n\approx 100,000$ to detect this trend reliably using the least squares model $E[Y]=\beta_0+\beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_1^2.$ This is neither a limitation of least squares nor of the model formulation (spline or otherwise): it merely reflects the difficulty of detecting this tiny signal amidst all the noise.
