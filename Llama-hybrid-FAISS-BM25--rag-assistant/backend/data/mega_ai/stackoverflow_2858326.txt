Some of the code to do this will probably need to be platform specific. On Windows, for example, you'd typically do your camera rotations when the user drags the mouse. You'd handle it by capturing the mouse and responding to WM_MOUSEMOVE messages while it's captured. While the mouse is captured, you'll continue to receive the mouse move messages even if the cursor position goes outside the boundaries of your window. It looks like unwind has already covered X pretty well, so I won't repeat it here.
