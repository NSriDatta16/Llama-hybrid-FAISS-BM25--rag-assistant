I would create a dummy unique id to identify the row and link it to other tables as I have had consistent bad experience with compound keys. A single id field just works a lot better. I suspect they are just evil. For all the relevant possible keys, i would recommend to create unique indexes, which would give the advantages (guaranteed uniqueness and fast retrieval) and none of the disadvantages (do not get me started). I also suspect that the key fields proposed might change from time to time. You really want your key to be immutable, since it will be used as a reference.
