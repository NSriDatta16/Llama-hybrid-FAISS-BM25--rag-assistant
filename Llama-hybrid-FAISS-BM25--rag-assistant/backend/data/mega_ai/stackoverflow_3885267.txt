Have you looked at the "decision forest" implementation in Alglib ? It's free for academic use. The webpage claims support for C++/C# and (maybe) Delphi. It's not a decision tree implementation but random forests tend to be better classifiers than single decision trees on many problems and they don't take much longer to train. My guess is that it will be hard to find a consistent decision tree implementation across multiple languages because there are so many different types of decision tree algorithms. There are a number of other open source random forest libraries listed in the Wikipedia article if the Alglib one is not what you need. Cavaet: the Alglib implementation claims not to be a traditional random forest.
