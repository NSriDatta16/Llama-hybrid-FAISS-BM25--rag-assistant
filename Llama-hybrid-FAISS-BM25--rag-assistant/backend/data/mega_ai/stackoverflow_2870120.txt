Lombok doesn't do two-pass compilation. Technically it 'slows down' the compile process in that it runs in addition to the usual things that occur when you compile, but compared to the parse phase, the lower phase, and the translation phase, lombok barely even registers. The major fragility issue is that editing lombokified code in an editor that is NOT either (A) dumb (i.e. notepad or a diff viewer), (B) eclipse, (C) netbeans, or (D) gets all its brains by running javac (e.g. vim with java plugin), it's going to suck. If that doesn't apply, the reduction of boilerplate should only make your code less fragile. DISCLAIMER: I'm one of the two main developers of lombok :)
