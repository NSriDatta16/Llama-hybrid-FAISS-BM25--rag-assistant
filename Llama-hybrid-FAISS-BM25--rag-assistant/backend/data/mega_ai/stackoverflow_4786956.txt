Unfortunately this is not a bug: they have been officially removed . The new editor in 8.x might look the same, but it's completely different underneath and we have added the +/- features back. the "-" button should be replaced by delete anyway. You can right click and choose delete or simply hit delete on your keyboard. The "+" option is indeed replaced by drag and drop. We've improved drag and drop significantly (and still improving it for the next version), and should be good enough that using "+" isn't needed. In some cases too, "+" isn't enough, you need more information to know where the item will be placed (like when dropping into a relativeLayout). (same thing with the up/down arrows) ( source )
