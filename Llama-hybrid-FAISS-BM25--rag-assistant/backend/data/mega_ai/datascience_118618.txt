Time series convert/summarise series of values into a single value

Hi I have a time series dataset which looks like this Date Value1 2021/08/01 2 and Date Value1 2020/08/01 4 and Date Value1 2019/08/01 6 I want to compare the 2021 data with 2020 first and compare 2021 data with 2019. I am doing a percent change calculation to get both the values, which will be 2021 vs 2020 and 2021 vs 2019. I want to now interpret these two changes into a single value i.e. For example, if change in Value1 from 2021 vs 2020 is 10%, change in Value1 from 2021 vs 2019 is 15%, I want to summarize this to a single value. What would be the better version to summarise other than just doing a plain average of these two ((10+15)/2)
