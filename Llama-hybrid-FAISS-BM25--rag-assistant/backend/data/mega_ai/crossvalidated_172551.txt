I hope this post is useful: These articles discusses code to find the ideal number of clusters: www.r-statistics.com/2013/08/k-means-clustering-from-r-in-action/ www.inside-r.org/packages/cran/useful/docs/PlotHartigan I used the above library on a project before. Once you have your representative topics, you could slot the users using these classification methods Tf-idf: http://blog.christianperone.com/2011/10/machine-learning-text-feature-extraction-tf-idf-part-ii/ Cosine similarly: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_filtering https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnow_(algorithm) And good old Niave Bayes classification.
