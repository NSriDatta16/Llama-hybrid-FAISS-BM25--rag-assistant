Are these valid statements? Yes ... taken as Java expressions in the context of a normal Java program. In the context of an Eclipse debugger's expression evaluator, I'm not sure. If so, why am I getting an exception? I don't know for sure, but I suspect that it is something to do with the debugger itself. One possibility is that you are using the expression evaluation functionality incorrectly. Another possibility is that this is a bug in the Eclipse debugger, or a mismatch between the Eclipse debugger and the debug agent in the JVM. The one thing that I do know is that the parseInt and parseLong methods themselves don't throw UnsupportedOperationException . (In theory, they could because it is an unchecked exception. But I checked the source code for those 2 methods, and there's no way that the code could do that ... if executed in the normal way.) The Google query - "site:eclipse.org +UnsupportedOperationException JDI" - shows a lot of hits in the Eclipse issues database and newsgroups / mailing lists. In some cases, it looks like the problem is that the JDI / JNDI implementation for the target platform is incomplete. Could this be your problem? You mention you are doing Android development ...
