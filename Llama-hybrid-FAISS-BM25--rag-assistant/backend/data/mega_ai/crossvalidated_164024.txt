Linear regression with prior on $\arctan \beta_1$

Suppose we have $\hat{y} = \beta_1 x + \beta_0$ (I ask only for the univariate case.) A typical Bayesian approach might involve Normal priors on both parameters. I was thinking today about a different approach. I imagined that the slope parameter should have a noninformative prior that uniformly sweeps the range of possible angles, so $\gamma = \frac{\arctan \beta_1 + \pi/2}{\pi/2}$; $\gamma \sim \text{Beta}(1,1)$ or whatever informative Beta we choose. Then $\beta_0\mid\beta_1$ is Normal or something. Alternatively, define parameter $\theta \in (-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2})$ and $\hat{y} = \left(\tan{\theta}\right)x + \beta_0$. Has this been done before? Is this useful?
