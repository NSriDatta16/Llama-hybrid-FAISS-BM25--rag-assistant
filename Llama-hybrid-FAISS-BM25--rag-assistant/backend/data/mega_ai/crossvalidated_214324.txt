The first thing we expect from a quantile forecast is that it respects the prespecified quantile, i.e., that it provides quantile predictions that are larger than a proportion $\tau$ of your realizations. You can check this by looking at your $n$ quantile predictions $\hat{y}_i$ and assessing whether $$\hat{\tau} := \frac{1}{n} \#\{i\colon y_i As a matter of fact, you can of course even do inferential statistics. Under the null hypothesis that $\hat{\tau}=\tau$, whether or not a given future realization fulfills $y_i However, this is certainly not the end of the story. A little more thinking gives us a somewhat more stringent criterion for a model to be good: the best possible model for $\tau$-quantile predictions will provide quantile predictions that are larger than a proportion $\tau$ of your realizations - and do this independently of the predictors $x$ . To see why the last clause is important, assume that $x$ is a one-dimensional predictor which takes the values $x=(1,0,1,0,1,0,\dots)$. Assume further that the true future distribution is a mixture of two uniforms and depends on $x$ as follows: $$ y \sim \begin{cases} U[0,1], & x=0 \\ U[1,2], & x=1 \end{cases} $$ Now, the unconditional distribution of $y$ is $U[0,2]$, since half of our $x$ are 0 and half are 1. Thus, if we want a median forecast ($\tau=0.5$), we could simply forecast $\hat{y}=1$. Then half of our observations would be below this prediction (namely, the ones where $x=0$), and half would be above it (those with $x=1$). We thus would have a wonderful median forecast that covers exactly the prespecified proportion of realizations. Nevertheless, we would certainly not say that this median forecast is good, since its performance still depends heavily on $x$. The best median forecast would of course take the dependence on $x$ into account: $$ \hat{y} := \begin{cases} 0.5, & x=0 \\ 1.5, & x=1 \end{cases} $$ Thus, another test you should do is to take the indicator variable of successes $I_{\{y_i This question is actually rather important in time series analysis and forecasting. Here, the question is one of forecasting Value at Risk, where you don't want a simple approach that gives correct quantiles on average, but overshoots the quantile during calm periods in the market, but undershoots it during turbulent times. Or there may be periodicities in variances, which a good quantile forecast had better incorporate. (See my example above.) Thus, what we are most interested in in the context of time series analysis is not so much whether $I_{\{y_i Christoffersen (1998, International Economic Review ) , or later Clements & Taylor (2003, Journal of Applied Econometrics ) , and recently Dumitrescu, Hurlin & Madkour (2013, Journal of Forecasting ) . If your underlying data have time series characteristics, I'd very much recommend that you look into this literature. Finally, for a somewhat different take on this question, I recommend Gneiting (2011, International Journal of Forecasting ) , who investigates proper scoring rules for quantile forecasts as point forecasts. He shows that all such proper scoring rules are actually slight generalizations of Koenker's $\rho_\tau$ function you note. This might be interesting for you.
