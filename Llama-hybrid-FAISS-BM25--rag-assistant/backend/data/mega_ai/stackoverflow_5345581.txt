ControllerFactory for specific portable area

My main ASP.NET MVC composite application uses a global Unity container to register types. The app sets the controller factory up to use this global container. I would like to refactor this such that each one of my portable areas leverages it's own child Unity container, so that different areas can implement interfaces in varying ways. It seems like I would need to have a different ControllerFactory per area. How would I accomplish that, given that the following sets the factory for all? ControllerBuilder.Current .SetControllerFactory(/* controller factory with global unity container */);
