There are two products JavaSE and JavaEE. EE is the web application/enterprise edition that allows the development and running of web application. SE is the plain Java product that has no EE specifics in it, but is a subset of EE. The SE comes in two types a JDK and a JRE. There is one big difference that may not be obvious, and I am not sure if it applies to all Operating Systems but under Windows the JRE does not have the server HotSpot JVM, only the client one, the JDK has both, and as far as I know all other OS's have both for the JDK and the JRE. The real difference is the the JDK contains the Java compiler, that is the JDK allows you to compile and run Java from source code where as the JRE only allows the running of Java byte code, that is Source that has already been compiled. And yes newer versions bundle a number of extra components, such as NetBeans editor environment and Java in memory Database (derby/cloudscape), but these are optional.
