Why does classifier chain ask for at least 2 classes, when I have it

I'm using Classifier Chain with logistic regression and when i try to use fit, i get This solver needs samples of at least 2 classes in the data, but the data contains only one class: 1 but I'm pretty sure I have two classes in my data, this is my X_test ' with 219990 stored elements in Compressed Sparse Row format> and I have this as my y_train : array([[1, 0, 0, ..., 0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0, ..., 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0, ..., 0, 1, 0], ..., [1, 0, 0, ..., 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0, ..., 0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0, ..., 0, 1, 0]]) and this is the part I'm trying to run cc_clf = ClassifierChain(LogisticRegression(penalty='l1', C=1, dual=False, solver='liblinear')) cc_clf.fit(X_train, y_train) cc_y_pred = cc_clf.predict(X_test) Am i using the classifier chain incorrectly? When I pass in the same data into one vs rest, it works. clf = OneVsRestClassifier(classifier1) clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
