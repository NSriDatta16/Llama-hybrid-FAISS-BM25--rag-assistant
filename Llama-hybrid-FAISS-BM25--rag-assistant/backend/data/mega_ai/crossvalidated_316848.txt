I need help finding the test statistic z

A class survey in a large class for first-year college students asked, "About how many hours do you study during a typical week?" The mean response of the 499 students was x = 15.3 hours. Suppose that we know that the study time follows a Normal distribution with standard deviation σ = 8.5 hours in the population of all first-year students at this university. Regard these students as an SRS from the population of all first-year students at this university. Does the study give good evidence that students claim to study more than 15 hours per week on the average? I have set up the hypotheses as H0: μ = 15 hrs and Ha: μ > 15 hrs. After that, I must find the test statistic Z. What I have been doing is (15-15.3)/8.5. I am not sure what I am doing wrong.
