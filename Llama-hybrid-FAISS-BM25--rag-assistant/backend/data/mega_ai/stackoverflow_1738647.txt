Select statement blocks the read/write operation on the InnoDB table

I have a Select query which executes on a transactional table having more than 4 million records. Whenever I execute this query , I observe that all write and update operations on that particular transactional table become suspended and we start getting exceptions from java side that lock wait timeout exceeds , try restarting transaction. Currently lock wait timeout is set to 200 seconds. I am unable to understand that why a select statement can create such locks on the table and block all insert/update statements. The table storage engine is InnoDb and primary key is auto-increment key. The MySQL Version is 5.1.40. Also I m not starting any transaction before executing select statement. Any Idea?
