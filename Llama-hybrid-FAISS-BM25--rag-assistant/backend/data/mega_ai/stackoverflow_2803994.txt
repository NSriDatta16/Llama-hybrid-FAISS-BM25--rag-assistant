MySql should handle it just fine. I might be a bit worried about the shared hosting setup though. Most shared hosting setups have very restrictive policies on CPU utilization that you might run into. Rather than letting your app drag down the performance of the server, they will often shut down your app for a few minutes if you exceed a certain CPU utilization threshold over some period of time. Of course they don't advertise what those limits are, but I've often run into this issue with various shared hosting accounts. You might be better off going with a cheap VPS type setup. That will (generally) get you a dedicated CPU and no artificial limits. Your server might slow down a bit under heavy load, but at least they won't cut your site off entirely.
