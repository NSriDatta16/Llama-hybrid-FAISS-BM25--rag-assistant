Reconstructing a logistic regression model from literature using published coefficients

I have a logistic regression model with the form: logit(p) = alpha + X*beta Where alpha is the intercept, X is the covariate matrix, and beta the corresponding coeffiecient. I want to be able to reconstruct such a model where I estimate the intercept from a new dataset, but fix the coefficients in the model based on what has been reported in literature. My questions are: Is such an approach possible? If so, could someone guide on a programmatic approach to do this?
