With regard to your first question: you have a few issues. One is that you have to join qualifications twice, since you want to compare the values from one match with another. Another is that your date comparison has no value to compare. It should be x between y and z -- in your example. you have no x . After you join twice, then you can modify your last line to say qual1.instid <> qual2.instid More details if you want, but I think that might get you started. As an aside, I find the SQL join syntax easier to deal with, but to each his own. One issue it helps resolve is the gigantic cartesian join you seem to have, because you don't appear to have any join criteria.
