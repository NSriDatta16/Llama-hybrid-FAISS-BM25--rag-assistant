Have you set your example in a Web Server? Even though many examples work just directly open its local file on your browser (i.e. file:///C:/directory/example.html ) many others require an actual web server to run properly (i.e.: http://localhost/path/example.html ). And I think local files won't work in this example as it has to performs an AJAX call to get the htmlFragment.html file. Are you using any of the following (or any other) web server? Apache HTTP Server lighttpd Apache Tomcat Internet Information Server Visual Studio Built-in Web Server
