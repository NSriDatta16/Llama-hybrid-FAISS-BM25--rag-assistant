jQuery Star Rating plugin - select in callback causes infinite loop

Using the jQuery Star Rating plugin everything works well until I select a star rating from the rating's callback handler. Simple example: $('.rating').rating({ ... callback: function(value){ $.ajax({ type: "POST", url: ... data: {rating: value}, success: function(data){ $('.rating').rating('select', 1); } }); } }); I'm guessing this infinite loop occurs because the callback is fired after a manual 'select' as well. Once a user submits their rating I'd like to 'select' the average rating across all users (this value is in data returned to the success handler). How can I do this without triggering an infinite loop?
