If you only have one "code-left" and one "code-right" on the page, Phill's answer will work great. If you have more than one of these, and are catching the click on "demobox-dark", then trying to get the next "code-left", because you have a paragraph in between the two, it won't really be the next . You could, instead use nextAll instead of next to do this? for example, $(this).nextAll(".code-left:first").slideToggle(600); Good luck!
