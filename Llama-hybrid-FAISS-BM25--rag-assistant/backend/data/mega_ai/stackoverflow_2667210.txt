How useful are design patterns when it comes to web programming?

Background: My organization uses Microsoft .Net (3.5) with SQL Server 2005 as back end. With RAD being the norm and Agile being the widely used process. I have always found using design patterns difficult since it involves a bit more understanding and bit more training. Can you give me some examples where design patterns have solved real time problems in Web programming? What is the criteria for using any design pattern? What is the benefit reaped from it. I know it is a general question but this would help me a bunch.
