Is there a Solr-Camel component?

I've been looking for this for a while and haven't found anything yet. Is there any reason to that ? I would like to proxy a solr server with the camel integration framework and I understand it must be quite straight forward without it, but less elegant :). If someone has worked on this, I would love some feedback. Nicolas.
