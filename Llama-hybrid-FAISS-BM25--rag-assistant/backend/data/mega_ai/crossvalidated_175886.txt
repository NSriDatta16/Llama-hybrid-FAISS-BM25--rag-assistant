Recursive bayesian prediction, which model to use?

Let's say that I have a set of random variables $X=\{X_1,..X_t,..X_T\}$ ($t$ is a time index). I know that every one of these random variables $X_t$ generate a multivariate Gaussian Distribution and are related somehow (for every $i$, $X_i$ and $X_{i+1}$ obe a certain relationship: $X_{i+1}=X_i+D_i$). I want to do a recursive inference and I have no idea what kind of model I should use. So having a full knowledge about the distributions of $X_1,..X_t,..X_T$ (all Gaussians) and knowing the relationship between every two indexed consecutive random variables, I want to be able to predict the last output at time $T$, $Y_T$ for a certain input observation $Y_t$. I googled for nearly an hour and got Gaussian processes (to model time-indexed Gaussian distributions), recursive Bayesian models and Bayesian networks. Can anyone please show me the right direction to start from?
