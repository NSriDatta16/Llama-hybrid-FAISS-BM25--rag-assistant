For a single developer it is ok. But I strictly discourage from using it with more than one developer. The SVN book says: Do not be seduced by the simple idea of having all of your users access a repository directly via file:// URLs. Even if the repository is readily available to everyone via network share, this is a bad idea. It removes any layers of protection between the users and the repository: users can accidentally (or intentionally) corrupt the repository database, it becomes hard to take the repository offline for inspection or upgrade, and it can lead to a mess of file-permissions problems (see the section called “Supporting Multiple Repository Access Methods”.) Note that this is also one of the reasons we warn against accessing repositories via svn+ssh:// URLs—from a security standpoint, it's effectively the same as local users accessing via file://, and can entail all the same problems if the administrator isn't careful. (From: http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.4/svn.serverconfig.choosing.html ) Installing svnserve isn't that complicated and it's really worth putting an hour or two in configuration.
