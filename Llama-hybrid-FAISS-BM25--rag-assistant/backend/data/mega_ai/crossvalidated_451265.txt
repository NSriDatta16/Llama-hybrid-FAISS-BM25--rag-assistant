Well, you have to decide which model you want to assume behind your discrete data-points! If you simply draw linear lines between your points, then averaging the discrete data-points is almost exactly the same as calculating the area/width. (because the 2 outer most data-points would have half weight) So it's the method of fitting that makes the difference! Maybe read this post , where people discuss probability driven fitting of discrete data-points.
