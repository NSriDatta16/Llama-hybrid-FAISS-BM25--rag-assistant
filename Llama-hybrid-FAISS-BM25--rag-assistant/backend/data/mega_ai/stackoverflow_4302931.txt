align-like environment in LaTeX for lines of texts

I am looking for a LaTeX environment, that is capable of formatting given paragraph(s) with a slight indentation and increasing line counters within parenthesis, e.g.: (1) Lorem Ipsum (2) Dolor Sit These numbers should continue to increase throughout the document, i.e. there should be no number used twice. It would behave almost like the align environment- including the possibility to \ref to individual lines, except that I do not wish to use it for math but rather for text snippets. Unfortunately, I am not that LaTeX savvy, so I cannot really define such an environment myself.
