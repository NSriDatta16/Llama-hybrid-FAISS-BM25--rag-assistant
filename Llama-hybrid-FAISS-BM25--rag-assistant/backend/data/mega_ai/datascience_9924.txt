anomaly detection alert system

I need to design and implement my 3rd year project which is a real-time alert system for parents to keep their kids safe with their smartphones. My data is time-based and unsupervised, which means I don't have score for any events, it contains events from : mobile browsing ( http requests ) gps coordinates calls ( outgoing & incoming ) Should I choose cluster based / density based approach ? How do I find rare & suspicious events that parents should be notified for with the help of machine learning ? Any suggestions on how to present the results visually ? Is a week of data enough for training ? Are there any good open sources in Java to detect anomaly ?
