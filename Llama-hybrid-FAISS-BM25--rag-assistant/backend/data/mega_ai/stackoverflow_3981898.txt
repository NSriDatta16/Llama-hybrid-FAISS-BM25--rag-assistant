smallest checksum on a string

scratching my head over this. i have 350 strings average 90 chars long, all strings are unique. Now, i wanna generate a unique id for each string. i tried the sum of chars in the string wich gave two doubles, the returned sum is not unique enough. Anybody any idea how to approach this? I thought of hash(), is that the best solution? abcdef will return the same as abcdfe
