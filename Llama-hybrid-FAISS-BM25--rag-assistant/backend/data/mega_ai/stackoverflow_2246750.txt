I set up listeners for 'moveend', 'zoomend', and 'dragend' to try it out. GEvent.addListener(map, "moveend", function() { console.log('moveend'); }); GEvent.addListener(map, "zoomend", function() { console.log('zoomend'); }); GEvent.addListener(map, "dragend", function() { console.log('dragend'); }); It appears that 'moveend' always fires after 'zoomend' or 'dragend'. However, no events ever fired more than once at a time. Maybe you accidentally set up two simultaneous listeners. You shouldn't need to use stopPropagation or cancelBubble.
