Logistic regression and success probability: Bayesian statistics

I have a Bayesian statistics homework question that I'm not sure of: Running this in R , I got completely flat lines at 0 and 1 so I was thinking this meant that the success probability does not change with this particular prior. Can anyone shed some more light on this problem? mu0 = 0 sig2_0 = 100 n = 10000 b0 = rnorm(n, mean=mu0, sd=sqrt(sig2_0)) x = seq(from=0, to=10, length.out=100) res = matrix(0, length(x), 3) for(i in 1:length(x)){ z = b0 z1 = exp(z) / (1+exp(z)) res[i,] = quantile(z1, c(0.025, 0.5, 0.975)) } plot( x, res[,2], type='l', ylim=range(res), ylab='Success probability', xlab='Covariate') lines(x, res[,1], lty=3) lines(x, res[,3], lty=3)
