I am not an expert but I can say: autoarima() will attempt to fit a integrated auto regressive moving average process to your data. Once the data is appropriately differenced and the auto regressive component and the moving average components are removed you are left with residuals with a variance. In R this is the sigma2 in the arima object. Usually I don't look at sigma2 until I first examine the ACF plots carefully.
