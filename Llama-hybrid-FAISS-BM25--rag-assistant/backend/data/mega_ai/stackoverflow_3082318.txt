You can't modify the incoming request's user agent. It is the value that is sent by the users browser so I'm not sure why you would want to change it anyways. If you were creating an outbound request yourself using the HttpWebRequest class you could set its .UserAgent property, or you could add to the .Headers collection if you were using a WebClient class.
