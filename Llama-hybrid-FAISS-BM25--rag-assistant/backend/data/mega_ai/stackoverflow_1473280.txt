I think what will help you is the test if two strings are anagrams. Here is how you can do it. I am assuming the string can contain 256 ascii characters for now. #define NUM_ALPHABETS 256 int alphabets[NUM_ALPHABETS]; bool isAnagram(char *src, char *dest) { len1 = strlen(src); len2 = strlen(dest); if (len1 != len2) return false; memset(alphabets, 0, sizeof(alphabets)); for (i = 0; i This will run in O(mn) if you have 'm' strings in the file of average length 'n'
