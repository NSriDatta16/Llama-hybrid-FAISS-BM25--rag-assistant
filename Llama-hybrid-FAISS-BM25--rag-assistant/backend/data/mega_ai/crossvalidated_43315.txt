probability of interest

The model that I created in R is: fit what I am unsure of is how to fit to model to predict probability of interest where p = pr(hiring = 1). Edit: This is the computer output for what I have computed so far. I am unsure if this is even a step in the right direction to find the answer to this question. What I am trying to do is, Fit a logistic regression model to predict the probability of being hired using years of education, years of experience and sex of job applicants. > test summary(test) Call: glm(formula = hired ~ educ + exper + sex, family = binomial(link = "logit"), data = data) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.4380 -0.4573 -0.1009 0.1294 2.1804 Coefficients: Estimate Std.
