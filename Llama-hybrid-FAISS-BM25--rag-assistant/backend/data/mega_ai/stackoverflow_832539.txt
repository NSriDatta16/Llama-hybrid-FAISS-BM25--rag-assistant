Saving the order of a list (php/zend/jquery)

I'm using the jQuery library to have an ordered list with the ability to re-order items with drag and drop. I want to send the information of the order to the database and the next time you refresh the page (or load it on another browser/computer) it would have your order. I have a table for each element of the list in mySQL and right now I'm ordering by the creation_date . So what is the best solution and where (and how) do I save the order?
