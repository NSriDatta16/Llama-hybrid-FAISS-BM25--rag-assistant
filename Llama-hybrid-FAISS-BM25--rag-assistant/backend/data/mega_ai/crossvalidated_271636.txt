To me, the issue is less about the sample size, although that does impact the magnitude of the error around any estimates, and more about the fact that you have more features than observations not to mention that these features are not independent. The usual rule of thumb in any multivariate analysis is that you have more data than metrics at a rough ratio of 10 observations per measure. While not a hard and fast rule , this would apply to PCA or any exploratory factor analysis as a cautionary note. In other words, using PCA as a feature selection method could be fraught with hazard. That said, there are known instances where the number of metrics is much, much greater than the data, e.g., chemometrics. The usual multivariate workaround to this challenge is partial least squares (PLS). It is well described in this Wiki article -- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_least_squares_regression -- as a kind of "factor analytic" regression. As the article notes, many packages offer it. It's worth a try with your data.
