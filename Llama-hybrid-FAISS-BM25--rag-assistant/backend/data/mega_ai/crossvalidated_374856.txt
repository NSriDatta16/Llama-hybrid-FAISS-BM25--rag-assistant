Interpretation of logistic regression output in this scenario

Let's say we are using logistic regression model for binary classification with the goal of classifying subjects as healthy or diseased. The output is the probability of the subject being diseased. Does the output probability have anything to do with the level of disease? For example can we say if the output probability is higher this means that the disease is more sever for this subject?
