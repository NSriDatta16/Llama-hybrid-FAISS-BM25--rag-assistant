Run Time Critical, reading operation of CSV files in C

Is there a way to code a swift, efficient way of reading csv files?[the point to note here is: I am talking about a csv file with a million+ lines] The Run Time is the critical metric here. One resource on internet concentrated on using binary file operations to read in bulk. But I am sure, if it will be helpful in reading CSV files There are other methods as well, like Robert Gamble written SourceForge code. Is there a way to write it using native functions? Edit: Lets split the entire question in a clearer and better way: Is there an efficient (Run Time critical) way to read files in C? (in this case a million rows long .csv file) Is there a swift efficient way to parse a csv file?
