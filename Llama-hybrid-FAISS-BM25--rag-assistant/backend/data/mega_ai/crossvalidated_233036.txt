Odd behaviour in CausalImpact (R)

I'm finding some odd behaviour in Google's CausalImpact R package and wondered if anyone has found the same and knows the cause. If you feed the package a certain length time series, the model snaps to a perfect historical fit, no matter what explanatory variables you use. Using code from Google's own toy example, I set up a model, which works fine library(CausalImpact) total.points This site won't let me post more than two image links as I'm new, but the above produces a regular CausalImpact example. Now switch the explanatory variable X1 for a nonsense variable X2 (different seed) that doesn't explain y at all. The result is as you'd expect and the model no longer fits. set.seed(10) x2 Finally, change the historic and predicted periods, so that there is a bit more history and a shorter prediction. Still using only the nonsense X2 variable as explanatory. total.points The model suddenly has an almost perfect historical fit, even though I haven't given it anything useful to explain the past. It does it suddenly - if you use observation 288 as marketing start in the example above, it won't do it. I'm a newbie to the site, but would really appreciate any clues about what it's doing!
