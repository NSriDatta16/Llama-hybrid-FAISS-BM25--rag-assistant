EDIT : Based on the addition of " maybe it's not very "conventionnal", but i want my private page "links" displayed in google index, but next require a registration to display the page. " To the question: You can check the User Agent in your php code to basically allow google to see pages if it was a registered user (google's user agent is "Googlebot/1.0" and you can search to find user agents for other common engines). However, this behavior is specifically against google's rules and they can and will remove your site from the index if they catch you doing it. Their policy is you should not treat googlebot any differently than you treat any random person who visits your site. (Original Answer) One way is to use a sitemap to show google how to find all of your pages. In general, and even in the case of sitemaps, if the content you want indexed is not linked to from a page that can be found through the "root" (/) (i.e. there is no way for the public to find it), then it probably won't get indexed. The only way to get it indexed is to link it in someplace. The question is though, why do you want your private pages in google anyway?
