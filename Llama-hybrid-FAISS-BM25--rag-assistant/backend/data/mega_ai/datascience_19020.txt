Why CNN doesn't give higher accuracy over simple MLP network? [From Keras examples]

I'm still new to machine learning and just came across powerful deep learning library, Keras. I've read Keras document and tried few Keras examples on Github here . I've also studied some basic knowledge and concepts of deep learning from several sources but still haven't really had solid understanding in CNN and RNN which look to be very powerful networks. So, to prove my assumption, I downloaded reuters_mlp.py example from Keras Github which originally uses simple MLP networks as a model. I combined the idea of CNN which I got from imdb_cnn.py example to reuters_mlp.py example and then observed the result. Surprisingly, the result didn't come out like I expected. CNN performed worst than simple MLP networks. Can someone please explain why the accuracy of CNN is lower than the simple MLP networks? Here are the outputs (Tensorflow as backend) 8982 train sequences, 2246 test sequences, 46 classes, num_words=1000 MLP (sequences_to_matrix, mode=bianry): Epoch 1/5 8982/8982 [==============================] - 3s - loss: 1.3236 - acc: 0.6984 Epoch 2/5 8982/8982 [==============================] - 2s - loss: 0.7182 - acc: 0.8250 Epoch 3/5 8982/8982 [==============================] - 2s - loss: 0.4544 - acc: 0.8864 Epoch 4/5 8982/8982 [==============================] - 2s - loss: 0.3197 - acc: 0.9192 Epoch 5/5 8982/8982 [==============================] - 2s - loss: 0.2511 - acc: 0.9356 1920/2246 [========================>.....] - ETA: 0s Test loss: 1.05213204963 Test accuracy: 0.785396260071 CNN (pad_sequences): Epoch 1/5 8982/8982 [==============================] - 81s - loss: 1.9794 - acc: 0.5181 Epoch 2/5 8982/8982 [==============================] - 78s - loss: 1.4289 - acc: 0.6591 Epoch 3/5 8982/8982 [==============================] - 79s - loss: 1.1546 - acc: 0.7175 Epoch 4/5 8982/8982 [==============================] - 78s - loss: 0.9639 - acc: 0.7663 Epoch 5/5 8982/8982 [==============================] - 77s - loss: 0.8378 - acc: 0.7935 2240/2246 [============================>.] - ETA: 0s Test loss: 0.960687935512, Test accuracy: 0.764470169243
