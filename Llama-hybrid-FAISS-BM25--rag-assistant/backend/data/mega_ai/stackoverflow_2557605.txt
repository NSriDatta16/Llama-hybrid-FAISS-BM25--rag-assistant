Using constant accelerations: Definitions: Vi - Initial velocity Va - Average velocity Vo - Ending velocity D - Total distance to be traveled T - Total time for travel t1 - Acceleration time from beginning to Va t2 - Acceleration time from Va to Vo The equation to solve is: (Vi+Va)/2*t1 + Va*(T-t2-t1) + (Va+Vo)/2*t2 = D You should decide how much time the initial acceleration (t1) and the final acceleration (t2) takes and then you are left with only one unknown -> Va, which can be easily solved. EDIT : find the distance as a function of time: Well, now that you know the velocities, it is easy to figure out the distance traveled: D(t) = Vi*t + 0.5*t^2*(Va-Vi)/t1 {0 where t3=(T-t2), D1 and D2 are the distance traveled at the end of the first and second segments, which can be found from the respective functions: D1 = 0.5*(Va+Vi)*t1 D2 = D1 + Va*(t3-t1) EDIT 2 : Solving for Va: (Vi+Va)/2*t1 + Va*(T-t2-t1) + (Va+Vo)/2*t2 = D Remember that t1 and t2 are the problem parameters that you choose. You decide what fraction of the movement the object accelerates and decelerates. Let's say t1=t2=0.1*T. Substitution then gives: (Vi+Va)/2*(0.1T) + Va*(T-(0.1T)-(0.1T)) + (Va+Vo)/2*(0.1T) = D Va*(0.1T/2 + T-0.1T-0.1T + 0.1T/2) + Vi*(0.1T)/2 + Vo*(0.1T)/2 = D Va*(0.9T) + Vi*(0.05T) + Vo*(0.05T) = D Va*(0.9T) = D - Vi*(0.05T) + Vo*(0.05T) Va = (D - (Vi + Vo)*(0.05T)) / (0.9T) Got it?
