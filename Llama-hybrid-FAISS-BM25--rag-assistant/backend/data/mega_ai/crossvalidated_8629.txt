I get the impression that you think that you can get insight into a statistical equation by programming it into either R or C++; you can't. To understand a statistical equation, find an "undergraduate" textbook with lots of homework problems at the end of each chapter that contains the equation, and then do the homework at the end of the chapter containing the equation. For example, to understand PCA you do need a good understanding of linear algebra and in particular singular value decomposition. While learning quantum computing through Michael Nielsen's book, it became apparent to me that I needed to review linear algebra. I came across Gilbert Strang's videos, they were extremely helpful in establishing a foundational understanding of concepts. However, the nuance of the material did not get through until I found a linear algebra book containing alot of homework problems, and then I needed to do them.
