If you know an absolute range for the output, but there is no reason to expect it to have the non-linear characteristic of the typical logistic activation function (i.e. a value in the middle is just as likely as a value near 0 or 1), then you can just transform the output by dividing by the absolute maximum. If the minimum were not 0, you could subtract the absolute minimum before dividing by the value (maximum - minimum). So basically don't try to train the neural network to the raw value, train it to the percentile value (0 for minimum, 1 for maximum).
