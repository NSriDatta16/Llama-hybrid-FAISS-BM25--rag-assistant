I think this question is best answered in a non-programming sense. Say you have 5 balls, and you want to move them around easily. You get a bag and place the 5 balls inside of it. The bag acts as a container. You can now move this bag around, and so quite easily the 5 balls move with it. Simply put, your holding zero or more objects, inside another object for easy retrieval.
