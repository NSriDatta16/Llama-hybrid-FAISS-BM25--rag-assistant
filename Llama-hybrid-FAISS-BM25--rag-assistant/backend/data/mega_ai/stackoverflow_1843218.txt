Can I use Sun's OpenSSO Apache WebAgent to integrate to a CA SiteMinder Policy Server?

The official Web Agents user documentation does not state what version of SAML is supported. I am trying to integrate this with a Policy Server that is not running Sun's OpenSSO policy server, so my only requirement is to support SAML 2.0. Has anyone had experience with this type of setup?
