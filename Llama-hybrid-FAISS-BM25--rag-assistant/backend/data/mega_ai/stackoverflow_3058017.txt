It is actually quite impossible to "pad" estimates in scrum. After a few sprints the velocity will average out and the team will "know" how many points it can commit to. There is nothing to pad. I think you have your statements backwards because Get the job done whenever we will reduce scope, quality or increase resources is an exact description of Waterfall; not scrum. In scrum we have deadlines, it is called the end of the sprint. In scrum we NEVER sacrifice quality because we know that will cost us more in the long run. In scrum we don't add resources because we know that people gel and form a "team" and upsetting that balance is detrimental to productivity. Why are you bothering at all with task times? The only time I have seen good developers pad estimates is if they are forced into giving an estimate for an unknown feature. We don't do this in scrum. We know what the conditions of acceptance of a feature is before we commit to it.
