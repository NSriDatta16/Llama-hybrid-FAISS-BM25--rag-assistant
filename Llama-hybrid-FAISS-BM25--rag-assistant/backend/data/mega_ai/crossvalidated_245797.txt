Different sample size calculations for variable and 1-variable

I am trying to use coefficients of variations ($CV$) to calculate sample size necessary to detect a difference of means ($\mu_0$ vs. $\mu_1$) for a variable that takes on values $x_i \in [0,1]$. I have test-retest data available for $x$ . I am getting differences in sample size calculations for the variable $x$ and $1-x$. I am using the formulas: $$N = \frac{16{CV}^2}{\ln(\mu_0/\mu_1)}$$ and $${CV}^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^k (x_{2,i}-x_{1,i})^2}{2k\bar{x}^2},$$ where $k$ is the number of subjects and $\bar{x}$ is the average of all measurements of $x$ (the number of measurements is $2k$). Working code in R: set.seed(1) var1.1 The result is: $N = 14$ for variable $x$ and $N = 13$ for $1-x$. Clearly, however, the $t$ tests would give the same results for both. How should I proceed in determining the sample size necessary for determining a significant difference in the means of $x$? t test sample size calculations based on effect size and variance If I do sample size calculations for effect size $d = 1.17$ I get a sample size $N = 13$ for a two sample t test for both $x$ and $1-x$, with standard power and significance using the pwr R package. Does this mean sample size calculations obtained from $CV$ can be biased, and if so what should I look out for?
