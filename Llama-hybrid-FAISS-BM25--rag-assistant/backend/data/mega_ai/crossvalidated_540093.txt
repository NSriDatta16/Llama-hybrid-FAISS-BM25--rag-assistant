If you want a horrible but fun way, think of the Coupon collector's problem. Suppose that you have $n$ different cards which you want to collect. At each time $t\,\in\,\mathbb{N}$ , you buy a card, which has probability $1/n$ of being the i-th card (even if you already have it) until you have all cards. You are not allowed to trade with other players. The question is: on average, how long does it take for you to collect all cards? Being more precise, let $(C_t)_{t=1}^\infty$ an i.i.d. sequence of cards, $C_1 \, \sim \, U(\{1,\ldots,n\})$ , and consider $S_t = \{C_1, \ldots, C_t\}$ , the set of unique cards that you have at time $t$ . Defining $$\tau = \inf\{t\,\in\,\mathbb{N}: |S_t| = n\},$$ your goal is to compute $E[\tau]$ . You can show that (just check wikipedia if you are bored) $$E[\tau] = n\sum_{t=1}^n\frac{1}{t}\quad. $$ Therefore, you have that $$\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \left(\frac{E[\tau]}{n} - \log(n)\right) = \gamma \quad.$$ Make $n$ large and use Monte Carlo to estimate $E[\tau]$ . Or produce a card game with those rules, dare your friends to collect all cards, and do a real life Monte Carlo.
