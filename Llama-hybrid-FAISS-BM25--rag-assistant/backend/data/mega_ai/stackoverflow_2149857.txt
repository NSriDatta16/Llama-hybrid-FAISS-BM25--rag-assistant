I would look for a way to limit the 'init' process to running on cpu 1.* Since CPU affinity is inherited, this should cause every other process on the system to also run on cpu 1, until you start your specific special process with cpu affinity set for cpu 2. * Alternatively, after the system has started, you can re-assign the affinity of all currently running processes, but that seems less elegant.
