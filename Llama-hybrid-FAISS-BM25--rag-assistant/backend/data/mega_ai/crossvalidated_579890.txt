Structural Changes - Utilizing R-package strucchange to Test for 0 vs. l or l vs l+1 breaks

I'm using the R-package strucchange ( https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/strucchange/strucchange.pdf ) to test for structural changes in different time series. As far as I understood the method sctest() in the strucchange package (to perform the tests for structural change) has implemented the double maximum test (" maxBB ") to test for an undefined number of structural changes against no change. Bai and Perron (e.g. 2003 - Computation and analysis of multiple structural change models ) extended this approach for F-statistics to tests for 0 vs. a fixed number of breaks l and also l vs. l + 1 breaks. Is it possible to utilize the strucchange packages to run these tests as well and get the corresponding p values and test statistics?
