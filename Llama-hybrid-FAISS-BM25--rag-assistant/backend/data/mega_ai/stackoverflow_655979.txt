How can I make Cobertura/Emma play nice with an Eclipse application?

My company is in the middle of upgrading our build system to use Buckminster (which has gone well). Naturally the managers would like it if we could automatically generate some of the metrics they use for code while we're at it - one of these metrics is coverage for the unit tests. The previous build, which was PDE-based, resulted in a separate headless application which parses through all plugins in the context, looks inside them for test classes, tosses all test cases into a larger suite, and then runs it programmatically, via JUnitResultFormatter.startTestSuite() . In the process it adds some homegrown tests for particular metadata (copyright markings, etc) and tests for package dependency. It seems like I should be able to just export the product for the test app, instrument it with the coverage tool of my choice, and then run it; however, it looks like both the coverage tools want to know the entire classpath they're dealing with. Is it possible to make either of these tools play nice without trawling my entire build workspace for jars and dependencies?
