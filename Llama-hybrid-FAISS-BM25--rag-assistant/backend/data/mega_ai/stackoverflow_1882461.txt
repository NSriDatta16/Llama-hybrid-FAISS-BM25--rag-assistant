Unfortunately one of the main purposes of the cross domain policy is to prevent exactly what it sounds like you're trying to do. Without requiring a cross domain policy to 'ok' the use of the website like this it would be possible to have a simple flash trojan which did a DDOS attack against a website from a bunch of machines. If you're embedding flash it may be possible that AIR has some way to do what you want - but other than a cursory look I haven't used it.
