How do I get a floating footer to stick to the bottom of the viewport in IE 6?

I know this would be easy with position:fixed, but unfortanately I'm stuck with supporting IE 6. How can I do this? I would rather use CSS to be clean, but if I have to use Javascript, that's not the end of the world. In my current implementation I have a "floating footer" that floats above the main content area and is positioned with Javascript. The implementation I have right now is not particular elegant even with the Javascript, so my questions are: Is there a way to do this without Javascript? If I have to use Javascript, are there any "nice" solutions to this floating footer problem? By "nice" I mean something that will work across browsers, doesn't overload the browser's resources (since it will have to recalculate often), and is elegant/easy to use (i.e. it would be nice to write something like new FloatingFooter("floatingDiv") ). I'm going to guess there is no super easy solution that has everything above, but something I can build off of would be great. Finally, just a more general question. I know this problem is a big pain to solve, so what are other UI alternatives rather than having footer content at the bottom of every page? On my particular site, I use it to show transitions between steps. Are there other ways I could do this?
