Without knowing what $parser->stopwords is it's hard to run your sample to see where it's failing. But my first observation is that you aren't passing $frags into parse(), you're passing $clauses. And it's possible that you get through the loops that convert $frags to $clauses without ever assigning anything into $clauses[0]. I would suggest you vardump or print_r $clauses just before the call to parse. Also, I question which [0] is failing? the first or the second? Easy way to tell... do this in parse: function parse($frags) { $i = 0; // more code here, commented out for the time being // below, send response to control hub for output $controller = Controller::getInstance(); if (!isset($frags[$i])) echo "failure at ".__LINE__." [$i]\n"; if (!isset($frags[$i][0])) echo "failure at ".__LINE__." [$i][0]\n"; $controller->setResponse($frags[$i][0]); } That should be informative as to which index is causing php to puke.
