DAM Solutions for full-length movies

Are there any DAM (Digital Asset Management) solutions in the market that can handle storage & classification of full length movies (10 GB and greater). Have heard of solutions from EMC Documentum, Artesia, Oracle UCM and the like but not sure if they handle file sizes this large ? Any open-source systems ?
