Printing '%' with printf in C/C++

Possible Duplicate: How to escape the % (percent) sign in C's printf How can I print '%' in C? E.g.: printf("A: %.2f%", pc); ...fails, the compiler complains there is an invalid conversion. Of course an easy way is; printf("A: %.2f%c", pc, '%'); But it's rather inelegant... I looked on the web, but I didn't find any escape sequence for %. I thought % would work, but it doesn't.
