If you use method="GET" on your form the HTML specification states that the user agent should send a GET request to the url used in the action attribute and append values as query string arguments. If you use method="POST" on your form the HTML specification states that the user agent should send a POST request to the action attribute and write the values of form fields in the POST request body. Conclusion: what you are trying to achieve is impossible with plain HTML. One way to achieve this would be to use javascript and subscribe for the onsubmit event of the form, build the request url and manually redirect to it after canceling the default behavior. Example with jQuery: $('form').submit(function() { var url = this.action + '/' + $('#FromDate').val() + '/' + $('#ToDate').val(); window.location.href = url; return false; }); But personally I would stick with a POST verb.
