backfill missing data in a time series

I have a time series {y_t, t=1,2,3,...,N} and y_t is missing in the period[t=s, t=s+1, ... t=s+M]. I want to backfill y_t using regression based on other time series {x_t} in a rolling-manner. Specifically, I use the sample before t=s to run a regression of y_t on x_t, and predict y_s based on the regression estimation; then I add the data t=s into the sample and run the regression again, to predict y_s+1; and so on, until I can predict y_s+M. After I do that, I found that the predicted value of y_s+M is quite different from y_s+M+1, which essentially create a big jump to the time series y_t from t=s+M to t=S+M+1. So is there any way that I can get rid of this issue? Or is there any better method to backfill y_t? Thanks a lot.
