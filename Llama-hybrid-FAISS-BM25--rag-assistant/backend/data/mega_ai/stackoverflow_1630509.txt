Finding *two* html tags with Regular Expressions

I need to pull out the content out of two paragraph tags and break it with a tag. The input is like so Yay StackOverFlow It needs to be like Yay StackOverflow What I have so far is (.*) /', $content, $match); echo($match[1])."..."; ?> Which pulls the first paragraph tag only: Yay... Also, is it possible to set a character limit? A max of 40 characters for example from both of the paragraphs or would I have to use substr ? Thanks! So it turned out to be: \s* /', ' ', $content); echo substr("$content",0,180)."..."; ?>
