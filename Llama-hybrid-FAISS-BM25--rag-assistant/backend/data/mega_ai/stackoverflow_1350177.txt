To group by multiple properties, you need to create a new object to group by: var groupedResult = from person in db.People group by new { person.Sex, person.Age } into personGroup select new { personGroup.Key.Sex, personGroup.Key.Age, NumberInGroup = personGroup.Count() } Apologies, I didn't see your final edit. I may be misunderstanding, but if you sum the age, you can't group by it. You could group by sex, sum or average the age...but you couldn't group by sex and summed age at the same time in a single statement. It might be possible to use a nested LINQ query to get the summed or average age for any given sex...bit more complex though. EDIT: To solve your specific problem, it should be pretty simple and straightforward. You are grouping only by name, so the rest is elementary (example updated with service and concrete dto type): class ProductInventoryInfo { public string Name { get; set; } public decimal Total { get; set; } } class ProductService: IProductService { public IList GetProductInventory() { // ... var groupedResult = from product in db.Products group by product.ProductName into productGroup select new ProductInventoryInfo { Name = productGroup.Key, Total = productGroup.Sum(p => p.ProductCost * p.ProductQty) } return groupedResult.ToList(); } }
