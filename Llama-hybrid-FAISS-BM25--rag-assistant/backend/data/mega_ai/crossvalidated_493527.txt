Logistic Regression R

I am learning R. This is from the book "R for Everyone" by Jared Lander. I was learning logistic regression on some housing data. The code below came from the book: acs = 100000) income1 I then tried to apply the model result back into the data "acs". library(modelr) # apply the model to data X In sampling "Income", it shows the two rows with income of $99,900 and $ 100,000. acs[2858:2859, "Income"] But the result of applying model shows probability of 0.4960143 0.2282368. probY[2858:2859] Why the lower income row has higher probability of >= $100,000?
