Should rescaling be used on test images in keras?

I am kind of confused regarding the topic. I have built a CNN architecture for the cat-dog image classification around 6000 images of cat and 6000 images of dog and I am predicting on test images. I have used Rescaling() in my layers. inputs = layers.Input(shape=(256, 256) + (3,)) x = layers.Rescaling(1.0/255)(inputs) My question should we use rescaling on the test images and then feed it for predict() or should we not ? Say a image of cat I feed into the model. When I am predicting the test images without rescaling it gives me 100% cat and 0% dog probabilities. But when I am rescaling the image img_array = keras.preprocessing.image.img_to_array(img) img_array = img_array/255 # Rescaling img_array = tf.expand_dims(img_array, 0) # Create batch axis before feeding the image, it gives me around 78% cat and 21% dog. Suppose if I have a image of dog, without rescaling gives 0.03% cat and 99.97% dog and with rescaling gives 78% cat and 21% dog.
