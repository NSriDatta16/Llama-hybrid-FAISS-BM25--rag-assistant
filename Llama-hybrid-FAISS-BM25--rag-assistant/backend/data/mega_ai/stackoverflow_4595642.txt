I think you should have a look to TeamCity, this is a very nice tool to automate all sort of test, and in particular case those with NUnit, we use TeammCity for: Nunit : test code base of 3 000 tests NCover: to measure coverage Documentation generation Web Test (with NUnit and WatiN) Code sanity checks We used to have Cruise Control 3 years ago and I have to say that it is less stable then TeamCity (or it was). EDIT: And TeamCity is a distributed architecture that let you have 3 agents (if you take the free license) that runs every sort of build you've configured.
