When is it time to port an old application to new platform?

I'm working for a company that has an established application written in VB6. The application is stable and continues to provide the company with good income. However, it is beginning to show its age and noises are been made to port to a more modern platform such as .Net. Since this is hardly ever a cut and dry decision I would appreciate input on when it is a good time to port a long standing application to a modern platform. Some of the pros and cons that I have already worked through: In favor of porting Finding skills for an old programming language becomes harder and more expensive Support from the platform vendor ends at some point Leveraging modern programming practises on the old platform becomes harder or impossible Rewriting provides the opportunity to improve existing practises Moving to a modern platform is motivating for the development team Moving to a modern platform provides marketing opportunities Against porting "If its not broken don't fix it" The cost of rewriting versus the return Risks associated with the transition from the old to the new application Upskilling existing software engineers Some related StackOverflow questions: What makes code legacy? When do you say that the code is Legacy code?
