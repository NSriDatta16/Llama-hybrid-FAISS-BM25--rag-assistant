A member of another forum posted this solution So all your sprites normally receive touch events? If you know when the sound is playing, you just could have them check that and ignore the touch if the sound is playing. For example, if your sprites implement the CCTargetedTouchDelegate protocol, you could do something like: - (BOOL)ccTouchBegan:(UITouch*)touch withEvent:(UIEvent*)event { if (soundIsPlaying) { return NO; // i.e., the sprite is currently uninterested in the touch } // Other checks and behaviour here. return YES; }
