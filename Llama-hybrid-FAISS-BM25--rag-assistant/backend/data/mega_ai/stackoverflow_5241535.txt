Drag and drop item from UITableView to UITableView

I know there are number of threads available on stackoverflow regarding drag & drop between two UITableView but I am not able to work on it smoothly. Please do not post links of that stackoverflow as a refrence here in this thread because I have already gone through that. So.... I have created a main UIViewController under which I have added two UITableView i.e. tableView1, tableView2 Under which I have added customCell and UIView enclosed with images on that cell. Now if i will use touchesMoved delegate its not working at all for me. Instead of I have gesture recognizer like so: //Custom cell for planned spend details progress bars.... - (void) customCell:(UITableViewCell *)cell { UIView *progressView = [[UIView alloc]initWithFrame:CGRectMake(2.0, 2.0, 320.0, 97.0)]; [self setProgressBars:progressView]; progressView.userInteractionEnabled=YES; [self addGestureRecognizersToView:progressView]; [cell.contentView addSubview:progressView]; cell.selectionStyle=UITableViewCellSelectionStyleNone; [progressView release]; } setProgressBars is a method where I have added UIImageView. Now using UIRotationGestureRecognizer I am able to drag and drop UIImageViews within single UITableView. Its not working at all If I will drag outside the premises of that UITableView. Please help in order to resolve my problem so that I am able to drag items from one UITableView to another
