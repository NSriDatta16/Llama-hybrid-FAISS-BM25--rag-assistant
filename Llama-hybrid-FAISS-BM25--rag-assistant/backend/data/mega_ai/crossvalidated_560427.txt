Low test R-squared in random forest regression

I am getting low R-squared value in test set for random forest regression compared to training R-squared. I tried to tune hyperparameters using GridSearch, but it didn't help. I have only 183 samples with 15 predictors. How can I solve this kinda underfitting issues. I appreciate your suggestions. Thanks! Here is the sample data: Here is my code: forest = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=50, criterion='squared_error', random_state=1, n_jobs=-1) forest.fit(X_train, y_train) y_train_pred = forest.predict(X_train) y_test_pred = forest.predict(X_test) mae_train = mean_absolute_error(y_train, y_train_pred) mae_test = mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_test_pred) print(f'MAE train: {mae_train:.2f}') print(f'MAE test: {mae_test:.2f}') r2_train = r2_score(y_train, y_train_pred) r2_test =r2_score(y_test, y_test_pred) print(f'R^2 train: {r2_train:.2f}') print(f'R^2 test: {r2_test:.2f}') Model result without tuning hyperparameters: Model result with tuning hyperparameters:
