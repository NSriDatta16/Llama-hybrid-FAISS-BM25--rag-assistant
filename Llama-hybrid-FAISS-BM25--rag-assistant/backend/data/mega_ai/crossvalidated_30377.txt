Calculate R-squared with JAGS and R

I have the following model that I am running in JAGS from R: model { for( i in 1:nData){ y[i] ~ dnorm(mu[i], tau) mu[i] It is a simple regression model with a gamma prior on the beta coefficients. I can run the model and get some reasonable results, but my boss wants to know whether the Bayesian flavor is better than a normal OLS regression, and to this end he wants me to calculate an R^2 statistic for both models. I am fairly new to Bayesian statistics, so if anyone could share some R code to illustrate how it is done, I would be very grateful!
