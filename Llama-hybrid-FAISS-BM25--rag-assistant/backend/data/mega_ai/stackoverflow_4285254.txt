Libraries should be specified during the linking step. Such information simply doesn't belong inside a translation unit. A translation unit can be preprocessed, compiled and assembled even without a linking stage. Simply because #pragma comment(lib,"xxx.lib") is in the source file does not mean the compiler consumes it. In fact, it goes in as a comment and is subsequently used by the linker. Not much different than *nix.
