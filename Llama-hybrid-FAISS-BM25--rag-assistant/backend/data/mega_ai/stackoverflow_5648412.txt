Small update: Since the Git 2.x releases, Git for Windows is based off of MSYS2 and available in 32 and 64 bit binary form. It still is a fork, and not interchangeable with the real MSYS2. One thing you must understand: msysgit (the git you are using) is a fork of msys with added git functionality. A lot of unix tools are included in the msys shell (for a full list, see the msysgit/bin folder). It might be possible to add additional msys tools to the msysgit bin folder, but I would not risk my head on that. In light of this, I think it would be optimal to just add your toolchain to the msysgit path (using the bash profile file or whatever in the msysgit tree) and just use that. If a particular utility is missing, add it from the MinGW-msys tree and hope it works OK. Alternatively, just use msys-git from cmd.exe. Since recent versions, it works very well (including git show, editing commit messages etc...). To do that, add the /cmd directory to PATH, and you can use all the git commands you want. This is what I do, as msys is a drag, but a necessary evil for git to work on Windows. UPDATE: detailed instructions to add a directory to PATH under any kind of MSYS: export PATH=/d/MinGW/bin:$PATH or hackishly find /etc/profile and change this section if [ $MSYSTEM == MINGW32 ]; then export PATH=".:/usr/local/bin:/mingw/bin:/bin:$PATH" else export PATH=".:/usr/local/bin:/bin:/mingw/bin:$PATH" fi to: if [ $MSYSTEM == MINGW32 ]; then export PATH=".:/usr/local/bin:/d/MinGW/bin:/bin:$PATH" else export PATH=".:/usr/local/bin:/bin:/mingw/bin:$PATH" fi There is no cleaner way because the msys-git people disabled the fstab functionality present in vanilla msys. Update from Nick (what I did to make it work): I created file in C:\Program Files\Git\etc called bash_profile . This is the contents of the file: export PATH=$PATH:/d/mingw/bin:/d/mingw/msys/1.0/bin make and gcc worked. The bash_profile does not come with msysgit so you won't overwrite it if you update.
