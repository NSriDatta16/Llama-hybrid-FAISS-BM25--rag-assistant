rails time demon in my machine... it eats 2 hours have checked everything!

I have my checked my environment.rb config.time_zone = 'Prague' Nothing in development.rb regarding time This seems to work, in theory... Time.zone.now # Thu, 10 Sep 2009 17:51:35 CEST +02:00 also correct... Time.now # Thu Sep 10 17:52:10 +0200 2009 mysql... SELECT NOW() # 2009-09-10 17:53:48 correct! but when I create a new record in rails or update an old one Item.create(:price => price, :spots => beds) # 2009-09-10 15:55:28 and have restarted rails many many times!
