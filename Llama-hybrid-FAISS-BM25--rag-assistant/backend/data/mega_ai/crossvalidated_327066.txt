All of the RNNs I see in educational materials have only one layer, why is that?

For example http://www.wildml.com/2015/09/recurrent-neural-networks-tutorial-part-1-introduction-to-rnns/ Can RNN's only have one layer for some reason? Or do these examples just use one layer to simplify the concept?
