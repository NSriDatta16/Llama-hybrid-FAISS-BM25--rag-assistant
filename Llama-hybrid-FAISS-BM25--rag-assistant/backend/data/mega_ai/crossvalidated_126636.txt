Trying to start working towards an answer... Richard, welcome to CV. As it is, we'll need much more information in order to put together sensible recommendataions. And you'll need to read up basics about statistical modeling and pattern recognition, in order to communicate with us using vocabulary all sides here understand. Is a neural network the only way to learn input/output relation? No. Transforming inputs to outputs is something a large number of methods does. Supervised models do so modeling the output as dependent variable. Among them are both regression and classification models. @Emre already pointed you towards logistic regression as one type of model for describing probablities of events. This is actually somewhere at the boundary between classification and regression - it is a regression technique as continuous probabilities are modeled, but the probabilities can be meant for class membership, which is a classification setting. (There's an interesting link between neural networks and logistic regression: logistic regression models can be fit by a neural network with logistic sigmoid and no hidden neurons) Please note that regression (in some fields aka calibration) and classification serve fairly different purposes: regression is for continuous output whereas classification deals with assigning cases to pre-specified groups as output. linear regression is not the same as logistic regression. According to the confusion table in your question your data set is extremely imbalanced: almost all cases belong to class 0 . This is a much harder situation to model than fairly balanced data. I suspect this may be a case for one-class classification which is meant for finding out-ouf-specification cases. Again, that is a fairly specialized task. One hugely important rule with statistical modeling/pattern recognition is that the method you employ should be chosen according to the type of problem and data you have. Thus, we need more information about what you actually try to achieve and what your data is.
