I know of no time series data as ubiquitous as the Iris or MNIST data sets however you might want to take a look at the M3 competition data found here . A description of the competition is available here . The data is also available in an R package on CRAN Another forecasting competition held at IJCNNâ€™04 is the CATS benchmark, which is discussed in Time series prediction competition: The CATS benchmark . A description of the data can be found here and the data is available here Edit There has been a new M4 Competition run, the data as well as a description of the data is available here . The M4 consists of 100,000 time series of Yearly, Quarterly, Monthly and Other (Weekly, Daily and Hourly) data. The minimum number of observations is 13 for yearly, 16 for quarterly, 42 for monthly, 80 for weekly, 93 for daily and 700 for hourly series. The 100,000 time series of the dataset come mainly from the Economic, Finance, Demographics and Industry areas, while also including data from Tourism, Trade, Labor and Wage, Real Estate, Transportation, Natural Resources and the Environment. A genereal overview of the M(akridakis) competitions is available on wikiepedia The Makridakis Competitions (also known as the M Competitions or M-Competitions) are a series of open competitions organized by teams led by forecasting researcher Spyros Makridakis and intended to evaluate and compare the accuracy of different forecasting methods.
