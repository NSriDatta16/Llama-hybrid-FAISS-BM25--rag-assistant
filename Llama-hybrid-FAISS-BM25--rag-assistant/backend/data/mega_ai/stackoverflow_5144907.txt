I know you requested a regex solution, but don't shoot the messenger when I say that regular expressions are not the right tool for this job. You could have an elegant solution by reading the file as lines, and skipping the second one: string fileContents = String.Join(Environment.NewLine, File.ReadAllLines("filepath").Where((line, index) => index != 1));
