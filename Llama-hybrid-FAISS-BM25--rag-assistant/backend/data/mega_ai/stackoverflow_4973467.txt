purpose of IBM Cognos Business Intelligence and Financial Performance Management?

I've been mandated to find out what IBM Cognos does, and I cannot find useful information on the subject apart what I can read from the IBM Website and Wikipedia . What I'm after is some concrete examples of what Cognos can do for businesses and organisations that intend to use it.
