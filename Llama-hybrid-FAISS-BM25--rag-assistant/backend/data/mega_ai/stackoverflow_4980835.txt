From the Excel 2003 specifications page , the maximum number precision is 15 digits. If the value 543523564537567457657567345 wasn't treated as text when entered into Excel then the best you will be able to retrieve is 5.43523564537567E+26. The Text property shows the displayed value of the cell with reference to the current number format whereas the Value property shows the actual stored value. Neither of these can be used to restore lost precision in excess of the 15-digit limitation. If the value was not originally treated as Text by Excel then you won't be able to retrieve the lost precision. To be treated as text when entered via the UI, the value must be added to a cell which had Text format before the value was entered or the value must be added to a General format cell with the value preceded by a single quote. To be treated as text when entered via VBA, the value must be enclosed in double quotes. Looking at the stored value in the XML produced from the spreadsheet will also shows you the underlying data. In this example I stored the same value in A1 and A2 but A1 was treated as a number whereas A2 was treated as text and you can see the difference in the XML fragment below (look at both the ss:Type and the x:Ticked parameters - see here ): 5.4352356453756703E+26 543523564537567457657567345 NB to quickly generate the XML for a specific Range in Excel, access the Value property as usual but pass the parameter xlRangeValueXMLSpreadsheet or its Integer equivalent of 11
