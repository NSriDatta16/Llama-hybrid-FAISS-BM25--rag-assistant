How do i anchor subviews of a UIScrollView like the URL bar in mobile safari?

I want to do something similar to how mobile safari keeps its URL bar anchored at the top of the screen while a page is loading unless you scroll past the top, in which case it scrolls down with the rest of the content. I, however, want the opposite to happen; I want specific subviews to scroll off the screen if I scroll down, but if I scroll to the top I want the subviews to stay anchored at the top of the screen while the rest of the content continues to scroll down. I suppose I could do some trickery with the view hierarchy where the subviews change their superview when we scroll to the top, but I'm wondering if there are any other more elegant solutions to this.
