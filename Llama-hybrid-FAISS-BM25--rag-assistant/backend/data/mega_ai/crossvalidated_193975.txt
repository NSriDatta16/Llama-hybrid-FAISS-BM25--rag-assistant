Time series forecasting with many predictors

Suppose I want to forecast a time series $y$ using its own lags and a large set of potential candidate predictors $X$. The model could be specified as follows: $$y_t = a + \rho \cdot y_{t-1} + \beta \cdot X_{t-1} + e_t$$ The objective is to find methods with good out-of-sample forecast performance. So far I have used bayesian and non-bayesian shrinkage methods (e.g. Bayesian Model Averaging, Ridge, LASSO, Least Angle Regression) as well as principal component analysis. Which alternative methods could be promising in this context? Preferably I would like to implement them in R if packages are available.
