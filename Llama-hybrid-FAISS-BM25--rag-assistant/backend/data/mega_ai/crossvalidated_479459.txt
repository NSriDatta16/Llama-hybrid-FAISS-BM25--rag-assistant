From your particular description of your problem, your goal is performing some exploratory data analysis. One field of Machine Learning is called Unsupervised Learning . I believe this is what you should look into. The previous answer suggested hierarchical clustering. That is a good method for performing exploratory data analysis from a small-ish number of observations. Two other interesting methods to look into are k-means clustering and neural networks (if you have enough observations). Neural networks can be used for unsupervised or supervised learning. Doing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to be able to plot your data in 2D is a possible first step for you to get a look at a projection of your data and it can show you which countries mix and which are distinctive at first glance (by coloring the points by country, for example).
