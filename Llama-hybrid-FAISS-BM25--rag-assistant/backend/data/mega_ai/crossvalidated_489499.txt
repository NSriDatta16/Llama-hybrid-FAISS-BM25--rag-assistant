Is there a way to measure the degree of similarity between two columns?

I have a dataset of a list of genes with predicted scores (of likelihood to cause disease) from 2 different machine learning classifiers: Gene Score1 Score2 RP11-983P164 0.2678077 0.2119513 SLC25A20 0.2644568 0.2586816 GLS 0.2560175 0.2631010 IKZF4 0.2468294 0.2189585 NRIP3 0.2446390 0.2170968 SENP1 0.2372014 0.2724868 SLC27A6 0.2321821 0.2218227 SRFBP1 0.2293986 0.2688244 OBFC1 0.2279012 0.2187441 STEAP2 0.2239941 0.2001475 I want to measure if any of the two predicted scores per gene are significantly different from each other, or if the predictions are very similar. I have a biology background so I'm not sure what to start with searching for this, and so sorry if I've asked this question in the wrong place, any help would be appreciated. Edit: I now have 6 score columns in total (all look similar to Score1 and Score2 ) - are there any other statistical tests I can do? Would it be worth doing a t-test?
