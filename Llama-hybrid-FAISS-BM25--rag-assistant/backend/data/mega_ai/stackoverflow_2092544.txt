Javascript tabs widget with drag and drop reordering

Do you know of a tab widget that has built-in drag+drop reordering? I'm building an editor-like interface and want to allow the user to reorder their tabs. So far I've been using ExtJS with a community plugin , but it's buggy and usually needs updating with every new ExtJS release.
