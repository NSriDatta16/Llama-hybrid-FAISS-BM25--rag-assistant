Windows 7 - translucent drag manager?

When dragging a file from Windows Explorer into other apps, I now get a nice icon of the files I drag. I cannot remember this from previous Windows versions so I was hoping that they finally implemented the equivalent of the Translucent Drag Manager where you can associate a transparent image with the drag contents. Does anyone know anything about this?
