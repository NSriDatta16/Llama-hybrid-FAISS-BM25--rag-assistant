A buffer is just a container to hold data for a short period of time when more comes in at any given time than a consumer can use / process. It's a first-in, first-out situation - the data comes in, might be buffered, and goes out in the same order it came in, after a while. A cache is a storage for speeding up certain operations. Things get put in a cache, and should be retrieved from it multiple times, over and over again. There's no "flowing through the cache" kind of mechanism - data doesn't come in and go out in the same order - but it's just a holding container. The order might be anything, really - items are addressed via a key, they don't "flow through" but they are "put in" and stay there (until they're thrown out because of not being used, or because the system goes down).
