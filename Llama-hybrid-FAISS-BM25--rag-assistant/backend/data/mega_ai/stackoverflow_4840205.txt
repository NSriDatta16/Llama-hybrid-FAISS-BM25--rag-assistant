When used with two lists, mapcar applies the function pair-wise to the lists (and with three lists it applies them triple-wise etc.). So (mapcar #'assoc '(a s) '((a . b) (c . d) (s . f))) is the same as ( (assoc 'a (a . b)) (assoc 's (c . d)) ) (when used with lists of different length, mapcar uses the size of the smallest list). To get what you want, you should do: (mapcar (lambda (x) (assoc x '((a . b) (c . d) (s . f)))) '(a s))
