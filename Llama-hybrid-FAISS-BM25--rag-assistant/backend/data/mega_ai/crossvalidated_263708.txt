Possibly because some of the earliest machine learning algorithms were implemented as actual physical machines. From Wikipedia: The perceptron was intended to be a machine, rather than a program, and while its first implementation was in software for the IBM 704, it was subsequently implemented in custom-built hardware as the "Mark 1 perceptron". (Picture from Cornell Library via Wikipedia) ADALINE (Adaptive Lineardi Neuron or later Adaptive Linear Element) is an early single-layer artificial neural network and the name of the physical device that implemented this network. A source for more information about these machines is the book Talking Nets .
