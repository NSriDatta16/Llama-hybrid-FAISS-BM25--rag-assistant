I would guess that ParentStorage is null because it is being lazily loaded. Either configuring it to be fetched eagerly or forcing a read by calling the getter before serialization may help make sure the Storage is serialized, and depending on your ID scheme this may work (I don't know for sure). The gains from serialization in this case seem minimal, and may have unexpected consequences as the Box and Storage classes evolve. It seems simpler to send up a single string for the name, load the Box, set the string, and save that object. Then you don't have to worry as much about the optimizations Hibernate does underneath.
