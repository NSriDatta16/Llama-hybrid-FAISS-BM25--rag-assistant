Testing first differenced time series - trend or not?

I have a question on testing for stationarity with the ADF test, in order to determine the order of integration. We do have a time series that looks in plot(df) obviously trending at level and has a high fluctuation ("drift+trend"). We therefore assume, that we have to apply following script from vars to get an appropriate ADF test result: ur.df(df, type = "trend", selectlags = "BIC") Assume the test finds that the time series is not stationary (,as the plot already suggested). We therefore proceed testing the first difference of the time series: ur.df(diff(df), type = "trend", selectlags = "BIC") Is it okay to consider " trend " in the test, when we know that diff(df) looks stationary in plot(diff(df)?
