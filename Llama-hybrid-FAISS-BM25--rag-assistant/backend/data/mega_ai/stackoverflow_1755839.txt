If you want absolutely nothing draggable/clickable, disabling typing in input fields etc, I'd consider showing a absolutely positioned transparent div over the entire page, so that every click will be on the div, which will do nothing. That will grant you swift and neat switching on and off of this click-disabler, without having to register heaps of listeners
