Intepreting 'one-unit' Change in Logistic Regression

I have very easy question that I'm hoping someone can assist me with: I ran an example logistic regression using this R code: hours |z|) (Intercept) -4.0777 1.7610 -2.316 0.0206 * hours 1.5046 0.6287 2.393 0.0167 * --- Signif. codes: 0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1 (Dispersion parameter for binomial family taken to be 1) Null deviance: 27.726 on 19 degrees of freedom Residual deviance: 16.060 on 18 degrees of freedom AIC: 20.06 Number of Fisher Scoring iterations: 5 round(exp(cbind(OR = coef(mylogit), confint(mylogit))),3) OR 2.5 % 97.5 % (Intercept) 0.017 0.000 0.281 hours 4.503 1.698 23.223 I know that by taking the exponent of the log-odds/coefficients for hours the odds of passing increase by a factor of 4.503 for a one-unit change in hours. However, given that the explanatory variable (hours) is continuous, what is considered a 'one-unit change' i.e. going from 1 to 2 hours as one unit? or from 1.75 to 1.76 hours as one unit? Also, is this interpretation of one-unit the same for regular OLS regression as well? I'm seeking to better understand the rules R applies to creating its regression coefficients.
