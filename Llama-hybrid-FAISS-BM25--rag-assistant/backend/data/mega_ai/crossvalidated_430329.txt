The comments you refer to in your last paragraph are correct, but perhaps misleading. It is true that regression does not make an assumption about the distribution of the dependent variable (it assumes things about the errors). But just because a model doesn't violate assumptions doesn't mean it is a good model. Remember that the usual regression models are models of the mean. Often, with a bimodal or multimodal response, the mean is not interesting. Often you would not use it as a measure of location -- in fact, there might not be a single good measure of location. So, if you aren't interested in the mean, why model it? One way around this is quantile regression. Here you could regress on the quantiles that are peaks of your combined data.
