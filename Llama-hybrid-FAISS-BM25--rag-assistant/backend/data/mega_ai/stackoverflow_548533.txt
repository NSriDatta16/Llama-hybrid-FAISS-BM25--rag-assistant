Good Single User Open Source Persistant Database that's easy to install and works with Open Office Base?

I'm creating a program for end-users, that's already written using MySQL and some OpenOffice.org Star Basic Macros. I was wondering if there was an open source single user database that would be easy enough for the average Joe to install, (or that I could write a macro to install it for him...)
