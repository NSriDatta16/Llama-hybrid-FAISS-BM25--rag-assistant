The stock returns that you are trying to model as dependent variables presumably don't have this problem of cutoffs, so you might be able to proceed with a regression approach. (This is different from your earlier question , where you were asking about correlations presumably among your predictor variables.) In a regression the distributions of the predictor variables don't necessarily matter; what matters is the distribution of errors after you have fit your model. You can't know that until you try to build the model. It sounds like you might at least have a case study for starting to learn about the issues you have raised. The best introductory guide to these issues that I know is An Introduction to Statistical Learning . There you will learn that there are much better approaches to these problems than the ones you have suggested in your question. One hundred variables aren't necessarily too many, provided that you take the appropriate cautions that the authors explain to avoid over-fitting, such as ridge regression with cross-validation (which directly deals with collinearity). If you are new to regression and statistics then you should be warned that regression on time series, as you seem to intend, poses additional problems. The value of one variable at one time may be correlated with its value at another time, leading to interesting problems even in forecasting individual time series. See this online resource for an introduction. Such issues need to be addressed before you can make much progress on a multivariate time series model (which is beyond my expertise). This Cross Validated page has further references on time series analysis. I remain worried about a feature of the data that you explained in your earlier question, which is that the data are presented as a percentage of the maximum value seen over a particular time period. Maximum values can be very poorly behaved so that any variable scaling derived from the maxima may also have distributions that pose problems for your analysis, particularly if you use your model in the future where a value of "100" might mean something other than what it meant in building your model. But sometimes you have to work with the data you have instead of the data you might wish for.
