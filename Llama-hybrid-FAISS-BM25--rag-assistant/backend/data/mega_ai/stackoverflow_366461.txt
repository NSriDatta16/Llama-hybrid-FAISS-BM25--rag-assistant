It would be really helpful if you updated your question to describe the platforms and compilers you are using. A strategy I have used is running the system on an emulator that can trace all the instructions. This instruction trace can then be used to work out the code coverage. On UNIX you could also run a process using ptrace() to single step the application, and thereby capture the instructions executed. If you just want function call tracing you could do some nasty hacking of the procedure linkage table to jump to some specialised logging code, but that is probably crazy. Again, more details on the execution environment and the level of detail would be required to give a useful answer.
