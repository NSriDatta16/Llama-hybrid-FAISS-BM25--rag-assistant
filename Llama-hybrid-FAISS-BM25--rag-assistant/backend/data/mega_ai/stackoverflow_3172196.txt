On my Linux systems I ignore apt-get for Ruby, except for the default ruby package that goes into /usr/bin. I will load any other version, like 1.8.7-head or 1.9.1-whatever using RVM into my own space if it's just for me. If the ruby being installed is system-wide I will use a source tarball and install into /usr/local/bin and adjust my path or the #! line in the source code to determine which version I want invoked. In my experience Ruby is easy to install on Ubuntu or any Linux as long as I don't use the packages. I know that hurts the feelings of the package maintainers but I haven't found their fruits to be to my taste very often. For the average user I highly recommend RVM for development and testing as you can have multiple rubies installed and jump back and forth easily by using a #!/usr/bin/env ruby invocation and letting RVM adjust the version I'll run against by doing a rvm use 1.8.7 or rvm use 1.9.1 . Or, you can run commands against each installed instance by using rvm ruby ... . RVM is a great piece of software and Wayne should be knighted. :-)
