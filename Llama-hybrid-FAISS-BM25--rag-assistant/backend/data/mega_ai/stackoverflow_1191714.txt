Sunbird, the open source Mozilla calendar, is based on sqlite. I just downloaded and unzipped their source code. It has .sql files in it. http://archive.mozilla.org/pub/calendar/sunbird/releases/0.9/source/lightning-sunbird-0.9-source.tar.bz2 The file mozilla\calendar\providers\storage\schema-7.sql is the schema sunbird uses to make valid iCal files, so it can't be too bad.
