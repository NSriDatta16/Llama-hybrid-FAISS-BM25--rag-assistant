How to move/drag an entire android view that contains a bunch of shapes inside?

I know how to drag a Ball around by extending View and overriding OnDraw and then calculating the new coordinates and redrawing my Ball. What if I have hundreds of shapes inside that view and need the entire view moved around with all the shapes together. Recalculating for every single shape doesn't seem feasible. On the Iphone I can draw a bunch of things inside a view and then move the entire view and it takes care of drawing the things inside the view for me. I only have to recalculate the coordinates of the view and then set the position not for everything inside the view. Is that possible on Android? Thanks, Steven
