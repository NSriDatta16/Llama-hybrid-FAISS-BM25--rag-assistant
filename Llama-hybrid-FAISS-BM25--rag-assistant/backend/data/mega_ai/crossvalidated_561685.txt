Perform glm on presence/absence data

I have a large presence/absence matrix of genes from different strains of S. aureus. I conducted a PCA and observed differences between my conditions. Now, I would like to find out which genes drive this variation. My presence/absence matrix comes with genes in columns and observations/samples in rows. I have a grouping variable as class factor, which specifies which samples belong to which group. head(gene.matrix) gene1 gene2 gene3 sample1 1 0 0 sample2 1 1 0 sample3 0 1 0 > grouping.variable [1] cond1 cond1 cond2 How do I call the GLM now? I already tried: > glm(gene.matrix ~ grouping.variable, family = binomial(link = "logit")) Error in eval(family$initialize) : for the 'binomial' family, y must be a vector of 0 and 1's or a 2 column matrix where col 1 is no. successes and col 2 is no. failures However, when specifying a single gene (with gene.matrix[,1]) the glm call is working. How can I perform the glm call with multiple dependent variables?
