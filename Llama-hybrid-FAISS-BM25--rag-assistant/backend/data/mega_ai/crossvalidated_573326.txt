In short, it tries to increase the inter-class distance of the embeddings using the softmax function and decrease the intra-class distance for embeddings of each class using the center loss. To make the embeddings of each class closer to each other, creates a center embedding for each class and drag the embedding of each case to their center embedding, at the same time to make the center embedding global it also updates each center embedding.
