Help with SQL aggregate functions

I've been learning SQL for about a day now and I've run into a road bump. Please help me with the following questions: STUDENT (**StudentNumber**, StudentName, TutorialNumber) TUTORIAL (**TutorialNumber**, Day, Time, Room, TutorInCharge) ASSESSMENT (**AssessmentNumber**, AssessmentTitle, MarkOutOf) MARK (**AssessmentNumber**, **StudentNumber**, RawMark) PK and FK are identified within "**". I need to generate queries that: 1) List of assessment tasks results showing: Assessment Number, Assessment Title, and average Raw Mark. I know how to use the avg function for a single column, but to display something for multiple columns... a little unsure here. My attempt: SELECT RawMark, AssessmentNumber, AsessmentTitle FROM MARK, ASSESSMENT WHERE RawMark = (SELECT (RawMark) FROM MARK) AND MARK.AssessmentNumber = ASSESSMENT.AssessmentNumber; 2) Report on tutorial enrollment showing: Tutorial Number, Day, Room, Tutor in Charge and number of students enrolled. Same as the avg function, now for the count function. Would this require 2 queries? 3) List each student's Raw Mark in each of the assessment tasks showing: Assessment Number, Assessment Title, Student Number, Student Name, Raw Mark, Tutor in Charge and Time. Sort on Tutor in Charge, Day and Time.
