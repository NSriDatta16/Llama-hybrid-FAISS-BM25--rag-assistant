This paper answers your question. In summary there are two subgroups: i. Bayesian functions and ii. Information theoretic functions (Log-likelihood based, which apply to any generative model, not just BN's). Bear in mind that some of the scoring functions they list under i. are theoretical, and cannot be used (in practice) without simplifying assumptions. I think it will be clear when you read the paper.
