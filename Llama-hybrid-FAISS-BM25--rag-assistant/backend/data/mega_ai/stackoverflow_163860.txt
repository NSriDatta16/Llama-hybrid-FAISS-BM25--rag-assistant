Tiny But Strong www.tinybutstrong.com It doesn't make the smarty mistake of embedding another macro language in the page, but does allow you to handle every practical web display issue I've ever thrown at it. In particular the above odd/even constructs are a doddle. For something like your code selecting from a database table In the PHP file $TBS->MergeBlock('blk1',$sqlconnect, "SELECT name from people "); And in the HTML file [blk.name;block=ul] [blk.name;block=ul] And that's it. Notice that the HTML is completely Dreamweaver compatible. Furthermore if I wanted to make that alternate over three line styles all I'd need to do is add the extra line, maybe with different classes, so [blk.name;block=ul] [blk.name;block=ul] [blk.name;block=ul]
