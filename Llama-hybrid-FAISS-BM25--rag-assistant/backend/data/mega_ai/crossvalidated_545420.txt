Your code does model the conditional relationship $V|U$ . Look at the lines V[i] ~ dbeta (alpha[i], beta[i]) alpha[i] V[i] follows a beta distribution parametrized by alpha[i] and beta[i] , where both of the parameters are defined in terms of mu[i] that is a function of U[i] . Similar kind of dependency is observed in linear regression or generalized linear models (e.g. logistic regression), where we model $y|X$ , where $E[y|X] = f(X)$ with $f(\cdot)$ being the regression function. As a sidenote, using WinBUGS in not a great idea. This software is not actively maintained for many years, the "latest news" section on its website has the newest entry from nine years ago, while the latest update predates it. If you use it, you must assume that it stops working any time and this is likely not to get fixed, making your code useless. For similar, but actively developed alternative you could check Stan .
