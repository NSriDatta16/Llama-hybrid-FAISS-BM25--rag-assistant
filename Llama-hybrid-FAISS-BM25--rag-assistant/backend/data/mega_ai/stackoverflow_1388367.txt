Well, I will give you the confirmation you need. It seems using the Orientation property on a "Calulated Field" just does not work, and I would have to agree this is a bug and not a common "usage" error. I was able to duplicate "hiding/showing" the field without having to remove ("Delete") the calculated field. This allows the user to physically drag the calculated field from the field list after you have progammatically "hidden" the field. This is not a bad solution because it duplicates the user-interface. (Using Excel 2003.)

Instead, try removing it.
