Conditionals in transact-sql select column lists

I've got a query that looks a bit like this: select records.id, contacts.name + ' (' + contacts.organization + ')' as contact, from records left join contacts on records.contact = contacts.contactid Problem is - contacts.organization is frequently empty, and I get contacts like "John Smith ()". Is there a way to only concatenate the organization if it's non-empty?
