Before using the KNN algorithm you could just reduce dimensionality by applying e.g., a singular value decomposition or a PCA. This will reduce complexity for the particular algorithm. In addition using sparse vectors is always a good idea. Another approach to minimize the memory consumption is to cast all values to the smallest type.
