A question for data scientists about Deep Learning Thesis

I am writing because I would like to ask more experienced people in Deep Learning about the (possible) topic of my master's thesis. I am not sure if it is not too complex and even possible to finish in 1 year for a student who has no professional background in deep learning and just finish a few related courses on Coursera and I need to ask your opinion. To put it in a nutshell: The topic title is: De novo peptide sequencing from tandem MS data. The result of my work should look like this: https://github.com/nh2tran/DeepNovo (but I need to figure out a different idea because that research group have a different kind of data). I would not have any 'technical' support because the tutor has only background in biochemistry. I start having doubts if it is a doable thesis. I can still change it. Thank you for the answers!
