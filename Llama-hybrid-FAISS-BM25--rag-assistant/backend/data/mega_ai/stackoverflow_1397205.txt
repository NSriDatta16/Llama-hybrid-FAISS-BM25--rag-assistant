char *buf = [routeGeom UTF8String]; int bestGuess = 1 = bestGuess) { bestGuess latitude, &(routePoints + i)->longitude); } Pick a good starting value for (whatever) so that 2 whatever is representative of an average number of points in a route. If you can't, you could try guessing the number based on the length of the string. Otherwise, if you want to be exact, you could parse the string twice, first counting, then create routePoints , then parse the data, in which case you wouldn't need the realloc section. Edit: Another option. This assumes that CLLocationCoordinate2D is simply a struct of 2 floats, in the same order as the data in the string. char *buf = [routeGeom UTF8String]; int bestGuess = 1 = bestGuess) { bestGuess
