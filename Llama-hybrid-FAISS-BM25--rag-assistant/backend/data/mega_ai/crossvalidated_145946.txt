The book by Prince, recommended by @seanv507 is indeed an excellent book on the topic (+1). And while it is not really compact, it has very logical structure and even a generous refresher chapter on probability as well as great focus on machine learning within computer vision context. However, I'd like to recommend another excellent book on the topic (also freely downloadable), which, while having more focus on computer vision per se, IMHO contains enough machine learning material to qualify for an answer. The book that I'm talking about is "Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications" by Richard Szeliski (Microsoft Research). One of the advantages of this book versus the one by Price is... narrower margins, which allow for larger font size and, thus, better readability . Also, the book by Szeliski is very practical . Since both books share significant content, but have somewhat different focus, in my opinion, they very well complement each other . All this, among other advantages, makes it very easy for me to highly recommend Szeliski's book.
