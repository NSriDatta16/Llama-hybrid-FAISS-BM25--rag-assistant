Gomez is a tools that I've used at a couple of organizations. It will monitor your site at timed intervals from a list of nodes that you select, for either an individual page or over an entire transaction (think a click-path through your website) The reporting capabilities are really good, and you can drill down into individual page requests to identify any performance bottlenecks or issues with site performance. There's also alerting options and the list of nodes and update frequency is excellent. I've never been involved in the actual purchasing or account management however, so I'm not sure how expensive it is.
