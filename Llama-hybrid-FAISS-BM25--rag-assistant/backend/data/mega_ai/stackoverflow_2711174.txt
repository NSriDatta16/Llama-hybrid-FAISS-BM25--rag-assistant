Based on the W3 documentation to assign a label to an input you have tofollow this instruction First Name Last Name following text included in that article To associate a label with another control implicitly, the control element must be within the contents of the LABEL element. In this case, the LABEL may only contain one control element. The label itself may be positioned before or after the associated control. Note that this technique cannot be used when a table is being used for layout, with the label in one cell and its associated control in another cell. When a LABEL element receives focus, it passes the focus on to its associated control. See the section below on access keys for examples. Labels may be rendered by user agents in a number of ways (e.g., visually, read by speech synthesizers, etc.) So you have to follow the instruction, was it clear or not ?
