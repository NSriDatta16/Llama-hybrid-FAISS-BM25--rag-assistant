Improving variable estimates by reducing uncertainty

I was hoping someone could assist me with a basic stats question. If I have $K_1$ samples of $R_1 = C_1 + n_1$, where $C_1$ is an unknown constant and $n_1\sim\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma_1^2)$. To make an accurate estimate of $C_1$ I can apply signal averaging such that $\frac{1}{K_1}\sum^{K_1}_1R_1 \approx C_1 + n_{k1}$, where $n_{k1}\sim\mathcal{N}\left(0,\frac{\sigma_1^2}{K_1}\right)$. Now assume I have another $K_1$ samples of another function $R_2 = C_1 + C_2 + n_2$, where both $C_1$ and $C_2$ are unknown constants and $n_2\sim\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma_2^2)$. If we assume $\sigma_1^2 I've been told that a biased estimator might be a possible solution. Could anyone recommend a method?
