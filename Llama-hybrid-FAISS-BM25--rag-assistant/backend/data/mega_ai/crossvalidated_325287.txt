Finally got the below using GaussianMixture in python's scikit-learn v0.19. This allowed me to specify that the covariance matrix should be shared across clusters (option = 'tied' in the covariance_type param) - something which doesn't seem available as an option in R. I also perhaps, 'cheated' a little bit by roughly specifying the initial distribution weights and the initial rough centroid locations by visual inspection of the PCA scatterplot.
