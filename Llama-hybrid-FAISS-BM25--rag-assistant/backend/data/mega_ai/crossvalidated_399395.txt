There is usually latent information in the null/missing value which a tree model or deep network can signal out. It gets a bit trickier in the peculiar case where 80% of the response is missing. It might be a good idea to wait for more data or try imputation with a probabilistic model (maybe a Bayesian model for imputation). Anyhow, being able to classify the non-passing students is probably just as important though ;) A boosted zero or one inflated beta regression might help you out here, as you could classify the non-passing students and run a beta regression over the grades at the same time. You would be sharing information in the gradient boosting as well. I probably wouldn’t bother with deep learning here, unless you’ve got a substantial amount of data. LightGBM and Xgboost tends to work just as well if not better on structured 2d tensors.
