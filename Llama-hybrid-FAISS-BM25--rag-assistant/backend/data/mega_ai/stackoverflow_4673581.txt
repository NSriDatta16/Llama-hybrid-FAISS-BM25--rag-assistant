Or perhaps you could use this class: http://developer.android.com/reference/java/net/URLEncoder.html Which is present in Android since API level 1. Annoyingly however, it treats spaces specially (replacing them with + instead of %20). To get round this we simply use this fragment: URLEncoder.encode(value, "UTF-8").replace("+", "%20");
