You did not really describe what you mean with model share, i.e. what the purpose of the modelling is, but the hts R package and hierarchical time series provide a way to create forecasts of time series which sum up to 100%, etc. Prof. Hyndman has at least two publications on using them: Hierarchical forecasts for Australian domestic tourism and Optimal combination forecasts for hierarchical time series . Besides documentation of the package I don't know other sources about hierarchical time series than the papers and the references therein.
