You might consider our DMS Software Reengineering Toolkit . DMS is a general foundation for parsing source text in arbitrary languages to compiler data structures (ASTs, symbol tables, control flow graphs, data flow graphs depending on how far you take it). DMS is a general purpose Source-to-source program transformation system . You can apply source-to-source pattern-directed transformations, or write procedural transformations (much like OpenC++), and then regenerate compilable source text corresponding to the transformed program. DMS is parameterized by explicit language definitions, and handles C, C#, COBOL, Java, Python, javascript, Fortran. It has a full C++ Front End that handles many real dialects of C++ (ANSI, GNU, MS), with full name and type resolution. DMS with the C++ front end can carry out transformations controlled by "metaprograms" within and across multiple compilation units. It has been used in anger to do radical reorganizations of C++ software systems, including massive rearchitecting of mission avionics software (see papers at website), finally used in UAVs. DMS runs on Windows, and transparently on Linux under Wine using sh scripts. EDIT 2/3/2011: DMS seems run fine under Wine on Linux and Solaris, too. Testing underway for DMS on Wine under OSX. EDIT 3/1/2011: DMS seems to run under Wine for OSX, too. EDIT 2/21/2013: The C++ front end now handles ANSI C++11, as well as MS and GNU versions of C++11. EDIT 2/24/2015: Now handles C++14 in ANSI, MS and GNU flavors. EDIT 1/16/2019: Now handles C++17 in ANSI, MS and GNU flavors.
