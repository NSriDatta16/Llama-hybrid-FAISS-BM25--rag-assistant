What are the pros and cons of different metrics for evaluating a logistic regression model?

In the data science world, I have always evaluated the performance of logistic regression models simply using ROC/AUC. However recently, I've read from some traditional statistics source about some measures of a logistic regression, including: for goodness-of-fit: Pearson statistic , Deviance , and Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic ; for quality of prediction: Nagelkerke's $R^2$ , Concordance measure. So, which metrics are better for what scenario? Also, I'm pretty confused how goodness-of-fit is different from predictability?
