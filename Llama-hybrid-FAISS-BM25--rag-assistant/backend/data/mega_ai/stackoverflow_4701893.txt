PHP preg_replace remove first HTML element in string

I would like to remove the entire first element of a html string (it is always a paragraph) in PHP. my current approach is using: $passage = preg_replace('/.*?\b'.' '.'\b/s', '', $passage, 1); This doesn't work because of the special characters in I know that the following will remove everything from the string before the word 'one' appears $passage = preg_replace('/.*?\b'.'one'.'\b/s', '', $passage, 1);
