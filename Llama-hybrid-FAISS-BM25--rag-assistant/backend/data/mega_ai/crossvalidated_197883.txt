You can find a useful explanation on that topic in Sun et a. (2003), particularly in Section 3: It reaches a conclusion that multiple kernel learning (MKL) is a special instance of ensemble learning (EL). For example, EL does not suffer from the limitation of MKL that the classifiers have the sub-kernels of the same size and the same support vector coefficients (for SVMs). Sun, Tao, et al. " Selective multiple kernel learning for classification with ensemble strategy ." Pattern Recognition 46.11 (2013): 3081-3090.
