I think the taking the log and then comparing medians is odd, and might sound like shenanigans to your audience. You can use Mann-Whitney on the original data (with or without the zeros, depending on what makes sense). Just understand that it isn't a test of medians. It is a test of stochastic equality. That is, Ho is that the probablity of an observation in one group being higher than an observation in another group is 0.50. This is usually a more interesting hypothesis than a test of medians, but it depends on your application. If you really want to test medians, use Mood's median test or a permutation test for medians. The percent change you could do a few different ways. What percent change is actually meaningful in your case? Is it the mean? The median? Other percentiles? Percentile Value for Group 1 Value for Group 2 Percent difference 10th whatever whatever + 10% 25th whatever whatever + 5% median whatever whatever 0% 75th whatever whatever - 17% 90th whatever whatever - 25% It may help also to simply present the histograms. Finally, if you use the Mann-Whitney test, one effect size statistic is Vargha and Delaney's A. It reports the probability that an observation in one group is greater than the other group. So that, VDA = 0.50 means the groups are stochastically equal; VDA = 1 means that all observations in one group are greater than those in the other.
