We say $Y$ is not causally related to $X$ if $E(Y|X)$ does not depend on $X$, which implies it is equal to $E(Y)$. This is wrong. Causal relations are about functional/structural dependencies, not statistical/associational dependencies. You should take a look here. Have I defined causality incorrectly? What have I done wrong? Yes, you have defined it incorrectly, you can check causal inference books/references here . More formally, in a structural equation model the causal effect of $X$ on the distribution of $Y$, which we can denote by $P(Y|do(X = x))$ --- that is, how changing $X$ affects the distribution of $Y$ --- is mathematically defined as the probability distribution induced by the modified structural equation model where the equation for $X$ is substituted for $X = x$. For example, suppose your causal model is defined by the following structural equations: $$ U = \epsilon_u\\ X = f(U, \epsilon_x)\\ Y = g(X,U, \epsilon_y) $$ Where the disturbances are mutually independent and have some probability distribution. This corresponds to the DAG: $\hskip2in$ Then $P(Y|do(X = x))$ is the probability distribution of $Y$ induced by the modified structural equations: $$ U = \epsilon_u\\ X = x\\ Y = g(X, U, \epsilon_y) $$ Which corresponds to the mutilated DAG: $\hskip2in$ The average causal effect would be simply the expectation of $Y$ using the causal cdf $P(Y|do(X=x))$. $$ E[Y|do(X =x)] = \int Y dP(Y|do(X = x)) $$ This is the mathematical definition, whether you can identify the effect with observational data depends on whether you can re-express $P(Y|do(X=x))$ in terms of the observational distribution without the $do()$ operator.
