Test for Equality of Parameters in Beta-Binomial Distribution

With binomially distributed data, it's straightforward to test the null hypothesis of equiprobable responses, $H_0: p=0.5$, but say you want to test the analogue in a Beta-Binomial model fit to over-dispersed data (not under a Bayesian paradigm, but with the whole thing fit via maximum-likelihood estimation). It makes sense to define a null distribution where $\frac { \alpha }{ \alpha+\beta }=0.5 $, but how would you decide how large or small these values should be? Is it reasonable to simply define $\alpha+\beta$ as the observed sum $\hat\alpha+\hat\beta$ from the fitted model? Or is there reason to expect that the null would imply some different degree of dispersion?
