Text mining on large database (data mining)

I have a large database of resumes (CV), and a certain table skills grouping all users skills. inside that table there's a field skill_text that describes the skill in full text. I'm looking for an algorithm/software/method to extract significant terms/phrases from that table in order to build a new table with standarized skills.. Here are some examples skills extracted from the DB : Sectoral and competitive analysis Business Development (incl. in international settings) Specific structure and road design software - Microstation, Macao, AutoCAD (basic knowledge) Creative work (Photoshop, In-Design, Illustrator) checking and reporting back on campaign progress organising and attending events and exhibitions Development : Aptana Studio, PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, AJAX Discipline: One to one marketing, E-marketing (SEO & SEA, display, emailing, affiliate program) Mix marketing, Viral Marketing, Social network marketing. The output shoud be something like : Sectoral and competitive analysis Business Development Specific structure and road design software - Macao AutoCAD Photoshop In-Design Illustrator organising events Development Aptana Studio PHP HTML CSS JavaScript SQL AJAX Mix marketing Viral Marketing Social network marketing emailing SEO One to one marketing As you see only skills remains no other representation text. I know this is possible using text mining technics but how to do it ? the database is realy large.. it's a good thing because we can calculate text frequency and decide if it's a real skill or just meaningless text... The big problem is .. how to determin that "blablabla" is a skill ? Edit : please don't tell me to use standard things like a text tokinzer, or regex .. because users input skills in a very arbitrary way !! thanks
