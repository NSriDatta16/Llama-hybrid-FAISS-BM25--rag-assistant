Generate two random numbers with different coverages and whose product is bounded

I need to generate two positive numbers $a$ and $b$ both $\ge 1$ , whose product is bounded $[2..z]$ and both have a limited coverage between 1 and respectively $a.max$ and $b.max$ . The draws should produce and uniform distribution for both numbers.
