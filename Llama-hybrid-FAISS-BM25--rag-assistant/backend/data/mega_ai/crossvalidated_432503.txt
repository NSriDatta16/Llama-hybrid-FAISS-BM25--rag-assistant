It seems that you are relating the value of MAE to the value of mean of the time series? Thats not a good idea imho: if you shift the whole series by a constant, its mean would also shift by that constant, but the MEA / quality of your model should stay the same (if your model is e.g. some regression with intercept, the intercept would just shift by that constant.) I would see a better approach to compare the MAE of the model with MAE of some simpler model, e.g. just predicting the average value of training samples all the time. (Doing that comparison for MSE is actually the R2 of your model.)
