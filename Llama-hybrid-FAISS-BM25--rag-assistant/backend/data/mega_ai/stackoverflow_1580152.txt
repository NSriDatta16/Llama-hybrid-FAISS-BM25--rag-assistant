First, the obvious. Check the indexes on the linked server. If I saw this problem without the linked server issue, that would be the first thing I would check. Suggestion: Instead of embedding the UPDATE in the server 1 trigger, create a stored procedure on the linked server and update the records by calling the stored procedure. Try to remove the sub-query from the UPDATE: if isnull(@d_email,'') <> isnull(@i_email,'') begin update server2.database2.dbo.Table2 set email = @i_email from server2.database2.dbo.Table2 t2 inner join server2.database2.dbo.Table1 t1 on (t1.user_id = t2.user_id) where t1.login = @login end
