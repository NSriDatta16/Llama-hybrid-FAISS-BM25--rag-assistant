How can I get windows explorer to "browse to next folder"? (vbscript/batch etc...)

I use the basic windows explorer to browse a large collection of images. I have a very well organised group of folders and I don't need/want any of the extra functionality of photo organisers such as picasa etc... The only drawback is: I'd really like to be able to browse from one folder straight into the next, without having to click back and choosing the next folder. So my question is, how could I do this in the smoothest way?! I'm guessing I could use a combination of some script and then use auto hotkey to bind it to a key shortcut. Any help/ideas/pointers very appreciated! Thanks.
