Suppose you take 10 samples of 50 and your friend takes one sample of 500. There is no difference in the amount of information you can extract versus your friend. In theory you are both under the same conditions because you have the same amount of data. Problems could arise if samples are not independent, but under independent random sampling you and your friend are dealing with equivalent situations. Let's look at the variance. Suppose you average your 10 sample means. So you have $$\bar x_{samples}=(1/10)(\bar x_1+\bar x_2 + \cdots + \bar x_{10}) $$ The variance of this random variable is $(1/10^2)*(10)*(\sigma^2/50)= \sigma^2/500,$ where $\sigma^2$ is the population variance. But this is the same as the variance of the random variable $$\bar x_{500}=(1/500)*(x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_{500}),$$ which your friend uses. To answer your question about bias, both estimators are unbiased for the population mean. That is, the expected values of both are equal to the population mean.
