explaining an extremely large coefficient in a rare events logistic regression

I am running a rare events logistic regression on a binary dependent variable. I have 538 observations and only 10 events (so 528 values of 0 and 10 of 1), which is why I chose to use a rare events logistic regression. When I run the regression, one of the independent variables in the model has a huge coefficient (around 25,000,000) and is found to be significant. The range on the independent variable is 0 to 1. Is this a problem? Could anyone explain why this is happening? When I run the same model with just a logistic regression this variable is insignificant. I'm not sure what is happening. Any advice would be appreciated.
