Creating links to organization/community pages in Liferay 6

Lets say I have am Organization object. How do I create an url that points to that organization's public pages? There is a class NavItem that creates links to given layouts, but which one the "front page" is undocumented (among everything else). Then there is PortletURLImpl that can be used (in convoluted way) for this at least as long as user is a member of the community.
