How to pretty print HttpServletRequest and HttpServletResponse

I would like to add logging of requests and responses to a Java webapp which I am running within Tomcat 6. The intention is to produce a log file with output similar to what Wireshark would display. For example: GET / HTTP/1.1 Host: www.bing.com Connection: keep-alive Cache-Control: max-age=0 User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/534.16 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/10.0.648.204 Safari/534.16 Accept: application/xml,application/xhtml+xml,text/html;q=0.9,text/plain;q=0.8,image/png,*/*;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate,sdch Accept-Language: en-GB,en-US;q=0.8,en;q=0.6 Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.3 I thought the best approach would be to use a Filter to capture the incoming HttpServletRequest and wrap the HttpServletResponse to allow the response content to be captured. However, once I have an HttpServletRequest and HttpServletResponse is there a standard way to pretty print these objects out as they appeared on the wire?
