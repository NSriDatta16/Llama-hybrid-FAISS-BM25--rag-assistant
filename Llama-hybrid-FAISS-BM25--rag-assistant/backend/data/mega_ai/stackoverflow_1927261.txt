Get Groups From OU using DirectoryServices.AccountManagement

I'd like to use AccountManagement to list all the groups in an Organizational Unit. The following snippet works with DirectoryServices but I would have to instanciate GroupPrincipal with the DirectoryEntry path in the result (which feels like a dirty fix). DirectoryEntry root = new DirectoryEntry("LDAP://OU=Marketing,OU=Operations,OU=Applications,DC=mycompany,DC=local") DirectorySearcher ds = new DirectorySearcher(root); ds.Filter = "(objectCategory=group)"; SearchResultCollection results = ds.FindAll(); Has anyone an idea? Thanks!
