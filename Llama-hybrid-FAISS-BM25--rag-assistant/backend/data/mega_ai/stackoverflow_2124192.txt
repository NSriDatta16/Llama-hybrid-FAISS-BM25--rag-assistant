I suggest you make ingredient a list of strings, populate it with the pickle.dumps of the types you're saving, and, upon retrieval, use pickle.loads to get a type object back. pickle serializes types "by name", so there are some constraints (essentially, the types must live at the top level of some module), but that's way handier than doing your own serialization (and, especially, de serializaton) of the type names, which would essentially entail you repeating a bit of the work that pickle can already do on your behalf!-)
