I do not use Python, but here is what I think may be going on. If the VAR model is indeed a statistically adequate model for the conditional mean of a vector-valued time series, conditioning on its past, then the errors should not only have zero autocorrelation for each individual component time series but also zero lagged cross correlations across the components. That is why you would inspect a $k\times k$ matrix of auto- and lagged cross-correlation functions rather than just the $k$ autocorrelation functions.
