Most definitely all things from your list for each individual item: Filename Line number Namespace/class/function name Test coverage Start time and end time And/or total time (this would be more useful for me than the top two items) Diagnostic output such as the difference between what you got and what you expected. From the top of my head not much else but for the group of tests I would like to know group name total execution time
