Java Web Start : Track exit of client application

A main class is invoked through a JNLP file using Java Web Start from a client machine. I want to update server DB table based on successful launch and closing of the application in client machine. The constraint is that I can't modify the application that gets launched(as it is a 3rd party GPL tool) Per my understanding of JWS, control goes out once application is launched. Is there any way to track such events(especially closure) using Java Web Start itself ?
