Look, It is very simple Problem. You have not Large but good Dataset. So, the approach will be like that. Clean Your dataset( like Outliers and Missing Value ) -> Split Your DataSet into Training and Test Set -> Build couple of Models like Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest or ANN -> Evaluate their Performance on Your Test Set and Calculate Accuracy and Area Under ROC Curve for each Model -> Model having highest accuracy and Highest AUC will be your final model which you can use for predicting Win/Loss for the unknown example. This is the right approach for every classification problem. Now, I am going to publish my paper soon :-) . So that will be the best reference for you.
