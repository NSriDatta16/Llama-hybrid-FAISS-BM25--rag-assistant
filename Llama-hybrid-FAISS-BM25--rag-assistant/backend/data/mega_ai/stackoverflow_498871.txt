One suggestion that I have is to use the generated ordering information on the backend to build the page with the items in the correct locations initially rather than rely on javascript to reorder them on page load. This will reduce the chances of having the display morph before the user's eyes from the default to their chosen ordering. It also allows the page to render correctly even with javascript turned off, although they will lose their ability to reorder things obviously. I think you're spot on with using AJAX to communicate back ordering changes to the server. The only other way you might do this is by having an "edit" mode that allows the user to make the changes, then "save" to get out of edit mode. The save would post back the current orderings. I prefer the AJAX way since you'll need Javascript to handle the drag-n-drop anyway.
