Multiclass: I want to develop a customized objective function with weights given by both label and prediction, for Xgboost

I want to develop a customized objective function with weights given by both label and prediction, for Xgboost. Example, let's say you have 2 classes I want to assign a penalties according to this cases: predicts=0, label=1 => assign big penalty (so the algorithm focuses on preventing that specific error). predicts=1, label=0 => assign small penalty (so the algorithm WON'T focus on preventing that specific error). Mathematically I wish I had a confusion like matrix, where for each slot I could assign the penalties for the multi-class case. And if I did the classic threshold solution it won't work for test cases as I won't have the labels! So far I modified a log-likelihood objective by making labels and the gradient bigger on certain cases, see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34178287/difference-between-objective-and-feval-in-xgboost ): # user define objective objective, given prediction, return gradient and second order gradient my_custom_obj It kind of works, but I am not satisfied.
