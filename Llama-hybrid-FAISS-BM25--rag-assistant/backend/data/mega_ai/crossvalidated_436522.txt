If I understand correctly, the situation is that you have an estimated logistic regression model that you use in production. So you need a system of quality control that can tell you if the model start to perform worse. One possibility could be to calculate a running Brier score , you could on the same plot indicate the expected Brier score assuming the model is correct and calibrated. That should give a reference value. There might be some ideas in this stored search . The Brier score is a proper scoring rule , you could also choose to use some other proper scoring rule.
