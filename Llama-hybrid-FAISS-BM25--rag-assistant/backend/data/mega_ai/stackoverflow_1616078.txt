timeIntervalSinceReferenceDate is perfectly fine. However, unless it's a long-running method, this won't bear much fruit. Execution times can vary wildly when you're talking about a few millisecond executions. If your thread/process gets preempted mid-way through, you'll have non-deterministic spikes. Essentially, your sample size is too small. Either use a profiler or run 100,000 iterations to get total time and divide by 100,000 to get average run-time.
