I think that the largest advantage is that matplotlib is based on Python, which you say you already know. So, this is one language less to learn. Just spend the time mastering Python, and you'll benefit both directly for the plotting task at hand and indirectly for your other Python needs. Besides, IMHO Python is an overall richer language than R, with far more libraries that can help for various tasks. You have to access data for plotting, and data comes in many forms. In whatever form it comes I'm sure Python has an efficient library for it. And how about embedding those plots in more complete programs, say simple GUIs? matplotlib binds easily with Python's GUI libs (like PyQT) and you can make stuff that only your imagination limits.
