How can I improve my cross-correlation methodology?

I will break my question appropriately to make it easier to explain. This is actually a short question but looks longer due to my plots so I apologize for that. Any input would be greatly appreciated. Setup I have a few locations that I am monitoring with sensors. The dataset that I have is a set of events that the sensors measured at different locations. The measurements themselves look like the following: First take I wanted to figure out if any of the events recorded by these sensors were correlated so I ended up computing the cross-correlation of these series (plotted below). The plot shows me that there seems to be some correlation between the sequences V3 and V10 but nothing to show a strong correlation. So I ended up revising my approach: I used a window to observe the events. I took a time window of 40 seconds and plotted the time series again along with their cross-correlation with each other. This time, it gave me something encouraging. I can see a perfect correlation between 3 and 10 and 3 and 6. and its corresponding cross-correlation plots. Question It looks like I should not be computing the cross-correlating the entire timeseries but rather only across a small window. This makes sense because I am not really looking to see if the entire time series is the same anyways. What I am really looking for is if there is a correlated event. If we assume that events beyond a certain time period need not necessarily be correlated then we can perhaps compute the cross-correlation for a sliding window that would be more accurate and notify only if it is greater than 0.8. Well, at this point, I feel like I am reinventing the wheel and am hoping there are standard techniques to do this. Most of my data points would be zero with a sudden burst now and then. In that case, how can I make I conclusions (that there is indeed a correlation) stronger? I head about FFTs and DFTs. Would they be of any use here? Any comments?
