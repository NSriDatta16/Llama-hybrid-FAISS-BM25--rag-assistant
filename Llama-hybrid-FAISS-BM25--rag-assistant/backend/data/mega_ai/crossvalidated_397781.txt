Relationship between Causal Calculus (in the sense of the Book of Why) and other existing modeling formalisms?

I am watching this video on youtube: https://youtu.be/zvrcyqcN9Wo?t=2896 about Causal Calculus (CC), namely this section on causal graphs, and it seems to me that this theory of causality is not that different from dynamical systems theory, specifically stochastic differential equations (SDE), except maybe for the fact that dif. eq. encode the causal relationships as derivatives where these are functions of the system state variables whereas in that video the relationships are direct and not implicitly modelled via derivatives... What are the differences between CC and SDE? And what about Markov chains? It seems to me this is just dynamical systems theory with noise added to the mix... yet given the hype around the topic of Causal Calculus I am wondering if I am overlooking something about CC.
