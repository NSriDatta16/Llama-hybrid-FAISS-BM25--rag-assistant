Asset not found XNA

I am very new to XNA and I began by following a tutorial that draws an image on the screen. I was able to move my image into the Content folder but when I try to use it in my code, it can't be found. I am using the asset name and I just cannot find what I am doing wrong. The tutorials use XNA 3.0 and I am using Visual Studio 2010, not sure if that matters or not. Here is my code public class Game1 : Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Game { Vector2 mPosition = new Vector2(0, 0); Texture2D mSpriteTexture; GraphicsDeviceManager graphics; SpriteBatch spriteBatch; public Game1() { graphics = new GraphicsDeviceManager(this); Content.RootDirectory = "Content"; } protected override void Initialize() { base.Initialize(); } protected override void LoadContent() { spriteBatch = new SpriteBatch(GraphicsDevice); mSpriteTexture = Content.Load ("Face"); } protected override void UnloadContent() { } protected override void Update(GameTime gameTime) { if (GamePad.GetState(PlayerIndex.One).Buttons.Back == ButtonState.Pressed) this.Exit(); base.Update(gameTime); } protected override void Draw(GameTime gameTime) { GraphicsDevice.Clear(Color.Black); spriteBatch.Begin(); spriteBatch.Draw(mSpriteTexture, mPosition, Color.White); spriteBatch.End(); base.Draw(gameTime); } } } The error reads "ContentLoadException was Unhandled. File not found. Solution Explorer I hope this is enough information. Also the asset name of my file is Face. Thanks in advance.
