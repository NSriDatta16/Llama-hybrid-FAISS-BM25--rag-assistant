Choosing alternate hypothesis in two sample t-test

I am trying to do two-sample T-test in Minitab where I have to compare average of one variable with another binary variable. I am having difficulty in choosing alternate hypothesis. So just for guessing I tried both ways H1: u1 > u2 and H1: u1 How do I know which alternate hypothesis is correct? I am missing some concept here, can anyone please explain it?
