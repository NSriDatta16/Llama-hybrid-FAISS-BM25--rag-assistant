Can I have a time covariate to account for temporal trends as well as time series biases such as AR/MA?

Can I have a time covariate to account for temporal trends as well as time series biases such as AR/MA? For instance if I have a model: Y ~ X + t where t is time, then can this be an alternative model formulation to some time series model like a GLS with ARMA(p, q) correlation structure? I was wondering if the inclusion of time as a covariate would help account for temporal trends as well as non-stationarity?
