Independent variable with 4 classes using in a GLM: different OR for same comparison (AB - BA)

I am inexperienced in using Rstudio and data-analysis. I want to perform a Generalized Logistic Regression, using an independent variable with 4 classes: 0,1,2a,2b and a dependent variable that I want to predict, with yes or no (1,0) Finally, I figured how to change the reference variable in order to to let all the 4 classes be the reference once. As a result, you will get a Odds Ratio for class 1 when the reference is class 0, but also for class 0 when the reference is class 1. My question: shouldn't the OR be the same for both combination (different reference setting)? In fact, the P values are the same. The image I attached shows the coefficients of the 4 GLM models I created. The other, shows the odds ratio's and a colour map for the same combinations I thought would have the same values. I tried to search the answer on the internet, but could not find something that helps me. I expect a reaction of someone that can confirm things are going wrong, or have advice.
