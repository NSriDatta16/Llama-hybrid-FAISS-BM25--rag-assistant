If you want to know whether a CNN would accept pixel values of [0, 1] or [0, 255], you need to look at its documentation or model architecture. E.g. It's explicitly written down that EfficientNet accepts [0-255] here . And if you look at the architecture, you will see that it comes with a normalization layer to convert [0-255] into [0-1]. Sometimes the CNN comes with some image pre-processing tools to make sure your images comply with its standard.
