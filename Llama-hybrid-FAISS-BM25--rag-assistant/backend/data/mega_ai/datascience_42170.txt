RNN package and problems with "Predictr"

I have two questions about how to use R's RNN package, specifically the trainr and predictr functions. Let's suppose I have a time series of 4000 steps for 5 different variables. How should this be passed on to the RNN, since the input has to be a 3D array? Should it be an array of dim(1, 4000, 5) or dim(4000,1,5) or something completely different? Moreover, let's suppose I successfully train my RNN and would like to make some predictions using the predictr function. Which dimension will the output have and how can it be interpreted? Until now I have tried to input the data as 3D array (4000, 1, 5) with the following code: RecNN And then used the predictr function with the input (250, 1, 5): results1 $ : num [1:250, 1, 1:100] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ... $ : num [1:250, 1, 1:2] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... Thanks a lot!
