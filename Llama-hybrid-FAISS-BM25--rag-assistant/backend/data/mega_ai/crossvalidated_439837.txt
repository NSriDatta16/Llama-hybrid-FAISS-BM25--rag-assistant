How to find significant predictors that can differentiate case and control without ML approach?

I have a dataset with more than 70 columns and I have an binary output column. What I did currently was to explore the dataset by plotting the bar and line graphs for the input variables vs output column. Though I see that certain variables show a clear distinction between two classes(customer churn or not), what I would like to do is get to know whether the input variables are statistically significant to influence the outcome? How can I do them without using Random forest feature importance or other ML feature importance methods? Is there any method or approach like chi-square or anova that can help me do this? I don't know whether chi-square or anova can do this. But thought of seeking your help
