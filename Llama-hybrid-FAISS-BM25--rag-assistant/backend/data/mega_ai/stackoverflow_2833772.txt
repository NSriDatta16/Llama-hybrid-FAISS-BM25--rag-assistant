How many times was the breakpoint passed? It may be that the debugger has had to test the breakpoint condition many times before it triggering. I do not know how it's implemented but I would not be surprised if the debugger's execution of the condition is a lot less efficient than normally compiled Java would be. Perhaps it's simply that it gets less attention from the JIT. Perhaps its not even fully compiled to Java at all and is interpreted.
