You need to .CreateAlias("Skills", "sks") .Add(Restrictions.In("sks.id", skillIdList)) I'm not sure if this can be done with a list of skill objects. Either way, the sql is going to end up the same as above. Note that this will create a Cartesian product so you might want to use an exists subquery or .SetResultTransformer(new DistinctRootEntityResultTransformer()) to get back a list of distinct Staff.
