I think you forget the activation function in nodes in neural network, which is non-linear and will make the whole model non-linear. In your formula is not totally correct, where, $$ h_1 \neq w_1x_1+w_2x_2 $$ but $$ h_1 = \text{sigmoid}(w_1x_1+w_2x_2) $$ where sigmoid function like this, $\text{sigmoid}(x)=\frac 1 {1+e^{-x}}$ Let's use a numerical example to explain the impact of the sigmoid function, suppose you have $w_1x_1+w_2x_2=4$ then $\text{sigmoid}(4)=0.99$. On the other hand, suppose you have $w_1x_1+w_2x_2=4000$, $\text{sigmoid}(4000)=1$ and it is almost as same as $\text{sigmoid}(4)$, which is non-linear. In addition, I think the slide 14 in this tutorial can show where you did wrong exactly. For $H_1$ please not the otuput is not -7.65, but $\text{sigmoid}(-7.65)$
