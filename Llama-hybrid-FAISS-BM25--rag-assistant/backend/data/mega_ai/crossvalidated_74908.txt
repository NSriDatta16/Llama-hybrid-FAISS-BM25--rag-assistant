Is there a textbook / handbook with full derivations for statistical / machine learning concepts?

In particular, I am looking for a textbook which will go over the details of derivations (including all calculus and linear algebra) for learning models and concepts such as logistic regression, Gaussian Discriminant Analysis, with full proofs for variants like Gaussian Naive Bayes. Books such as "Elements of Statistical Learning" tend to gloss over certain details. For example, when discussing L1 Regularized Logistic Regression (Section 4.4.4), it says that "the score equations ... have the form", and then presents the form without giving the derivation.
