It appears that you're not using hidden layers. It's not a shallow neural network then, it's just logistic (softmax) regression. I wouldn't expect that to work very well, especially with the number of classes you have. Typically people would train 1-against-all classifiers when using logistic regression, as the multi-class softmax like your using can be very unstable during optimisation. Try a single hidden layer model first, though.
