Do you merely used drag and drop to work with databases, letting magic happen as far as editing of data is concerned? While you can exist with LINQ to SQL or EF drag and drop, the "magic" underneath the hood is worthwhile to learn, especially in light of other forms of persistant mechanisms. To persist to a file, you have to capture the form data and then create a class that handles the save to the file. The best path is to Google saving to the type of file (comma separated, XML, etc) and create the software to handle the persistance of that information. You can test it with a simple console app. When you are happy, use the same pattern to wire to your MVC application. The main difference is you have to get the path from the ASP.NET internals (hard coded == bad). Someone may have an open source "module" that does this work, so search the open source sites.
