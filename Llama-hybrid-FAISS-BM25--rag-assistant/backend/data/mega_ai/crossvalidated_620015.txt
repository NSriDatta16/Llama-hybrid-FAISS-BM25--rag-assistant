How does one sample from a gaussian distribution without a library?

I am looking to write a program that generates samples from a gaussian distribution with a certain mean and standard deviation. I am not allowed to use any library except a random number generator. Is there a trivial way that one could do that? I am familiar with techniques like rejection sampling or a mcmc approach but they might not be easy to implement without a library. Note - The reason I am asking this question on Cross Validated instead of StackOverFlow is because I am not looking for code. I am rather looking for equations that I can convert into code.
