You may want to take a look at "Statistics 153 (Time Series) : Lecture Three" - from Aditya Guntuboyina: lecture notes : it's pretty inclusive: https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~aditya/Site/Statistics_153;_Spring_2012_files/Spring2012Statistics153LectureThree.pdf The problem with this smoother is of course that it is time-symmetric / a-causal: if you are dealing with a real-time / online process, the shape of the curve will unfortunately be distorted. Just like a spline: looks pretty mathematically, but terrible once the data start moving.
