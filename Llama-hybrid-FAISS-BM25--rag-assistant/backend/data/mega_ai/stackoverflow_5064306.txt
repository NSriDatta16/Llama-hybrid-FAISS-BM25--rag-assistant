Basically what Neil posted there is what you need to do (minus first paragraph rant :P ) Here's an example (basically digest from Neil's links): Your XUL file: Your something.properties (there you define your localized strings key=value). Of course you can have as many files as you want/need: something=Some text for localization something2=Some more text Your js file: var strbundle = document.getElementById("strings"); var localizedString = strbundle.getString("something"); Hope this helps.
