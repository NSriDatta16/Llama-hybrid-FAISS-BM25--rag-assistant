XML Reader Performance

I've traced slugishness in my application to the bit of code that's being timed below. I knew that this would be a slow point but each request is taking an average of 1 second. The bit of xml that I'm after is always in the first tag so I don't think it's the download times that are getting me. Stopwatch stopwatch = new Stopwatch(); XmlTextReader reader = new XmlTextReader("http://steamcommunity.com/id/test?xml=1"); stopwatch.Reset(); stopwatch.Start(); while (reader.Read()) { if (reader.Name.Equals("steamID64")) { reader.Read(); stopwatch.Stop(); time = stopwatch.ElapsedMilliseconds(); return Convert.ToInt64(reader.Value); } } Is there a faster way to read the tag that I want or am I being limited by the server I'm downloading the xml files from? Thanks.
