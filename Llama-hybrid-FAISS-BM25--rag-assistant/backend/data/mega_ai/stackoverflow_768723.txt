The applet-launcher project should help: The JNLPAppletLauncher is a general purpose JNLP-based applet launcher class for deploying applets that use extension libraries containing native code. It allows applets to use extensions like Java 3D, JOGL, and JOAL very easily, with just a few additional parameters to the tag, on Java SE versions as far back as 1.4.2. JOGL has a sample applet here , and Java3D has two samples here .
