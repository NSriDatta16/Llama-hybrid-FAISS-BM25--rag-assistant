A User Agent that says just "Mozilla/4.0" is a bot, right?

I'm getting several requests in web apps that are basically wrong in ways my code shouldn't be generating... Mainly it's requests to .ashx without any GET parameters specified. The user agent is "Mozilla/4.0" (nothing more than that) The IPs vary from day to day. This is a bot, right? Thanks!
