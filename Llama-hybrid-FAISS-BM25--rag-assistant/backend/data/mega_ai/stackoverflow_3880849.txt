You need to think about your application and your user base. For example, historically, IE was installed on many home computers. Most average internet users would never go and install another browser because they didn't really care. There are lots of people however, that do care. Those sorts of people are inclined to install a new browser (or two or three). They tend to be much more tech savy and their expectations are a lot different. Looking at browser market share may be misleading. If you are targeting your website to average internet users, then you'll probably do ok to test the top 2 or 3 browsers. If you are likely to attract a more technical audience, then you can expect a much wider range of browsers. The best stats to use are your own. Look at you logs and run them through some tools that will give you the breakdown of browsers that come to your site. Some interesting links for you: Example: 25% of the visitors we track at Squidoo use Firefox, which is not surprising. But 50% of the people who actually build pages on the site are Firefox users. Twice as many. http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2008/04/why-downloading.html http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_stats.asp
