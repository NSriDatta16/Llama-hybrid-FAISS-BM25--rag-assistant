ok.... after looking at the NHibernate code it seems that I was looking for AliasToBeanConstructorResultTransformer .... of course! However I may have found an nHibernate bug. If you have the same column name returned twice from two different tables (market.name and account.name, say) then by the time nHibernate returns the array from the db to the transformer, the first occurance of 'Name' will be used for both. Nasty. Work around is to uniquely alias. With Hql, the sql generated is heavily aliased, so this is only a bug with SqlQuery. Grrrr. Today must be my day, also found another nHibernate bug/issue I've posted to StackOverflow for comment.
