Silverlight does not let you know anything about a selected file either (just access it as a file stream). Letting you know the file's path would be considered another security hole, so it is not allowed. Sorry. The only folders you can use are in Isolated storage, so you may want to put all your user files there instead. That way you can provide a tree display of files and folders (you will have to obtain, or write, that file/folder selection code of course).
