In C#, how to determine the XSD-defined MaxLength for an element

I'm using XmlReader with an attached XSD for validation. As my XML document is being read and validated, I want to determine in my C# code the 'maxLength' value specified in the XSD for a particular element. For example, my XSD fragment is very simply defined as: I can get the 'minOccurs' value easily using: myReader.SchemaInfo.SchemaElement.MinOccurs; But how do I get the 'maxLength' value (value of 10 in my example fragment above)??? I thought ' myReader.SchemaInfo.SchemaElement.Constraints ' might give me this information, but that collection always has a 'Count' of zero. Thanks, Pat.
