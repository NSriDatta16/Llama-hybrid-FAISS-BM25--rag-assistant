Is there anyway to add metadata to Java Collections?

Let's say I have a collection of objects which can be sorted using a number of different comparators based on the different fields of the object. It would be nice to be able to know later on in the code which comparator was used to sort the Collection with and if it was ascending or descending. Is there anyway to do this elegantly instead of using a bunch of Booleans to keep track of things?
