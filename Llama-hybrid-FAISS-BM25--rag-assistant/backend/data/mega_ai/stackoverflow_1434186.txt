index A,B is different from index B,A That is because an index is organized along a particular sort order. So imagine you need to search with the following WHERE clause WHERE A='somecrit' AND B='SomepartialCrit%' -- notice the wildcard The A,B index will be very efficient at resolving the query, but if it were WHERE A='SomepartialCrit%' AND B='somecrit' The (A,B) index would only partially help (could be better than full table scan but not optimal..) whereby the (B,A) index would come to the rescue... For use with a query that included both A and B as exact match (no wildcard), either index could be used in an equivalent fashion (efficiency-wise), although the choice of one particular index could be driven by other part of the query such as ORDER BY clauses etc. An index on A is different from an index on A,C For one the index on A,C could be used to resolve queries that involve both A and C criteria, and also the A,C index could be use to "cover" the SELECT clause or part thereof, that is: If the SELECT clause only includes column A and C (from this particular table), SQL could provide the results without having to get data from the table proper, it would get the A and C values from the index alone. Are "redundant" indexes a bad thing ? As said above, extra indexes may help resolve SELECT queries more efficiently. On the down side, they a) use storage space and b) make the INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE queries less efficient (because the new/updated/deleted values need to be added/changed/deleted in more places. It is therefore a matter of finding the right balance based on the available storage space available and the use case (some mostly read-only databases can have a slew of indexes without hurting performance at all, databases with frequent inserts can see their performance degrade terribly with too many indices) On clustered indexes See explanation by Joel Coehoorn. No, the clustered index of a given table does not need to be based on the primary key. Selecting a good clustered index (or indeed deciding to not use a clustered index) is a part science part art process which scope is beyond this short response.
