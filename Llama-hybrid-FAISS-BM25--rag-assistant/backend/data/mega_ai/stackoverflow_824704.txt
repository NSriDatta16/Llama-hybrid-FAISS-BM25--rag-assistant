Disable GZIP compression for IE6 clients

We need to conditionally disable GZIP compression if user's browser is IE6 (it hangs browser for 5min) in few pages of larger site. Server is IIS7 and has compression for static content turned on - want that compression left working if user agent is not Mozilla/4.0. ASPX code sample anyone? Alternatively, code to conditionally redirect to the same page on another site (could create another virtual site with compression disabled) but need to pass all parameters (GET/POST).
