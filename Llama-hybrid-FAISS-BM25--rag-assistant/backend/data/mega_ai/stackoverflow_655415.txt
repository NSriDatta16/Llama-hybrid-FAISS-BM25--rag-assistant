As per the man page: -O2 Optimize even more. GCC performs nearly all supported optimizations that do not involve a space-speed tradeoff. The compiler does not perform loop unrolling or function inlining when you specify -O2. As compared to -O, this option increases both compilation time and the performance of the generated code. In human words: it is the highest truly safe way of optimization. -O3 makes reorganizations which can be troublesome at times. The subject as such is fairly deep.
