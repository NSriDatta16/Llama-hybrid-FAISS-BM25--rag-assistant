You may want to consider doing a form of PCA on the correlated time series called SSA, as described in this Q&A: Can PCA be applied for time series data? This should remove any correlation between temperature and oxygen, and then allow you to model just changes in concentration of oxygen that are not explained by the correlation between temperature and oxygen. There is a SSA package for R, but I haven't used it (yet): https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rssa/Rssa.pdf And here is a good intro to SSA: http://environnement.ens.fr/IMG/file/DavidPDF/SSA_beginners_guide_v9.pdf
