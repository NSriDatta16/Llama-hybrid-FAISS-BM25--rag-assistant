Question about interpretation of a fixed effects model

I am trying to see the impact of a group of similarly-minded policies and programs which were introduced at various dates in various Canadian provinces on a measure of student satisfaction. I plan to create an annual province-level index reflecting the extent of these similarly-minded policies to serve as my explanatory variable. I have annual province-level data on student satisfaction. I was thinking to use a fixed effects model with several controls to capture the relationship between the policy index score and student satisfaction. Thus, my basic model would look like $Y_{it}=\alpha_i+\beta X_{it}+\epsilon_{it}$ for province i in year t. I am also interested in seeing the impact of having these policies in one province, province $j$ , in particular. To do this, I am thinking to use the following logic: From the FE model, I will ultimately find that for any province i in any year t, on average, a one point decrease in the index score (i.e. a one-unit decrease in $X_{it}$ ) will result in a change of $\beta$ in $Y_{it}$ . Suppose, for example, that in 2017, province $j$ 's index score is 15. Then if province $j$ had none of these indexed policies (i.e. its index score was 0), $Y_{it}$ would change by $-15\beta$ . Thus, the impact of these policies in province $j$ in year 2017 on the dependent variable was $-15\beta$ . Does this reasoning make sense? Am I interpreting the $\beta$ coefficient in the FE model correctly?
