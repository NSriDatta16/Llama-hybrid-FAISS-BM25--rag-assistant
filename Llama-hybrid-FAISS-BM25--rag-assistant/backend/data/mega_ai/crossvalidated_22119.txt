If you call $A$ the transition matrix of your birth-death chain, with its special structure of only three non-zero terms per row, the probability to observe $n_0,\ldots,n_t$ is $$ [A^{n_0}]_{n_0n_1}\,[A^{n_1}]_{n_1n_2}\cdots[A^{n_{t-1}}]_{n_{t-1}n_t}\,. $$ You therefore are able to compute exactly the likelihood associated with your chain. From there, any standard method depending on the likelihood (Bayesian, MLE, &tc.) applies.
