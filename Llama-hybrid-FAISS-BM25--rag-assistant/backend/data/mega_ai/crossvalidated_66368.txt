Basic epidemiological models in R

To support an education project around neglected infectious diseases in Sub-Saharan Africa, I aim to estimate and report some very basic epidemiological models in R to build intuition and understanding with the students. I have been searching for a little bit (to no avail) - does anyone know of basic R-based modules / models (compartmental or agent-based) that I could use? For example - SIR models similar to these Python models ( http://wiki.deductivethinking.com/wiki/Program_3.1 )
