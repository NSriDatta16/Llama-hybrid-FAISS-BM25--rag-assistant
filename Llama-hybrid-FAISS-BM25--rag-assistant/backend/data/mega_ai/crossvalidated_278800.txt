Predict using trained model on dataset

I am very new to machine learning. I have a question about running predict() on data used for training set. Here are details: I took a portion of my initial dataset and split that portion into 80% (train) and 20% (test). I trained the model on 80% of training set model and then run the model on 20% test data: predict(model, newdata = test.df, type = "prob") Now I want to predict using my trained model on entire initial dataset which also includes the training portion. Do I need to exclude that portion that was used for the training?
