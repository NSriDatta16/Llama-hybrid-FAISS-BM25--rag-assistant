If you want to redirect everything sent to stdout (emitted by print statements, for example) to your text control, then you can just replace sys.stdout with your own object simulating a file object. You can just use the StringIO class, then send its accumulated value to your text control periodically (using a timer). You can also subclass StringIO , override its write method and send the new contents to the text control immediately after every single text fragment received. It is not a nice solution, feels like monkey patching, however.
