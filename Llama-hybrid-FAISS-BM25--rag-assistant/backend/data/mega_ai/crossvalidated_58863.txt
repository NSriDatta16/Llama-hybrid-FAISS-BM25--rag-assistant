When your dependent variable is binary ($1$ vs. $0$, "dead" vs. "alive"), the you might use logistic regression which is a glm with a binomial error distribution and a logit link function. When your dependent variable is ordinal (e.g. "bad"> "good" > "best"), you can use ordinal logistic regression . For a nominal (e.g. transportation: "walk", "car", "bicycle") dependent variable, you can use multinomial logistic regression . EDIT Your approach to convert the disease status into a 0,1-variable seems correct. If your outcome is continuous, you could use a GLM with a gaussian error distribution and an identity link function which is equivalent to a simple multiple regression model (OLS).
