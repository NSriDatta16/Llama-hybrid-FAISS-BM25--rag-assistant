Keep in mind that you're NEVER zooming in on a UIImage . EVER. Instead, you're zooming in and out on the view that displays the UIImage . In this particular case, you chould choose to create a custom UIView with custom drawing to display the image, a UIImageView which displays the image for you, or a UIWebView which will need some additional HTML to back it up. In all cases, you'll need to implement touchesBegan , touchesMoved , and the like to determine what the user is trying to do (zoom, pan, etc.).
