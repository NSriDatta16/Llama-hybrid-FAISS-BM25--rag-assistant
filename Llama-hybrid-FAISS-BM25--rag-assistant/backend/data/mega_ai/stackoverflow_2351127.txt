More generally, you are facing a common issues with specializations. When you write a specialization of a template class, generally you have to pay attention to its interface and make sure it matches the interface of the template class you specialize, otherwise you have those nasty surprises. Sure there are situations in which the very goal of the specialization is to provide a different behavior and some operations do not make sense any longer, but then you lose the benefit of generic programming since you cannot any longer treat any instance of the template like any other and have to write special cases for the specialization whose interface differ... And you just found out that it was no fun ;)
