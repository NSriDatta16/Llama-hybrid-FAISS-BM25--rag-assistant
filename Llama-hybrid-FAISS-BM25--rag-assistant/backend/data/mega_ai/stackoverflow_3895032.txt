null target of extension method

public static IFoo Bar (this IFoo target, ...) { // I'm curious about how useful this check is. if (target == null) throw new ArgumentNullException("target"); ... } (1) The code above seems strange to me because I feel like in any case the calling code would be the one to check that. Is there some subtlety to extension methods in this area that applies? (2) Is there a legitimate pattern that leverages the fact that the target can be null? I ask this as a consequence of wondering why calling an extension method on a null reference wouldn't generate the runtime exception the same way as if you called an instance method on a null reference.
