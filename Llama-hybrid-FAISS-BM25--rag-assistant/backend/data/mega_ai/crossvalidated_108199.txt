Is cross validation needed?

Suppose we have training data set and a test data set. The outcome variable is binary. Is it usually necessary to split the training data set so that there is a cross validation data set? Or can you use the whole training data set to build a model and the use this model on the test data set? For logistic regression, for example, would cross validation really help? If so, what type would be best?
