Just use plain EL in template text: Use of scriptlets is discouraged since over a decade. They should be all replaced by taglibs (Struts2, JSTL, etc) and EL. Whenever that's not possible, then the code logic almost certainly belongs in a real Java class, like a model object, a servlet (or Struts2 action), etc.
