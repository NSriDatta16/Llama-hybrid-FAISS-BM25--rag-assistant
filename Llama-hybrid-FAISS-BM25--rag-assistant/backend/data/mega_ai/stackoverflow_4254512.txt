The best option here (IMO) is just to keep another reference, I prefer self , like this: function MyClass(){ var self = this; this.message = 'Hello World'; // I need access to this variable in the callback //registering class member function as callback $('div').draggable({drag:this.onDrag}); this.onDrag = function(event,ui){ alert(self.message); } } The alternative is messing with context of another plugin you don't really control when (again, IMO) it's not really necessary, just having another reference to access your class is just as easy and less confusing in many cases.
