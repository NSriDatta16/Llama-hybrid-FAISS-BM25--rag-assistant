Ljung-Box test is inappropriate for testing residuals from an ARIMA model, and Breusch-Godfrey test should be used instead; see Testing for autocorrelation: Ljung-Box versus Breusch-Godfrey . (Even if you tried using the Ljung-Box test, the standard practice is to adjust the degrees of freedom of the null distribution for the fact that you are supplying residuals rather than raw data to the test. This can be done using argument fitdf in function Box.test . fitdf should equal the $p+q$ where $p$ is the autoregressive order and $q$ is the moving average order.) Also, no autocorrelation is not necessarily an indication that you have a model that will generalize well out of sample. You are likely to overfit when you require the residuals to have no autocorrelation. Meanwhile, AIC-based model selection as used in auto.arima strikes a good balance between underfitting and overfitting.
