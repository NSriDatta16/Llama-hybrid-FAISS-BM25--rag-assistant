In general I use standard deviations or quantiles for descriptive purposes, i.e. describing my sample, my sampling procedure, etc. - basically whenever I would use boxplots to visualize my data. When my goal is to do any type of inferential or frequentist statistics, and I need an estimation of the error of a statistic, e.g. when I'm interested in the sampling distribution of the sample mean to make generalizing statements about the underlying population parameter, I would use the standard error of the mean (or confidence intervals). On the contrary, when I'm doing Bayesian analyses I would only use standard deviations or quantiles since you are working with a full posterior distribution of plausible parameter values, hence the concept of a standard error (and sampling distributions) doesn't exist.
