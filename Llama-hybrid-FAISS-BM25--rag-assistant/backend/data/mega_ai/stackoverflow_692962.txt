How to use PHP to get a webpage into a variable

I want to download a page from the web, it's allowed to do when you are using a simple browser like Firefox, but when I use "file_get_contents" the server refuses and replies that it understands the command but don't allow such downloads. So what to do? I think I saw in some scripts (on Perl) a way to make your script like a real browser by creating a user agent and cookies, which makes the servers think that your script is a real web browser. Does anyone have an idea about this, how it can be done?
