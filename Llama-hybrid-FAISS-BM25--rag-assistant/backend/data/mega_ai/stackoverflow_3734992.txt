Parent UIScrollView detecting child UIView's touches

Basically... I have a UIScrollView subclass which you can add a target and selector too, which get fired if a touch event is detected within the view. I am using the scroll view as an image gallery, and the touch inside the scroll view is used to fade out the HUD components (UItoolBar, etc): @implementation TouchableScrollView - (void)addTarget:(id)_target withAction:(SEL)_action { target = _target; action = _action; shouldRun = NO; } - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { shouldRun = YES; } - (void)touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { shouldRun = NO; } - (void)touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { if(shouldRun) { shouldRun = NO; [target performSelector:action]; } } @end I then have another custom UIView added as a subview to this which has the following set (both of which I have played around with): self.userInteractionEnabled = YES; self.exclusiveTouch = YES; and uses the following to trigger an animation: - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event The problem is even when the custom UIView detects the touch and responds (by flipping itself over), the UIScrollView selector also gets fired causing everything to fade out. Please help, I'm totally stuck?!
