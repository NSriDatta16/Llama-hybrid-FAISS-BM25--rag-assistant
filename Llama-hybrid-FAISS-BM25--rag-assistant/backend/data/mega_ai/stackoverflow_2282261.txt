Blog Engine .NET with XML Data Storage How is it so fast?

I am looking for a way to embed a blog engine into my own application and I am too curious about Blog Engine algorithm. This may not be the correct place to ask but, How is that possible to store blog entry data in an XML file like BlogEngine.Net with Default Configuration. It must be getting slower everyday while the file is getting larger and larger. I am wondering the algorithm behind that. Is it loading with a different way ? Or Am I wrong with the time estimation ? I know it is open source but I thought it would be better to see a discussion here for some others might be thinking the same and this thread can be a reference.
