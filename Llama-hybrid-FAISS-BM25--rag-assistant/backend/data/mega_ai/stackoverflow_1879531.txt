You can try to make some flag to indicate the first launching of your app. And then store this flag in NSUserDefaults. For example, if you cannot find your flag after launch, you show alert like "would you like to use your current location as start location?" if user choose YES, so you will update location and store it in the userDefaults. This is a persistent storage. Oh, perhaps, it even will be better to store not flag, but your start location coordinates.
