You can download MyEclipse from here . There is a free 30 day trial. But after that, you will have to buy an annual license. You should get the option of creating JavaEE projects in your Eclipse 3.4.2 though. Did you downloaded the 3.4.2 JavaEE distribution? Or installed the plugins manually? I would recommend you to download the JavaEE full distribution. It will save you a couple of headaches.
