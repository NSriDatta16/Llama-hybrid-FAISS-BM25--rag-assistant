Statistical analysis of the results calculated from a stochastic global optimization

I recently use the Basinhopping algorithm [1], a Monte Carlo Markov Chain variant, to find the global minimum of numerical functions (which are not necessarily smooth). Though the global optimization algorithm usually outputs a reasonably small global minimum, I have no idea how to get a statistical meaning, e.g. , the confidence interval, about the calculated global minimum. Question : In a typical stochastic global optimization, how do people perform the uncertainty test on their prediction? In my concrete case, the numerical function $f$ is guaranteed to be non-negative, and thus the global minimum $f^*$, if found, necessarily satisfies $$f^*\geq 0.$$ From time to time, however, the true global minimum, denoted by $$f^*_{true},$$ differs from the one produced by the algorithm. Then my question can be more precisely stated as: Is there a way to estimate $$\text{Probability} ( f^*_{true} = 0~|~ f^* =0)? $$ [1] Wales, David J., and Jonathan PK Doye.
