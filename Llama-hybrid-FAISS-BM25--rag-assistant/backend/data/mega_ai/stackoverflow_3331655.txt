I would pick a for the first one. It is unlikely you will use more than one h1 , plus that class name you chose ties presentation to the class name. You will have a problem, for example, if you want that changed to green at some time (the class name will be redundant). For the footer, both look acceptable, depending on if you need that p as an extra hook for CSS. I'd probably use the p anyway, as it is paragraph-ish .
