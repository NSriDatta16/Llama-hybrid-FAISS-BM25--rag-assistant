Is there any non linear dimensionality reduction algorithm that returns a projection matrix?

Is there any non linear dimensionality reduction algorithm that returns a projection matrix $W$ , such as Kernel PCA and Kernel LDA does? The projection matrix $W$ can be a non linear transformation matrix. My goal is to find a method that don't have any optimization requirements when projecting data onto a new dimension, such as Isomap, Umap etc. have.
