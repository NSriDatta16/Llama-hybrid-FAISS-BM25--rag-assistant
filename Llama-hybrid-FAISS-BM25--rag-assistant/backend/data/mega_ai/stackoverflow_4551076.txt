Googlebot substitutes the links of Rails app with subdomain

I have this Rails app, with domain name abc.com . I am also having a separate subdomain for Piwik stats, in this subdomain stats.abc.com . Googlebot somehow listed some of the links with my subdomain too. http://abc.com/login http://stats.abc.com/login http://abc.com/signup http://stats.abc.com/signup The ones with stats will reference to the same page in the app, but are treated entirely different website. I have put in robots.txt in stats after this matter, but wondering if there is any appropriate way to block this because I may have new subdomains in future. Here's my content in robots.txt User-agent: * Disallow: / Thanks.
