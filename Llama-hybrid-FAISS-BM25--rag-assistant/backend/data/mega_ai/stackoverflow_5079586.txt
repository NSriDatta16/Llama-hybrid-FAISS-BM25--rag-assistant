Use event filtering: e.g. in the list container's setupUi, do # the self param passed to installEventFilter indicates the object which # defines eventFilter(), see below: self.list.installEventFilter(self) and then define the filter API function in that container: def eventFilter(self, watched, event): if event.type() == QEvent.KeyPress and \ event.matches(QKeySequence.InsertParagraphSeparator): i = self.list.currentRow() # process enter key on row i Note that InsertParagraphSeparator is the logical event bound to the Enter key. You can use alternative ways of catching the event, but what I have shown should point you in the right direction.
