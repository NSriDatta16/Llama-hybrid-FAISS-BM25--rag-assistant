Can't upload images with Magento 1.4 on Windows/IIS

Everything else works in Magento 1.4 but I can't upload images. Running on Windows/IIS. I know it isn't officially supported but seems odd that everything works but something as simple as image uploads. Tried updating the media path and that is correct. Also updated permissions on directories, but nothing has worked. Any other ideas to get this to work? thanks
