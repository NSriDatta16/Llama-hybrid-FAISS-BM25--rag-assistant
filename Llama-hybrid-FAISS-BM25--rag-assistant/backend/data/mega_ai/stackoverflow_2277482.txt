I am currently working through a similar example. Once you need to uniquely refer to tags they are no long simple value objects and may continue to grow in complexity. I decided to make them their own entities and create a separate repository to retrieve them. In most scenarios they are loaded or saved with the post but when they are required alone the other repository is used. I hope this helps. EDIT: In part thanks to this post I decided to restructure my application slightly. You are right that I probably was incorrectly making tags an entity. I have since changed my application so that tags are just strings and the post repository handles all the storage requirements around tags. For operations that need posts the tags are loaded with them. For any operation that just requires tags or lists of tags the repository has methods for that.
