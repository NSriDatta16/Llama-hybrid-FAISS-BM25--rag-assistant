You kinda answered your question, if you pay close attention you already now the value the gender U has in your dataset. Why don't you train a different classifier (thus, building 2) for the gender U and then choose the classifier based if the user meets the condition of it's gender being "U" or not?. Also, can you elaborate more on the goal of the model you're building? That might change the approach to the problem.
