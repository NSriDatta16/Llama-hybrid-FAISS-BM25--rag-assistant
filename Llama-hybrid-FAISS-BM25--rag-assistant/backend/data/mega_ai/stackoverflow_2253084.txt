Magento; dispatch multi store

I've set up the following multi site structure in Magento (1.3.2.4); Site | Store | View -------------------------- Site A | Store A | View A Site B | Store B | - So, 2 site codes and 1 view code. Is the (empty) view of Store B inherited from Store A? And what if "Store B" was left blank, would that inherit the root category of "Store A"? My major question I want to dispatch a certain store/site by code, respectively my site codes are 'site_a' and 'site_b'. I have a filesystem that looks like this (goal is not to customize the magento directory). ./sites/site_a/.htaccess ./sites/site_a/magento/ 'setEnv MAGE_RUN_CODE site_a' is added to my htaccess in the root of site_a (found this on internet, im not sure of this is implemented by magento..) I expected switching the RUN_CODE to 'site_b' would load 'Site B' at /site_a/magento/, but it doesn't. Any help is appreciated :-) // Roland Edit: Offcourse $_SERVER['MAGE_RUN_CODE'] exists (with the correct value and matching the configured value) in /site_a/magento/. Im getting this feeling its not implemented :-)
