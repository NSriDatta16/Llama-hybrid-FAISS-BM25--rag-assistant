Several trivial questions about applying Bayesâ€™ rule

Question 1 I wonder can I calculate Bayesian rule like following: P(Raining|Peter uses an umbrella) Since raining or not is irrelevant if Peter uses an umbrella Can we still use Bayes rule? If yes how do we do this? Question2 However in some case it is hard to distinguish that two event is irrelevant or not For example I want to find out what is the probability of my dog come for meal if I ring the bell Given P(Dog come for meal|Ring the bell) Dog come for meal is my subjective opinion: it may be come for meal because of other reason Another example is that the appearance of a rainbow means that good things will come out Given P(Good Things|the appearance of a rainbow) How do we handle this kind of case
