Unless you need more of UIView's event handling stuff, you'll get the best performance if you use a single view and give it a -touchesBegan:withEvent, -touchesMoved, and -touchesEnded methods. Then use a custom drawRect method to draw your individual squares in either on or off states. You could also use layers, but trying to lay out 150 views is asking for trouble.
