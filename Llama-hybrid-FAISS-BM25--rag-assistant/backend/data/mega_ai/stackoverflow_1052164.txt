If the file in question is very large, you should always consider using a memory mapped file. clojure.contrib.mmap offers some functions to deal with that. I know i can create array from clojure but what is the lisp way of handling this? I don't know about the Lisp way, but the Clojure way allows you to use the sequence functions on arrays, so you don't have to decide between efficient representation and comfortable handling (which in my opinion is one of the points that makes Clojure so pragmatic).
