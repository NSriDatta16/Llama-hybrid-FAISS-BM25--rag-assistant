Best practices with STDIN in Ruby?

I want to deal with the command line input in Ruby: > cat input.txt | myprog.rb > myprog.rb myprog.rb arg1 arg2 arg3 ... What is the best way to do it? In particular I want to deal with blank STDIN, and I hope for an elegant solution. #!/usr/bin/env ruby STDIN.read.split("\n").each do |a| puts a end ARGV.each do |b| puts b end
