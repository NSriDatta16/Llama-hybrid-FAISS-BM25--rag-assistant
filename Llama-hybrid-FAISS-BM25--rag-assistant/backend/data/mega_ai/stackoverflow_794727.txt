What's your experience with adding SSL to Tomcat 6?

Over the weekend we added SSL security to a Tomcat 6 instance that has been running for awhile without error. This morning, after the number of sessions increased on the machine, Tomcat began throwing 500 errors to users. I checked the logs and found an instance of OutOfMemory, followed by dozens of errors related to Google Guice attempting to start new threads. I can only image that with the addition of SSL, more memory is being used by more threads being created, or some such situation. I'm not terribly sure where or how the extra resources are being used. I was hoping that those with the experience of using SSL on Tomcat could point me in some direction on places to look for clues. At the moment I'm not sure where the issue could be. Here are a few of the statistics about our setup and configuration: -XX:ThreadStackSize=512 Initial Memory Pool: 128MB Maximum Memory Pool: 1024MB Thread Stack Size: 512KB I've been adjusting these in various ways to attempt to at least find a path towards success. So far, about 5 minutes after the server is restarted the performance begins to plummet. Any direction would be greatly appreciated.
