You can send the Expires , Cache-Control and Pragma headers yourself: Expires uses RFC 1123 date, format, eg: Expires: Thu, 03 Feb 2011 15:16:16 GMT For Cache-Control you can do: Cache-Control: public, max-age: 3600 . The max-age is in seconds. As for Pragma, you can disable the web server's default response of no-cache with: header('Pragma: '); PS. Many webservers also include a way for you to tell the webserver handle serving the file. In lighttpd you can use the x-sendfile header. In Apache you can use mod_xsendfile if you have it installed to do the same. In nginx you can use the X-Accel-Redirect header. Serving static files is really the webserver's job, and these are very handy features that you can take advantage of, while still hiding your files from public docroot area. For other webservers you can fallback to handling sending the headers for caching yourself.
