It's 100% unnecessary from a functional point of view. And the way you have things arranged it's also completely unnecessary from a style point of view. Alternate CSS organizational schemes (indenting hierarchically, for instance) can make it worth it. If I have an element with children I'll often leave an empty selector lying around, at least until I'm done with the project and I'm optimizing, because it helps keep things organized and there's a very good chance I'm going to at least apply style to that element at a later time.
