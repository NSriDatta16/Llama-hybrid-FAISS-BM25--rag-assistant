How to compress small strings

I have an sqlite database full of huge number of URLs and it's taking huge amount of diskspace, and accessing it causes many disk seeks and is slow. Average URL path length is 97 bytes (host names repeat a lot so I moved them to a foreign-keyed table). Is there any good way of compressing them? Most compression algorithms work well with big documents, not "documents" of less that 100 bytes on average, but even 20% reduction would be very useful. Any compression algorithms that would work? Doesn't have to be anything standard.
