Windows layout : see the navigator

In netbeans I should want a layout like the second in this page : http://wiki.netbeans.org/WinsysLayoutFor65 The navigator is in bottom, left side. I can't do that. If I select menu Window/Navigating/Navigator, the navigators appears in the middle panel. If I drag drop it, it goes in left, or in bottom, but never in bottom left. How is it possible to put it in bottom left ? Thanks.
