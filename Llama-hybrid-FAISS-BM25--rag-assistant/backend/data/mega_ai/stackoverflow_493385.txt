I used to build a massive Java webapp (JSP frontend) using Ant on Windows and it would take upwards of 3 minutes. I wiped my computer and installed Linux, and suddenly the builds took 18 seconds. Those are real numbers, albeit about 3 years old. I can only assume that Java prefers the Linux memory management and threading models to the Windows equivalents, as all Java programs appear to run better under Linux in my experience (especially Eclipse). Linux seems a lot better about preventing extra reads from the disk when you're doing a lot of reading of files that haven't changed (i.e. exectuables and libraries). This may be a property of the disk cache or the filesystem, I'm not sure which. One of the great things about Java is that it's cross-platform, so setting up a Linux-based build server is actually an option for you. Being something of a Linux evangelist, I'd of course prefer to see you switch your dev environment to Linux, but I know that a lot of people don't want to do that (or can't for practical reasons). If you're not willing to even set up a Linux build server to see if it runs faster, you could at least try defragmenting your Windows machine's hard drive. That makes a huge difference for C++ builds on my work computer. Try JkDefrag , which seems a lot better than the defragmenter that comes with Windows. EDIT : I'd assume I got a downvote because my answer doesn't address the exact question asked. It is, however, in the tradition of StackOverflow to help people fix their real problem, not just treat the symptoms. I'm not one of those people for whom the answer to every question is "use linux". In this instance, however, I have very real, measured performance gains in exactly the situation the OP is asking about, so I thought it worth sharing my experiences.
