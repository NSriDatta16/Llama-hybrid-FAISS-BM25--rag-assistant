You need to separate tasks and versions in your mind before you can come back and apply them. Tasks are work you do on your code. Versions (and I'm lumping in all point releases here) are releases of your code. You to work, tasks, on your code with the objective of making a release. That release, depending on the scope of the work you are doing may be a full version 1.x.x, 2.x.x, etc., or a point release 1.1.x, 1.2.x, 1.3.x or it may be a minor point release/bugfix/whatever you want to call it, 1.0.1, 1.0.2, 1.0.3. The tasks could be bug fixes, features, changes, refactoring, whatever. In the scope of a full application development you may that your organisation bundles groups of tasks in to the work needed to make the next release or you may have releases date-bound, i.e. you'll release version 2.0.0 on 25-Feb-2011 regardless of the tasks completed (although normally there's a subset that must be complete for the release to happen). Version releases tend to follow major updates, upgrades, feature additions. Point releases tend to follow moderate improvements, and major bug fixing. Minor point releases to be the result of bug fixes. Every where you turn you will find different approaches to this process and you just need to either understand that used by your company or if you have the opportunity, to find one that makes sense to you and then apply it consistently.
