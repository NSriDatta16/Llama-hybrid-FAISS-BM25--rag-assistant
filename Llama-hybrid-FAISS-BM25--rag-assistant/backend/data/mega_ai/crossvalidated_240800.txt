Random Forest classwt

I have a random forest algorithm that performs reasonably well. I read here about the importance of classwt (the priors of the classes) and decided to try them out. I have 18 columns, each with over 1000 data points and only 2 classes. Class -1 is present about 75% of the time, while class 1 is the remaining 25%. Now the questions: Why the priors don't need to add up to 1 ? I used the priors above (.75, .25) and the performance has been either same or significantly worse. Why classwt doesn't improve the performance ? Am I doing something wrong ?
