Incorrect Lambda value with Box-Cox transformation on time series data in python

I am trying to perform Box-Cox transformation of my time series data and I am getting a lambda value of -14.38 in python. Isnâ€™t this wrong since lambda lies between -5 and 5 in Box-Cox transformation? My data has high variance with increasing trend in annual growth rates for every year, so I want to transform it to stabilize variance. What could be wrong that I am getting this unusual lambda value? For reference attached image shows how my series looks like. Code used in python: sessions_df['sessions'], lambd= stats.boxcox(sessions_df['sessions']) print('Lambda: %f' % lambd)
