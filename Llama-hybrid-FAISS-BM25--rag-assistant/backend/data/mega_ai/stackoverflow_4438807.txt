I would imagine you only need one collection per type of information you need to collection. To improve performance, simplify code I would use TObjectIntHashMap. e.g. How many requests of content type X have been done TObjectIntHashMap contentTypeCount = new TObjectIntHashMap (); contentTypeCount.increment(contentType); How long it takes to process request of type Y TObjectLongHashMap contentTypeTime = new TObjectLongHashMap (); contentTypeTime.adjustValue(processType, processTime); I don't see how you can make it any shorter/simpler/faster by using the other approaches you mentioned. The average time to perform increment(key) on my machines takes 15 ns (billionths of a second)
