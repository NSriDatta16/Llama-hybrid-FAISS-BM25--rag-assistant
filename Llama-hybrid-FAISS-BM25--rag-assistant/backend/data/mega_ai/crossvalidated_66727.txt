Score Variance of supplementary individuals in PCA

I have posted an almost similar question last week but I want to get some more of the theoretical background Difference in Variance of factor scores for supplementary and active observations PCA . I am doing PCA on genetic data (number of variables >> number of rows) and all data points take values in {0,1,2}. The aim of doing the PCA is to isolate the effect of different origins (People from Europe have different genetic structure than people from Asia). I have run the PCA with several different packages on two kinds of different data sets. One with little structure ( all the samples had the same origin) and one including samples from two different world regions. I use a subset of the data to find PCs and then apply the loading matrix to supplementary samples. What I observe is the following. In the case of the data set with little structure, as expected the eigenvalues are almost similar and so the proportion of total population variance explained by the first principal component is small. Now if I apply the loadings matrix to supplementary individuals that have been standardized using the mean of the active sample the score variance of these supplementary individuals is much smaller (3 to 5 times smaller). I then did the PCA only on the supplementary individuals and it turns out that the PC1 of the two subsets are poorly correlated (~ $0.07$). When I do the exact same thing on data including samples from two different world regions than the difference in Score Variance between the active and supplementary individuals is much smaller ( $\frac{Var(Score_{passive})}{Var(Score_{active})} = 0.9$) and the PC1 of the two subset are strongly correlated (~ $0.95$). However the the Score Variance of the passive sample is still smaller than the one of the active sample. Now my question: Is this a global result? Is the Score Variance of the supplementary individuals always smaller than the one of the active? I'd really like to understand but I'm having trouble getting the mathematics and Intuition behind that straight.
