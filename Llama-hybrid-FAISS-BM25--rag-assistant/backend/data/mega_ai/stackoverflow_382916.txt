To build on daub815's answer, in Windows, you can use a batch file to pass arguments to another command. In this case, we'll use the java launcher to launch your class with the main method. I did a quick Google search on how to do write a batch file to take multiple arguments, and found a page with a batch file to pass arguments to another command. Adapting from the example, here is what you can do: @ECHO OFF :Loop IF "%1" == "" GOTO Done java YourClass %1 SHIFT GOTO Loop :Done Save the above file as a batch file (with a ".bat" extension), and then you can drag-and-drop files onto it, and it will be passed as arguments. Also, you can call the batch file from the command line and pass arguments as well. Edit : It appears that the batch file will not work with quoted arguments which contain spaces. Using a workaround presented in the site I've linked to will split the spaces contained in the quoted full path of the file into separate arguments, so that won't work either. If anyone has a good idea how to fix this, please either edit this entry, or post another answer. I will make this a community wiki.
