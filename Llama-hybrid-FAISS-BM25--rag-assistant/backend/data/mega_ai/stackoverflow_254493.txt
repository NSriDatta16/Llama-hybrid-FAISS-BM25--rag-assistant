I've used schemas in the past sort of like namespaces so you could have multiple entities named Address ( [Person].[Address] , [Company].[Address] ). The advantage to this is visual organization in SQL Management Studio, you can get the same thing by putting everything under one schema and naming tables with a single identifier (i.e. [dbo].[PersonAddress] ). I've also used them for developer vs. developer development prior to running SQL Server Developer Edition on all our dev machines (back when we had a centralized development database earlier in my career).
