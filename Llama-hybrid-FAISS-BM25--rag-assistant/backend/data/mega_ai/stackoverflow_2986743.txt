GWT as offline app, to be deployed onto an iPad

I often use GWT for web UIs. I have heard of it being used a fair bit in conjunction with Gears for offline solutions (probably nowadays HTML5 "offline storage" is all the rage) and I'd like to experiment with building a GUI in GWT and use it on my iPad. Tips/tutorials on how to deploy it onto the device to act as much as possible like a resident "App"? This is just a curiosity/experiment to fill a week-end... (I can "free" the iPad for the experiment if need be yet I am sure a lot can be done without doing so...)
