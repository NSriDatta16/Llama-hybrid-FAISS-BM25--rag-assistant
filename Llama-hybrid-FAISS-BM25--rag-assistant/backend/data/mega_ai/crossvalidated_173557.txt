The description suggests you have MCMC samples. this leads me to expect that the model you fit was Bayesian. If that is the case then it does not make sense to look for confidence intervals for parameters. Instead, you could provide credible intervals; typically by stating the $\alpha/2$ and $(1-\alpha)/2$ empirical quantiles from your MCMC samples. The asymmetry of the distributions does not change this. *Unless there is something quite special to say about whether your algorithm was likely to perform badly at the corners. EDIT: the argmax of the posterior distribution is called the MAP estimate. This is what you are calling the 'fit value'. MAP estimates are great, but in Bayesian stats, it's not all about $MAP \pm 1.96 \sigma$. For instance you could easily take the mean or median of your samples rather than the mode. Basically your samples contain a lot more information than just the fit values. Consider how you would react if the hist below was of your posterior samples, would 3 be your 'fit value', or would 0? How would you summarise your samples? Whatever prior you use, the posterior should be a probability distribution (caveat: search for 'improper priors'). Summary: you're on the right lines using quantiles of your samples (more care may be needed if you want to go beyond univariate summaries). Your issue is thinking that there's a problem with doing that; this likely caused by conceptual carry over from frequentist stats.
