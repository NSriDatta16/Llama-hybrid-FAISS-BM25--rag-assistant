How to select and plot hourly averages from data frame?

I have a CSV file that looks like this, where "time" is a UNIX timestamp: time,count 1300162432,5 1299849832,0 1300006132,1 1300245532,4 1299932932,1 1300089232,1 1299776632,9 1299703432,14 ... and so on I am reading it into R and converting the time column into POSIXct like so: data Great so far, but now I would like to build a histogram with each bin corresponding to the average hourly count. I'm stuck on selecting by hour and then counting. I've looked through ?POSIXt and ?cut.POSIXt , but if the answer is in there, I am not seeing it. Any help would be appreciated.
