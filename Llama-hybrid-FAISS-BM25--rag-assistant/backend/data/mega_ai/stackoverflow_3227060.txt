SIngle and Double click events not working as expected in canvas

I have a Canvas which is present in a UserControl , I have attached the DoubleClick event to this UserControl like this mainWindow.CanvasLayout.MouseDoubleClick += new MouseButtonEventHandler(CanvasLayout_MouseDoubleClick); I am using this event handler to achieve full screen functionality. Now, Canvas can have various controls placed inside it. Drag and drop functionality is implemented for these controls similar to this codeproject article. Basically, I handle these events for a control - this._dragSource.PreviewMouseLeftButtonDown += new MouseButtonEventHandler(DragSource_PreviewMouseLeftButtonDown); this._dragSource.PreviewMouseMove += new System.Windows.Input.MouseEventHandler(DragSource_PreviewMouseMove); this._dragSource.PreviewMouseLeftButtonUp += new MouseButtonEventHandler(DragSource_PreviewMouseLeftButtonUp); Now, when user DoubleClicks on a control(present in canvas ) both DoubleClick (Full Screen) and single Click (drag & drop) operations are performed, i.e. if user double clicks on control and change its mouse position quickly, control position is changed(its dragged and dropped to new position). Is there any way I can prevent drag and drop operation when user double clicks on a control?
