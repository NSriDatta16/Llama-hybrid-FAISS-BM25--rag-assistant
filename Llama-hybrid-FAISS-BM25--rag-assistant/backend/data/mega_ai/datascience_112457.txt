What does ~\epsilon means in the Bellman equation?

Slide 30 of these lecture notes for reinforcement learning contains this "Bellman equation": $$ Q^*(s, a) = \mathbb{E}_{s'\sim\varepsilon} \left[ r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q^*(s', a') \mid s, a \right]$$ Everything else makes sense to me, but what does the " $\sim\varepsilon$ " part mean?
