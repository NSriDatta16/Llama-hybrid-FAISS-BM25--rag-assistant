Suppose that you have a learning problem and it's just for fitting a function which depends on only one feature, and the function to be predicted is a quadratic shape. you can have a good performance by just having the input feature if you use linear SVM but it will have errors. adding extra features, polynomial features as the input may be useful but it adds more complexity to the classifier and it causes more computational overheads. By the way that's true. You can have better estimate of functions by adding the high order polynomials of the features in hand. I don't know if you are familiar with normal equation or not but what that does is to add high order polynomials to better fit the function which makes the current data.
