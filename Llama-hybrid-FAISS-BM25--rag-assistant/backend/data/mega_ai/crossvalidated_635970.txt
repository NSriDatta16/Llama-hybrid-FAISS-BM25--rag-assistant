Hi Rashad: I'll write this here even though it's not an answer. Suppose one had a distributed lag model such as: $y_t = \rho y_{t-1} + x_t + \epsilon_t$ . This kind of look like a harmless regression with independent errors. But, now, re-write it using the lag operator. One obtains: $y_t = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \rho^{i} x_{t-i} + \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \rho^{i} \epsilon_{t-i}$ So, my point is that the inclusion of a lagged dependent variable ( in this case, $y_{t-1}$ ), actually implies a correlated response in the "transformed" version of the model. So, a lagged dependent variable is a way of dealing with past errors and $x's$ that continue to have a lagged effect and are NOT just contemporaneous. I hope that helps as far as what I'm trying to say but I'm not even sure if it's relevant to your problem. I think it answers the first question hopefully which is that you're current model does not account for errors that continue to have a lagged effect after their initial occurrence. Andrew Harvey's "Econometric Analysis of Time Series", an underrated text, covers this type of material. Most econometric texts and statistics time series texts don't, atleast at the level that Harvey does.
