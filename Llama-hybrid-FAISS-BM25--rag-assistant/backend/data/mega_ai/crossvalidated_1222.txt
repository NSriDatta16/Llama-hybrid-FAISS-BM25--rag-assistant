I can't post a comment (the appropriate place for this comment) as I don't have enough reputation, but the answer accepted as the best answer by the question owner misses the point. "If statistics is all about maximizing likelihood, then machine learning is all about minimizing loss." The likelihood is a loss function. Maximising likelihood is the same as minimising a loss function: the deviance, which is just -2 times the log-likelihood function. Similarly finding a least squares solution is about minimising the loss function describing the residual sum of squares. Both ML and stats use algorithms to optimise the fit of some function (in the broadest terms) to data. Optimisation necessarily involves minimising some loss function.
