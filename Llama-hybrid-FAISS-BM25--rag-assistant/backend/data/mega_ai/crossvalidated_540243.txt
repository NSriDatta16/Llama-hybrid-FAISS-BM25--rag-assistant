Q1: I assume for coefficients 2& 3, the levels of the other factor(s) are held constant? So, in this case, coefficient 2 would be the estimated average difference in running performance when a shake is consumed before a long warm up with self-selected music. Is this the correct interpretation? In short, no. Coefficient 2 is the effect of consuming a shake irrespective of the duration or the type of music. It is assumed to be the same unless you fit an interaction. I think, at least in part, that also answers Q2 and Q3.
