The question you want to ask I think is not "what stocks fell first," that is clear as Zen said, it seems that you want to know what characteristics are common to stocks that fell "first." You must define what that means, ie. what the cutoff point for stocks that fell first is. You mention one day or two days after t=700 in your question, as long as you have a justification for that timeline, that is fine. Just define the period you want to analyse. Robustness checks could be performed by examining different period lengths. I think that if you do that, you can create an indicator variable (1/0) for whether or not the stock "fell early", maybe deciding that using the SVM classifier as mentioned above. I would recommend using a non parametric technique to compare the stocks. If you were interested in a causal interpretation of whether some variable caused prices to drop first, you could use a matching estimator (if your data fulfills the relevant criteria) that compares the 1 group with the 0 group. Alternatively, you could analyse the data parametrically, again using the indicator variable with a probit or logit model, or if you are looking for something causal use an IV probit estimator. There are many more options. Point is, I think you should focus on modelling the "early fall", and use a theory-based choice for what is considered early. This is based on a slightly different interpretation of what you described in the question, but I hope it is constructive for you, since I think as it is written you do not have a hypothesis that requires any regression or other inferential statistics.
