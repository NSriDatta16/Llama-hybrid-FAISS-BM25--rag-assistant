Allright, first of all, try to understand how core data works. I think you're pretty close, but programming is all about really knowing what's going on, instead of 'kinda' knowing what's going on. The Getting started with Core Data" guide is quite instructive. Now about your code (I don't know you're exact data-model and surrounding code, so I'm kinda guessing here). I'm assuming you have a member called 'datePicker', which refers to the datepicker that you're using. Allright, let me see if I can quickly fix some things in your code, but do be a bit careful. I haven't read through every line of your source code, and I haven't tried compiling it, so there will probably still be errors. In the end, you'll still a thorough understanding of the code. - (void)textViewDidEndEditing:(UITextView *)textView { NSManagedObjectContext *context = [OrganizerAppDelegate managedObjectContext]; NSManagedObject *note = [NSEntityDescription insertNewObjectForEntityForName:@"Notes" inManagedObjectContext:context]; [note setValue:notesView.text forKey:@"text"]; // Set the timestamp as well. [note setValue:datePicker.date forKey:@"timeStamp"]; NSError *err=nil; if (![context save:&err]) { NSLog(@"Whoops, couldn't save: %@", [err localizedDescription]); } } /* Beware, we're just storing every edit here, without every throwing anything away. We'll try to display just the latest note in the 'dateChanged', but you might want to delete any previous notes first.*/ /* I don't think this whole dissecting and generating a date is necessary */ - (void) dateChanged:(id)sender{ //Load... NSEntityDescription *entityDescription = [NSEntityDescription entityForName:@"Text" inManagedObjectContext:self.managedObjectContext]; NSFetchRequest *request = [[[NSFetchRequest alloc] init] autorelease]; [request setEntity:entityDescription]; NSPredicate *predicate = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat: @"(timeStamp = %@)",datePicker.date]; [request setPredicate:predicate]; //added this line later NSArray *array = [self.managedObjectContext executeFetchRequest:request error:&error]; // Assuming that the last item in the array is the item that was added last. This might or might not be reasonable. notesView.text = [[array lastObject] text]; [monTable reloadData]; [tueTable reloadData]; [wedTable reloadData]; [thuTable reloadData]; [friTable reloadData]; }
