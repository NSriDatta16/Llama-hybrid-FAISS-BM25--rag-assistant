Algorithms that lead to java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: PermGen space error

I am getting PermGen space error on Sun JVM (1.6.0_21-b06) (Ok, it's Oracle :)). Increasing of option -XX:MaxPermGen value does not help. I know that PermGen is a space intended for permanent objects like class metadata. Count of classes in project is not so big ~ 10 000. Before crash jvisualvm shows 57MB as Used PermGen. I guess that some algorithm occupies all accessible memory. Does someone know examples of algorithms that lead to PermGen overflow ? UPD. I ask such abstract question, because in the moment I can not use any profiler - code crashes so hard that jvisualvm and eclipse stop to respond. I need than kill java processes from terminal with kill -KILL {process_numer}. I work with bad organized (but commercial) code that has many threads and JMS messaging. Debugging is a mess - I need some idea first where to look.
