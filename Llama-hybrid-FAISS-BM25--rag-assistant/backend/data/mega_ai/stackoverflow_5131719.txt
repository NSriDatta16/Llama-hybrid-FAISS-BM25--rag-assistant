Like you said, a User can create an organization, so unless the organization doesn't tracks the owner (unlikely), you should have the CreateOrganization method delegated onto the user. A basic idea I can think of would be like: User: Creates organizations by calling OrganizationRepository::Add( OwnerId ) Organizations: Can only be created given the id of the owner. If ( and only if ) you don't need to track the creator of organizations, then the idea of placing an Add method directly on the organization without requiring anything else looks fine. Hope I can help! David
