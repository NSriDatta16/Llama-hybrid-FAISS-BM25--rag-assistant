Time series simulation based on a given time series

I’m looking for some procedures to simulate time series based on another time series as an input. The objective is that it may provide me with more training datasets that are similar to the given time series. A few methods that come to my mind is by using GAN(generative adversarial network) and Monte Carlo. Ideally there’re some R packages that can help with generating the time series simulation. Open to ideas, thanks!
