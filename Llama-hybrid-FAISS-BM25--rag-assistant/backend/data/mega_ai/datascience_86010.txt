You might be interested in the annual Kaggle survey about the state of Machine Learning and Data Science. Some key results related to your question: The most commonly used algorithms were linear and logistic regression, followed closely by decision trees and random forests. Of more complex methods, gradient boosting machines and convolutional neural networks were the most popular approaches. Some numbers from the report (2020): Linear or Logistic Regression - 83.7% Decision Trees or Random Forests - 78.1% Gradient Boosting Machines (xgboost, lightgbm, etc.) - 61.4% Convolutional Neural Networks - 43.2% Bayesian Approaches - 31.4% Recurrent Neural Networks - 30.2% Neural Networks (MLPs, etc.) - 28.2% Transformer Networks (BERT, gpt-3, etc.) - 14.8% Generative Adversial Networks - 7.3% Evolutionary Approaches - 6.5%
