How do I visualize data where I have to compare multiple data, but one gigantic output is tanking others

I have 6 different data sets which I need to compare. I am able to compare five of them by plotting graphs, but when I include the sixth dataset, it tanks the other datasets because while the maximum value of the other five datasets is in thousands, for the sixth dataset, the maximum values is in billions. So I get one straight line for the first five datasets and some graph for the sixth. Therefore, I am unable to compare the first five together with the sixth. How should I visualize the data so that I can differentiate between them.
