Rail Application Model/Controller & Routrs organisation

I'm trying to work on this Rails app which has the following objectives: /foods/ - render a list of food categories (eg: Breads, Dairy, Biscuits...etc) /foods/breads/ - render all Foods that are within the food category "Breads" foods/breads/bagel - render a detailed view of the properties of the Food (in this example a Bagel). Currently I have two models with associated controllers: Foods - contains a list of foods (eg: bagel, rice, toast, rich tea biscuit...etc) and is set up to belongs_to a single Food Cat Food Categories - a list of categories such as "Dairy", "Breads"...etc & is set up to has_many :foods I'm really stuck on how to achieve my objectives. I really need advice on routing, controller actions and views. Any suggestions?
