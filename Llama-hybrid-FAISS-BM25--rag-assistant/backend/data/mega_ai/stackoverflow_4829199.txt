SQL: Is there a way to get the average number of characters for a field?

Is there a simple sql query that can help me to determine the average number of characters that a (text) database field has? For instance my field is called "message". Ideally I would love to do something like this... select average(characterlength(message)) from mydatabasetable is this even possible through sql? Thanks!
