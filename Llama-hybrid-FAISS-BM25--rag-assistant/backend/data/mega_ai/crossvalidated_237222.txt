Binomial regression is any type of GLM using a binomial mean-variance relationship where the variance is given by $\mbox{var}(Y) = \hat{Y}(1-\hat{Y})$. In logistic regression the $\hat{Y} = \mbox{logit}^{-1}(\mathbf{X}\hat{\beta})=1/(1-\exp{(\mathbf{X}\hat{\beta})})$ with the logit function said to be a "link" function. However a general class of binomial regression models can be defined with any type of link function, even functions outputting a range outside of $[0,1]$. For instance, probit regression takes a link of the inverse normal CDF, relative risk regression takes as a link the log function, and additive risk models take the identity link model.
