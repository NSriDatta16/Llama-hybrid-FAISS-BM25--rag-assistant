Prefer Charles Merram's answer, but I thought this worth noting as working but ugly and to be discouraged. Because '.' is a lexical delimiter , the following worked: >>> 'abc def' . split() ['abc', 'def'] >>> 'abc def' . \ ... split() ['abc', 'def'] >>> sys.version '2.6.4 (r264:75706, Dec 7 2009, 18:45:15) \n[GCC 4.4.1]' but don't do that.
