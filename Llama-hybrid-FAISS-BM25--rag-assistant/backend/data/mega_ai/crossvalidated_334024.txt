Running logistic Regression in SPSS

My survey data contains 10 different questions all recoded into 'Correct' (1) and 'Incorrect'. I have 2 IVs which are also categorical. I need to find out whether each treatment condition affects the answer to the questions. In order to do this in SPSS I have 2 options: Run binomial logistic regression with each question as my DV and the two categorical IVs. However, do I run binomial logistic regression for each question separately? Does SPSS allow to run this with multiple dependent variables? Run multinomial logistic regression. In this case, I created a variable called 'correct_answers' which indicate the number of correct answers given by each participant. So, in order to run multinomial logistic regression, I would put 'Correct_answers' as my DV (reference as last by default) and Factors (since categorical) or IVs would contain each question and the two previous IVs. Will this work or am I doing something wrong? Thank you.
