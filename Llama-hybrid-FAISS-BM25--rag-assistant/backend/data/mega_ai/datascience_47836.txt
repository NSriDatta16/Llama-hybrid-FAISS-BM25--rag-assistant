So finding actions from videos happens to be a tricky task. I have no idea about temporal 3D convnet but in order to tackle a problem like this, I would couple the CNN layer on individual frames of video and then feed the frame timeline into another layer of LSTM in order to find the context of the video. As the action being performed on the video covers anywhere from 10% to 90% of the frame, you can perform TestTimeAugmentation on the video in order to find the action with a higher confidence rate. Similar approach could be found in this video by Google .
