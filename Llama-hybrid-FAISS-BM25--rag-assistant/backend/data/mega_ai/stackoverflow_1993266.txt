I run an instance of Tomcat on my machine, with a simple HTML page that has all the links I need (e.g. Java, Hibernate, Spring, Groovy). I set this page to be my home page in Firefox. I find this much more useful than bookmarks, which are a wretched way to organize information, IMHO. I can get to the Java6 doc with "Ctrl-T [or 'Home'], click". After that, navigation is a simple search.
