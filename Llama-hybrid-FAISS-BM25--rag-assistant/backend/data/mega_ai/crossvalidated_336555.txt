Does higher maximum Q value imply better or worse performance?

Suppose I run a RL algorithm and for every episode, I grab the (average) maximum Q value. I do this for several runs (with different hyper-paramters, for instance) to compare performance of my RL algorithm. The curves look something like this. What can I say about the performance of these runs? Is larger the maximum Q value the better? I have found some paper online ( second to last page) that says: "Since maximum Q value explodes....therefore the performance is worse..." Can someone explain why this should be the case? By definition, Q value is the maximum expectation reward at state s, taking action a, following policy $\pi$. Why would a higher expected reward translate into worse performance?
