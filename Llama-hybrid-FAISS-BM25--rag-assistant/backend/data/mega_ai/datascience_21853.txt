Hi All, My name is Kasra, originally from Iran and currently living in Germany. I am a Machine Learning Scientist by training and my research has been focused on Graphs and Complex Networks during the last 3 years of my academic activity. I did my masters in Machine Learning at University of Bonn, Germany and did 2 years of my PhD at Space Physics Group, Institute of Geophysics at University of Cologne in Germany. At the moment I work as a senior Machine Learning Scientist at areto-consulting in Cologne. I would love to contribute to the community as a moderator as I think I can bring practice and theory together in SE discussions and help the community stand at a rational place between practical Data Science and theoretical ML/PR/DM. For more info you may check my website or my LinkedIn profile which are a bit out-dated but still says something about me! I wish for final elected candidates a bright, joyful and fruitful way ahead in advance!
