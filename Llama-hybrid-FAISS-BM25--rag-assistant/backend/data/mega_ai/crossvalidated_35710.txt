I would start by generating a sample correlation matrix for a large subset of those variables. Eliminate the variables with low correlation and test the one's that appear to have high correlation. This selection process technically violates the assumption of independent testing. But I think it is still a reasonable approach as long as you take multiplicity into account. If you only want to focus on Japan then look at only the Japanese data. However, sometimes in estimation problems however the estimation of parameters for one country can "borrow" strength from the results for other countries. In such cases empirical Bayes methods can be used. In their baseball player batting average example, that is how Efron and Morris use other players' batting average to improve the estimate of a given player's average. So there could be an advantage to using all the data.
