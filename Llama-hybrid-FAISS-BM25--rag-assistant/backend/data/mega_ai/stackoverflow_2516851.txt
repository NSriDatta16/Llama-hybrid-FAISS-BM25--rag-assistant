RTP H.264 save and replay

We are interested in saving a H.264 stream and replaying it. Is there any one who experience saving h.264 using winpcap and replaying it. We were able to save H.263 and replay, but same logic does not work for H.264. We also tried rtpdump tool to save H264 stream, but we were unable to replay it in that format? thanks in advance
