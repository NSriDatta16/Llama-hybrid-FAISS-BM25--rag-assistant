A bit off topic, but perhaps useful in your search (which sounds like a Masters/Ph.D. thesis). In my experience of using learning algorithms for things like classification, segmentation, etc., Bayesian learning is superior to all forms of neural nets, genetic algorithms, and other nifty sounding algorithms due to its strong mathematical basis. A foundation in mathematics, in my book, makes a technique superior to ad-hoc methods. For example, the result from a Bayesian network can be mathematically interpreted as a probability (even with a p-value if you like), while a neural net is often guesswork. Unfortunately, Bayesian statistics doesn't sound as sexy as "neural network" even though it's arguably more useful and well founded. I would love to see somebody shake this out formally in an academic setting.
