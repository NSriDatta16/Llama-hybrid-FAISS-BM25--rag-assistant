Aggregates in DataSet are normally used in conjunction with relations: http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpref/html/frlrfsystemdatadatacolumnclassexpressiontopic.asp Basically if you need your result as single row with single column, you'd need to create that extra table with that column and add expression to it so you would get a single row: Table1, column Number: 3 rows containing 1,2,3 Table2, column Average, expression set to "Avg(Table1.Number)": One rows containing 2 As to your particular example: "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ", you could use row count: table.Rows.Count You can also create DataView with particular filter and get number of rows in it to emulate more complex cases of COUNT.
