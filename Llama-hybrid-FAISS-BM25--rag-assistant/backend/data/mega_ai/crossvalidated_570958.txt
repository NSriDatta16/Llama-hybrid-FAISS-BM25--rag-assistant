Which is the measurement invariance level necessary for a multiple regression analysis?

I am interested in running a multiple regression model to test the association between a predictor variable x and an outcome variable y and control by some confounders variables (e. g. gender, age). Considering that metric invariance (loadings constrained to be equal across groups) across confounder variables groups (gender, age) is supported for the predictor variable and for the outcome variable, is it ok to run multiple regression models (examples : binomial negative , logistic regression) or is it necessary to have also scalar invariance ( loadings and intercepts constrained) ?
