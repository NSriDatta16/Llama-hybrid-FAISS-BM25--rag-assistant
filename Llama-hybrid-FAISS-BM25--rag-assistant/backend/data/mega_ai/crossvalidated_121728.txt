One reason to convert ordinal Likert values to ratio scale values is if you plan to do any math functions after obtaining the responses. As an ordinal scale, Likert responses support mode and median calculations, but not +, -, X, or / functions, nor averaging, raising to powers, etc. This is because there is poor equality of ratios between the scores. In other words, the distance between 1 and 2 is not the same as between 4 and 5. If you use a standard Likert 1-5 scale (1 being most important), the interval ratios between the ordinal levels look like this: 2/1 = 2 3/2 = 1.5 4/3 = 1.33 5/4 = 1.25 To convert the Likert scale to ratio scale, create a pair-wise comparison matrix using AHP, and calculate its eigenvector. I like to begin with monotonal values in the matrix unless there is a reason to do otherwise. The resulting eigenvalues will be from highest to lowest: 0.50, 0.260, 0.134, 0.068, 0.035. Using this ratio scale 0.503-0.035 (0.503 being most important), the interval ratios between the levels are much closer, looking like this: 0.503/0.260 = 1.93 0.260/0.134 = 1.94 0.134/0.068 = 1.98 0.068/0.035 = 1.95 We use AHP exclusively in modern QFD, a method of new product development. This improves the accuracy and confidence in the results, which impact multi-million dollar investments.
