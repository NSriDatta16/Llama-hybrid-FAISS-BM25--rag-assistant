Stationarity in OLS time series and asymptotic properties

I think I lack somewhat deeper understanding of this topic, but I thought stationarity is required in order for OLS to have asymptotic properties. "But stationarity is not at all critical for OLS to have its standard asymptotic properties"( Wooldridge, 2012 ) I thought stationarity is needed or otherwise OLS would not be consistent, but I guess I'm wrong. Could someone tell me why stationarity is not critical for LLN? Thanks in advance!
