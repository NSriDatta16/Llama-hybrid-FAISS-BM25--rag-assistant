How to grab dynamic content on website and save it?

For example I need to grab from http://gmail.com/ the number of free storage: Over 2757.272164 megabytes (and counting) of free storage. And then store those numbers in a MySql database. The number, as you can see, is dynamically changing. Is there a way i can setup a server side script that will be grabbing that number, every time it changes, and saving it to database? Thanks.
