C++ Abstract class can't have a method with a parameter of that class

I created this .h file #pragma once namespace Core { class IComparableObject { public: virtual int CompareTo(IComparableObject obj)=0; }; } But compiler doesn't like IComparableObject obj param if the method is virtual pure, while virtual int CompareTo(IComparableObject obj) {} It's ok, however I want it as virtual pure. How can I manage to do it? Is it possible?
