Understanding this hypothesis testing exercise using P-value

The exercise states that: Your team evaluates a new cannon ball and compares its distance performance to a new ball from your competitor. In an initial evaluation you test 10 of your new cannon balls and 10 of the competitor’s balls with the goal of determining if the average distance in yards travelled by your new ball is greater than the average distance travelled by the competitor’s ball. The resulting data is shown below. You might assume equal variances when using a statistical test. Which one of the following statements is correct? The properly calculated P-value is in the range 0.15 None of the statistical hypothesis tests discussed are appropriate for the analysis of this data. The properly calculated P-value is in the range 0.075 A statistical hypothesis test cannot be applied in this case, because we have less than 12 data points for each type of ball.

My question is about what the right interpretation is for the alternative hypothesis. It could be u1-u2 ≠ 0 or u1-u2 If u1-u2 ≠ 0 then P value = 0.330 and the answer is option (1). If u1-u2
