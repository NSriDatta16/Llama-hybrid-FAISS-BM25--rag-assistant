Delphi typed constants in case statements

What is the most elegant (or least ugly) way of using typed constants in a case statement in Delphi? That is, assume for this question that you need to declare a typed constant as in const MY_CONST: cardinal = $12345678; ... Then the Delphi compiler will not accept case MyExpression of MY_CONST: { Do Something }; ... end; but you need to write case MyExpression of $12345678: { Do Something }; ... end; which is error-prone, hard to update, and not elegant. Is there any trick you can employ to make the compiler insert the value of the constant (preferably by checking the value of the constant under const in the source code, but maybe by looking-up the value at runtime)? We assume here that you will not alter the value of the "constant" at runtime.
