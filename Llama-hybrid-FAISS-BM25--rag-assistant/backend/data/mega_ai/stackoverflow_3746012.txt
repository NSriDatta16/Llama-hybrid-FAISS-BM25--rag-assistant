c++: How to transform a map iterator which point to pair into a "regular" pair pointer

those are the maps: multimap firstMap; multimap *> secondMap; template bool GarageDataBase ::Add(T data,SortKey key1, SearchKey key2) { multimap ::iterator it; it=(firstMap.insert(pair (key1,data))); pair *mizi=&*it; secondMap.insert(pair *>(key2,mizi)); return true; } I am trying to insert a pair into the firstMap and get a pointer to this pair and insert it into the "second" field in the secondMap so that i could go into my firstMap from the secondmap. pair *mizi=&*it; this doesn't compile saying : error C2440: 'initializing' : cannot convert from 'std::pair *' to 'std::pair *' any idea whats going on or maybe a better way to make it work?
