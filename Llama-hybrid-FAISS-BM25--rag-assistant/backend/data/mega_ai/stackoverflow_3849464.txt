HttpClient POST gets html page about 2.5x slower than browser

When I hit Search on London journey planner (e.g from Holborn to Savoy Pier), I get result in about 4 secs. When I do that with HttpClient using POST method, this line takes about 10 secs: InputStream is = httpClient.execute(httpPost).getEntity().getContent(); Any ideas what can be the problem? I'm sending the same parameters as browser and I have also set User-Agent to Chrome.
