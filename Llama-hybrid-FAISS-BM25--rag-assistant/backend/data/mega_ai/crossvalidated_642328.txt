If you mainly care about prediction, consider including all interactions and using regularized estimation (lasso, ridge, elastic net, SCAD, ...) or best subset selection. There are R packages such as rqPen and cqrReg that can do regularized estimation (even the quantreg package has lasso: rq.fit.lasso ); not sure about subset selection, though. You could also try a quantile neural network from qrnn , as per Dave's reference. If you really wish to stick to rq from quantreg , that leaves only best subset selection (from the suggestions above). If you want inference about some parameters, you probably have a sufficient sample size for splitting into training and test samples, training and selecting a model on the training sample and doing inference on the test sample. More specifically to your questions: If some interactions make zero sense, I would exclude them from the model. This is about getting the complexity of the model just right. Including all pairwise interactions yields 55 variables together with main effects, and that is probably fine with the sample size of yours. Including one more level of interactions is probably a bit too much. For the more extreme quantiles ( tau=0.1 or tau=0.9 ) the estimation precision will be lower, so simpler models could be better. At least I would not try a more flexible model for tau=0.1 or tau=0.9 than for tau=0.5 . I am not exactly sure how AIC.rq works and what model the AIC value corresponds to, so I am not sure whether you should use it. Alternatively, you may try cross validation where you would evaluate your model on the left-out folds. This might be computationally expensive, though.
