I would like to draw conclusions about whether Z is in fact a significant factor in the outcome variable via interactions b4 and b5, but I understand that in a logistic regression all coefficients and particularly interactions need to be evaluated in the context of specific values of the independent variable x. That is not quite correct, as long as you remain in the odds ratio metric the dependence on other variables is only limited to the variables with which Z is interacted in a similar way as in simple linear regression. The difference is that with odds ratios you need to think in multiplicative terms rather than additive additive terms, as the ratio part in odds ratio already suggests. The whole interpretation becomes problematic when you want to interpret the outcome in terms of marginal effects. For examples on how to deal with interactions in terms of odds ratios see here , and for an interpretation in terms of marginal effects see here .
