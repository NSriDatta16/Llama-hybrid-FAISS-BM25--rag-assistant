jQuery drag left/right

I've just created a custom carousel with images and have got previous/next arrows to move the images around. Does jQuery have an event where I can click on the photo, drag it to the left or right and fire the same action that I currently have on the arrows? My current code looks like this $carousel.animate({ left: '+=' + amountToAnimate }, 800, 'backEaseOut'); I also need to prevent Firefox from 'picking' the image up. I'm already using jQuery UI if that helps.
