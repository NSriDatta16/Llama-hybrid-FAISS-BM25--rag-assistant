find . -type f in ruby

I want to grab a list of all the files under a particular directory. Dir.glob works great, but there doesn't seem to be a way to limit results to just files (excluding directories). Heres's what I have right now: files = Dir.glob('my_dir/**/*').reject { |f| File.directory?(f) } Is there a more elegant way to accomplish this?
