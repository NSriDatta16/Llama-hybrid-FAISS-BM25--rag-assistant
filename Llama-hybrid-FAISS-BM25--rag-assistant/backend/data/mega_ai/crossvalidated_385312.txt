What is the precise definition of "performance" in machine learning?

In machine learning, people usually refer to the "performance of a model" or "performance of an optimizer". What is the exact definition of "performance"? What would be the "performance of an optimizer"? I know that there are ways of measuring how far away current predictions of machine learning models are from the expected ones: for example, you can measure the accuracy of a model, perplexity, etc. Is this what the performance of a ML model refers to? Is it a name to refer to any way of measuring the correctness of the predictions (or, in general, outputs) of the model? Or is performance actually the time it takes to perform the prediction? Or something else?
