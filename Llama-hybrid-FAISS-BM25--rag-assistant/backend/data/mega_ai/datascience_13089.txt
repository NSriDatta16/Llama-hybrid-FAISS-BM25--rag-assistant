String Values in a data frame in Pandas

Suppose I have a data frame like this : Hospital_name State Employees ...... Fortis Delhi 5000 ...... AIIMS Delhi 1000000 ...... SuperSpeciality Chennai 1000 ...... Now I want to use this data frame to build a machine learning model for predictive analysis. For that, I must convert the strings to float values. Also, some of these columns in Hospital_name and State contains 'NAN' values. In such a case, how should I prepare my data for building a model in Keras?
