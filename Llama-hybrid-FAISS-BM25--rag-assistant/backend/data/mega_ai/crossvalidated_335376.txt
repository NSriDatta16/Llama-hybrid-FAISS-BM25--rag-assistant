binary logistic regression with large sample size

I try to make a binary logistic regression model from 85871 samples. I used enter method. There are seven explanatory variables and all of them have significant in Wald Test. But, in Hosmer Lemeshow Test also significant, so my model doesn't fit the data right? What can I do in order to make my model fit? Is there another goodness of fit test?
