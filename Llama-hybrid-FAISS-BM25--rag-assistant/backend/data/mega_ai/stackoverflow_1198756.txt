Issue FORM POST Request From PHP using HTTP Basic Authentication

I hope this is a relatively straight forward thing to do, and that my google skills have simply failed me on this occasion. I have a BASIC authentication protected resource which I want to have PHP perform a POST HTTP request against. I have tried injecting Authentication: Basic (encrypted u/p data) into the headers which didn't appear to work - so I wonder, can the powers of Greyskull i mean StackOverflow provide any guidance. $req .= "&cmd=_initiate_query"; $header = "POST /someendpoint HTTP/1.1\r\n". "Host:example.com\n". "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\r\n". "User-Agent: PHP-Code\r\n". "Content-Length: " . strlen($req) . "\r\n". "Connection: close\r\n\r\n"; $fp = fsockopen ('ssl://example.com', 443, $errno, $errstr, 30); if (!$fp) { // HTTP ERROR } else { fputs ($fp, $header . $req); while (!feof($fp)) { $result .= fgets ($fp, 128); } fclose ($fp); }
