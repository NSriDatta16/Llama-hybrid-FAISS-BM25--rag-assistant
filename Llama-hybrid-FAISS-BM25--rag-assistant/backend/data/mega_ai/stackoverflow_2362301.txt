Can someone tell me where I can get source code to create a simple question answer forum by using ASP.Net (Visual Studio 2005) ? As per the requirement I need to get a prototype for this type of question answer forum which can be used along with a Reporting application. I can use Visual studio 2005/2008. Infact, I may be given the liberty to use silverlight 3.
