First is your features, while I'm no expert in your field, I would say that only having 4 features is unlikely to produce good results. In a case where 4 features could sufficiently explain your problem, I would say that machine learning isn't even an appropriate approach since you could easily spend time manually analyzing each variable to identify how each of those variables affect the outcome (and if it's known these 4 variables are sufficient to explain the problem, would it even be an interesting result that your model can accurately predict the outcome?) Your dataset is extremely inbalanced/noisy. While supervised learning is very effective at identifying patterns in data, noteably it's not effective at identifying black swan events. If in your dataset the number of failed landings is extremely sparse e.g. You've already oversampled your dataset and the class weight you've set seems very extreme You haven't included the training/validation/test losses/performance so it's hard to say if your model is overfitting or any other possible issues AUC is computed using the probability output since it computes the FPR, TPR at various decision thresholds Overall I would really suggest you take a step back and really think about what kind of questions you're trying to answer rather than focusing on this one approach. By understanding the fundamental goals that your project is trying to achieve you can identify the most appropriate approach and produce useful results rather than throwing a black box at it.
