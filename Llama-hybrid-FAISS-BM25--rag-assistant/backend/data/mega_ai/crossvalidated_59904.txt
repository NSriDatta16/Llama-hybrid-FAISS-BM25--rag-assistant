I'm not sure your objective is achievable. But here is an idea. Can you construct a Bayesian model where the posterior for each $\mu_i$ has a known distribution? For example, suppose you can do this with normal distributions. If so, then you can easily find the probability that $\mu_i$ is in a given bin. Suppose you do this for each player for each bin, adding their partial contributions (probabilities) into the bins until you have exhausted your data. Then divide each bin total by the number of players in your data. This is your estimate of the histogram of the $\mu_i$'s. Question 2. This sounds like a standard CDF estimation problem. Check out the Dvoretzky-Kiefer-Wolfowitz inequality.
