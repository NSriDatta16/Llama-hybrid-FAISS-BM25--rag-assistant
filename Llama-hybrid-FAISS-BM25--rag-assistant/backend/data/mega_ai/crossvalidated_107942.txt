Perhaps you can jigger with your data structure a little bit like this: You say that each assay is produced twice on each tissue type. If both samples receive precisely the same assay, then it should not matter to you to arbitrarily call, say, one assay on the tissue "group A" and the other assay on the same tissue "group B". So, if you code your outcome/success=1, and no outcome/failure = 0, your data could be thought of as looking like: Tissue Outcome A Outcome B 1 0 0 2 1 1 3 1 1 . . . . . . . . . 49 0 1 50 0 0 These look like paired data (because one observation of success/no success in a tissue is paired with a second observation of success/no success in the same tissue type ), and when someone says "I wanna examine the correlation between paired data with binomial outcomes" I head straight over to McNemar's test . This require rejiggering your data, because what you are analyzing are pairs , and there are four kinds of pairs, and you wanna set up the counts of each ( totally made up numbers, yo): Group A Group B Kind of Pair Count of Pairs no success no success concordant 15 success no success discordant 11 no success success discordant 19 success success concordant 5 McNemar's test is a $\chi^{2}$ equivalent to the sign test. The test statistic only examines discordant pairs . Let's call the count of Group A successful, but Group B not successful $r$, and then let's call the count of Group A not successful, but Group B successful $s$ (which discordant pair you call which is arbitrary). The test statistic (which is including a Yates continuity correction in that "$-1$" business) is: $$\chi^{2}_{\text{df=1}} = \frac{\left(\left|r-s\right|-1\right)^{2}}{r+s}$$ $$\chi^{2}_{\text{df=1}} = \frac{\left(\left|11-19\right|-1\right)^{2}}{11+19} = \frac{49}{30} = 1.6\bar{3}$$ These made up data give a $p$-value of about 0.20, so unless you are being outrageously libertine with your Type I error preferences, you would not reject the null hypothesis. As it so happens, the null hypothesis you are testing is that there is no association between group membership and probability of success. R can perform McNemar's test using the, ahem, mcnemar.test() function
