Is this a zoom bug in UIScrollView?

In a class that conforms to UIApplicationDelegate and UIScrollViewDelegate I did the following in : - (void)applicationDidFinishLaunching:(UIApplication *)application { // Created an instance of UIScrollView to house a horizontal strip - along the x-axis - of kNumberOfPages UIViews: scrollView = [[UIScrollView alloc] initWithFrame:[UIScreen mainScreen].applicationFrame]; // Make self the delegate scrollView.delegate = self; // Set content size to the cumulative width of all UIViews contained scrollView.contentSize = CGSizeMake(scrollView.frame.size.width * kNumberOfPages, scrollView.frame.size.height); // Zoom range is from a min of the width of the scrollView to a max of 2 * scrollView.contentSize scrollView.minimumZoomScale = scrollView.frame.size.width / scrollView.contentSize.width; scrollView.maximumZoomScale = 2 * scrollView.contentSize; // A subclass of UIView will be the container for the horizontal strip of UIViews containerView = [[ConstrainedView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, 0, scrollView.contentSize.width, scrollView.contentSize.height)]; // The only difference betrween ConstrainedView and UIView is this overloaded method that constrains zooming to only the x-axis - (void)setTransform:(CGAffineTransform)newValue { // Scale along the y-axis only CGAffineTransform constrainedTransform = CGAffineTransformScale(CGAffineTransformIdentity, newValue.a, 1.0); [super setTransform:constrainedTransform]; } // Fill the container view with UIViews as subviews CGFloat horizontalOffsetX = 0.0; for (int i = 1; i Looks pretty tame, right? Here's the weirdness. Zooming in - magnifying - works fine. However, as I zoom in there is increasing resistance, jitter, and increased slowness as if I'm dragging through hardening molasses as I attempt to approach fully zoomed out. It is almost impossible to squash the N UIViews so that they all appear within the bounds of the UIScrollView frames. Very weird. Can someone please explain what is going on and if this is in fact a bug? Cheers, Doug
