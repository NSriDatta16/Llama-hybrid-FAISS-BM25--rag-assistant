Getting "Unknown iOS Detected" everytime in Xcode Organizer when I connect my device iOS 4.2.1

I get the same screen everytime I connect my device to the Mac. This thing started happening after I installed iOS 4.2.1 on my iPhone. It takes several minutes each time to recognize the device when I connect it to Mac. What can be a permanent fix? EDIT: My iOS SDK version is 4.2.1 and My Xcode version is is 3.2.5.
