Is my dataset unbalanced?

So I'm trying to implement Nvidia's end to end driving paper to simply have an agent in Carla follow the lanes. I'm trying to predict the steering angle of the car based on the RGB images from the front camera. I'm getting and r_score of about 1.20 % Every image in the dataset has a steering angle . So here are plots for the distribution of steering angles . I've also augmented the images but when I run it, the car still fails to follow the lane. I'm being wrong or should I take another approach? Thanks :)!
