Access SQLite from different processes

I'm developing an application that uses SQLite as the primary data storage method. I have two processes running for my app using an alternate entry point. I need to access the same DB from the two different processes but as we all now SQLite is not like a server DB engine, it can only be accessed once at a time. I wanted to know if there is a way to kind of "lock" the DB when it's being accessed by other process so that if the second process tries to acces the DB at the same time, it would wait until the first process finishes and then try to access it again. How can this issue be treated?
