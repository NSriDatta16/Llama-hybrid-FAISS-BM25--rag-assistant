I was once maintaining the operating system code we customized for a Harris minicomputer (yes, this was a long time ago). Going through the scheduler code (assembler) one day, I came across a code block that had the comment "Begin Magic" at the top and about 25 lines later the comment "End Magic." The code in-between was some of the tightest, most complicated, elegant code I've ever seen. It took 4 of us to figure out what that little section of code was actually doing (VM switching).
