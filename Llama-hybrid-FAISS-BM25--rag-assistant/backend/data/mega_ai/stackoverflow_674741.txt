From the declaration you posted, your C# code will look something like this: [DllImport("mydll.dll")] static extern int Calculate(ref MathInputStructType input, ref MathOutputStructType output, ref IntPtr formulaStorage); Depending on the structure of MathInputStructType and MathOutputStructType in C++, you are going to have to attribute those structure declarations as well so that they marshal correctly.
