Unsynchronized time series visualization

I would like to visualize a large amount of events composed of time serie windows. A typical event would be: Problem is, my events are not synchronized, and so if I plot them all, it would look like: Question Is there any way to visualize all my events so I can see their original/"typical" shape (preferably in the time domain) despite their unsynchronization ? What I have tried so far: Visualize features : approach is good but I have to guess what I am looking for. Synchronized events : in the example above it might be possible, but for some other cases it won't be. (such as multiple peaks spaced with different time lapses) Use statistical values to visualize : that was my first shot, to plot not all events but only their mean , median , p95 ,... Problem is, using this approach gives a deformed rendering of the data because of the unsynchronization: What I have thought about The main problem of applying the mean , p95 or whatever statistical function is that it is applied along an axis that is not synchronized between events. I don't know if it exists or if it is even feasible, but I was thinking about an approach that would display those statistical values checking their temporal neighbors ? I know Dynamic Time Warping deals with this unsynchronization but I am not sure if and how I could use it to plot my events in the way I'd like. An idea of a possible output could be (any other output idea is welcomed!): Any help, idea, would be greatly appreciated ! Thanks
