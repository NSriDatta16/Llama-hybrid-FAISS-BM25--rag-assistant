Nested cross-validation for regression over small dataset

I'm trying to do nested cross-validation for regression model parameter selection and prediction evaluation. I'm using temporal data (series of count). The problem is that I don't have a lot of data for training and test so I'm to follow this process: Split the data into two folds (80% - 20%) Use standard GridSearchCV for parameter selection over the first fold Evaluate the model with the best parameter by TimeSeriesSplit cross-validation. Here, I will use the whole dataset but I will define a new TimeSplit function to work like this: only the second fold will be divided into N subfolds and for each iteration i, the model learns on the first fold dataset (80%) + i subfolds of the second fold and test on the next subfold. Did I perform the nested cross-validation properly so that my evaluation results are unbiased? One other question, is it required to use TimeSeriesSplit cross-validation when using regression model over time series data? Any help is appreciated
