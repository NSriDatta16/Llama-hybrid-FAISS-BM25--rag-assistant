What are the appropriate Statistical tests when dealing with two or more categorical outcome variables in a model

I'm familiar with GLM techniques when dealing with continuous outcomes and categorical or continuous predictors. I've used Logistic regression with a single dichotomous categorical outcome variable and continuous predictor variables. I thought today, what about if I have two or more categorical outcome variables? What type of analyses are available to me? For example If I have data for School Grade [A, B, C, D, F], HS Drop Out[yes,no] Unemployed [yes,no], and I want to predict these three outcomes with Kindergarten Reading Ach. [0-100], Kindergarten Math Ach. [0-100], and Family SES [0-100]. Ignoring the validity of my model. How would I analyze those three categorical outcomes variables with my three continuous predictor variables?
