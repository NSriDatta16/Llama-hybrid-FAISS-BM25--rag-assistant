What is a good Manual/Guide class in LaTeX?

I am writing a manual/guide for our intranet using LaTeX. I am wondering if there are classes developed for this purpose? A search returns results that are manuals about using LaTeX. Spefically I want to make use of "hint" boxes and the like (Floating boxes in a guide that have a short hint or some such thing). I find the way these stand out from the rest of the text really draws in the readers attention. Perhaps there is a better -- read less complex -- way of going about this using the standard book or article class?
