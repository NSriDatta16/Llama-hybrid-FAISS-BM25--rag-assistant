Heuristics to discover spammers/bots (In forums, blogs etc)

The ways I can think of are: Measure the time between actions. Compare the posts' content (if they're too similar to each other) or, better yet, only the posted links. Checking the distribution over a period of time the user is active (if the user is active, say posting once every hour, for a week, then either we have a superman or a bot here). Some special activity expected: like in stackoverflow, I would expect users to press their user name link (top middle) to see their new answers, comments, questions etc. (added by chakrit) Number of links in a post. Not heuristic. Use some async JS for user login. (Just makes life a bit harder on the bot programmer). (added by Alekc) Not heuristic. User-agent values. And, How could I forget Google's approach (mentioned down by Will Hartung). Give users the ability to mark someone as Spam, enough Spam votes means this is a Spam user. (calculating what is enough users, is the work here). Any more ideas?
