When describing the Gelman-Rubin statistic (R hat) in Bayesian Data Analysis ( 3rd Ed, ch. 11.4, pp. 283-285 ), Gelman and his coauthors say that the multiple chains used in calculating R hat should be simulated with overdispersed starting points and further that each chain should be split at the middle into two parts . For example, even if only two chains are simulated, the diagnostic would be computed across the four half chains. If you make either of these changes (diffuse starting points and chain splitting) to your diagnostic procedure, I think you will find the Gelman-Rubin statistic would identify that your chains have failed to converge.
