Is standardization needed before using scikit-learn SVM?

I am using the SVM function provided by scikit-learn . I would like to know whether I need to perform standardization before fitting the model. As I know, LibSVM tends to require pre-processing the data. I am not sure whether scikit-learn automatically normalizes the data instead of expecting us to handle it ourselves.
