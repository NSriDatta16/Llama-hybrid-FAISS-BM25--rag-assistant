Disclaimer: I come from a 4 year degree and a year's worth of professional Java experience. The first two questions are quite straightforward and if a candidate doesn't see a better approach I would suspect it's because they haven't been paying attention in class ;-) Most of the answers to the second question presented so far alter the functions behaviour. The function could very well be evaluated twice in the original code, although I can't say if that is the intent of the function. Side effects are important. I would probably one-line the first function, myself. The questions are fairly language agnostic, but they're not library agnostic, which I would argue is equally as important. If you're specifically looking for .NET knowledge, well and good, but without Google I couldn't tell you what an ESLinq.DataContext is, and my answer to the third question suffers accordingly. As it is, it's nearly incomprehensible to me. I think you also have to be careful how you present the questions. There's nothing incorrect about the first two methods, per se. They're just a little more verbose than they should be. I would just present them with the sheet and say, "What do you think of this code?" Make it open ended, that way if they want to bring up error-handling/logging/commenting or other things, it doesn't limit the discussion.
