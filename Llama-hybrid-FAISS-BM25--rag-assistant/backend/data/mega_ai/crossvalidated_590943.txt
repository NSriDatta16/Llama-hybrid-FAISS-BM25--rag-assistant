NLP as a Poisson Regression Problem?

Suppose I encode the sequence to sequence dataset as a vector of integer $\{0,1\cdots N\}$ where $N$ is the maximun number of unique words in the dataset. For example, I am planning to build a chatbot with inputs maximum of 8 words: Q:Where can I buy these apples ? $$ [8,19,23,5,76,10,2,0] $$ A:At the market downtown $$ [44,7,12,90,0,0,0,0] $$ Can I use multivariate Poisson Regression to fit the data such that when I inputted an unseen sentence New Input: Where to buy apples ? $$ [8,65,32,10,2,0,0,0] $$ Output: At the market downtown $$ [44,7,12,90,0,0,0,0] $$ Is there any violations in the conditions for using the MVP regression?
