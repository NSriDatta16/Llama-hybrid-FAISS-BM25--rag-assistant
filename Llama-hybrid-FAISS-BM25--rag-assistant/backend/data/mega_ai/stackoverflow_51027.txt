Database system that is not relational

What are the other types of database systems out there. I've recently came across couchDB that handles data in a non relational way. It got me thinking about what other models are other people is using. So, I want to know what other types of data model is out there. (I'm not looking for any specifics, just want to look at how other people are handling data storage, my interest are purely academic) The ones I already know are: RDBMS (mysql,postgres etc..) Document based approach (couchDB, lotus notes) Key/value pair (BerkeleyDB)
