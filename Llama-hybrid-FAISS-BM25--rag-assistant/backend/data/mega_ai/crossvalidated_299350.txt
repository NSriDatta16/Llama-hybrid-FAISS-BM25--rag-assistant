Three comments that go a little beyond helpful answers to date. Although this question is posed with a particular dataset, more general issues are clearly worth discussion. 1. Obvious but important: the dataset is too small to be confident what is best to do. Easy to say, but getting more data if you can is the best thing you can do here. 2. Should you exclude the outlier? Excluding the outlier and not telling anyone would be poorest practice. Excluding the outlier as anomalous or awkward is treated by others as a defensible practice. I would urge rather two regressions reported concisely, that with and that without the outlier. Sometimes the outlier makes less difference than you fear; sometimes it becomes clear that quite different models ensue. If you make a judgement that one model is better, you're still allowing readers to think about other analyses. (Often readers care little about your particular data, for example, but are gathering ideas on what analyses make sense for their similar data.) In your case, you did precisely that. And we find that the slope appears to be about zero in both cases, so the inference is similar, that there is no linear relationship worth scientific attention. Making your data public if possible also encourages alternative analyses, just as you are doing here. 3. Why not transform the predictor? An option that can make sense is to transform the predictor, which will dampen the effects of any outlier(s). Here as all values are positive logarithms are in order mathematically. Your own stance of including the observation with the highest value is equivalent to admitting that values could be much (even an order of magnitude?) larger, so what would happen then? Whenever that is the attitude, log scale is defensible. Naturally, there is always a scientific or practical question of whether $y$ as a function of log $x$ makes sense otherwise, given known limiting behaviour (what happens at very small or very large values). Here as the variables are completely anonymous, no advice can be given on that, but your own subject-matter expertise should come into play.
