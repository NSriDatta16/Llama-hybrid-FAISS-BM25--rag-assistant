Btw, this should be done something like this: $avg_query = "SELECT AVG(id) as average_id FROM unfollowr_users"; $avg_result = mysql_query($avg_query) or die("Couldn't execute query."); $row = mysql_fetch_assoc($avg_result); $average = $row['average_id']; echo "$average\n"; AVG is not an PHP function it's SQL function. We just add better name when we SELECT.
