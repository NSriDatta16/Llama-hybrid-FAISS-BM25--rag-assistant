Would a simple Gibbs, or a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm work for a State-Space model?

I'm wondering if a MCMC algorithm, in a Gibbs or a Metropolis-Hastings style, work for a State-Space model. Would I also be able to learn about the state variable and not just the parameters? I've found people using STAN for this type of latent models, but I've also read some short excerpts of text saying that we should use Particle MCMC, but without any explanation why... In which cases am I pushed to use the pMCMC? Any help would be appreciated.
