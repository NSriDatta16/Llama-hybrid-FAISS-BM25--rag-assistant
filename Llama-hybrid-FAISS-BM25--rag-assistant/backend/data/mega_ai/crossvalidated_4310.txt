Binary or Multinomial: Perhaps the following rules will simplify the choice: If you have only two levels to your dependent variable then you use binary logistic regression. If you have three or more unordered levels to your dependent variable, then you'd look at multinomial logistic regression. A few points: Satisfaction with sexual needs ranges from 4 to 16 (i.e., 13 distinct values). Such a variable is typically treated as a metric predictor (i.e., in the covariate box in SPSS). Possibly your dependent variable is causing some confusion because as you phrase it, it is not a standard dichotomy. It sounds like a frequency item that could range from never, to occasionally, to sometimes, to often, to always, etc. However, I'm guessing that either you have explicitly collapsed categories or you have required the respondent to implicitly collapse the categories down to a binary choice. As a side note, if you did have an ordered set of frequency categories, then you might want to use a model that incorporated that order. SPSS: I posted some links to tutorials in SPSS and R for conducting binary logistic regression.
