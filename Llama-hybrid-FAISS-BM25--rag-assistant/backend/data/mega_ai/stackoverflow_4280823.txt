Couldn't tell you what the solution is (some sort of least cost path analysis, at a guess), but I have some experience with road modelling software. At one end of the scale you have strategic modelling systems that use a similar (broadly speaking) approach. They can be thought of like a gravity model - it will use estimates of traffic generation and demand to make high level predictions of traffic flows between, for example, towns and cities, or industrial areas to residential, etc. This is mostly useful for looking at the macro effects of major planned developments, changes in population distribution or land-use zones.. that sort of thing. At the other end you have simulation models of specific areas of a city, town, interchange, etc. These are numeric models that treat each car as an autonomous agent with factors like aggression, road knowledge, and so on. This is very much a brute force style approach, but it is the only way to provide useful statistics on actual traffic behaviour in a complex network with features like traffic lights, buses, etc. A traffic modeller can, for example, plug it into the actual traffic control data, run the model for a specific period for a specific design solutions and set it to run 6 or 7 times. The resulting data gives you a very good assessment of the performance of a particular solution against another (or the status quo). Hope this provides some useful context.
