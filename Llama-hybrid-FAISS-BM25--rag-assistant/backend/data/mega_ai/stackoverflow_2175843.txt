Limit size of cache directory

I have some questions about the cache directory in android. Does anyone knows the limit for each app's cache directory? Also what will happen if there is not enough disk space to cache data? All I know is when the device runs low on storage, the files here (cache directory)will be the ones that get deleted first and each app has its own cache directory. Now, are the files of other app's cache directory will be cleared to accommodate my app's request to add files in the cache dir when there is not enough storage?
