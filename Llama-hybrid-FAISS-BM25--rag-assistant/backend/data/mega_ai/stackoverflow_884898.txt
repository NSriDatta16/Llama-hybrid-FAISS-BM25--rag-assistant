Linq insert on primary key field that is autosync

I more or less want to do what this question suggests. How do I MANUALLY set an Identity field in LINQ-To-SQL (IDENTITY INSERT) However, I want to explain. I have a client db. I load Linq objects from here and the send them across WCF. On the other side, I attach them to a data context and post them to the table. The issue is, they will have their Guid column set. This column is marked as AutoSync in the DBML. So in the case of an insert, Linq forces me to use the new value. I would like it to keep my value when I need it to. Update 1 Basically I want to flip the AutoSync and IsDbGenerated setting on the fly programatically. [Column(Storage="_cName", AutoSync=AutoSync.OnInsert, DbType="UniqueIdentifier NOT NULL", IsPrimaryKey=true, IsDbGenerated=true)]
