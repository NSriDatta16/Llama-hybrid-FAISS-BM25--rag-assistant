A few points This sounds like a survival analysis / event history analysis model (e.g. discrete time survival analysis, Cox proportional hazards model, etc.) because you are measuring time to event (time to working on first project). Such models are described as explaining the probability of whether and when an event will occur. It also sounds like it is a mixed model because of the colleges. These two points are quite compatible, as the hierarchical data format required for event history analysis is more or less precisely what is needed for mixed models as well. My suggestion would be to nest individual employees within colleges, so you might have (in the discrete time case) a college-person-period data format like this: College PersonID Period FirstProj Covariates 1 1 1 0 1 1 2 0 1 1 3 1 1 2 1 0 1 2 2 1 2 3 1 0 2 3 2 0 2 3 3 0 2 3 4 0 2 3 5 0 2 3 3 1 The first three variables are identifiers of the factor/unit at-that-level defining the data hierarchy. Notice that these variables are sorted which is necessary to do explicitly in many statistical software packages for these kinds of analyses. Note also the the variable Period is not calendar time, but time that the subject was observed so the beginning of study time (perhaps in work days, or in weeks, depending on your needs) corresponds to the value 1 for every subject, even though they were began training/were first observed on different calendar dates. The College-level residuals will tell you which colleges are at either extreme. Such models will also permit college, individual, and period-level (time-varying) predictors.
