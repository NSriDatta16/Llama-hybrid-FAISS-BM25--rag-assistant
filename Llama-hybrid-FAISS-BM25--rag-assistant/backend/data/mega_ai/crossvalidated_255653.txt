Is it possible to use PCA scores and some additional individual variables for cluster analysis?

I am trying to conduct the k-means cluster analysis. Because some variables are highly related, I conducted PCA to reduce variables. But some variable shows low communalities and the KMO is lower than 0.5. I would like to conduct PCA only with highly related variables, and conduct cluster analysis using both, (a subset of) PCA scores and the remaining variables. For example, 3 PCA scores (from 10 variables) + 5 individual variables. Is it possible? If it is possible, can you give me some examples?
