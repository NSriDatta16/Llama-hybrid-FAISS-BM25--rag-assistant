The phrase "Kleene star" is a tipoff that someone is talking about regular languages in the theoretical CS sense, i.e. , those that can be recognized by deterministic finite automata . Did the same developer also come up with a question involving the pumping lemma ? Help us answer your question by providing more context. Based on your comment, I assume thorough understanding of regular expressions is not critical in your organization, so is this a straightforward test of knowledge? Are you trying to gauge the candidate's ability to gather information and reason abstractly? Willingness to step outside the box and answer None Of The Above? Did you solicit these interview questions? If so, did you provide guidelines, or was it an "I need 3 potential interview questions from everyone by COB today, and and please submit along with a TPS-report coversheet!" assignment?
