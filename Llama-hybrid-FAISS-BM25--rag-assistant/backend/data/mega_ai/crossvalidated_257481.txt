If by "r" you mean what I would call the "regular" correlation, that is normalized covariance, then for linear regression: $\hat {\beta} = {\rm cor}(Y_i, X_i) \cdot \frac{ {\rm SD}(Y_i) }{ {\rm SD}(X_i) }$ So you could say that it's already accounted for in the parameter estimate. The p-value is the only thing you should pay attention to when it comes to hypothesis testing, at least if you accept that the conditions under which it is valid are met. If there is a very strong correlation and the hypothesis is rejected you should consider getting more data, or getting a less noisy sampling if possible.
