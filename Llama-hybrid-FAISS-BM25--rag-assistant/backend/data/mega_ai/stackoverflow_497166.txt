How can I get the base class Linq result to cast up to the inherited Employee class It's not an upcast, it's a downcast. I think you don't understand casting or possibly - instance type vs reference type. public class Animal { } public class Zebra : Animal { } public class Zoo { public void ShowZebraCast() { Animal a = new Animal(); Zebra z = (Zebra)a; } } System.InvalidCastException: Unable to cast object of type 'Animal' to type 'Zebra'. In the same way, you have an instance of Entity that you can't downcast to use an Employee reference against it. You could convert the types, but then you have to supply a conversion method. public partial class Animal { } public class Zebra : Animal { } //in another file public partial class Animal{ public Zebra ToZebra(){ return new Zebra() { //set Zebra properties here. }; } } public class Zoo { public void ShowZebraConvert() { Animal a = new Animal(); Zebra z = a.ToZebra(); } }
