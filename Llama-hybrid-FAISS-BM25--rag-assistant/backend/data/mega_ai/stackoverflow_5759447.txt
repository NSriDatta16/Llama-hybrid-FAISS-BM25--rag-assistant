Attaching callback to popup window in IE 9

I'm creating a popup window and attaching a callback function to it. There is a button in the popup's page which calls this callback when clicked. This works in Firefox 4 and Chrome 10, but not IE 9. The "myPopupCallback" property that I add to the window is found and executed by Firefox and Chrome. In IE, it is undefined. Is there something about IE that causes problems with attaching data or functions to a window? Main window code var popup = window.open(url, '', 'status=0,menubar=0,toolbar=0,resizable=1,scrollbars=1'); $(popup.document).ready(function() { popup.myPopupCallback = function(rows) { // ...do stuff with rows... }; }); Popup window code $('#btn-ok').click( function() { var rows = $('#rows'); // IE 9 throws an error on the next line because window.myPopupCallback is undefined window.myPopupCallback(rows); });
