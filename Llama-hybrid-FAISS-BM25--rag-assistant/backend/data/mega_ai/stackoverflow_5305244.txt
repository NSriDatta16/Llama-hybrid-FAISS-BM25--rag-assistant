C# application for Multiple user Login on same Site

Is this possible to make an application that allows us to make an application that has 4 web browser controls and we can independently use each browser control for different Login on same website. Lets say i have one web browser dealing with hotmail with Office Email where as Second web browser control dealing with hotmail with Personal Email Currently i have searched that web browser cannot have different PROXIES or USER-Agent Strings. Any Solutions?
