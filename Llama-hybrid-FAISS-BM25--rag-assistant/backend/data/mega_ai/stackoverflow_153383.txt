I make unit test to reach the maximum feasible coverage. If I cannot reach some code, I refactor until the coverage is as full as possible After finished to blinding writing test, I usually write one test case reproducing each bug I'm used to separate between code testing and integration testing. During integration testing, (which are also unit test but on groups of components, so not exactly what for unit test are for) I'll test for the requirements to be implemented correctly.
