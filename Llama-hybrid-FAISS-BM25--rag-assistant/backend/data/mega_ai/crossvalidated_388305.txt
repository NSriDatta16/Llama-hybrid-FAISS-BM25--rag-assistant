How do I check my logistic regression for linearity?

My understanding is that logistic regression assumes a linear relationship between the logit of the outcome and each predictor variable. I'm working on a case study from this MIT course . My model is making really poor predictions and I suspect it is because non-linearity. idx .5] This is the confusion matrix > table(glm.pred1,test$Florence) glm.pred1 0 1 0 787 73 1 0 1 How can I confirm that assumption? What I've tried: I plotted the predictions against the log-transformed probabilities that came out of my model. I was told that doesn't work for poorly performing classifiers. Here is a post with info .
