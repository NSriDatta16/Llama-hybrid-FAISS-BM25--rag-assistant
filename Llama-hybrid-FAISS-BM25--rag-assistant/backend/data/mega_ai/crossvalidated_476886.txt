Although every logistic regression model might have a corresponding log-linear model (Poisson regression with categorical variables), the converse doesn't necessarily hold. Your models involves 4 variables, with v having 2 levels. Work backwards from the logistic regression model. According to the page you link (where $N$ = 4 in this case, counting all variables in the log-linear model): The general rule is the model should contain the $N-1$ and lower order interactions between the independent variables, and for every term in the logistic model formula, an interaction between in and the dependent variable. If Y is the dependent variable, and A, B and C are independent, with an interaction B:C the loglinear model will have the following design: Y + A + B + C + A:B + A:C + B:C + A:B:C This is exactly the situation in your logistic regression, with Y corresponding to your v, the B:C interaction corresponding to your x:y interaction, and A corresponding to your z. So the log-linear model corresponding to your logistic regression model is: n ~ v + x + y + z + x:z + x:y + y:z + x:y:z + v:z + v:x + v:y + v:x:y, family = poisson(link = log) Your log-linear model, when expanded to this form, lacks the x:z and v:y two-way interactions and both 3-way interactions, x:y:z and v:x:y. Note the requirement for constructing the log-linear equivalent to a logistic regression: "the model should contain the $N-1$ and lower order interactions between the independent variables," where $N-1$ is actually the number of independent variables in the logistic regression. Thus a log-linear model equivalent to a logistic regression model will include all interactions among the independent variables of the logistic regression. If a log-linear model doesn't include all of those interactions, I don't know that you can construct an equivalent logistic regression.
