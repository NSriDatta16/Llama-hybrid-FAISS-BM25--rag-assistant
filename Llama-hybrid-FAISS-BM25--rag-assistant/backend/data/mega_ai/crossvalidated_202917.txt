Why is computing the Bayesian Evidence difficult?

In Bayesian estimation, we need to compute the normalizing factor P(X) . Say that our parameter space was y. Then in order to compute the Bayesian evidence we'd need to marginalize the evidence over all the possible parameters in our parameter space: I don't understand why that is so difficult to compute. Is that not a straightforward application of the total law of probability?
