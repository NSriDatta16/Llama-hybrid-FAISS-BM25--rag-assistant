Problem resolving dependencies because of [organisation]

In my ivysettings.xml, I have a url resolver with the following artifact resolver: Any organisation that has a "." in its name fails to resolve (such as org.apache.struts#struts-core;1.3.5). I've come to the conclusion that the reason for the failure is that instead of going to http://my-repo-server/my-repo/org/apache/struts/struts-core/1.3.5/struts-core-1.3.5.jar it goes to http://my-repo-server/my-repo/org.apache.struts/struts-core/1.3.5/struts-core-1.3.5.jar (Notice the "." instead of the "/" in the above urls) Am I using the wrong type of resolver? Is my pattern wrong? How do I resolve an artifact with "." in the organization name?
