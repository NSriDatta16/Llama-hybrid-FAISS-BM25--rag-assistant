Both FindBugs and Cobertura do NOT work on the source level, but on the bytecode level. So, you should wave in your aspects statically (that would also improve application start time) at the compile time (e.g. using maven's AspectJ plugin) and not at the load time and then run static analysis tools on the result bytecode.
