how I can use the data coming from Traceview (ie: CPU time in ms spent on each frame of the game) to determine battery usage (if this is at all possible) In theory it would be possible to extrapolate the battery usage for your app by looking at the power consumption on a frame by frame basis. The best way to accomplish this would be to evaluate the power consumption of the CPU (only) for a given period (say two seconds) while your app is running the most CPU intensive operation, (additionally, GPU power usage could be gleaned this way also) while recording TraceView data (such as frames per second or flops per second) giving you the the traffic across the CPU/GPU for a given millisecond. Using this data you could accurately calculate the average peak power consumption for your app by running the above test a few times. Here is why I say it is theory only: There are many variables to consider: The number and nature of other processes running at the time of the above test (processor intensive) Method of evaluating the power draw across the CPU/GPU (while tools such as PowerTutor are effective for evaluating power consumption, in this case the evaluation would not be as effective because of the need to collect time stamped power usage data. Additionally, just about any method of collecting power data would introduce an additional overhead ( Schr√∂dinger's cat ) but that strictly depends on the level of accuracy you require/desire.) The reason for the power consumption information - If you are looking to define the power consumption of your app for testing or BETA testing/evaluation purposes then it is a feasible task with some determination and the proper tools. If you are looking to gain usable information about power consumption "in the wild", on user's devices, then I would say it is plausible but not realistic. The vairables involved would make even the most determined and dedicated researcher faint. You would have to test on every possible combination of device/Android version in the wild. Additionally, the combinations of running processes/threads and installed apps is likely incalculable. I hope this provides some insight to your question, although I may have gone deeper into it than needed. -Steve
