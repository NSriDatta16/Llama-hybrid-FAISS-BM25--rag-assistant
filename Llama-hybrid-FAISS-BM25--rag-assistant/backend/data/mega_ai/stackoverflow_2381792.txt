URL getting truncated at 255 characters

I have a JavaScript widget which communicates with my Rails app by creating tags in the DOM. Every once in a while, I see a malformed request in my server logs, where the URL is truncated at 255 characters: http://myapplication.example/mycontroller/1/myaction?hostname=www.mycustomer.example&request[param_a]=3&request[param_b]=1&request[param_c]=0&request[param_d]=0&request[param_e]=3&request[param_f]=1&request[param_g]=4&request[param_h]=0&request[param_i]=5&request From Google and Stackoverflow ( What is the maximum length of a URL in different browsers? ), it looks like 255 characters is not a valid limit on URLs. Here's what I know: This is a sporadic problem, it does not happen on ALL requests URL is truncated at 255 characters when this happens When this error happens, the user-agent is not recorded in the backtrace Here's what I do NOT know: What types of browsers does this error occur on? Perhaps some mobile browser... What's the best way to root cause this problem?
