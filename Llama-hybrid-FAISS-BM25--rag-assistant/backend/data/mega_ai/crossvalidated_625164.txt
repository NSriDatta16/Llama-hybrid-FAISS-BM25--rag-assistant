Hessian is numerically singular with a categorical predictor but not with a continuous one

Let's say I have a mouse performed a task for several runs, and for each run I assigned a score (ordered). I'm interested in the effects of medication (A, B) across runs. dat.ord If I treat run as continuous variable, there is no warning: fm I thought ordinal regression was simply an extension of logistic regression, so I was expecting a similar warning if I ran a logistic regression: dat.log But there is no warning. Why am I getting the warning in ordinal regression if I convert run into a categorical factor but no warning if run is a continuous predictor?
