Percentage change

I have paired data pre and post-exposure to a drug. I would like to calculate the percentage change of my metric in response to the drug. I am getting a little confused and I am probably overthinking it. I think I should calculate the change per patient then the average of the individual changes to get the overall change. I would like to go on to see if the calculate p-values for the change.
