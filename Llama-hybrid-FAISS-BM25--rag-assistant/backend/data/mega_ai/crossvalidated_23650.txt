Some good answers already here. Here is a much simpler one, which is really an addition to the good answers you have received, not a substitute. Ordered logistic regression is the appropriate tool for modelling an ordinal response variable. There is an implementation - polr() - in Benables & Ripley's library(MASS) in R . Then you are back in the standard world of model selection, on which there are many good questions and good answers on Cross-Validated.
