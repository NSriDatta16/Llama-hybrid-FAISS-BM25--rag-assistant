Any way to tell what part of a WPF Ellipse shape a user has clicked on?

This may seem like a silly question, but is there some way to determine what part (say, a quadrant) of an Ellipse that a user clicked on? Or is the only option to just figure it out based on mouse point coordinates relative to the shape itself? I'm working on a control that allows the user to click on any part of the ellipse and drag it to resize if that helps.
