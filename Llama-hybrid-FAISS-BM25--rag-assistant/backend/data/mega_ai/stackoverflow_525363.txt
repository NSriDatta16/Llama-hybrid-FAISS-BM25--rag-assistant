I've had to do exactly this before. Here's my mouse event processing code, cut down to just the bits relating to making drag require a few pixels before being treated as a drag. public void mousePressed(int mod, Point loc) { pressLocation=copyLocation(loc,pressLocation); dragLocation=null; } public void mouseReleased(int mod, Point loc) { if(pressLocation!=null && dragLocation!=null) { // Mouse drag reverted to mouse click - not dragged far enough // action for click pressLocation=null; } else if(dragLocation!=null) { // action for drag completed } else { // do nothing } pressLocation=null; dragLocation=null; } public void mouseDragged(int mod, Point loc) { if(pressLocation!=null) { // initial drag actions following mouse press dragLocation=pressLocation; // consider dragging to be from start point if(Math.abs(loc.x-pressLocation.x) And note, I also had problems with Java some JVM's generating click events after dragging, which I had to detect and suppress.
