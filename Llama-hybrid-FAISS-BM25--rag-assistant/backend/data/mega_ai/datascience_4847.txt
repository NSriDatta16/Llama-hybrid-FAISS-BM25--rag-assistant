There is a worked out example in the Wikipedia page for "simple linear regression" Just for the sake of it, let me plug in your example into the formulas: The fitted model should be a straight line with parameters $\alpha$ (value at $x = 0$) and $\beta$ (the slope): $$f(x) = \alpha + \beta x$$ The values for these parameters that minimize the distance between line and data points are called $\hat{\alpha}$ and $\hat{\beta}$. They can be computed out of the data point values by using these formulae, derived here : $$\begin{align} \hat{\beta} & = \frac{ \overline{xy} - \bar{x}\bar{y} }{ \overline{x^2} - \bar{x}^2 } , \\ \\ \hat{\alpha} & = \bar{y} - \hat{\beta}\bar{x} \end{align} $$ where an expression with an overline $\overline{xy}$ means the sample average of that expression: $\overline{xy} = \tfrac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n{x_iy_i}$. Here are the values I find for the datapoints you have listed in your question: $$ \begin{align} \overline{xy} &= \frac{1}{4} \sum{ } \\ &= \frac{1}{4}(4000 + 20000 + 66000 + 120000) = 52500, \\ \overline{x} &= \frac{1}{4} \sum{ } = 2.5 ,\\ \overline{y} &= \frac{1}{4} \sum{ } = 16500 , \\ \overline{x^2} &= \frac{1}{4} \sum{ } = 7.5 , \\ \overline{x}^2 &= 2.5^2 = 6.25 \end{align} $$ and the fitted line should be: $$ \begin{align}\ \hat{\beta} &= \frac{52500 - 2.5 \times 16500}{7.5 - 6.25} = \frac{41250}{1.25} = 33000 , \\ \hat{\alpha} &= 16500 - 33000 \times 2.5 = - 66000 , \\ \Rightarrow f(x) &= - 66000 + 33000 x \end{align} $$ Therefore, the model would predict, for a house with 10 rooms, a rent of: $$ f(x) = -66000 + 33000 \times 10 = 264000 $$
