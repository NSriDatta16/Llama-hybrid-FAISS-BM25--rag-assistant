After reading Joseph answer i've tried to search for errors in catalog_category_entity and founded that all the categories in my tree has level 1 or 2 except for the categories that doesn't appear that have level 7. The strange things is that level 7 is the correct level for those category anyway i think that the problem is that Magento found a category with level 2 and it direct children has lavel 7 and it doesn't recognize those category as children for the father category. I've changed level of the children to 2 and everything seems to work. Why all the category in my tree has level 1 ? i don't know ...
