@Albert, You appear to be overly concerned with the minutiae of case conversion, when you haven't yet sorted out (nor explained to answerers) what you really want to do. === Your previous attempt at explanation (in comment on my answer to this question ) === @John: Well, I'm actually making an API for my web service. My webservice accepts a key that maps out to a specific record in my database. The key is case-sensitive, and the key can be composed of any unicode characteer. So in order to normalize all input, I will convert all key queries into lowercase (if they have uppercase equivalents). A consequence of that is when I create the record keys (which my users can customize), I cannot accept any uppercase character that can be converted to a lowercase equivalent by the toLower() function. So I'm trying to make a filter for that. Any suggestions? === and my replying comment === @Albert: If your keys are case sensitive, why are you normalising them??? "record keys which users can customize" means what??? "any unicode char" vs "cannot accept any uppercase char" ??? To answer your question literally: Looks like you can't accept a character c when c.lower() != c which means that you can't accept any key if key.lower() != key. I think that you should start a NEW QUESTION, explaining exactly what you are trying to do, with examples. ... and you've certainly asked a new question (in fact 2 of them) but you haven't explained anything. This "new" question is so new that @Alex Martelli's answer is essentially the same as my comment highlighted above. I think that you should start a NEW QUESTION, with new content , explaining exactly what you are trying to do, with examples.
