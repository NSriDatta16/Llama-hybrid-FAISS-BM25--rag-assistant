Firstly, for anything like rolling dice, ignoring how many dice rolls your proportion estimate is based on is absurd. With an outcome of (1,0,0,0,0,0) you should not yet be worried about the fairness of a dice, at all, with (10000,0,0,0,0,0) you should be. Secondly, many would consider the analysis of such data as a (simple?) extension of the single proportion case. E.g. for an exact test you similarly "simply" enumerate all possible outcomes and "just" need to define what counts as more extreme. On the Bayesian side there's a conjugate analysis with a beta-prior for a single proportion and with a Dirichlet prior for more outcome categories. If you are looking for models/distributions for a single proportion or on a simplex there's the beta and Dirichlet distributions. Whenever possible it is better to consider the underlying binomial/multinomial (if out exists and these data are available).
