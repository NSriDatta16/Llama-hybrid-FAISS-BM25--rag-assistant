jQuery vs. prototypeJS; size children

I currently work on a magento webshop, which loads PrototypeJS as framework. However i need jQuery at some point to do some custom stuff. jQuery is loaded after prototype and runs in noConflict mode. Now, here's my demo HTML: child child child An external JS file is loaded and contains the following; var $j = jQuery.noConflict(); $j(document).ready(function() { alert($j('#someID').children().length); }); My alert shows '1' (on any selector) where 3 is expected. Weird?!
