ROC Curve results remain the same

I have a dataset which has double 0' than 1'. I apply a logistic regression and a logistic regression with weights that balance the train dataset. My problem is when I create ROC curves in both cases they remain the same and AUC is the same.Or better it changes so little that difficult to distinguish. The accuracy of course decreases. I use python and the roc_curve() where I provide the response variable of the test dataset and the probabilities that the model calculates. I have the same behaviour with Average Precision Curve. I have difficulties to justify it. Can someone please explain to me?
