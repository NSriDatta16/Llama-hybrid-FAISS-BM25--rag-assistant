What do you think is the best unit testing framework for Swing? Good question. I can't help you with that. I can point you to articles about ui testing I have read from Misko Hevery's site Misko Hevery's tips I would like to point you out to Google's testing guru Misko Hevery's website. He talks a lot about how to write code that is easy to test. For example When reading his excellent slides "How to Write Hard to Test Code" he points out at slides 45/288 that the cost of fixing rendering bugs is relatively low. I think that he is right about that and that you should not be to concerned with having 100% code coverage off your UI. He also has some good tips to over how to test your UI . The important thing is to separate the graphical UI from the control logic and data. This can be achieved with the standard Model View Controller design pattern ObjectMentor This is a website about testing.I found this interesting article from Michael Featers explaining UI Test Automation Tools are Snake Oil
