Flash CS5 Crash corrupted files. How can I get my xml library assets back into a new FLA?

I started using Flash CS5 (and it sucks btw, but that's not my issue today). I spent many hours working on a .FLA file. Saving as I went and at one point Flash CS5 crashed during the save. The .fla file is now corrupt. The new .fla format is essentially a .zip file. So I was able to change the file name to *.zip and explore inside of it. The DOMDocument.xml file is corrupt and dead. The DOMDocument.xml is the timeline so all my placement and animation is gone. However, my LIBRARY folder is in tact and has all of my library items as *.xml files. I was wondering if anyone know how I can get those library items into another .fla file so I don't lose ALL my work? I've tried creating a new .fla file and dragging the LIBRARY folder into the new .fla, but my library items don't show up when I load the new .fla in the Flash CS5 IDE. Any and all help would be greatly appreciated.
