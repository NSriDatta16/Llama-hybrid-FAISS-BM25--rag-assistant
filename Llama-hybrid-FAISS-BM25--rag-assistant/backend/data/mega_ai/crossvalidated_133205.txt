Multiclass classification means a classification task with more than two classes; e.g., classify a set of images of fruits which may be oranges, apples, or pears. Multiclass classification makes the assumption that each sample is assigned to one and only one label : a fruit can be either an apple or a pear but not both at the same time. Multilabel classification assigns to each sample a set of target labels. This can be thought of as predicting properties of a data-point that are not mutually exclusive , such as topics that are relevant for a document. A text might be about any of religion, politics, finance or education at the same time or none of these. Taken from http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/multiclass.html Edit1 (Sept 2020): For those who prefer contrasts of terms for a better understanding, look at these contrasts: Multi-class vs Binary-class is the question of the number of classes your classifier is modeling. In theory, a binary classifier is much simpler than multi-class problem, so it's useful to make this distinction. For example, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) can trivially learn a hyperplane to separate two classes, but 3 or more classes make the classification problem much more complicated. In the neural networks, we commonly use Sigmoid for binary, but Softmax for multi-class as the last layer of the model. Multi-label vs Single-Label is the question of how many classes any object or example can belong to. In the neural networks, if we need single label, we use a single Softmax layer as the last layer, thus learning a single probability distribution that spans across all classes. If we need multi-label classification, we use multiple Sigmoids on the last layer, thus learning separate distribution for each class. Remarks: we combine multilabel with multiclass, in fact, it is safe to assume that all multi-label are multi-class classifiers. When we have a binary classifier (say positive v/s negative classes), we wouldn't usually assign both labels or no-label at the same time! We usually convert such scenarios to a multi-class classifier where classes are one of {positive, negative, both, none} . Hence multi-label AND binary classifier is not practical, and it is safe to assume all multilabel are multiclass. On the other side, not all Multi-class classifiers are multi-label classifiers and we shouldn't assume it unless explicitly stated. EDIT 2: Venn diagram for my remarks
