Logistic regression and Biostatistics and spss!

I have problem with my data.I dont know the exact method in order to analyse them.I have made 10 experiments into 9 different cell groups.The 10th is the control group.I have put copper in three different concentrations at 3 out of 10 cell groups and then i put 6 different concentrations of copper and EDTA(helps cells against copper).I would like to see...if there is a connection between copper concentration and death and then i would like to see wheather EDTA helps cells to live more. Should i use logistic regression?But how should i put my data on spss?
