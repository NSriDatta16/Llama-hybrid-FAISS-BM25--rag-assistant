By simply adding your collection (List) to your IsolatedStorageSettings you are relying on the built in serializer (the DataContractSerializer) to serialize your object for persisting to disk. Are you sure your object can be correctly serialized and deserialized? Doing this yourself is probably the easiest way to do this. If you do this yourself, not that: - DataContractSerializer is slow - DataContractJsonSerializer is faster - Json.net is faster still - Binary serialization is fastest. When serializing yourself you should also save in an IsolatedStorageFile rahter than in the settings. This can help with performance and also adds flexibility which can aid debugging and testing.
