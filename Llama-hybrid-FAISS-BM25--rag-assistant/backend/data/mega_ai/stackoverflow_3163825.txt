how to insert an image on drop in a paragraph in jquery

I want to add an image after I drop it into a paragraph. I could add the image into the paragraph, but I want it to be dropped either before the first line of the paragraph starts or after it ends, because I want it to have the text floated properly around it. I'm trying this code: $('.textElementClass').droppable({ accept: '.imageElement', tolerance: 'pointer', drop: function (e, ui) { $(this).css({'height':'400px'}); $(this).append(ui.draggable); } }); Thanks
