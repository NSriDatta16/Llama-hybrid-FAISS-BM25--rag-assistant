How does one implement drag and drop for Android marker?

Hi? I am working on a MapView app in Android. I have three markers that I want to be able to use the Google Map API getlocation-function on, later on. In order to try it out I would like to move the marker with a drag and drop-function, and then check the location. Anyone who has gotten a drag and drop to work on an android marker, or know a way to start figuring it out? /AK
