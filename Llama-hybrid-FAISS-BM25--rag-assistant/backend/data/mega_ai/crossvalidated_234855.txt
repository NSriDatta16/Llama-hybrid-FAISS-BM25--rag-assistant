linking proportional abundance to binary response variable

I ran into an issue that is simple in appearance but that got me somewhat stuck. I post it here to see if anybody has an elegant solution. I have a dataset giving 1) the proportional abundance of five categories in several groups, and 2) whether the group exhibits a particular property (yes or no, binary variable). You can think of this as a data set containing ecological communities observed on several islands. Each community is made up of five species (species proportions add up to 1 for all communities). The data set also contains a binary variable describing whether these communities persisted during the course of an experiment. From this data set I want to estimate the effect of increasing the abundance of any given species on the probability of survival. The difficulty is that you have to correct for the decrease in all remaining species that is associated with an increase in any particular species. There is also the problem of having 5 species contributing to the survival of the community, but the community composition can only be described with a maximum of 4 variables. Here is a script to generate the type of data I wish to analyse. Here all is random of course. library(vegan) species.a
