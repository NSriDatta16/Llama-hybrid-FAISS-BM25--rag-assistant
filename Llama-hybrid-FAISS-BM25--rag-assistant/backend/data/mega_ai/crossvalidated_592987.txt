Is NGARCH a ARCH or GARCH-Model?

I have got a question, that I cannot solve for myself. I´m modeling with R and plan to compare diffrent GARCH-Models (GARCH only, no ARCH) in modeling and forecasting the standarddeviation of several time series. My current overview is SGARCH, NGARCH, EGARCH, GJRGARCH and TGARCH. The plan is to compare two symmetric GARCH-Models and three asymmetric GARCH-Models. Everything seems fine, but I´m very confused about the NGARCH Model. Is it a ARCH-Model or belongs the NGARCH to the real GARCH Family and the n stands for nonlinear (=symmetric)?
