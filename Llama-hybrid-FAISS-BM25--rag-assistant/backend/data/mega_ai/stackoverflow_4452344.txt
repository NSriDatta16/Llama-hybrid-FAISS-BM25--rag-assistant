The size of high speed hardware integers (assuming the language has them) will always be dependent on whatever size integers are available to the compiler that compiled the language interpreter (usually C). If you need cross-platform / cross-version big integer support, the Perl pragma use bigint; will do the trick. If you need more control, bigint is a wrapper around the module Math::BigInt . In the scope where use bigint; is loaded, all of the integers in that scope will be transparently upgraded to Math::BigInt numbers. Lastly, when using any sort of big number library, be sure to not use tricks like 9**9**9 to get infinity, because you might be waiting a while :)
