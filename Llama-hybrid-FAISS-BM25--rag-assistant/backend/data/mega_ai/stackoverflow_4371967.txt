I disagree about postbacks being the main issue MVC looks to solve. Although that certainly is a benefit, MVC is mostly about separation of concerns. It's a great way to logically separate and organize your business logic, models, HTML templates, etc. And if you really need/want to use webforms as well, MVC lets you mix those in.
