Besides the fact that you do not end your cases with a break (as noted by strager), the main problem is the statement l = k; . Note that k is a char[20] and, when assigned to a int , you don't assign any of the contents of k to l . Instead l will contain (the value of) the pointer to the array. You will have to do something different here to get the value that is in the array; what exactly depends on that ucz sends back. After fixing this and making my own ucz , the program seems to work without any problem. Of course, it might also be that there is another problem in your version of ucz .
