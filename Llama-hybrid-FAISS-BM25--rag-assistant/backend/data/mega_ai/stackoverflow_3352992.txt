I discovered my problem. The Byte[] column in my datatable was not in the same ordinal position as the corresponding database column ordinal. The datatable column ordinal was 56 while the database column ordinal was 8, thus either the datatable needed to be re-organized or the columnmapping for the sqlbulkcopy. Reorganizing the datatable was much easier and quicker.
