What is the benefit of Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) over average of sensitivity and specificity for imbalanced data?

Assume that we have a 2 class data where number of samples in each class are very different (data is imbalanced) and penalty of miss-classification is equal for the two classes. For assessing the performance of a binary classifier over this data, I like to know what is the benefit(s) of Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) over just averaging sensitivity (True positive rate) and specificity (True negative rate)?
