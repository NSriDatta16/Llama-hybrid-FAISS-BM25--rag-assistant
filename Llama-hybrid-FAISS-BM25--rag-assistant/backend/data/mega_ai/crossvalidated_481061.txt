Nice question. When the risk you are trying to predict has two outcomes - hart infarct occurs or not - then a technique like logistic regression is fine. More advanced prediction models are also available. When all your input variables come from continuous distributions you can compare the outcomes of your logistic classifier with that of linear and quadratic discriminant analysis. You need to choose a certain time window within which the hart infarct occurs. When occurring later than that then it should not count. The random separation into training and test sets is necessary to assess possible overfitting in your predictive models. Use your test set for that at the final stage.
