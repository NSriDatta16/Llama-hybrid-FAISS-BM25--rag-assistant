You can use non-euclidean distances such as Bray-Curtis if you use Pseudo-F as your test statistic (see Reiss et al 2010, Biometrics, Vol. 66 (2), pp. 636-643). "the pseudo-F statistic is a generalization of the classical F statistic that can be calculated directly from the distance matrix D, whether or not D is Euclidean." The authors of the vegan package in R recommend using the function "adonis", which uses a permutation test with pseudo-F ratios, rather than mrpp. You might want to look into using adonis instead.
