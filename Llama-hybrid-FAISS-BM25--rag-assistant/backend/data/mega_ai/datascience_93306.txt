Pixel labelled image is must for semantic segmentation using deep learning in matlab?

I have large set of CT images containing lung regions. But I don't have corrosponding pixel labelled images. So how I could do semantic segmentation using DL in matlab. Like a test program I created 6 pixel labelled images using image Labeler. But it's not practical. I have thousands of such images. Could someone help me with a solution?
