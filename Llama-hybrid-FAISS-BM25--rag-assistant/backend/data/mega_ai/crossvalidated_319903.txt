First things first. You basically have two variables, a binary $Y$ that records if they attended ($Y=1$), or not ($Y=0$) and a continuous $X \in [0, 1]$ where the closer $X$ is to $0$, the more certain they are about not attending, and the closer to $1$, the more certain they are that they'd attend. You correctly identified the binomial distribution parametrized by number of possible attendees $n$ and probability of attending $p$, as a likelihood function. In your case $n$ is known, since it is your sample size and $p$ is to be estimated from the data. The $p$ parameter depends on $X$, what leads us to a logistic regression model . First possible choice of a model for your data is simple model assuming continuous $X$: $$ \begin{align} y_i &\sim \mathsf{Bin}(n, p_i) \\ p_i &= \mathrm{logit}^{-1}\big(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i\big) \end{align} $$ Alternatively you may assume something closer to your original description, where we would use a dummy variables: $I_{X=1}$ that returns $1$ if $X=1$ and $0$ otherwise, and $I_{X\in (0,1)}$ that returns $1$ if $X$ is in the $(0, 1)$ range (i.e. excluding the exact $0$ and $1$) and $0$ otherwise. The model would be: $$ \begin{align} y_i &\sim \mathsf{Bin}(n, p_i) \\ p_i &= \mathrm{logit}^{-1}\big(\beta_0 + \beta_1 I_{X=1} + \beta_2 I_{X\in (0,1)} x_i\big) \end{align} $$ i.e. $$ \mathrm{logit}(p_i) = \begin{cases} \beta_0 & X = 0 \\ \beta_0 + \beta_1 & X = 1 \\ \beta_0 + \beta_2 x_i & X \in (0, 1) \end{cases} $$ Next, you need to assume priors for $\beta_0,\beta_1,\beta_2$. Assuming that $\Pr(p_i = 0 \mid X = 0) = 0$ does not sound like a reasonable choice since it will lead for your model to always conclude that probability of attending is zero if someone said he will not attend, since $z \times 0 = 0$ no matter what $z$ is. Such prior would it make impossible for your model to learn anything from the data where $X=0$. Same with making strong assumptions like something to leads that $p_i \ge 0.5$ for $X=1$, since there is no objective reason to assume that if someone said that he will do something, then the probability that he will do is $\ge 0.5$ (how many people do you know that told you that they will stop smoking?). For $\beta_1,\beta_2$ you seemed to assume that they need to be "probabilities". They do not in the model I described, since they can be anything on the real line. Defining such constrains for logistic regression model would make it overtly complicated. In your description you seem to be assuming that the priors are on the $p_i$ values, but this is incorrect since you are interested in the $p_i$ that depends on $x_i$, so you need to include information about such dependence in your model and logistic regression is the most direct and commonly used approach for such cases. Since logistic function transforms each $z 0$ to $0.5
