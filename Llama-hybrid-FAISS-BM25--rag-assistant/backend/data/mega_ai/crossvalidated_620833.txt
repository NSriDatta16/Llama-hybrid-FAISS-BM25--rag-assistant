Using both Random Forest and RFE for Feature Selection and Dimensionality Reduction

I am using random forest classifier currently to do feature selection for a balanced dataset of about 18K rows and 7050 features. I recognize this is a lot of features. I am thinking of using random forest to select an arbitrary number of features (200-300) and then use recursive feature elimination to feature select even further. What are some problems that I should prepare for when running this type of "ensemble" feature selection?
