Andrew, It seems to me that you want to call a function when the user taps any where except the UI objects. so my suggestion is that create a custom button of the size of screen(320x460 assuming that the grey bar is shown) place it back of all the objects in the IB. By this time you will be able to see a UIButton with almost 0% opacity. and from the IB drag the selector option of the custom button to the file owners and select the function that you want to call and you are all done. Its simpler than what you were attempting in your code
