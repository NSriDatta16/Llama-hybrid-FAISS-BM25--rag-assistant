Neural network with PROC logistic in SAS

I am wondering if somebody has used or has any reference to point as to how a neural network in conjunction with PROC logistic can be used in sas. A code would be an ideal thing for me but if unavailable, if somebody can pass me a link as to how can I benefit myself from using neural network alongside logistic ?
