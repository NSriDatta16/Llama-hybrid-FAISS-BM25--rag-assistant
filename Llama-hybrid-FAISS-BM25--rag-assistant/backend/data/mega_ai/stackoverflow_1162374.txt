I haven't heard of such a thing. Seems like an overuse of branching to me. I guess it depends on what we mean by the word "feature". Is it a use case? A user story? An entire iteration? Branches imply parallel development. If you aren't developing in parallel, why branch? Some good SCM references from our host, Jeff Atwood: Eric Sink Branching and Merging Primer And, of course, the SVN red bean book: http://svnbook.red-bean.com/ I also like what "Pragmatic Version Control" has to say about branching and tagging.
