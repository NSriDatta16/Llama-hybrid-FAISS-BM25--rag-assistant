Big difference in random forest test subset error and other subsets

I'm using R "randomForest" package for predicting stock prices. I have more than 3000 observations and 90 columns. I have excluded my last 150 days from data set and divide the rest of my data to test and train subsets. so I have three subsets: train, test and current days. I run the script and fit a model by random forest on my train subset, and then predict with test subset. Since i have two classes YES/NO in my target variable, I use following code to see the results : with(data[-train,],table(rf.pred,target)) True YES prediction in test subset is usually over 80% but when I use the model to predict in current 150 days, the prediction power is awkward and less than 50%! for example : test subset results: target rf.pred NO YES NO 224 16 YES 3 47 current days results: target rf.pred2 NO YES NO 0 0 YES 106 44 I want to know why the test and current days result differs to this extent?
