What is 'p' in this grid world example given below for Q-learning and SARSA?

This is the simple grid world problem. I am new to Machine/Reinforcement learning so I need help to understand this better. I need to implement Q-learning with epsilon-greedy action with $epsilon = 0.2, p = 0.8, alpha = 0.1$, and the grid world of size 50 by 50.
