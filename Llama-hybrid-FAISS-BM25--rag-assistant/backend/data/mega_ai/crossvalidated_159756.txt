Cointegration in R - Standard error, test statistic and p-value of weights

I'm using urca package in R version 3.2.1. I used ca.jo function on a set of I(1) regular time series variables - taking two at a time - to check for cointegration. The loading matrix, which I believe is the cointegrating equation's coefficient matrix, shows the estimated coefficients, but does not have the corresponding standard error, t-stat or p-value. How do I determine whether variable x(t) has a long run causal effect on variable y(t) ?
