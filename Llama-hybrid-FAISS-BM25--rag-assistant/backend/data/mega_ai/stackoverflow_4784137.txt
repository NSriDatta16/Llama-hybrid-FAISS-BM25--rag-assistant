Choose OpenGL ES 1.1 or OpenGL ES 2.0?

I'm going to start a new cross-plattform openGL project (primary for iPhone & PC). So theres the main question: targeting for OpenGL ES 1.1 or OpenGL ES 2.0? Or both? So far I read Open GL ES 1.1 isnt really deprecated, isn't it? So what would speak for openGL ES 2.0? Programmable vertex- & fragmentshader - Anything else? I heard about performance decrease with alpha blending or so - can that be true? I assume openGL ES 2.0 code should also run on PC - So is openGL ES 2.0 is really more future aware? The other developers out there are still coding for OpenGL ES 1.1 or 2.0? And why? I assume in case I choose openGL ES 2.0, there would be a lot of overhead for also backward compatibility with openGL ES 1.1. But there are a lot of iPhones out there without openGL ES 2.0 support - how should I accomplish this? Any experience out there? I found only this question: OpenGL ES 1.1 or 2.0 on iPhone kind of relevant, but it isn't really deep about the implementation... So any advice is welcome! Thank you so much!
