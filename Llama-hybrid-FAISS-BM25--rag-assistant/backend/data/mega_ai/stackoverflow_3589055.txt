Django, database retrieval not working but deleting fields and adding new fields is working

I have been able to get my database queries to work properly for deleting existing entries and also adding new entries to the database but I am completely stumped as to why I am unable to retrieve anything from my database. I am trying a query such as: from web1.polls.models import Poll retquery = Poll.objects.all() print retquery --prints: "[ ]" Also, if I try this, it just returns "poll object" from web1.polls.models import Poll retquery = Poll.objects.all()[0] print retquery --prints: "poll object" I have looked at everything and there are definitely entries in the database, I have tried this with a number of different models where everything else is working otherwise so I don't know what I can do at this point, any advice is greatly appreciated
