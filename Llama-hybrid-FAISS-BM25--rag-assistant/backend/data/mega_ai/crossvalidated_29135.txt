Difference between survival analysis and classification?

Since the time variable can be treated as a normal feature in classification, why not using more powerful classification methods (such as, C4.5, SVM) to predict the occurrence of an event? Why lots of people still use the classic but old Cox model? In case of the right-censoring data, since the time would change for an instances, so I think same object with different time values could be treated as two different instances in classification. Is this OK? Is there are some highly-cited paper on this topic? Thank you!
