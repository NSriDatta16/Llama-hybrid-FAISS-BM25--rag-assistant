Using large files in a OVHcloud AI notebook

I’m trying to train an artificial intelligence model on OVHCloud AI Notebooks with the Common Voice’s dataset from Mozilla. The problem is that this database has a 70 GB size . I have tried to download it on my computer, and then to export the database to the OVHCloud Object Storage so I can use it, but this is excessively long. Is it possible to download directly this file on the notebook ? (My file is a tar.gz file)
