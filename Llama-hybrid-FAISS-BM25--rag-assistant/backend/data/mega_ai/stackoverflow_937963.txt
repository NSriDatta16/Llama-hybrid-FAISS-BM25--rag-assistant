From the last paragraph of section 1.6.6 of the C# 3.0 language specification : The signature of a method must be unique in the class in which the method is declared. The signature of a method consists of the name of the method, the number of type parameters and the number, modifiers, and types of its parameters. The signature of a method does not include the return type. In IL two methods can differ by return type alone, but outside of reflection there is no means to call a method that differs only be return type.
