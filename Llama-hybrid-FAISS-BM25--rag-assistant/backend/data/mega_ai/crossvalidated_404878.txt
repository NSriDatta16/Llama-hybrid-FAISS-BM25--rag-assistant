NLP - how do you randomly draw negative samples?

From my understanding, negative sampling randomly samples K negative samples from a noise distribution, P(w) . The noise distribution is basically the frequency distribution + some modification on words. Typically we choose K = 5 ~ 20 negative samples. P(w) = Uw(w)^(3/4) / normalization_factor And I've seen these two same equations that are represented in two different notations: Three questions: What is the meaning of the blue box? What is the significance of j and i ? The second equation does not seem to show anything that "randomly draws" words from the noise distribution. What is the meaning of k in red box? How do you choose noise samples from the noise distribution? Let's say that the normalized noise distribution looks as the following dictionary: dist = {'apple': 0.0023, 'bee': 0.004, 'desk':0.032', 'chair': 0.032 ...} How do you "randomly draw" K noise samples from dist ?
