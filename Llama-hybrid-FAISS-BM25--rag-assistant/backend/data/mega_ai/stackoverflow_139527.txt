Please don't use absolute positioning to reassemble a scrambled page. This won't work for mobile devices, screen readers for the visually impaired, and search engines. Please don't add captcha. It will just drive people away before they ever see your site. Any solution you come up with will be anti-web. The Internet is about sharing, and you have to take the bad with the good. If you must do something, you might want to just use Flash. I haven't seen link farmers grabbing Flash content, yet. But for all the reasons stated in the first paragraph, Flash is anti-web.
