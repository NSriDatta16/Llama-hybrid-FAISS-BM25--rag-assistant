I expect that System.Collections.Generic.List is not thread-safe, meaning that if you try to concurrently Add from two different threads, things will go wrong. Ah yes, it says so in the docs . You could prevent this from happening in a number of ways: use a collection type that allows threadsafe adds (there are some new ones in .Net 4.0) lock before you add use thread-local storage for the collections, and merge them at the end ... These are very typical issues you encounter with data parallel code.
