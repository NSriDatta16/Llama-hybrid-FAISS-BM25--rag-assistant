If you mean "initialize a dense array of N items in a time independent of N", then it is physically impossible. A dense array has a storage space that grows linearly with the number of items, and it will take a linear amount of time to initialize this space. You can have constant-time initialization using a sparse array. That is essentially an associative array (or hashmap, or dictionary, or table, depending on the language) which initializes items when they are first accessed.
