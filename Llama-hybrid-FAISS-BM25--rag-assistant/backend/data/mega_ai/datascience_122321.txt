Clustering and grouping noisy time series fuel data

I have a time series of fuel data which are split into distinct clusters (as shown in the image below. I'm looking at the green line). The clusters almost always have a descending gradient. I would like to identify these clusters programmatically (I'm using python). Are there any statistical methods I can use to do this? Many thanks for any hints.
