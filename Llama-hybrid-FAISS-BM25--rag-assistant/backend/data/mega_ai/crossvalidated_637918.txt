Building the best proxy for an economic indicator

I've been asked to help people from the Economics Department with an index A which is a geographically restricted GDP. This index was expensive to calculate, so they have data on it only for 1993-1999 and 2004-2012. They have a proxy B which is basically a linear model made from of a different dataset with many predictors but few samples of each. The proxy follows the up and down trends of the index. How can they construct a better proxy with the data they have? My ideas boil down to models other than averaging, and comparing how well their proxies follow the trends of the index. Maybe there are better approaches. I am confused a bit because we are not trying to predict the index A but rather to construct a good proxy B. Where can I read about such problems?
