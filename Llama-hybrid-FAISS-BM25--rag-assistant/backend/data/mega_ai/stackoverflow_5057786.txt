You could loop through its children and remove then, ie. var parDiv = document.getElementById('elName'), parChildren = parDiv.children, tmpChildren = [], i, e; for (i = 0, e = parChildren.length; i Or use .empty() if you are using jQuery. This is just an alternative solution, a while loop is much more elegant.
