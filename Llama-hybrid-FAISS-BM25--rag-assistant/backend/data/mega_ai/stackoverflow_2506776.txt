Is it possible to format C++ code with VIM?

I am rather new to VIM. I got some source code and this is a mess. At a first sight I would like at least to get a clear and organised view of the code, so I like to get it rightly formatted, I mean indented depending on the depth of the functions and so. I wonder if it can be done with VIM, and otherwise which other commandline tools for that can you recommend. Thanks
