Is it possible to show the order details sent to customer via email in a separate page (Magento)?

Is it possible to show the order details of last processed order, such as Item Sku Qty Subtotal in a separate page? I tried adding the order details section from frontend/base/default/template/email/order/items/order/default.phtml in a separate cms page, by adding {{layout handle="sales_email_order_items" order=$order}} to it. But, when I run this cms page after order being placed, it shows the following error: Fatal error: Call to a member function getAllItems() on a non-object in D:\wamp\www\magento\app\design\frontend\base\default\template\email\order\items.phtml Is this actually possible?
