jQuery: A shortcut to create a div container after a cue word

I'm creating a shortcut for a blog theme where I want to generate a div container around elements after using a cue word. For example, my blog entry would like this: First Paragraph [box] Second Paragraph Third Paragraph I'm hoping with some jQuery magic it could turn into this: First Paragraph Second Paragraph Third Paragraph One more rule: When I create a container box, I know I will always generate it before the closing div.entry. I'm hoping this restriction will make it easier to write the rules for jQuery. For example, I will never want the markup to look like this where there is content proceeding the div.box container: First Paragraph Second Paragraph Third paragraph
