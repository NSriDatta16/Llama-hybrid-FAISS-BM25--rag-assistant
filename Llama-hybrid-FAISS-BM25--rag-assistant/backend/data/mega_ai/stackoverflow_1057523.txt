Is there a elegant way to implement selectable tabs/menus in ASP.net

I am struggling to find a way of implementing a tab style menu system in ASP.net. The tabs look great from the HTML/CSS standpoint and are implemeted in the Master page so I don't have access to the body tag from the content page. what I am trying to work out is how to vary the "active tab" based upon the page the user is accessing. I can think of several ways of doing this: Dynamicly generate the HTML at each page load Manipulate the list items in the Page_Load Use jQuery to manipulate the selected tab class I have an additional problem which seems to make some solutions unsuitable; one tab may incoporate several different page names, so for example the Courses tab should be selected for both Default.aspx and CourseDetail.aspx. None of these seem particuarly elegant, I get the feeling that there is a better way of doing this in ASP.net but I don't know what I am looking (or searching) for. HTML: Courses My Courses Administration CSS: #head ul { list-style: none; padding:0; margin:0; } #head li { display: inline; border: solid; border-width: 1px 1px 0 1px; margin: 0 0.5em 0 0; background: #EEE; font-size: large; font-weight: bold; padding-top: 0.3em; } #head li a { padding: 0 1em; text-decoration: none; color: Black; } #head .selectedtab { padding-bottom: 1px; background: white; border-bottom: 1px solid white; } #tabs { text-align: right; width: 100%; border-bottom: 1px solid; }
