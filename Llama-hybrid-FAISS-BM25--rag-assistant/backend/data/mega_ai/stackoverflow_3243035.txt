(define (average ....)) in Lisp

I'm just playing around with scheme/lisp and was thinking about how I would right my own definition of average . I'm not sure how to do some things that I think are required though. define a procedure that takes an arbitrary number of arguments count those arguments pass the argument list to (+) to sum them together Does someone have an example of defining average ? I don't seem to know enough about LISP to form a web search that gets back the results I'm looking for.
