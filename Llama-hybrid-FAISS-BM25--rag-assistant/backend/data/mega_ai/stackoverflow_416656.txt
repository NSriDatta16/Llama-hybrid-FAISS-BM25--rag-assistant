@Kent Boogart: That appears to be the correct explanation. For a full explanation, Suzanne Cook has this blog post which elaborates a little more than the original one you posted: http://blogs.msdn.com/suzcook/archive/2003/05/29/57143.aspx Following is code leveraging AppDomain.AssemblyResolve - // register to listen to all assembly resolving attempts: AppDomain currentDomain = AppDomain.CurrentDomain; currentDomain.AssemblyResolve += new ResolveEventHandler(MyResolveEventHandler); // Check whether the desired assembly is already loaded private static Assembly MyResolveEventHandler(object sender, ResolveEventArgs args) { Assembly[] assemblies = AppDomain.CurrentDomain.GetAssemblies(); foreach (Assembly assembly in assemblies) { AssemblyName assemblyName = assembly.GetName(); string desiredAssmebly = args.Name; if (assemblyName.FullName == desiredAssmebly) { return assembly; } } // Failed to find the desired assembly return null; }
