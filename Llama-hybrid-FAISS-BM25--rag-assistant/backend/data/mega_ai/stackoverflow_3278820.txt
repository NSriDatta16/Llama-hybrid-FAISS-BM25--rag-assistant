I think the closest you can get is the CMY colour model which, fortunately, is just the inverse of RGB. C = 1 - R M = 1 - G Y = 1 - B Now, if you assume (although CMY is cyan-magenta-yellow) that C = blue, M = red, Y = yellow, you get pretty close to your art colours. For example: Blue becomes (1, 0, 0) Yellow becomes (0, 0, 1) Blue + Yellow becomes (1, 0, 1) Converting back to RGB gives (0, 1, 0) which is green Update: 0 to 1 are just convenient representations for no colour and full colour, equivalent to 0 to 255 of standard RGB. For those wondering "this is obviously wrong, how is cyan = blue?", you should also realize that CMY != art colour. In fact, art colour doesn't match any primary colour model, so this is just a reasonable assumption to get the kind of colours you expect to get by mixing paints in art.
