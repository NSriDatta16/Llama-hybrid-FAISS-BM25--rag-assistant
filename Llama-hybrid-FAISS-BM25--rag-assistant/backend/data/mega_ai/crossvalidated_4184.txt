How can Gröbner bases used to describe discrete probability?

[Cross post from here , figured this community may be more relevant] I am working in the field of machine learning, and I have come across a few papers that show relationships between Gröbner bases and discrete probability. So I come here for help. Can you please explain how can Gröbner bases used to describe discrete probability? I have looked at Gröbner bases and I understand the general concepts (and used Maple to calculate a few examples). So it is the link that is missing for me.
