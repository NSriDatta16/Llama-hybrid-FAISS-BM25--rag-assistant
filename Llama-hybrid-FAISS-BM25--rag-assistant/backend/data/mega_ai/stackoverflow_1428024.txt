Here's my general process: Start by understanding what the application does, and how its used. (I see way too many developers completely skip this critical step.) Search for any developer documentation related to the project. (However, realize this will nearly always be wrong and out of date - it just will have helpful clues.) Try to figure out the logic in the organization. How is the main architecture defined? What large scale patterns are used? (ie: MVC, MVP, IoC, etc) Try to figure out the main classes related to the "large" objects in the project. This helps for the point above. Slowly start refactoring and cleaning up as you try to maintain the project. Usually, that will get me at least somewhat up to speed. However, usually I end up given a project like this because something has to be fixed or enhanced, and timing isn't always realistic, in which case I often just have to jump in and pray.
