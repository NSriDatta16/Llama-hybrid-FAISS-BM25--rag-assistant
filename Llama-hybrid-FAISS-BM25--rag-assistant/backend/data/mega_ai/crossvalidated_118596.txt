Yes, I think you can scale frequency distribution from the smaller sample. The reasoning is essentially an assumption that the process is stationary ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stationary_process ). You could also create confidence intervals for each range bin about the scaled average, but the mean or expected value for each would indeed be simply the scaled version exactly as you describe.
