Internationalization/Locale Support Provide application translations for different languages, and serve the appropriate language based on a user's locale settings. Mobile Version Detect a user-agent string and serve a mobile/touch-friendly version of your app. This is pretty easy to do using xhtml mobile profiles . Use an ORM that supports multiple backends Both as a developer and a user, its nice to be able to swap out database backends by editing a config file. That way, you can run on something like SQLite for dev/single-user uses, and something like PostgreSQL or MySQL for production. (unobtrusive) Notification if Javascript is disabled Ever been to Stack Overflow with JS turned off or disabled? Sometimes I forget that noscript is turned on, and SO helpfully tells me. Then I can make a decision about whether or not I want to turn it back on; but at least I know that I'm missing functionality, rather than just thinking the app is lame. Firebug/Javascript logging Providing lots of logging helps debug ajax issues. just doing console.log(message) in javascript will log the message to firebug. Have a Production/Development switch in your application config file that turns this on or off (have the php not generate the log messages in production mode)
