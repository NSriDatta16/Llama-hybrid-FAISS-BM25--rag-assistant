Which techniques can be used to explore causality in repeated cross-sectional data?

I have repeated cross-sectional data for certain variables during 51 years (hundreds of variables, measured every year). The number of samples (individuals) for which these variables are measured in each year varies, with later years having typically more samples, but the number of measured variables remains constant. I would like to explore causality in this data between the measured variables during time. I know that Granger causality is usually used in time series, but since this is repeated cross-sectional data, it would not be the most canonical use for it. I can average values and apply Granger between averages, but I would like to find other ideas. I've searched for alternatives, but so far have not been able to find a good one. Does anyone have any advice on alternatives that could help me explore causality in time with this type of data?
