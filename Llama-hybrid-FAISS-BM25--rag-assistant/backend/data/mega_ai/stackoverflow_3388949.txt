To make this a programming question, I'm going to assume you mean "can I programatically determine Google's opinion of their agreement with the copyright holder?", I think the answer is no. See for example: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kffacxfA7G4 - no music url or other indicator (that I can see), but I'd guess at 270m views it must have attracted sufficent attention for the copyright agreement status to be resolved. So far as the rest of your question goes: "How can I tell if the owner of the artist has an agreement with Google which covers a specific video" - this is something to be answered by a court, not a programming question. - The ethical question raised by co-operation with Google as a potential infringer of copyright is not a programming question either.
