Python is a general-purpose, dynamic, strongly typed language with many 3rd-party libraries for data science applications. There are two versions currently in wide use: 2 and 3. Python 2 is the "old" version, with no new versions being released beyond 2.7, save bugfixes. Python 3 is the "new" version, with active development. Python syntax is relatively easy to comprehend compared to other languages. For example: numbers = [1, 2, 5, 8, 9] for number in numbers: print("Hello world #", number) Python has a clean look due to its regulatory approach to whitespace . While seemingly restrictive, it allows all Python code to look similar, which makes inspecting code much more predictable. All loops and conditionals ( for , while , if , etc) must be indented for the code block that follows. Popular scientific and data science packages include: Numpy - A fast, N-dimensional array library; the foundation for all things scientific Python. Scipy - Numerical analysis built on Numpy. Allows for optimization, linear algebra, Fourier Transforms and much else. Pandas (PANel DAta) - A fast and extremely flexible package that is very useful for data exploration. It handles NaN data well as well as fast indexing. Handles a wide variety of external data types and file formats.
