I don't know if I'd phrase it as 'linear algebra is very important when studying algorithms". I'd almost put it the other way around. Many, many, many, real world problems end up requiring you to solve a set of linear equations. If you end up having to tackle one of those problems you are going to need to know about some of the many algorithms for dealing with linear equations. Many of those algorithms were developed when computers was a job title, not a machine. Consider gaussian elimination and the various matrix decomposition algorithms for example. There is a lot of very sophisticated theory on how to solve those problems for very large matrices for example. Most common methods in machine learning end up having an optimization step which requires solving a set of simultaneous equations. If you don't know linear algebra you'll be completely lost.
