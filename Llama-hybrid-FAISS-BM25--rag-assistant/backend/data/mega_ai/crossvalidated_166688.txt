is it logical to train a binary classifier when one class form most of examples?

I want to train a binary classifier while only few examples in train data are "T" class. However I just used two numeric features but I think It's not logical to use any kind of classifier for this task. I have tried Naive Bayes and logistic regression. In my train data there's 3388 examples which 3110 of them are "F" class.
