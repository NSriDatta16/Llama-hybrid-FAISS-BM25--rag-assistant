Naive Bayesian classifier calculation problem

I am having trouble calculating the Bayesian probability for this table, when doing naive Bayesian classifiers. When I try to calculate number 5 I get $1.25$ by doing the following: $P(a=1|id=1)= \frac {3}{4},$ $P(b=2|id=1)= \frac {3}{4}$, $P(id=1)= \frac {1}{2},$ $P(a=1)= \frac {1}{2},$ $P(b=2)= \frac {1}{2}$ which leads to $P(id=1|a=1,b=2)= \frac {\frac {3}{4} \times \frac {3}{4} \times \frac {1}{2}}{\frac {1}{2} \times \frac {1}{2}} = 1.25$ Obviously this is wrong as a probability can't be more than $1$ but I am not sure where I went wrong.
