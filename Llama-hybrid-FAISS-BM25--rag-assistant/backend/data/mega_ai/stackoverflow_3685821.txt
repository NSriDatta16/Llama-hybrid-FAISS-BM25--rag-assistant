Production quality WPF examples

As I'm learning WPF I came across quite a few examples, but mostly all of them have a disclamer like 'this is not production quality code', as they refer to a specific issue they're addressing. What I would like is to see how is WPF used in reallife, the application as a whole, so that in one example I can see all of the best practices at work (binding, resource files, multilanguage, solution organisation, etc... from basic stuff to advanced). Do you know of such examples?
