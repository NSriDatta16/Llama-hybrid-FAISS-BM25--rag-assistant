I tried to understand why bagging 10 random forests would work better than a random forest with 100 tress and I see no rational reason. I do not exclude that there could be some Weka implementation details. However to answer your question I believe it is talking about a bagging ensemble with 10 bags and in each bag a random forest with 10 trees. I do not have a proof, but there are some elements which I consider it provides enough evidence for this: In the first paragraph, the last sentence which starts with "we found that neither 100.." it talks about building either a bagging with 100 trees or a random forest with 100 trees. Now 100 is 10 x 10, which are 10 bags x a random forest with 10 trees. 10 bagged random forests means the same thing from the previous point (even if it is not usual to bag random forests) in Weka is very easy to combine in this way some classifiers, since they can be chained together due to the fact that they implement the same interface (this is a programming stuff, I am a programmer, and I confirm that it is obvious that Weka intended to make such kind of experimenting as easy as possible) there is a way to decrease the total compute out-of-the-bag error if you group 10 random forests with 10 trees into bagging, instead of 100 random forest. If you have 10 bags and in each bag one rf with 10 trees, than the oob error is computed for the other instance of the 10 bootstrap samples from the bags. These 10 oob samples sets are classified with a random forest instead of a normal random tree. Of course, the random forest has in general less variability, so the oob errors from the 10 bags could be lower than if you have the average of oob errors for 100 oobs predicted with trees. I do not know if this is a real improvement, it might be. From my point of view it is not, it looks like an introduction of a optimistic bias in oob estimation, but this is only my intuition and since I don't have an extensive experience, I might be wrong. Even so, it looks like a plausible track last argument is a personal intuition: I asked myself why one would over-complicate these kind of formulations for nothing? I found reasonable to believe they did that with a purpose, and a "reasonable reason" is that they simply used a bagging of random forest.
