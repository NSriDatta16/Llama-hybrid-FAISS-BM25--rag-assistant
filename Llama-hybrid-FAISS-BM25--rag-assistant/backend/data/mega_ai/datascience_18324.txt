Image Classification, Convolution Network and Gamma Correction for images

I am working with NIST Special Database 4 , which is a database of fingerprints. The objective is to train a convolutional network (CNN) and train it to classify the fingerprints. After I looked through the database, I notices some images are lighter and some are darker, an example is provided below: Now my question is if the images are used with unequal intensity (without any preprocessing), would that affect the training process for the CNN and subsequently the accuracy of the classification process? Would Gamma Correction of the images to uniform intensity be better before the training & classification process? Is there some best practices for Gamma correcting multiple images to similar intensity. Would really appreciate some help on this.
