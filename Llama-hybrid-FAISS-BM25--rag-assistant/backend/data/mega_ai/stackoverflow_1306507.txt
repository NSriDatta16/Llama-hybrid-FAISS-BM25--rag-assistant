ASP.NET leverages the multi-language capabilities of the .NET Common Language Runtime, allowing web pages to be coded in VB.NET, C#, J#, Delphi.NET, Chrome etc. This means you don't have to learn C# to use it and, even if you don't know any of those languages, you may find it easier to start with a more human readable one such as VB.NET. In any case, I recommend the following tutorials if you do plan on learning C#: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa288436%28VS.71%29.aspx
