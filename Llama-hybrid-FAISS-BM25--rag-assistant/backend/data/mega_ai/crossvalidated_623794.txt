What is a visual representation of an ordinal logistic fitted model

Naturally, the above image is a graphical representation of a sigmoid function fit for a logistic regression I'm trying to understand the equivalent of an ordered logit. Below is an image that, to the best of my understanding, is the graphical representation of a fitted proportional odds logit of four categories. are the kinks in this representation right, or am I just waaay off base with this one? I'm no more than an economist, one who throws a regression at every problem they encounter.
