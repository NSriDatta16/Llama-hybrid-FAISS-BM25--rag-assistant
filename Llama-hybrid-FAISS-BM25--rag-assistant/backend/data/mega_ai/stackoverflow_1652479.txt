Is there a better way to serialize plist-y objects in Objective-C?

I like the plist serialization capability for small collections of objects: it is simple, the storage is XML, etc. But I find setting values in dictionaries cumbersome: [myDict setObject:keepThis forKey:@"ivar"]; I'd much prefer to use object derived of classes (or even just structs): myObj.ivar = keepThis ... and then send a message to a collection to get a plist. The classes/structs used for this purpose could be restricted so that they map directly and easily to plist primitives; for example myObj could be mapped to a NSDictionary and a requirement could be placed on ivars such that they are one of the plist primitives. Has someone already built a facility for this, or should I roll my own?
