After much testing, I ended up completely restructuring/rewriting how the preloader works, and this fixed my issue. What I thought was some lag between the loading of the final image and the firing of the event was actually (for reasons that I still don't fully understand) the code that updated my preloader clip wasn't being run as the events were being fired, but instead was waiting until the last image in the series began loading to start working. I moved the code that updates the loading progress from inside the preloader movie clip (which was looking at some _root level progress variables and updating itself on enter frame) into the onLoadProgress event itself. Everyone who commented thank you very much for the quick responses, and as soon as I reach my 15, I'll vote up both of your answers as they were helpful, if not exactly the answer I was looking for.
