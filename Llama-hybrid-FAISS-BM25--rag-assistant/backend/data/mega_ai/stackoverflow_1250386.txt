How to embed video on in HTML page

sorry for the convoluted and subjective question, but multimedia is totally out of my area of expertize. I know there are several alternatives to embed video on a page. There is HTML 5 tag, there is video/ogg content type which seems nobody uses, there is Flash SWF embedding or Flash FLV progressive, I think Silverlight has something and finally there is external hosting. My needs are for a commercial site video tour, it has to be fairly good quality. Good hosting is around USD $100/mo (I looked at viddler.com, the ones 37signals use), over my budget. Is there a good, commercial, hosting at under USD $20/mo ? So I'm considering the alternatives. I believe my best bet is on SWF, is a tested technology, supported by plenty of platforms. Besides I'll need to use their charting components anyway later down the road. What tool do I need? Standard Flex Builder, Professional Flex Builder or I can use the free Flex SDK? What other alternatives are there?
