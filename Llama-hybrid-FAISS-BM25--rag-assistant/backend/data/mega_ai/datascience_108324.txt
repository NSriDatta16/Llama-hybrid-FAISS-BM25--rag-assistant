Combine prior knowledge probability with ML model probability results

I want to combine prior knowledge to improve my machine learning model. According to Bayes rule, max posterior is obtained when multiply prior with MLE. I multiply prior probability with the machine learning probability prediction results. However, it doesn't make sense that I will get better prediction results because I got smaller probability. Am I missing something? Thx
