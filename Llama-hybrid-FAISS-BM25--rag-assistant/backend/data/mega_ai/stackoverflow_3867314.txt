Magento - Create a minimum shipping charge

We use USPS API for international shipping. The API returns a shipping cost and we add % Handling charge. We want to set a minimum charge, e.g., if shipping + handling is less than $5 we want to set the shipping price to $5. Would this require writing a full shipping module or just adapt the USPS module?
