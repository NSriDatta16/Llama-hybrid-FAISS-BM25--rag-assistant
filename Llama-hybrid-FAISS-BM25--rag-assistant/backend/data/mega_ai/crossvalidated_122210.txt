Stein's phenomenon, or Stein's paradox, refers to a surprising finding made by Charles Stein in 1955: when three or more location parameters are estimated simultaneously, then there are more accurate estimators than simply taking the average of all observations. `Higher accuracy' is to be understood as providing a smaller expected squared error uniformly over all values of the parameter. One particular example of a more accurate estimator is given by the so called James-Stein estimator (1961), that handles all parameters together (in particular by considering a joint error), instead of treating them separately. The James-Stein estimator is an example of shrinkage estimator. This phenomenon has been shown to occur in a wide range of settings.
