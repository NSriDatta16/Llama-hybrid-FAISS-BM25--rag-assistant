Disclaimer The above answer is completely fine if the question is about the prior probability that $θ=1$ . While there is no indication whatsoever in the text of the question to the alternative, namely that the question is about the posterior probability that $θ=1$ , a recent exchange with students about a very similar question in my book, The Bayesian Choice (Exercise 5.9), leads me to propose the extension to the posterior setting. In this posterior case, when $X\sim \mathcal{E}(\theta)$ [for instance] the probability that $θ=1$ is \begin{align*} \mathbb{P}(\theta=1|x)&= \frac{e^{-x}}{e^{-x}+\int_0^\infty \theta e^{-\theta x} \pi_c(\theta)\text{d}\theta}\\ &=\frac{e^{-x}}{e^{-x}+ \int_0^\infty \theta e^{-\theta x} c^c \theta^{c-1}e^{-c \theta} \Gamma(c)^{-1}\text{d}\theta}\\ &=\frac{e^{-x}}{e^{-x}+c^c (c+x)^{-c-1} \Gamma(c+1)\Gamma(c)^{-1}}\\ &=\frac{e^{-x}}{e^{-x}+c^{c+1} (c+x)^{-c-1}}\\ &=\frac{e^{-x}}{e^{-x}+ (1+x/c)^{-c-1}}\\ \end{align*} which converges to $$\frac{e^{-x}}{e^{-x}+e^{-x}}=\frac{1}{2}$$ when $c$ goes to infinity.
