Time Series Analysis of two countries

I would like to perform a time series analysis on two countries. To be more precise, I would like to discuss the effect of an event in country 1 on country 2. I was thinking about using GDP growth or exports to analyse the effects. However, I am not sure if this will be sufficient. Furthermore, I am also wondering which statistical technique I could use in this case. A more concrete example would be: I want to determine the effect of a crisis in Argentina on Brazil. Let's say I determine this using the data on Foreign Direct Investment. I then want to research the effect of the crisis of 2001 in Argentina on the GDP of Brazil. What technique could I use?
