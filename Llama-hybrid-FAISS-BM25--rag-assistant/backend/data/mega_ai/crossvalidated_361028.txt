When to apply time series models?

When should I apply traditional time series models (e.g. additive, ARIMA) versus other models such as linear regression? For example, if I wanted to build a predictive model for website traffic, I could approach it with: Use previous traffic data + time series technique like exponential smoothing Collect other data features such as advertising spend, social media activity, email campaigns and run a linear regression model The former approach is more straight forward, faster to implement and likely to fit better compared to the latter. What disadvantages am I not taking into account here? The only thing I'm coming up with is that approach #2 will provide some insight into the weighting of the feature data (e.g. relationship between ad spend and traffic).
