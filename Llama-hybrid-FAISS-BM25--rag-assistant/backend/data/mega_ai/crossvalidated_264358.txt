how to specify a distribution for left skewed data?

I am doing bayesian analysis. Exploratory analysis shows the parameter might has a left skewed shape. So what kind of distribution should I used as prior distribution for this parameter? Any kind of transformation that will change the parameter to have a normal shape(please note the parameters have negative values)? # The question is simple: I plotted my data and it looks like the plot below. So what kind of distribution should I assume the data is coming from?
