HttpBrowserCapabilities.Crawler property .NET

How does the HttpBrowserCapabilities.Crawler property ( http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa332775(VS.71).aspx ) work? I need to detect a partner's custom crawler and this property is returning false. Where/How can I add his user agent so that this property will return true? Any other way outside of creating my own user agent detecting mechanism?
