Ah! I got it. Your files directory in internal memory is private by default and is not writable by external apps (e.g. Camera app is external app) Just create a new directory in writable mode in your application space (internal memory) and pass this URI to the camera Activity. And everything works fine. No need of external storage to be present at all. Tested and works fine.
