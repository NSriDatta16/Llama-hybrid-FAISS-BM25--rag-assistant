Poisson GLM with nonstationary data

My main goal is to model some count data. The dataset is a time series dataset that if I were to perform linear regression, I would difference to make sure the data became stationary. However, if I want to use Poisson GLM, would I still difference it or try to make stationary? My main concern is if I were to apply a transformation, I wouldn't be modeling counts anymore, rendering Poisson irrelevant. In addition, differencing can lead to negative values, and Poisson is only for positive values.
