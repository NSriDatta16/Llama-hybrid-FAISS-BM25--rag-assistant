After I read the source code , I find out that keras.datasets.imdb.load_data doesn't actually load the plain text data and convert them into vector, it just loads the vector which has been converted before. As for your problem, I assume you want to convert your job_description into vector. Maybe you can try sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer . I'm no expert on NLP, but I've encountered problems (e.g. Two Sigma Connect: Rental Listing Inquiries ) which need such technique. In the meanwhile, there are other word2vec/embedding techniques you may try. Here is a tutorial from keras which shows a detailed example on word embedding.
