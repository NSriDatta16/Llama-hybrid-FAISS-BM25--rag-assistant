Simulation of time series with R

I'm new on time series. I'm trying to solve an exercise on the simulation of an ARMA process. The problem is the following: Generate 100 simulations, each with n=60 elements of an ARMA(1,2) process with mean $\mu=1.25$ and parameters $\phi_1=-0.5$, $\theta_1=0.5$, $\theta_2=-0.7$ and $\sigma^2=0.5$ For each simulation estimate the mean and the first two correlation coefficients and find in how many simulations they are contained in the theoretical confidence intervals. Ok so, I think that for one simulation of the ARMA(1,2) I should do something like: x And this is one simulation, right? But then, for generate the other 99 simulation what should I do? Can I construct a kind of a loop? Thank you in advance ! Cheers
