What do the columns in Perl's Devel::Cover output mean?

In the "Perl build, unit testing, code coverage: A complete working example by Kurt W. Leucht" we see that we run build testcover and bet the coverage report. We see the result in the figure "File Cover". Can anyone tell what does the number shown under stmt, bran, sub and time indicate?
