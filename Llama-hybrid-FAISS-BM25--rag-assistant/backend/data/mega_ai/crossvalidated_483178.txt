Strictly speaking, the question is imprecise in that it does not specify the reference measure. If the reference measure is $\text{d}\mu(x)=e^{-x^2}\text{d}\lambda(x)$ where $\lambda$ is the Lebesgue measure, a posterior with a flat density is valid. Assuming however using a "flat prior" means having a constant density with respect to the Lebesgue measure, Thomas Lumley's answer clearly explains why Bayesian inference is impossible with such a "posterior". This is not a probability density and hence the posterior is simply not defined. There is no way to compute posterior expectations or even posterior probabilities since the posterior mass of the entire space in infinity. Any parameter space with an infinite volume cannot be inferred under a posterior like this. More generally any posterior integrating to infinity is not acceptable for Bayesian inference for the very same reason that this cannot be turned into a probability density. As a marginalia , and as discussed in an earlier X validated entry , the maximum entropy prior $$\arg_p \max \int p(x) \log p(x) \text{d}\lambda(x)$$ is defined in terms of a dominating measure $\text{d}\lambda$ . There is no absolute or unique measure of entropy in continuous spaces.
