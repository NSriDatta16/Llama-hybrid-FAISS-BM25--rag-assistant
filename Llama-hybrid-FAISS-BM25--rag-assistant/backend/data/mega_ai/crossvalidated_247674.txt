The answer will depend on how you interpret values coming from the same month. Independent Version What if every value is a sample spaced 10 days? Then your month indications are relatively meaningless. Crossing the month barrier does not matter and you should lump all of the data together independent of months. You've already done that in your first equation. Stratified Version Month matters here in some way to cause values to cluster together or it's in some way a meaningful grouping variable. In this case you might use your second calculation. What you're doing is averaging the values within a month together in order to get a better estimate for a particular month. It will likely reduce your between month variability and make your estimate not about the mean value per se but about the mean value expected for any month. Your Update A CI based on your final example will mean a different thing. Without multiple months the CI can't generalize across months and can only say something about January but not months in general. I will be a CI for January or Januaries. You could try to extrapolate it to other months but it wouldn't be as strong inferentially as either of the other CIs calculated using data from multiple months. As you keep developing examples and trying to test things remember that you need to think about interpretation and what things can mean as much as the calculations. (BTW, there are other ways to deal with the averaging more explicitly in multi-level modelling which you might want to read up on for more advanced data problems like this)
