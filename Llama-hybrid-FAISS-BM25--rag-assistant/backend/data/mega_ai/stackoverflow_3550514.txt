Others have indicated using SSL to secure the site. However, that is only one part of the puzzle. Kyle was close with the second, but didn't quite cut it. The answer is that every single transaction which is posted to your web service must contain some type of authorization key. That key can be pre-shared and baked into the application OR it can be acquired through some other means and set up as part of the application install / configuration process. Nearly all companies which provide web services online following this method. The idea is that regardless of the underlying protocol (ssl for example) you have to validate that the request is indeed coming from an authorized device / program. Some vendors have the users create a unique key for each user, some for each device, and others just 1 key for the entire organization. Regardless of how deep you take it there is in fact a key. The key usually isn't that large. It might be anywhere from 15 to 40 alphanumeric characters.
