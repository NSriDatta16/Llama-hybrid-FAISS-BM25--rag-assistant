Making reference to the comment that gives the numbers of participants and observations, that's a small sample by any standard... and not much to go with for modelling dependence, as would be required for using more than one observation (difference) per participant. The chi-squared test is discouraged because chances are that the sample is too small for the chi-squared approximation. The paired t-test is also questionable, the t-distribution may only be very roughly correct, the nature of the data is not quantitative, and another issue is that such a "before vs. after" comparison with Likert scaled data is affected by floor and ceiling effects, i.e., somebody who chooses "very much so" before the experiment cannot increase anymore. Unfortunately I don't think there are better alternatives that work for your sample size. If you can do without a significance test, that'd be better. (There are good reasons to think that significance tests are overused and chronically misinterpreted anyway.) The best thing you can do, in my opinion, is a good visualisation of the data, maybe a parallel coordinate plot that shown all data and how they belong together, with the possibility to show all participants for the first "before & after"-pair, and then for later pairs the plot will thin out. This also will show floor and ceiling effects clearly, and can be interpreted in an exploratory manner. If you have to do a test by all means, I'd probably use the first "before & after" pair for each participant only (as I'd think that if a test participant has gone through the experience before, this is essentially different from doing it for the first time; so later observations as well as the mean of all of them may not be comparable with those who have just one). Then I'd do a paired t-test and interpret it "exploratorily", explaining myself that there are various reasons for doubting its validity. However, one could still think of the differences as random numbers generated from a distribution for which the t-approximation of the distribution of the test statistics may roughly work. The p-value may be so clearly significant or insignificant that it adds something to a good visualistaion, however not much should be concluded from p=0.03 or so.
