Parametric vs non-parametric machine learning methods

I looked-up many references and websites and researched on how to determine if a method is between parametric or non-parametric. I came up with below definitions, A parametric algorithm has a fixed number of parameters. In contrast, a non-parametric algorithm uses a flexible number of parameters, and the number of parameters often grows as it learns from more data. From https://chemicalstatistician.wordpress.com/2014/01/14/machine-learning-lesson-of-the-day-parametric-vs-non-parametric-models/ . Moreover, I found, A parametric model, we have a finite number of parameters, and in nonparametric models, the number of parameters is (potentially) infinite. From https://sebastianraschka.com/faq/docs/parametric_vs_nonparametric.html . And many other methods of determination, though the problem is none of them can helo ones to determine if a certain hypothetical method is parametric or not. (For instance, why k-means' number of parameters are constant but KNN is variable or basically what do we call a parameter and what we do not?)
