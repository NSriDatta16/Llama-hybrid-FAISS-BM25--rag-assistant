You don't really need Struts to accomplish internationalization. You can use the JSTL formatting tags. You can use the fmt:bundle tag in your JSP to set the resource bundle to use. Basically a resource bundle is a collection of property files, one for each language that your application supports, that have a common base name. The fmt:message tag will print a message from the resource bundle based on a key. The last thing you need to do is to use the fmt:setLocale tag to actually set the locale (in other words, which of the resource files in the bundle to use) based on what language you want to display. A good place to start is here: http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/1.4/tutorial/doc/JSTL6.html
