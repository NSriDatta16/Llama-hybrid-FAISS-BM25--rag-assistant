safe_mode_exec_dir needs to be set to a filesystem path. It can also contain multiple paths separated by semicolon. However, note that safe mode is deprecated and will be removed in PHP 6 : This feature has been DEPRECATED as of PHP 5.3.0. Relying on this feature is highly discouraged. if you need added security in your PHP environment, there are better approaches like the Hardened PHP project 's Suhosin patch.
