We multiply because we use learned embeddings to convert the input tokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension d_model in the embedding layer. Refer Section 3.4 on Embeddings and Softmax of the original paper . You'd also see that an object of TokenEmbedding is used in Seq2SeqTransformer for source and target token embeddings.
