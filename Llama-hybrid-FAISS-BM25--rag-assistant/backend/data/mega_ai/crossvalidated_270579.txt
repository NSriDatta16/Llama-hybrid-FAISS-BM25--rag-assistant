Logistic regression coefficient in not-so-good classification result

I did a Logistic Regression (LR) on a 2-class problem (77.3% negative, 22.7% positive), and the results are as follow: $\text{logit} (p) = -2.0 + 1.4X_1 + 1.3X_2 + 0.2X_3 - 0.3X_4 - 0.7X_5$ The final model Likelihood Ratio Tests indicated the model is significantly better than the intercept-only model (Chi-square = 21.636, df=5, p = 0.001). The goodness-of-fit is also indicating the model is good. Pearson Chi-square = 12.777, df=12, p = 0.385 Deviance Chi-square = 16.007, df=12, p = 0.191 Pseudo R-Square Cox and Snell .033 Nagelkerke .050 McFadden .031 Everything seems ok, but my classification result is not so good. Basically, it classifies everything as negative (Model accuracy = 77.3% same as the baseline). My question is whether the estimated coefficient from this model is still any good considering its classification performance is not. I added the ROC of the positive class.
