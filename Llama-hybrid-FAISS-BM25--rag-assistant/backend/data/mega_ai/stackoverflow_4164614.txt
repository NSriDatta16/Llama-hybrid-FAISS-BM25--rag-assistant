extracting nouns,noun phrases,adjectives verbs from text file corpus using visual c#

i am doing a project wherein i have to extract nouns adjectives noun phrases and verbs from text files(.doc) format. i have a corpus of around 75 such files. i have accessed net to find about it and i came across POS tagging in python using nltk. as my project is in c# (using visual studio 2008) i need a code to do so. i have tried wordnet api for the same and even sharpnlp but as i am a newbie i found these tough to integrate with my project. can anybody please suggest me simpler code to do so using something like vocabulary etc. plz help me guys. thanx.
