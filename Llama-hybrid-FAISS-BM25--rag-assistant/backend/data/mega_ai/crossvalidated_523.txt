I don't think that supervised/unsupervised is the best way to think about it. For basic data mining, it's better to think about what you are trying to do. There are four main tasks: prediction. if you are predicting a real number, it is called regression. if you are predicting a whole number or class, it is called classification. modeling. modeling is the same as prediction, but the model is comprehensible by humans. Neural networks and support vector machines work great, but do not produce comprehensible models [1]. decision trees and classic linear regression are examples of easy-to-understand models. similarity. if you are trying to find natural groups of attributes, it is called factor analysis. if you are trying to find natural groups of observations, it is called clustering. association. it's much like correlation, but for enormous binary datasets. [1] Apparently Goldman Sachs created tons of great neural networks for prediction, but then no one understood them, so they had to write other programs to try to explain the neural networks.
