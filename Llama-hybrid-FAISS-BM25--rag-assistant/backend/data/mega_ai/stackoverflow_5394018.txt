Memory Allocation issue when modifying CreateToolbarEx function with new bitmap

I'm trying to modify some old code (c++) that uses the CreateToolbarEx function, in an attempt to use a new bitmap and replace our 24x24 pixel toolbar buttons with flashier 36x36 ones. The function I'm using is as follows: m_hToolbarWnd = CreateToolbarEx(m_hPagerWnd, ws, ID_TOOLBAR, NUMBERTOOLBARBITMAPS, hInst, IDB_TOOLBAR, tbInitButtons, m_ncButtons, 24, 24, 24, 24, sizeof(TBBUTTON)); I'm able to expand the size of the current toolbar buttons by changing the '24's to '36', but if I change IDB_TOOLBAR to the new toolbar bitmap and run the program I hit a memory access read violation pointing to the CreateToolbarEx function. Am I missing something on how the bitmap is getting its memory allocation or creating the individual buttons? The new toolbar is 1584x36 pixels (44 buttons).
