I didn't use RijndaelManaged but basicly encrypting passwords considered bad security practice. Instead it's better to keep their hashes. So the column size depends on the maximum password length and how your hash function works. If it produces unicode characters you need nvarchar column, if latin only - varchar will save half of the space in the storage.
