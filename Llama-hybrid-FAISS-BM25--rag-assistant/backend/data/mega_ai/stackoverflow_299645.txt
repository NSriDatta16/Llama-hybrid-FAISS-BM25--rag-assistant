WPF: How to combine animations with custom event handling?

I'm trying to create a custom WPF control that is draggable, but I also need to animate it as it is dragged. I need to override OnMouseDown to implement the dragging functionality, but I also want my animation triggered on the MouseDown event. Without dragging functionality--i.e., when OnMouseDown is not overriden--the animation works, but when I override OnMouseDown to implement the dragging functionality, the animation stops working. What's the trick here? Thanks!
