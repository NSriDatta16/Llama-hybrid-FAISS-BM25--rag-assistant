If the number of your source integers i is relatively high (so that a direct search becomes inefficient) but still manageable, you can relatively easily build a perfect hash function hash(i) for your input integers (using Pearson hashing , for example) and then use the hashed value as the entry into the output table map output = map[hash(i)]; Of course, if the range of the input values is relatively small, you can use the identity function in place of hash and just turn the whole thing into a straghforward remapping output = map[i]; (although if that was the case you wouldn't probably even ask.)
