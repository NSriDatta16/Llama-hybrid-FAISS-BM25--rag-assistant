I'm right there with Robert. I'm not sure that CSS has the ability to make things that dynamic. In which case the solution is Javascript or as proposed (and much more simple) jquery. I could be mistaken, but I think in order for javascript (possibly jquery as well) to pinpoint exactly what you want to be able to do anything to, you need to use the 'id' attribute. Then when you use the jquery functions, you can apply the drag quality to "window_main". Hope that helps. Good luck!
