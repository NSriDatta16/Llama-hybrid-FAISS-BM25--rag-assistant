Isolation forest sklearn contamination param

I am working on an unsupervised anomaly detection task on time series data using an isolation forest algorithm. I am developing it in Python, more in detail using scikit-learn . I found a lot of examples on this, but what is not very clear, is how to set the contamination parameter during the instantiation of IsolationForest. Looking at the documentation , contamination is the amount of contamination of the data set, i.e. the proportion of outliers in the data set. Should I use some statistical techniques to identify this percentage?
