Your use case is basically why I created the ability to add extra frames to Flex SWFs that are treated as late-loaded modules. Instead of embedding your level, stream it in after the main application. Documentation on -frame is sparse. Sorry! Here's some external stuff, that links back to stuff I wrote and Alex Harui wrote. Good luck! http://www.richinternet.de/blog/index.cfm?entry=FF295F89-DAD8-CCDC-960413842BC0D478
