Logistic regression: what happens to the coefficients when we switch the labels (0/1) of the binary outcome

How to interpret the coefficients of logistic regression? To be more specific, I have a set of independent variables, and one dependant variable (let it be "rain" or "no rain" expressed as 1 and 0 respectively) I build my logistic regression model and I want get an insight about the relations between my inputs and outputs, and see what are the most influential variables in the model. To do this I resort to the model coefficients: Variable Coeff P-Value x1_0 0.63914 1.27e-11 *** X2_0 0.59451 2e-16 *** X3_0 -0.38567 1.16e-08 *** X4_0 -0.58933 6.23e-05 *** X5_0 -0.01629 0.775 My question now is are these coefficients refer to the "rain" or to the "no rain" in my output? In the book "Practical Data Science with R" in chapter 7, it says: "Negative coefficients that are statistically significant correspond to variables that are negatively correlated to the odds (and hence to the probability) of a positive outcome (the baby being at risk). Positive coefficients that are statistically significant are positively correlated to the odds of a positive outcome." Does the positive outcome here refer to the "rain" in my output variable?
