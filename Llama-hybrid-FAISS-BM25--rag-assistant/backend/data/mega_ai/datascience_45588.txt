Project structure - many projects share same large dataset

I have a bunch of projects for my job that are largely unrelated except they use the same data, which is pretty big on disk in csv format. I want these to exist separately from each other and I usually try to use the cookie cutter data science model for project structure, and keep all my data in a data folder in the root of the project. But because this dataset is big, I don't want to have ten copies of it in the root of these ten projects. I also don't want to put them in one big project sharing it because I feel like they don't belong together. What's the best way to structure multiple different projects that all share the same large dataset?
