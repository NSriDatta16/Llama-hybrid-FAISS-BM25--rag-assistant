Dynamic READ ...RECORD INVALID KEY not working properly in COBOL. How to fix it?

A Cobol program with file-control like so: SELECT D-FLAT-FILE ASSIGN TO DFLAT-FILE ORGANIZATION IS INDEXED ACCESS MODE IS SEQUENTIAL FILE STATUS IS RECORD-STAT RECORD KEY IS D_KEY OF D-FLAT-FILE DESCENDING WITH DUPLICATES. SELECT C-MAST-FILE ASSIGN TO CMAST-FILE ORGANIZATION IS INDEXED ACCESS MODE IS DYNAMIC FILE STATUS IS RECORD-STAT RECORD KEY IS C_KEY OF C-MAST-FILE. reads a record from the first flat file like so: PROCESSING. READ D-FLAT-FILE NEXT RECORD AT END ....END READ. and reads a record on the second DYNAMIC file like so: READ C-MAST-FILE RECORD INVALID KEY GO TO PROCESSING. All works well except for 1 case. If the 1st record from the 1st flat file does not match any records on the 2nd dynamic file, the program goes into an infinite loop instead of doing GO TO PROCESSING. I checked the manuals, all as per manual (it is the VAX Cobol). What am I missing?
