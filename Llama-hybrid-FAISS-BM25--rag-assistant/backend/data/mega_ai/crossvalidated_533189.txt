According to this post on the SAS forums, the different values reflect the difference between dividing by the number of observations $n$ and dividing by the degrees of freedom $n - p$ . Average square error is computed as $$\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}{n}$$ Mean square error is computed as $$\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}{n-p}$$
