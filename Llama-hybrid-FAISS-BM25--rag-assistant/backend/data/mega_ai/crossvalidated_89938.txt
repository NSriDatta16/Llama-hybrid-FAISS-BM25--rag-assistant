Kernel logistic regression (KLR) refers to using logistic regression into a kernel induced feature space, as is more common in support vector machines (SVM). By working in a feature space, kernel methods (including KLR) can be used to model nonlinear relationships. KLR is less popular than SVM because it's much slower to train models and typically does not offer better predictive performance. Stepwise (logistic) regression refers to an implicit feature selection mechanism baked into the regression modeling process. Stepwise procedures are a controversial issue: the feature selection works well in some situations but with statistical issues that need to be addressed (poor estimates of model uncertainty). Because of this, stepwise regression is sometimes used as an example of data dredging. Forward, backward and bidirectional elimination or different approaches used in stepwise regression.
