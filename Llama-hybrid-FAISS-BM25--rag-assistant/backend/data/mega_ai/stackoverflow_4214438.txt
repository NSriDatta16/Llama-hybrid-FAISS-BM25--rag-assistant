MYSQL 5.0 introdcue Archive Storage Engine , I believe that answer most your question Should I add an index to the table - yes, if your want to perform search Will it recreate the index after every insert - is handle internally by mysql worth it - depends, adding index will slow-down database write operation a bit (depending how many index and record length) Or is there a better way to speed up my analytic queries - if you just want to perform simple calculation, you can consider split the data daily (each table to hold a logging for each day). Or you can prepare some sort of query cache warm-up script
