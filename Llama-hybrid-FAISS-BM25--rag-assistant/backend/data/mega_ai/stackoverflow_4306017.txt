Xml.Serialization, Correct way to append

For my windows 7 phone application i serialize my object and save it to items.xml . Now when i want to add more items to my items.xml i have a problem co's the writer.WriteEndElement(); has already been written. now what i can do is read all the items that are in items.xml save it in a list and then overwrite the current items.xml tough this puts heavy usage on the phone so i doubt its the correct way but is there any decent work around for this and thus decently append the file ? thanks ! using (var isfs = new IsolatedStorageFileStream(@"items.xml", FileMode.Append, store)) { XmlWriterSettings settings = new XmlWriterSettings(); settings.Indent = true; using (var writer = XmlWriter.Create(isfs, settings)) { writer.WriteStartElement("ToDoItem"); item.WriteXml(writer); writer.WriteEndElement(); writer.Close(); } } Misc. [XmlRoot("ToDoItem")] public class ToDoItem : IXmlSerializable{ ... }
