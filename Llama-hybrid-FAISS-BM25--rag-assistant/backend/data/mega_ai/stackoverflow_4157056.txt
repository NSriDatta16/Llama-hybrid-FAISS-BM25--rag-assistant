Best approach to create a "settings" dialog page in iPhone

I need to present the user with a screen with controls (i.e. a dialog). It will display some labels and different types of controls so that the user can do some configuration: select a color (custom color picker) select a line width (slider) select one value from a list of values (UISegmentedControl?) enable / disable one option (On/Off) ... I am evaluating different alternatives: Create the layout with labels and controls in InterfaceBuilder Use a UITableView , so that each cell contains a label and its control I like option 2 because it is similar to iPhone Settings app, and it makes the screen look organized, giving you sections, scroll..., but it is a real pain to create in code all different cell layouts, taking into account each row heights... The solution has to be easiliy maintainable, allowing easy reuse of code, DRY (low repetition), data-driven... Is there a recommended or standard aproach to do this?
