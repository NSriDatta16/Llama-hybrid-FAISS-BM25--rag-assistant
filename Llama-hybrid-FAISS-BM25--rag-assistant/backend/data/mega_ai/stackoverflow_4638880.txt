According to adobe you do need to embed font characters twice for classic text and for TLF. You must create separate embedded font symbols for use in TLF and Classic text containers. The TLF (DF4) outline format is not available for PostScript Type 1 fonts. TLF (DF4) requires Flash Player version 10 or later. Flash CS5 Help You don't need TLF to rotate or transform text. You only need to embed your font. Flash CS5 does that automatically if you apply some transform to your textfield, but you might need to specify other characters because it only embeds the ones that are in your textfield. Using TLF will increase .swf size. Embedding entire fonts will too. Don't use TLF unless you really need to and embed only the characters you need.
