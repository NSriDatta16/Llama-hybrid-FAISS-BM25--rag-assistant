XSL Template outputting massive chunk of text, rather than HTML. But only on one section

I'm having a slightly odd situation with an XSL template. Most of it outputs fine, but a certain for-each loop is causing me problems. Here's the XML: And here's the section of my template that processes it: And here's the output: Hall Communal gardens, pathway leading to PVCu double glazed communal front door to Communal Entrance Hall Plain ceiling, centre light fitting, fire door through to inner hallway, wood and glazed panelled front door to Inner Hall Plain ceiling with pendant light fitting and covings, security telephone, airing cupboard housing gas boiler serving domestic hot water and central heating, telephone point, storage cupboard housing gas and electric meters, wooden panelled doors off to all rooms.

For reference, here's the entire XSLT: http://pastie.org/private/eq4gjvqoc1amg9ynyf6wzg EDIT: And here's the full XML: http://pastie.org/private/upu3g9rstw8pilemtaq The rest of it all outputs fine - what am I missing from the above section?
