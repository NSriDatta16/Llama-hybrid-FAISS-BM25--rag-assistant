Update : Twitter added listed_count to the user payload. It looks like adding lists_count to the user payload is on the todo list . We've got this on our todo list. It requires fairly extensive asynchronous fragment invalidation so it's not as simple as just adding the count into the payload. We've got it on the list though. Meanwhile, Darrel's suggestion was the only direct approach, but succinctness of a language and its libraries do matter: require 'rubygems' require 'nokogiri' require 'open-uri' username = "twitterapi" page = Nokogiri::HTML(open("http://twitter.com/#{username}")) page.at_css("#lists_count").text.gsub(/\D/, "").to_i # => 1299
