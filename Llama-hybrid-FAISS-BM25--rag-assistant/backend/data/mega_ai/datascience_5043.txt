First, it sounds like your choice of model selection is a problem here. Your outputs are binary-valued, not continuous. Specifically you may have a classification problem on your hands rather than a traditional regression problem. My first recommendation would be to try a simple classification approach such as logistic regression or linear discriminant analysis. Regarding your suspicions of bad data , what would bad data look like in this situation? Do you have reason to suspect that your $X$ values are noisy or that your $y$ values are mislabeled? It is also possible that there is not a strong relationship between any of your features and your targets. Since your targets are binary, you should look at histograms of each of your features to get a rough sense of the class conditional distributions, i.e. $p(X_1|y=1)$ vs $p(X_1|y=0)$. In general though, you will need to be more specific about what "bad data" means to you.
