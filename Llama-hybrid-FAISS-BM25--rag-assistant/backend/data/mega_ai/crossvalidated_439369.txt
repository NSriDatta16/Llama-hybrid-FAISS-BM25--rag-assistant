...example where, with an improper prior, the Bayesian estimator equals the maximum likelihood estimator... There is a fundamental issue with this property, namely that it depends on the parameterisation of the sampling model. Indeed, if $$\hat\theta^\text{MAP}=\arg\max_\theta L(\theta|x)\pi(\theta)=\arg\max_\theta L(\theta|x)=\hat\theta^\text{MLE}\tag{1}$$ consider the change of parameterisation $\eta=h(\theta)$ , where $h$ is a bijection. Then the prior on $\eta$ is $$\tilde\pi(\eta)=\pi(h^{-1}(\eta))\ \underbrace{\left|\dfrac{\text{d}h^{-1}(\eta)}{\text{d}\eta}\right|}_\text{Jacobian}$$ and there is no reason for $$\hat\eta^\text{MAP}=\arg\max_\eta L(\eta|x)\tilde\pi(\eta)=\arg\max_\eta L(\eta|x)=\hat\eta^\text{MLE}$$ to hold, even though $$\hat\eta^\text{MLE}=h(\hat\theta^\text{MLE})$$ because of the Jacobian. MAP estimators are not invariant by reparameterisation. As an additional remark, that a particular prior leads to this (dubious) identity is not one of the definitions ( here , there , or there ) of non-informative priors, since, for one thing, being non-informative is a property that depends on both the data (I assume (1) holds for a particular $x$ ) and the parameterisation. Furthermore, improper priors should not be assimilated to non-informative priors.
