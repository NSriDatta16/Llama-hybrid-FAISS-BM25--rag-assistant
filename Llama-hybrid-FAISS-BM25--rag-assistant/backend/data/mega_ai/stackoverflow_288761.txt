Rich interaction in Java/JSP web app

I'm writing a website in JSP using Struts and Hibernate. I'm looking for a way to implement a rich UI where you can have more than just buttons. For examples, drag and drops, drop down lists that updates itself in real time as you type more letters out etc. Is there a way to use something like Swing with Struts and Hibernate? Or are there any other options available for making a rich UI?? (I'm open to abandon Struts and/or Hibernate if there are better alternatives) Fundamental problem: The organization I work for have strict rules about what development tools and open source libraries we can or cannot use, and is pretty slow on updating their approval list. None of the AJAX things (e.g. GWT, dojo) are on the list yet. Thank you for taking the time to read this post!
