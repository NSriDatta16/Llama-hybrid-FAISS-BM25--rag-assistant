Given the constraints I think you won't have many options. A good starting point would be to equal the alignments and control distances to increase overall symmetry with the ultimate goal to reduce visual clutter . Examples: The group boxes "Special" and "Running options" should have equal height. The distances between the four buttons "Save settings" and "Exit" should be equal. All buttons should have the same height, if possible avoid word wrapping. Use the same height for all single-line edit boxes. The quota label and its text field should be at the same baseline. The distance between a group box caption and its first control should be equal (compare "Running options" to "Retrieval options") Increase the distance between the controls in general, i.e. make the form look less dense. Content fixes: Use the same captions/names for the same things. For example, you use "Append to l ogfile" but "Overwrite L ogfile Use the same character case, sometimes it's " O nly the first one", " E very S ingle W ord" and sometimes "it is C amel-cased". Decide on one scheme and use it consequently ( Sentence case and Title case are the most common) Don't try to be cool, "Go 2 background" doesn't look very professional. Avoid controls with unreadable shortcuts or no content at all. It doesn't help if the user has to stop on every control and think: "What does this thing do?" Some more radical/controversal changes: Try making the group boxes more symmetric, possibly be re-positioning them and use the same height. If necessary use two columns of checkboxes, that would still look better than uneven group boxes. Unless it's absolutly necessary, remove the horizontal scroll bars from the two multiline edit boxes Get rid of the "Clear" buttons. For the list box on the buttom left you have to provide some other way to delete items, perhaps make this into a multine text box, too. Try replacing the checkbox collection with a checkable list box or a property grid. A rule of thumb: Imagine the lines of the bounding box of each control lengthed until it reaches the form boundary. The less different lines reach the boundary, the better. (Because correctly aligned controls produce more incident (-> less unique visible) lines) On the use of colors and icons: Simply adding icons and colors doesn't solve the fundamental problems such forms have. They all suffer from being overloaded with controls and adding even more only worsens the problem, because they just add more visual noise, but don't provide any more visual cues.
