In both cases 12 appears when approximating the distribution of the test statistic with a normal and chi-square respectively because the statistic must first be written in a standardized form (if you were performing a permutation test these constants would be unnecessary). With continuous data, the ranks from $1$ to $n$ are used, and the variance of a randomly chosen value from $(1,2,3,...,n)$ is $(n^2-1)/12$ . [Consider that the expectation of a randomly chosen rank from $1$ to $n$ is $(n+1)/2$ and the expected value of the square of a randomly chosen rank is $n(n+1)(2n+1)/(6n)$ ; the variance of a randomly chosen rank is therefore $(n+1)(n-1)/12$ . Similarly, the covariance of two randomly selected values (chosen without replacement) from $(1,2,3,...,n)$ is $-(n+1)/12$ .] As a result the variance of either the sum or the average of $m$ randomly chosen ranks from $(1,2,3,...,n)$ will have $12$ in it. There's no "inversion" of the 12 differently in either formula - in both cases there's a denominator term involving a function of (something/12). If you divide by something/12 that's the same as multiplying by 12/something. So in the Kruskal-Wallis we see it simplified to be written that "12/something" way. In the Wilcoxon rank sum test when you're using the normal approximation you divide by the square root of the variance, so there's a $\sqrt{}$ (something/12) in the denominator; it could as easily be written as $\times \sqrt{}$ (12/something). For similar reasons (at heart, because an expected squared rank involves $\sum_{i=1}^n i^2$ ), either 12 or 6 (or sometimes a 24) appears in formulas related to many other rank-based statistics.
