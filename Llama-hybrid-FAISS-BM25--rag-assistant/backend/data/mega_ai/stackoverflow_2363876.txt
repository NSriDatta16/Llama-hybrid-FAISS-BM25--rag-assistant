iPhone: View that is a Property Fails to Appear after Adding a @synthesize Directive for the Property

I have a mainwindow.xib which has a tabbar controller. The first tab bar has a view, that loads from "View1.xib". In my View1.xib, I drag the UI element on it. It has this in .h: #import @class View1Controller; @interface View1Controller : UIViewController { IBOutlet UIView *view; IBOutlet UIButton *startButton; } @property (retain, nonatomic) UIView *view; @property (retain, nonatomic) UIButton *startButton; -(IBAction)startClock:(id)sender; @end In .m file, I do nothing. It will behave normally. I can see the view and its button. But after I add : @synthesize view, startButton; When I load the application, it shows a blank view with no button but produces no errors. What is happening?
