How Do I Track and Eliminate Session Abuse?

I'm pretty sure that there have been developers in the past that have severely abused our poor friend ASP.NET session state. Session would love to help track things between requests, but can only do so much! Please help me ease its pain so that it can work with us happily ever after. Does anyone know of a tool that can monitor session sizes across multiple in memory sessions? We currently have IP affinity turned on at the load ballancer because the sessions are so big people want to keep them in memory. I want to be able to monitor both average session size as well as individual sessions, which applications have been accessing them, and what is being stored in the session. This heartess, inconsiderate abuse of session state must stop now. Together, we can find an answer.
