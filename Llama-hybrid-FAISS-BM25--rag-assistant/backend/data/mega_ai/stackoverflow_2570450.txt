Read a local file

Is there no way for javascript hosted on a webserver to read a file on a client's local machine? (this has obvious security risks). I guess I'm wondering if there's any access granting a user can do, like drag and dropping a file into the browser, or explicitly selecting a file from a popup to get around this? I know flash 10 allows reading of a local file, just wondering if there were any method to do this in javascript. Thanks
