Use any regression analysis program. Organize your data into two columns, one for x and one for y. You probably also want to include a third column that denotes the column of y that each value came from. For each value of x you will have several rows, one for each observed y. Estimate a model using a polynomial, probably in x and x^2. If you want a regression for specific subsets of the original y columns then restrict your analysis to those cases.
