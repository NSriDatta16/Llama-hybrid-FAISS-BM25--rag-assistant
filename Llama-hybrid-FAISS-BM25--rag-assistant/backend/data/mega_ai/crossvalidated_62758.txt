Reverse scoring when question is stated in a negative fashion

In my survey, I had a question that asked respondents why they did NOT engage in a particular behavior (x). Some of the answers were stated in a positive way, such as "because of age" while some were stated in a negative way "I did NOT know how to do x". I am trying to reverse code because I am using these statements in a factor analysis and I would like the means that I compute to make sense (so that higher values indicate higher agreement with a positively stated statement). The problem is that when I run Cronbach's alpha test, the values I get make sense when I do NOT reverse code and they are negative when I DO reverse code. I am wondering if it is because my question was stated in a negative way to start with ("why did you not engage in x behavior?")? Myself and my supervisor feel that in this case it doesn't really make sense to reverse code, but I'm wondering how that will affect the means that I calculate? I will be using these means subsequently in a logistic regression.
