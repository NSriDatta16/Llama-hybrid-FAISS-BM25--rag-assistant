It appears that Case 4 is a case of "perfect separation" - i.e. each gene position is uniquely related to one of the two specimen categories. If this is correct, then this is a known problem with categorical variables. Look up these CV post How to deal with perfect separation in logistic regression? and Seeking a Theoretical Understanding of Firth Logistic Regression but there are also others. Also, a search on the web will provide many links and references.
