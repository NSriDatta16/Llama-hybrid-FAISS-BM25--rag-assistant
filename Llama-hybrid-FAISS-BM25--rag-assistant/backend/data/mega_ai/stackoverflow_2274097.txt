migrating emails from imap to exchange 2010 using c#

I've been given the task of writing a small application to help migrate over 400GB of emails sitting in a public folder structure on a linux IMAP server, to a MS Exchange 2010 Public folders. I've looked at drag and drop with outlook, but there is a problem. Outlook caches all the email locally to a pst file before pushing to Exchange. Currently the limit for these files is 20GB. Now not being a strong developer in C#, is there a way to use outlook as a connector to both the imap server and exchange and then use C# to walk the folder structure and copy the emails?? What is important is that we don't loose any of the original email header/source data. I know that the only way to talk to public folders in Exchange 2010 is using the Exchange Web services, however from examples I have seen this may change the email source. I am hoping that outlook will help preseve this data and using the mapi interface negate the need to do these web service calls. Although I have said that I am using C# I am willing to write this in another language (java, perl, php etc), I just need to come up with something that will help with my problem. Can anyone in the SO community give me any pointers to help with this problem or point me in the right direction?? Many thanks, Grant
