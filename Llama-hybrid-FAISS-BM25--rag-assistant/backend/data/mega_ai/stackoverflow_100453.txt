You need two tables. One for storing the repeating events (table repeatevent) and one for storing the events (table event). Simple entries are only stored in the event table. Repeating entries are stored in the repeatevent table and all single entries for the repeating event are also stored in the event table. This means that everytime you enter a repeating entry, you have to enter all the single resulting entries. You can do this by using triggers, or as part of your business logic. The advantage of this approach is, that querying events is simple. They are all in the event table. Without the storage of repeating events in the event table, you would have complex SQL or business logic that would make your system slow. create table repeatevent ( id int not null auto_increment, type int, // 0: daily, 1:weekly, 2: monthly, .... starttime datetime not null, // starttime of the first event of the repetition endtime datetime, // endtime of the first event of the repetition allday int, // 0: no, 1: yes until datetime, // endtime of the last event of the repetition description varchar(30) ) create table event ( id int not null auto_increment, repeatevent null references repeatevent, // filled if created as part of a repeating event starttime datetime not null, endtime datetime, allday int, description varchar(30) )
