WPF: Cannot see my custom control in the toolbox

I have created 2 WPF control which reside in the same folder and i want to add one control to the other. The controls are added in a Win Forms project. the thing is that in a custom Win Forms control I can see my two WPF controls in the toolbox but in the WPF designer I cannot see any WPF controls. Any ideas why? And how can I add my control is XAML without dragging from the toolbox I tried with But that doesn't work with the type "my2:MyControlName" doesn not exist
