Does the mse loss equal the L2 loss in an autoencoder?

I have been trying to implement an variational autoencoder on a texture dataset. For that I used the VAE example given by Keras as a base and changed the layers to my liking. Since the example uses binary crossentropy loss I wanted to change it to the L2 loss because a Paper regarding a texture autoencoder suggested so. I have searched how to implement the L2 loss, but did not quite find a clear answer. Is the mse loss equal to the L2 loss in the context of the variational autoencoder?
