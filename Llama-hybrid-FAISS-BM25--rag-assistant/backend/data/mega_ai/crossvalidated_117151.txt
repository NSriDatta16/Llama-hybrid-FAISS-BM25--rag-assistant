Multivariate stats

I have the following data to analyse and not sure what the best method would be. I have percent coverage data for several invasive plant species. as well as several variables including different land uses and road types from where these species have been sampled. What multivariate method would be best to analyse this simultaneously? Also, do I need to do it separately for each species? Thanks
