No matter which scripting language you choose (and I would probably vote for Python), you might consider using SWIG (www.swig.org) to ease the burden of interfacing to C++. While normally used to build C++ extensions for python (or ruby, lua, guile, any many others), it can be used to aid in embedding too. You had mentioned boost::python, which is certainly a full featured option, and allows for a somewhat closer Python/C++ integration (especially where virtual functions are involved). However, in my experience, SWIG is a lot easier to integrate, works with scads of scripting languages, and for python, is natively supported by Python's distutils.
