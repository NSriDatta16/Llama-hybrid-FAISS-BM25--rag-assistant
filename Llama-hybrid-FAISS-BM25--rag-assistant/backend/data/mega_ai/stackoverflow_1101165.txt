PHP/MySQL - an array filter for bots

I'm making a hit counter. I have a database and I store the IP and $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT']; of the visitors. Now I need to add a filter, so I can put away the hits, that are made by bots. I found out, that many bots usually keep some common words in the $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT']; , so I's like to make and array of words, that would keep the bot from displaying in the results. Here is what I have now: while($row = mysql_fetch_array($yesterday, MYSQL_ASSOC)) { } Also if you know any other way of detecting and removing the bots from the results, I'd be verry thankful. Cheers
