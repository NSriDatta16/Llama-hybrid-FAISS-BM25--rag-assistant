I used it as a low-rent near line storage system on a machine with OpenSolaris installed on it. I had it on a basic mirrored RAID system with 30 days worth of snapshots. On more than one occasion it saved my bacon and that was on a very basic setup. I can only imagine how much you could do with it on more serious/capable hardware.
