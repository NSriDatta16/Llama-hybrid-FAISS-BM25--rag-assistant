This is clearly problematic output. But it is also problematic text. In a logistic regression you should have one dependent variable and one or more independent variables, not the other way 'round. Assuming this was a typo, and you really do have just one DV, then this looks like colinearity. But if, at step 1, there is only one IV, you can't have colinearity, which requires more IVs. If you have one IV and one DV and the IV is never 0 when the IV is 1 (or something like that, it's hard to tell) then you would get an OR of 0 or infinity; you didn't get infinity, but that could be some computational error. You shouldn't do a regression like this. Please clear up the above confusions. Showing your code and a sample of your data would help.
