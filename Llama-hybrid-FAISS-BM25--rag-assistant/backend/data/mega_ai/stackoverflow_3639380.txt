Use Nokogiri to get all nodes in an element that contain a specific attribute name

I'd like to use Nokogiri to extract all nodes in an element that contain a specific attribute name. e.g., I'd like to find the 2 nodes that contain the attribute "blah" in the document below. @doc = Nokogiri::HTML::DocumentFragment.parse Three's Company A love triangle. test test test EOHTML I found this suggestion (below) at this website: http://snippets.dzone.com/posts/show/7994 , but it doesn't return the 2 nodes in the example above. It returns an empty array. # get elements with attribute: elements = @doc.xpath("//*[@*[blah]]") Thoughts on how to do this? Thanks! I found this here
