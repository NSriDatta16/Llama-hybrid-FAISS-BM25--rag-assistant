The only editor I know of that has syntax highlighting and a fallback to a textarea is Mozilla Bespin . Google around for embedding Bespin to see how to embed the editor. The only site I know of that uses this right now is the very alpha Mozilla Jetpack Gallery (in the submit a Jetpack page) and you may want to see how they include it. There's also a blog post on embedding and reusing the Bespin editor that may help you.
