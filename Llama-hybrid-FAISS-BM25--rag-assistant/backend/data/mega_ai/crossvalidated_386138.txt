What is the relationship between an average of correlations and a correlation for an average of the same variables?

I have variables $A, B, C,$ and $X.$ It is common to calculate $r_{AX},$ $r_{BX},$ and $r_{CX}$ correlations; however, sometimes the variables A, B, and C are averaged into one variable, $\operatorname{Av}(A,B,C).$ My question is whether the average of the three correlations, $r_{AX},$ $r_{BX},$ and $r_{CX},$ $\operatorname{Av}(r_{AX},r_{BX},r_{CX}),$ is the same as the correlation between the averaged $\operatorname{Av}(A,B,C)$ and $X,$ $r_{\operatorname{Av}(A,B,C)X}.$ Edit after comments: When I calculate these with my data, the average of correlations (using the Fisher transformations) is lower than the correlation for the average. $r_{AX}$ = .472 $r_{BX}$ = .556 $r_{CX}$ = .573 $\operatorname{Av}(r_{AX},r_{BX},r_{CX})$ = .535 $r_{\operatorname{Av}(A,B,C)X}$ = .619 Is it possible to calculate one from the other without knowing the individual variables or their correlations? If no, is this relationship reliable, that the average of correlations is always lower than the correlation for the average? Edit2: I see that I still wrote down the wrong question. The point is: is there a general rule about their relationship? In a realistic case without specifically designed extremes, e.g. data from validated questionnaires with a response range from 0 to 5, I imagine that the two results are somewhat close to each other most of the time. What I wanted to know is what, if anything, can I infer about the one result if I only have the other.
