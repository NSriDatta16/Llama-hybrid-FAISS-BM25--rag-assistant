First, 12 is an int . Since you didn't specify a type, the compiler assumes int , just as it assumes double when you don't specify a type for 2.5. The assignment long x = 12; compiles just fine because there is no loss of precision when the compiler implicitly upcasts the literal int value 12 to a long . I always try to use uppercase type specifiers like 2.5F and 12L, simply because they're easier to read. 1 and l look much the same in the monospaced font that I prefer.
