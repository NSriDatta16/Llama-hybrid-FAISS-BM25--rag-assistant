rails3, gridfs and mongomapper: how to serve files? send_data?

i am currently developing a rails3 app with mongomapper and file storage in gridfs. after some trying around, i found grip and currently also use it in the app for storing the data. so far, so good - now i am trying to get my head around serving the files to the user -- what would be the best/fastest way to achieve that? from: http://railstips.org/blog/archives/2009/12/23/getting-a-grip-on-gridfs/ there seem to be 2 ways: send_data from ruby/rails - is this a recommended way? fast enough? (i want to use passenger in the deploy setup) writing a rails metal (see http://gist.github.com/264077 ) - any comments or hints on how to use that with rails3? any other ideas or even examples? thanks a lot!
