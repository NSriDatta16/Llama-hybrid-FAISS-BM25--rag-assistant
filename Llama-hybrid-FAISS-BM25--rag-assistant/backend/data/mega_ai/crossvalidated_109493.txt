Analyzing regression results

I have done a regression model where i determine the number of cubes (independent variable) based on the amount of units i started with for each product type (dependent variables, X1, X2, X3, X4, X6, X9, X10, X15 ). But i would like a second opinion on the results, because the tests for heteroscedasticity i did (Breusch-Pagan and white test) suggests my data has heteroscedasticity. But i think it is because i have alot of data (500 000 observations). Looking at the graphs below i don't seem to pick up much heteroscedasticity, although there do seem to be outliers in my data. But i would like to have a second opinion and want to know does my results look fine so that i can use this regression model and can assume (1) my residuals close enough to a normal distribution and (2) there is little sign of heteroscedasticity?
