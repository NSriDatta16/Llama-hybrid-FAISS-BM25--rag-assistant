Sql server 2005 needs daily index defrag

Our production database needs daily index defragmentation on one of its tables. The table has several indexes and one of them will get to 90% fragmentation each day. The index is on two date fields ( a start time and an end time). We do not get this problem on our development database although this obviously has a much lower throughput. Each night we have a maintenance task scheduled to do a defrag but this sometimes needs to be run during office hours. The table currently has 250,000 records and grows by about 500 to 3000 records a day. Any ideas on why it is getting fragmented so quickly?
