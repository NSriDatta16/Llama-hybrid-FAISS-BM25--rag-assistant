You can use Pages and navwindow if you like. This can still encompass a MVVM pattern as the Views may be loaded as pages if needed. To start your project create one window xaml document and change the Window tag to a Navigation Window tag ShowsNavigationUI="False" Then within each page you can control the navigation or loading of new pages using NavigationService NavigationService.Navigate(newUri("mynewpage.xaml", UriKind.Relative)); If logging is not of any value for you in page navigation you can disable this in code if you need. ps- If you are looking for MDI WPF/win-32 does not really support MDI (Multi-document interfaces) like Delphi so for times when you need to create a MDI appearance you can use TabView controls or rely more on a pattern development MVVM which provides a more elegant means to load and pass different UI controls.
