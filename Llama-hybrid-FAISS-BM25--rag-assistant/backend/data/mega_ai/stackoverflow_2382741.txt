Slow Performance -- ASP .NET ASPNET_WP.EXE and CSC.EXE Running After Clicking Redirect Link

I click on a link from one page that does a redirect to another page (Response.Redirect(page.aspx)). The browser churns for about 30 seconds and the page displays. I'm trying to track down why it takes so long to load the page. The page hosts two other custom controls. I have commented out the lines of code for each and both controls, and the page still takes about 30 seconds to load. I've set breakpoints on the Page_Load event for each of the controls as well as page.aspx and it also takes about 30 seconds from clicking the link with the Response.Redirect to the first break point. I loaded up task manager and clicked on the link. I notice aspnet_wp.exe and csc.exe run during this 30 second time frame. I'm wondering if there are some sort of code-behind shinanigans going on while I'm waiting for the page to load. This only occurs the first time I click on the link. Afterwards, it's not as slow. I've googled but there's not a lot of useful information about this. Anyone have any ideas? Thanks, ---Dan---
