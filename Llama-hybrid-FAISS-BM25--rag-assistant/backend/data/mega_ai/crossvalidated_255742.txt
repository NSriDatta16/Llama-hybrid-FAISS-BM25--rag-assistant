Generally speaking, as others have said, the further out your forecast the more likely your prediction errors will increase. With 2 years of data, I would not trust either. As far as your approach, you're essentially using a seasonal naive approach that averages the past 2 corresponding weeks of the previous seasons. Assuming you know for a fact this is seasonal data, why not just use seasonal naive? With such limited data, you have no way of knowing if you'll gain or lose accuracy by averaging the last two seasonal periods, so you may as well go with the less complex model (unless, of course, you have some domain knowledge that is swaying you to average them).
