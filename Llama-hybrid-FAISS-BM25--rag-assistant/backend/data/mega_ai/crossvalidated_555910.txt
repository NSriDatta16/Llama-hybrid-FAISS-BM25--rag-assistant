why is the probability of positive ( or negative) signs under the null hypothesis in a matched pairs sign test = 0.5?

Im having trouble seeing how two random variables with the same median will have on ,average, equal number of positive differences and negative differences. Can somebody elaborate and help provide intuition as to why this must be so?
