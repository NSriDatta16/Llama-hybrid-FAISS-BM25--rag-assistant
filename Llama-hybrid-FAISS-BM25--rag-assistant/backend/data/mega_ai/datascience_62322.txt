NLP techniques to label unlabeled data in a dataset

So I have a .xls file with negative and neutral reviews of a medicine. However, this dataset does not have labels. I converted this .xls into a dataframe and I am using the Spacy Lib. I have to use NLP techniques to label the data. Can you guys help me out on how to use NLP techniques to label this dataset as a neutral review or a negative review. So far, I did data cleansing (remove stop words, punctuation, etc.) What are the next steps?
