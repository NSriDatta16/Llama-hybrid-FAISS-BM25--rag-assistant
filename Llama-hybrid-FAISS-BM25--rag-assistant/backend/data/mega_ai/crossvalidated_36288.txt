How to combine annual rainfall data with specific forecast of known accuracy to predict weather for a particular day?

Alice is getting married tomorrow at an outdoor ceremony in a beautiful garden. In recent years, it has rained, on average, only 5 days in a year. Alice is anxious about the weather for tomorrow and wishes to get the weather prediction from a weather forecaster. From the past records, the weather forecaster is correct 90% of the time. Unfortunately, the weather forecaster predicts rain for tomorrow. Should alice make wet weather plans for tomorrow? Found, e.g. , at http://stattrek.com/probability/bayes-theorem.aspx .
