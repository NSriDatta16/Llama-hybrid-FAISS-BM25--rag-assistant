One of the requirements for clients/servers to be compatible with HTTP/1.1 is the support of pipelining. So I don't see how using it would be a problem... I would rather think it would be encouraged. Using pipelining you cut down on creating new resources, network bandwidth, etc. All modern web servers support pipelining and any reasonably complete client library should, so I'm not sure what the problem could be... perhaps if you ask about specific errors we could help you with them.
