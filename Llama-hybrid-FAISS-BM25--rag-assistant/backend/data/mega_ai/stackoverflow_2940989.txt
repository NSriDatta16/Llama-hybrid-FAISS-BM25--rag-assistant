What you should do is hook into the Magento event that is fired for a newly placed order and define your own class with the functionality you are looking for. See Customize Magento using Event/Observer for how to set up observers (you'll need to create your own module for this). The event you want to listen for is sales_order_place_after , and when you declare an observer for it, your code will be called after any order is placed. Hope that helps! Thanks, Joe
