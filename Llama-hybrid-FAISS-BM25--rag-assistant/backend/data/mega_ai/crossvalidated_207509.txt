Python machine learning brute force

I have a dataset from which I try to predict one value. I tried linear regression, but it doesn't work. Is there an algorithm in Python which will compute a good statistical model (neural network) in every case? What I am looking for is the brute force algorithm for machine learning. The only thing I care about is how good the prediction is.
