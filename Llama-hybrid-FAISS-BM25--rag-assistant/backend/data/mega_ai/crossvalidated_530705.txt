I believe that he is combining all of the time series into 1 long time series. Then he is padding the periods in between to make sure the the time series line up (i.e. each January for each time series actually occurs in January) which could be an issue if your time series are of different length or the same length but not full years. Also he doesn't want any serial correlation between the series so he adds several periods to ensure that. As others have pointed out in the comments this assumes that the overall level of the each time series is the same. For your case with 1000 time series I would probably use the accepted answer of the thread and just say there is an 'on average' better arima model. I think Hyndman's approach could be a nightmare with a large data set like yours.
