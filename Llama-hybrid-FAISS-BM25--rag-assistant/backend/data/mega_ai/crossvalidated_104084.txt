While you may have a population, the central question is whether it's actually the population about which you wish to make statements (at least ones relating to population effects/differences). If it isn't, you might still in many cases treat it like a sample. If it is actually the target population, there's no need for statistical inference, just describe the differences. Frequently, for example, it turns out that the wish for example, is to say something that might be relevant in the near future, or to guide policy, which suggests a notional (and perhaps not physically realizable) population somewhat different from the observed. In that case there might arguably be a reason to continue with statistical inference. The dependent variable itself is not assumed to be normal in ordinary regression; the conditional distribution is. Even when the assumptions are reasonable, bimodal/multimodal marginal distributions are common when there are two or more groups with different means. You should check your normality assumption by examining residuals, not the raw response. You talked about medians but worried the medians might be close even though the distributions might differ overall. You might consider quantile regression for a representative set of quantiles. Dichotomizing your response is not generally regarded as a good idea. [However, interactions (whether categorical$\times$categorical, categorical$\times$continuous or continuous$\times$continuous) work much the same way in logistic regression as they do in ordinary regression; their effect on the linear predictor, in particular, is understood in almost the same way.]
