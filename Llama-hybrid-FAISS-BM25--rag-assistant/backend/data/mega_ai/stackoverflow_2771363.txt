UPDATE 6/2012: This used to work at the time of the writing, but obviously no more. Sorry. In Firefox (might apply to other Gecko-based browsers as well) you can use the following JavaScript snippet to allow cross-domain calls: if (navigator.userAgent.indexOf("Firefox") != -1) { try { netscape.security.PrivilegeManager.enablePrivilege("UniversalBrowserRead"); } catch (e) { alert("Permission UniversalBrowserRead denied -- not running Mozilla?"); } } It looks like there's an issue created in the Chromium issue tracker for achieving the same functionality, so you could try starting Chrome with the argument --disable-web-security . I don't know which builds this works on exactly, but at least Nokia's WRT Tools comes with a Chrome installation that does in fact allow loading content from other sites.
