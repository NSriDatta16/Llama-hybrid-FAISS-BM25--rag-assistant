Sounds like Dojo is browser sniffing and providing IE-only implementations of event handling code based on the user agent string, and a quick look at the source code suggests this is the case too. This is bad behaviour for a general purpose library, which should be using feature detection, especially since feature detection in this case is trivially easy. My advice: ditch Dojo, if it's too incompetent to deal with this.
