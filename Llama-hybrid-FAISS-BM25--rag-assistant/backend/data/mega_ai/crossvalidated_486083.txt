How to compare aging of material samples

I have a data set of 300 different materials, a 100 of each of three types, the properties of which change through time. The variation is measured through an imperfection parameter which is determined twice daily. For each material I have up to 50 days of data which can be plotted as a rising and falling chart of the evolving imperfection rate per sample. I am looking for a statistical approach that: measures the consistency of imperfection rates within each material type (is the behavior consistent or highly variable) compares the different materials to determine if there is statistical different imperfection rates / behaviors I am not sure where to start. I obviously need a statistic that can compare time series (imperfection rates per day) - but I am not sure what that statistic is? Any guidance appreciated ...
