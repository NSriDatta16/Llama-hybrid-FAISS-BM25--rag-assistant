Steps for embedding a windows forms user control in web page

I am developing a windows forms user control in Visual Studio 2005. It is a file upload control and uses only 2 elements. A button for showing opnefiledialog An openfiledialog I have added an object tag to the html page with the class id and all that. The namespace is ActiveXUploadFile and class name is FileUpload. But the control is not displayed in the web page. Is there anything more to be done for this? Thanks
