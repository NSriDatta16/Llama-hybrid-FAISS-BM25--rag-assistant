How to get a non-XML output using JDOM XSLTransformer?

I have an XML file which I'd like to parse into a non-XML (text) file based on a XLST file. The code in both seem correct, and it works when testing manually, but I'm having a problem doing this programatically. I'm using JDOM's XSLTransformer class to apply the XSLT to the XML and it returns it in the format of a JDOM Document. The problem here is that I can't seem to access anything in the Document as it is not a proper XML file and I get a "java.lang.IllegalStateException: Root element not set" error. Is there a better way within Java to obtain a non-XML file as a result of XSLT?
