What you really want to do would be monkey patching , i.e. changing the behaviour of existing classes without modifying their code. Unfortunately, Java does not support this, nor things like mixins that might be used alternatively. So unless you're willing to switch to a more dynamic language like Groovy, you'll have to live with less elegant solutions like composition.
