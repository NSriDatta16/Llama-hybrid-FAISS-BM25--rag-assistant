Odds ratio in logistic regression with multiple predictors

It seems to be commonly accepted that $e^\beta$ corresponds to the OR in logistic regressions. Although I understand that in the univariate case this definitely seems to correspond, i.e. $$ OR = \frac{\text{odds}(F(x+1))}{\text{odds}(F(x))} = \frac{\frac{F(x+1)}{1 - F(x+1)}}{\frac{F(x)}{1 - F(x)}} = \frac{e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 (x+1)}}{e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 x}} = e^{\beta_1} $$ This doesn't seem as clear for the multiple predictor case. What would be the proof for this? What probabilities are being compared? I have noticed that with added predictors, the OR changes, the explanation given being that it represents the OR with other variables taken into account, how? Is it really still the OR once it changes?
