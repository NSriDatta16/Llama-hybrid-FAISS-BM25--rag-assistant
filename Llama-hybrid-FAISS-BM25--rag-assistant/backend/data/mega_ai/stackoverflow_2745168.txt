Android: Setting maxSDK version for Android 1.5 app

I've released an android app with the property now my app seems to crash on android 1.5 devices (i guess because i use drawable-mdpi/hdpi,...) so thought it would be good to release the same app just for 1.5 devices (not using the mdpi/hdpi-directories). but when i use it doesn't compile for 1.5 (it states that target and maxsdkversion are unknown properties). (if i set the jar-sdk to 1.6 it works fine). So what is the best way to solve my problem? Is the app runable if I compile with 1.6 sdk but restrict it to sdk 3 (1.5) ? Or would this also crash since the sdk3 doesn't know the manifest-attributes "target/maxSdkVersion"? Any other ideas how to solve this?
