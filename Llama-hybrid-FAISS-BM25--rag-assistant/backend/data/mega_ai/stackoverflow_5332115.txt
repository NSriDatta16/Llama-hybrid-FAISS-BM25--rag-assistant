Xcode 4 Archive Version Unspecified

I'm trying to build a release version of my iPhone app in Xcode 4 and when it finishes and launches Organizer, there is no version number, it only says "unspecified". This is preventing me from using Xcode 4's Validate and Submit features. Any ideas on how to fix this? My version number is set in my project settings, so not sure what's causing the problem.
