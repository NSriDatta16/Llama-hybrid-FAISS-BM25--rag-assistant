I think that whuber's answer is straightforward and a simple one for a non-time series person like me to understand. I base mine on his. My answer is in R not Stata as I don't know stata that well. I wonder if the question is actually asking us to look at whether the absolute year on year increase is the same in the two cohorts (rather than relative). I think this is important and illustrate it as follows. Consider the following toy example: a Here we have 2 cohorts, each of which have a steady 1 year per year increase in median survival. So each year both cohorts in this example increase by the same absolute amount, but the RLE gives the following: rle Which obviously has an upward trend, and the p value to test the hypothesis that the gradient of the line 0 is 2.2e-16. The fitted straight line (let's ignore that this line looks curved) has a gradient of 0.008. So even though both cohorts have the same absolute increase in a year, the RLE has an upward slope. So if you use RLE when you want to look for absolute increases, then you'll inappropriately reject the null hypothesis. Using the supplied data, calculating the absolute difference between the cohorts we get: Which implies that the absolute difference between median survival is gradually decreasing (i.e. the cohort with the poor survival is gradually getting closer to the cohort with the better survival).
