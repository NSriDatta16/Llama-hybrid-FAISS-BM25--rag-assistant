You can find information about Caché by googling for Intersystems--that's really the best way. You can also search under the old name of the language, MUMPS. I knew nothing about Caché when I started working on it fresh out of college, and I don't think it was that hard to learn. Like most scripting languages, it's best to learn by trying things out in the terminal and learning your way around. Also, Caché has a built-in SQL mapping system so that you can have it behave like a relational database externally but still leverage some of the powerful non-relational concepts under the hood.
