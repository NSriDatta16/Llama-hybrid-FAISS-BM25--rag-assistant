Javascript image editor library

My friend and I have plan to build a web shop. One of the shop's main feature is the ability for the customer to design their own stuff. My friend took polyvore website as an example. The above link point to an editor page. In polyvore, the customer can drag and drop items from right-hand side to a 'canvas' in the left-hand side of the page. the image have simple handler for resizing, rotate and move. This is the main feature that we want to achieve. I want to know if there are any free JavaScript library out there that provide these functionality? We don't need too advance stuffs, because the goal is not making something like online Photoshop application. The polyvore editor has most of the features that we need.
