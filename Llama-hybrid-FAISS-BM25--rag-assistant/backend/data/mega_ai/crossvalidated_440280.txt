Choosing model from Walk-Forward CV for Time Series

my question is about the ‘correct’ form of analysis following the use of multiple train/test splits on time series data. Specifically, I’m using Sklearn time series split to generate 10 windows for training an XGBoost model on a sparse time series dataset (~75 time periods / rows) to not have lookahead bias. For each split, I save the MSE on the test set. (method similar to this link ), and then average the errors over the splits as a measure of model overall performance. I’m uncertain about the way to choose one of these models, given the different type of CV here. Do I just use the one with the lowest test error to analyze feature importance and other ‘post-modeling’ steps? Thanks for your help.
