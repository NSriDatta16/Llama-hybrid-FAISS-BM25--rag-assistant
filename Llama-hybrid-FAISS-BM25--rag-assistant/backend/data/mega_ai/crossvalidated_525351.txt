An Apples to apples comparison will see two models trained on the same amount of data. To select between your linear model and your neural network, you will use the validation set (which means whatever set you use as validation for your network, you have to use the same set for your linear model). The model with the lowest loss on the validation set is likely the model you will choose. From there, you use the selected model on the test set to get a final estimate of out of sample performance. You touch the test set once and only once.
