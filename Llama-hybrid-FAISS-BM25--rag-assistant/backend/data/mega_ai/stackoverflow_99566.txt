Write automated unit tests. If you have tests that test the code you are maintaining you can be assured that any modifications haven't broken it. Test frameworks such as JUnit can help. Get a copy of Martin Fowler's classic book Refactoring and read it. Pay particular attention to the concept of code smells. This will point you to particular refactorings that will help with your situation. Get a good IDE that has refactoring support built in. IDEs won't support all of the refactorings in the book but many of them will have a number of them. Eclipse and NetBeans in the Java world are free and support refactoring well. Consider a continuous integration server like Hudson to track whether your tests are failing.
