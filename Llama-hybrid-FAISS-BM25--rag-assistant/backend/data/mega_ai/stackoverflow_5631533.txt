How do I exclude types and methods from being covered by dotCover in TeamCity?

I've got an existing C# 4 project which I've checked the test coverage for by using TestDriven.Net and the Visual Studio coverage feature, i.e. Test With -> Coverage from the context menu. The project contains some code I don't want covered, and I've solved that by adding the [ExcludeFromCodeCoverage] for those types and methods. We've just upgraded TeamCity to 6.0.3, and I've added dotCover coverage to the NUnit build step. I've managed to remove coverage for external assemblies such as NHibernate in the "Filters" section (by explicitly state the assemblies for which I want coverage), but I'm struggling with how to exclude types and methods from covered assemblies.
