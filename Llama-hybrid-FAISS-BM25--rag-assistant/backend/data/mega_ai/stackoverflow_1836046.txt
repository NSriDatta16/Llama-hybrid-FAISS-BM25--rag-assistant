Normalizing line endings in Ruby

I have a string in Ruby, s (say) which might have any of the standard line endings ( \n , \r\n , \r ). I want to convert all of those to \n s. What's the best way? This seems like a super-common problem, but there's not much documentation about it. Obviously there are easy crude solutions, but is there anything built in to handle this? Elegant, idiomatic-Ruby solutions are best. EDIT: realized that ^M and \r are the same. But there are still three cases. (See wikipedia .)
