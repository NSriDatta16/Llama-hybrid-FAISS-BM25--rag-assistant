The pseudo-R-squared reported by betareg is the squared correlation of the linear predictor and the link-transformed response (default link: logit). For the mj_vd model from example("MockJurors", package = "betareg") that you cite, this can be replicated via: summary(mj_vd) ## reports: Pseudo R-squared: 0.03885 cor(qlogis(MockJurors$confidence), predict(mj_vd, type = "link"))^2 ## [1] 0.03885128 This pseudo-R-squared is not explicitly mentioned in the UCLA website but it is of type 3 (square of correlation). The McFadden pseudo-R-squared provided on the UCLA website is for discrete data where the likelihood contributions are actually probabilities between 0 and 1 (and thus the corresponding log-likelihood are negative). This is not the case for beta regression. In this case Smithson & Verkuilen (2006) also call this "proportional reduction of error (PRE)". This has the inverse ratio of the log-likelihoods. See also: calculating a pseudo R2 value when deviance is negative The negative value for the McFadden pseudo-R-squared is due to the inverse ratio of log-likelihoods. This only works if both are negative (e.g., as in logistic regression) but here both log-likelihoods are positive. I generally find the pseudo-R-squared to be of rather limited use in beta regression. Whether the model fit is useful (for you) depends on many aspects, e.g., whether you mostly want a model for the mean or you are really interested in a probabilistic fit. A comprehensive answer for this is beyond the scope of this question, though. Alternative means of model comparisons could include information criteria (AIC or BIC), scores for the mean predicitons like (root) mean-squared error (MSE, RMSE), or probabilistic scoring rules (CRPS, log-score), or graphical model assessments (quantile-quantile plots, PIT histograms, etc.).
