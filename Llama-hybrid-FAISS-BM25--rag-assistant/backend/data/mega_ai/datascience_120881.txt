Depending on a task there could be a better strategy than simply averaging the vectors. Imagine following scenario. Say we have two point clouds of particular shape in multidimensional space, representing presence of particular orthogonal features. It could be particular colours, sampled from the surface of a flower. If you average complimentary colours, you get something grey in-between, but both samples initially had very vivid and saturated colours. In the end the centroids of perceptibly similar objects would be more distant from the centroid of the search target than the centroid of a more distant object! So if you find a maximum similarity for each point in target features among the sample's features, and then average those similarities, this problem is solved. I found that this way I get a better result in similarity search. The formula is as follows: average by i (maximum by j (cosine distance (a[i], b[j] ) ) ) There could be even better strategy. For example, you might want to apply some more sophisticated activation function to pairs of points instead of max and a better averaging function to too.
