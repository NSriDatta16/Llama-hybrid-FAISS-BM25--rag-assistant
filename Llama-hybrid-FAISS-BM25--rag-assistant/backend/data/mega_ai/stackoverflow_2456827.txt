Not sure if this is helpful, but in the documentation there's the following paragraph: There is no dynamic recompilation of classes that are loaded in this way and changes to the spark files will have no effect. However the files must be available on disk at runtime. Sorry about that - but the different frameworks still needs to test for the view files' existence to know what view descriptor it should instantiate. Do you have the view files in your directory structure?
