How to self-learn data science?

I am a self-taught web developer and am interested in teaching myself data science, but I'm unsure of how to begin. In particular, I'm wondering: What fields are there within data science? (e.g., Artificial Intelligence, machine learning, data analysis, etc.) Are there online classes people can recommend? Are there projects available out there that I can practice on (e.g., open datasets). Are there certifications I can apply for or complete?
