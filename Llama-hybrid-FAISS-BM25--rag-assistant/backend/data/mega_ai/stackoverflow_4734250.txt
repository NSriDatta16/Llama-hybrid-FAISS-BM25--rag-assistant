If you didn't have access to cron , you could easily do this: Write a model that stores the email, the time to send, and a BooleanField indicating if the email has been sent. Write a view which selects all emails that haven't been sent yet but should have by now, and sends them. Use something like OpenACS Uptime , Pingdom or any other service capable of sending HTTP GET requests periodically to call that view, and trigger the email sending. (Both are free, the former should request once every 15 minutes, and the latter can be configured to request up to every minute, and will do so from several locations.) Sure, it's inelegant, but it's a method that works on basically any web host. I used to do something like this when I was writing PHP apps to run on a host that killed all processes after something like 15 seconds.
