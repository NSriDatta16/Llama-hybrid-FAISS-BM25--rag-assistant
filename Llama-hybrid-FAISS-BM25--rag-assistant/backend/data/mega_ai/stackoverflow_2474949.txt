One thing you could do is to take advantage of jQuery's ability to cache document fragments (the example is from a talk John Resig gave but you could apply it to your code): // SLOW AS IT IS NOT CACHED. BECAUSE OF FOO $("ul").append(" " + foo + " "); // FAST. DOCUMENT FRAGMENT IS CACHED $(" ") .find("a").text(foo).end() .appendTo("ul"); This would be applicable to your line above: $(" ").html(" " + num + " " + sartist + " " + salbum + " " + sfile + " Play ").appendTo('#libtable');
