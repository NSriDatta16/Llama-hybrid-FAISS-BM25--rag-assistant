Swig: How to wrap double& (double passed by reference)?

I am using SWIG to access C++ code from Python. How do I elegantly wrap a function that returns values in variables passed by reference like void set(double&a) { a = 42.; } I could not find out how to do this. In the best case I'd be able to use the function in Python with Python floats: >>> b = 2. >>> set(b) >>> print b 42.0 At the moment it gives me a TypeError: in method 'TestDouble_set', argument 2 of type 'double &' .
