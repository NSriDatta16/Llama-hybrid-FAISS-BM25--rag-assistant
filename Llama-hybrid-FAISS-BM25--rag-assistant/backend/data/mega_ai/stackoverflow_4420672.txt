howto start table in mnesia?

I have situation when one of tables rich size 2G and after it I cannot work with this table, 'mynode@localhost' 5> mnesia:dirty_first(my_table). ** exited: {aborted,{badarg,[my_table]}} ** I understand I need apply fragmentation but how to do it in runtime? And main question is - howto start my_table to reduce its size in runtime? (i mean without restart mnesia)
