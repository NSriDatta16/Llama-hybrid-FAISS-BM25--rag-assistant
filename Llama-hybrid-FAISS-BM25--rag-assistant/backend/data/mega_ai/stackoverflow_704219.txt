Running JAR directly is on longer suggested (from Sun) (someone may disagree). You are suggested to use WebStart/JNLP, applet, or exe/batch wrapper that you can control the startup behaviour of the JVM. The another way you can do is that implement your own wrapper in Java. i.e. fork the real java.exe with -Xmx in your main() function.
