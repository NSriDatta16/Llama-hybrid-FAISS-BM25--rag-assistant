Why even bother with the clunky OpenXML stuff?? Just use the basic XQuery support in SQL Server to do this much more elegantly: ALTER PROCEDURE GetSingersGenre(@SingerData XML) AS BEGIN INSERT INTO dbo.SingerTable(SingerName) SELECT Singer.Node.value('(.)[1]', 'varchar(50)') FROM @SingerData.nodes('/Singers/Singer') AS Singer(Node)
