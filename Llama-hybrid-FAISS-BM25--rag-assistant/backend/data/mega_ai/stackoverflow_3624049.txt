Your could looks fine. Possible reasons for this problem include the following: Dragging the Dock control very quickly causes an ajax conflict, and an error is shown. To avoid this from happening you could show an AjaxLoading panel during the process of an ajax request (search/ask in the telerik forums for a sample showing how to do this). Additionally you should make sure the UpdatePanels on your site are configured as in the following online demo: http://demos.telerik.com/aspnet-ajax/dock/examples/myportal/defaultcs.aspx . The error is a result of a ViewState problem. This telerik forum thread provides a possible solution: www.telerik.com/community/forums/aspnet-ajax/docking/failed-to-load-view-state-error-when-moving-dynamically-created-widgets-around-the-raddocklayout.aspx
