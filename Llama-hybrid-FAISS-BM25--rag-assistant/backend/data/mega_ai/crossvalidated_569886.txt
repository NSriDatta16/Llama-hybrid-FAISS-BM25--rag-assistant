How to predict an outcome of the game (next row) based on all previous games (rows)?

I'm a data science student and I've come across a fairly unusual dataset (to me, which explains the vague title). It's of the following form: STAT_1 STAT_2 ... HOME AWAY NEXT_HOME NEXT_AWAY NEXT_RESULT 15 11 ... Team A Team B Team C Team D 1 11 18 ... Team C Team D Team E Team F 0 ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 10 11 ... Team W Team X Team Y Team Z 1 Basically, the rows represent the statistics of the "current" match and at the end of the row the columns NEXT_HOME and NEXT_AWAY represent the teams which are playing the next game (next row) and the result of that next game is stored in NEXT_WINNER. The test data is of the same form but without the NEXT_WINNER column because that's the target variable. This is unusual to me because essentially I need to predict the outcome of the next match based on all previous matches using a machine learning model of my choice. I've never done anything like this so I would appreciate some guidance (not solutions, just advice and where to start). Something of the sort of how to transform the dataset to make it more manageable. I'm guessing I should somehow store stats for each team and do something with it but I'm unsure. Thanks.
