Bayesian A/B testing a continuous value (Not a success rate)

I'm interested in changing my A/B tests to Bayesian A/B tests, since I recently read several interesting articles and papers on the subject. In particular I would like to apply the approach given in the paper 'Bayesian A/B Testing at VWO' since I think that the expected loss concept is exactly what I have been looking for as a criterion for stopping the test. I will be trying this for conversion. But, I also need to compare the amount my customers in each group spend. Since this data is not normally distributed, in the past I have used a permutation test for this, giving a p-value; I conclude that the groups spend different amounts if this is below 0.05. Can I do this in a Bayesian way as well? Ideally I would like to find a method which allows me (as with conversion) to keep track of the expected loss for both groups, and stop the test when one group has an expected loss lower than the acceptable threshold (say 0.1%). Any suggestions?
