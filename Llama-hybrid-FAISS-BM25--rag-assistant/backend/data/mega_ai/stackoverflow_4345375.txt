fixing NSWindow size?

How can we fix the size of NSWindow so that user should not be able to resize it jus by dragging it with mouse or is there a way so that all the subviews window resizes when users changes the size of window , actually the problem is that when user changes size ofwindow , subviews do not resizses thats i wanted to lock window resizing?
