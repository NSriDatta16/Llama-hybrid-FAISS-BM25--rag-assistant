How to replace the clothes of person using GAN?

I have one source video, let us say if the person is standing or walking in the video, the person's clothes should swap with the destination image (contain the picture of any clothes). I would like to use a GAN, like StyleGan for it. I am trying to find out the repository on Google if somebody has implemented it but I am not finding it. If you have an idea kindly share the link with me.
