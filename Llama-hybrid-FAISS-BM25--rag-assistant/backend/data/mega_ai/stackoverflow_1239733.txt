This may seem flippant but in a sense that is what stackoverflow is. You declare a problem and or intended result and the community provides the solution, usually in code. It seems immensely difficult to model dynamic open systems down to a finite number of solutions. I think there is a reason most programming languages are imperative. Not to mention there are massive P = NP problems lurking in the dark that would make such a system difficult to engineer. Although what would be interesting is if there was a formal framework that could leverage human input to "crunch the numbers" and provide a solution, perhaps imperative code generation. The internet and google search engines are kind of that tool but very primitive. Large problems and software are basically just a collection of smaller problems solved in code. So any system that generated code would require fairly delimited problem sets that can be mapped to more or less atomic solutions.
