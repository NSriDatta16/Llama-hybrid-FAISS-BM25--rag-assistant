I don't have any actual code for you, but you would probably want to subclass ChildWindow and handle the MouseLeftButtonDown, MouseMove, and MouseLeftButtonUp mouse events within a certain "border" of the edge of the ChildWindow or within a certain "grip" region (such as the lower-right corner). You would want to use some standard drag and drop logic to detect that a drag is being performed for a resize and update this.Width and this.Height based on the relative mouse coordinates using the GetPosition() method of the MouseEventArgs class. You might also want to have a look at the FloatableWindow control on CodePlex, which is a refactored version of the ChildWindow which supports drag and drop moving and resizing.
