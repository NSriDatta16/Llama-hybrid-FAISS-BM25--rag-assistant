Can pooling ever increase accuracy in convolutional neural networks?

In ConvNets, pooling is used to downsize the input volume, leading to fewer parameters, leading to computational efficiency and possibly helping with overfitting. But can pooling ever increase the accuracy of your CNN model? I suppose this could happen if your CNN was overfitting when pooling was not used, and introducing pooling prevented overfitting, which could lead to better accuracy performance during testing. But if overfitting was not a problem to begin with, and you applied pooling, is it possible for accuracy to increase as a result of the pooling? I don't see how this would happen since pooling is essentially making a lower-order computation, so your accuracy should always be $\leq$ un-pooled CNN?
