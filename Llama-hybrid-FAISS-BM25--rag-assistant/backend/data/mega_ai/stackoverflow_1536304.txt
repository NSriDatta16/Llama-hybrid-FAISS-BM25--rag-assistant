I'm trying to do the same thing as this and I really want to be able to redraw while it's zooming. Fixing it up at the end in scrollViewDidEndZooming:withView:atScale is not really good enough. The way I do it is pass a dummy view in viewForZoomingInScrollView: and read the height of this dummy view and set the frame on the actual content view to whatever I want. Because the frame changes, it means that drawRect gets called everytime. It seems fine on the simulator, I'm just drawing a few lines. But I don't actually own a device though, so I can't test it properly. Also in the code you've got, you have touchesBegan:withEvent: but then you are forwarding to super touchesMoved:withEvent: instead of touchesBegan:withEvent:
