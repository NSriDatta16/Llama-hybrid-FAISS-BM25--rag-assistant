Can a ML classifier's prediction be understood as a probability?

When predicting classes with a machine learning classifier, such as scikit-learn's DecisionTreeClassifier or KNeighborsClassifier the predictions work by calling predict_proba() , which predicts the probability for an input to be in each class. Calling the classifiers's predict() simply chooses the class with the highest probability. How does the predict_proba() relate to probility theory? Can I say the classifier's output is the probability that the sample is of class $\mathcal C_k$ given an input vector $\mathbf x_i$ , such that predict_proba() $\Leftrightarrow p(\mathcal C_k|\mathbf x_i)$ ? My goal is to use this conditional probability together with my prior knowledge of the class distribution by applying Bayes' theorem.
