The common way is through providing a context to a prompt. GPT type of bots' APIs allow for providing large amount of text for a context, e.g. 64K in a bot that I use. Also look up retrieval-augmented generation ( RAG ). The way I use this in my teaching is by supplying the text of my slides and lecture notes to the bot when conversing with it. So that a bot can use the context to come up with better answers than a general bot.
