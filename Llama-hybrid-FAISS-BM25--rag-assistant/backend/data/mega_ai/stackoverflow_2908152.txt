I take it you're on shared hosting so the reason it shows your hosts email address is because when you configure PHP there is a setting called "sendmail_from" which is a default address to send mail through in the event that no address is provided in your code. You appear to be specifying the proper headers in your code so I can only think of one possibility (that I can't test from this computer). Try removing the around your email address - it may be trying to read that as HTML and so you have nothing. This can occur on Windows machines because PHP itself parses the custom headers and not the MTA (message transfer agent) and PHP treats any as HTML. I realize that it doesn't look as professional (since the email client won't show the name when it receives the email) but if you're running from a Windows machine there's very little else you can do unless you switch to an alternative mail package. $subject = "Subject Here"; $headers = 'MIME-Version: 1.0' . "\r\n"; $headers .= 'Content-type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1' . "\r\n"; // Additional headers $headers .= 'From: domain@domain.com' . "\r\n"; $to = $email; $body = ' My Message here '; mail($to, $subject, $body, $headers);
