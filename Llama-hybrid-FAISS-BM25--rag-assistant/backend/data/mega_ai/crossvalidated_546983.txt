See Lawrence Christiano''s "Brief Review of VAR's" notes. He distinguishes between u(t)'s which are new errors that occur at each time in the time series (t,t+1) but do not necessarily mean anything, with underlying economic shocks which MAY persist on an Impulse response graph or show a pattern at some level "C", e.g. ut=C*et. If there is no impact in the Long run, C=0, and ut=0 means random Gaussian white noise with E[ut]=0 mean. But if for example supply shocks are persistent, they will show some impulse response pattern long run where C has some value or level, like may C=.90% of the error ut will impact demand each time. At least that's how I read it. But agree sometimes used interchangeably.
