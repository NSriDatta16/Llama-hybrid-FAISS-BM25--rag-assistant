You are returning centerString from center_string . However, centerString is declared as an array on the stack. So when center_string returns, the storage for centerString is no longer available. You have a couple of options: You can allocated centerString on the heap (using malloc ), but you should make that clear that the caller will need to free the storage by calling the function something like make_center_string or new_center_string . You can declare centerString as static : static char centerString[34]; This makes centerString use a different storage space than the stack (the same as global variables, but you can only access it directly from within the center_string function; but center_string can return its address to another function). This will let you return centerString correctly and use it in main .
