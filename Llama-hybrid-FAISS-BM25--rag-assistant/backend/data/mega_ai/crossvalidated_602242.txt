The following summarizes the multiple references you provide, with respect to your case of "simple" (unpenalized) multiple logistic regression. For multiple logistic regression or other unpenalized regression models, there is no general need to pre-scale. For regression models there is an intelligible interpretation of the coefficients in terms of the original scales of the predictors. Any pre-scaling removes that intelligibility unless you back-transform the coefficients to represent the predictors in their original scales. Numerically large or small values of predictors can lead to problems with numerical stability, particularly when calculations involve exponentiation. In that case you might need to standardize first, but afterward re-express coefficients back in the original scales. Some implementations might do that "under the hood" to avoid problems, like the coxph() function for survival analysis in R. Other approaches might need (some) pre-scaling, as explained in the references you cite. In the context of regression, penalized approaches like ridge regression or LASSO are intended to evaluate all predictors on comparable scales. The default of some implementations is thus to pre-standardize while choosing the penalty factor, and then rescale when reporting coefficients. But there's no need to accept that default in penalized models. You can choose individual scaling factors for predictors instead, as shown on this page . If binary or categorical predictors are involved in a penalized model, you have to think carefully about just what you mean by having predictors on comparable scales, as discussed here , and recognize that, for multi-level categorical predictors, usual standardization methods might give different results based on the choice of reference category. You also can choose not to penalize predictors of primary interest, while restricting penalization (and implicit scaling/re-scaling) to predictors for which you simply want to control. Some non-regression modeling methods might need predictors to be pre-adjusted to comparable scales, but that's not the case for your "simple" multiple logistic regression, except perhaps to overcome numerical stability problems.
