validates_each user_id & question_id stops collection of user_id but not creation of record

I am trying to limit a user of my application to voting (liking in this case) a an answer to a question a particular number of times. I am successfully stopping the collection of the user_id but the record keeps getting created. I need for the validation to actually block the creation of the record in the likes table. alt text http://gadocidesign.squarespace.com/storage/Screen%20shot%202010-05-20%20at%2010.07.19%20AM.png As you can see the last two votes lose the user_id but are still created. The code below will show you how I am doing this. I am trying to limit a user to voting no more than 10 times on any answer to a question. Like Model (I spare you the reverse has_many associations but they are there). class Like {:user_id => user_id, :question_id => question_id}) end end LikesController#create class LikesController
