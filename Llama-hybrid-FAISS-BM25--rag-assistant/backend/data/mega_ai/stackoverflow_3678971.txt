Most of the enterprise document management solutions I've seen ( Cimage , Documentum , LiveLink ) definitely don't care about #1. Storage is relatively cheap, especially if it's storage vs processing (store and retreieve). They mostly rely on filesystem based storage - perhaps with name abstraction such that ShoppingList.doc perhaps becomes 20100909100101a.doc.rev1 , with a database tracking the given-name, the stored name, revisions, and various other data {MIME type, headers & properties etc}. By not generating deltas + compression you get indexing very easily from any number of existing products/agorithms. Versioning is also extremely simple with this approach. Depending on the size and scale you're building, you could also store versioned files within a database. An (S)FTP or CIFS storage process would also allow your software to run on an app server with modest space, but store the files+history on a file or cloud server of some sort - although this isn't much different from filesystem based storage.
