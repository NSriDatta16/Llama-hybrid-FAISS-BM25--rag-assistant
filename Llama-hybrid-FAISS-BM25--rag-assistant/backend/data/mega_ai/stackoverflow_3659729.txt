Note, this answer recommends libraries that have now been abandoned for 10+ years. phpQuery and QueryPath are extremely similar in replicating the fluent jQuery API. That's also why they're two of the easiest approaches to properly parse HTML in PHP. Examples for QueryPath Basically you first create a queryable DOM tree from an HTML string: $qp = qp(" title ..."); // or give filename or URL The resulting object contains a complete tree representation of the HTML document. It can be traversed using DOM methods. But the common approach is to use CSS selectors like in jQuery: $qp->find("div.classname")->children()->...; foreach ($qp->find("p img") as $img) { print qp($img)->attr("src"); } Mostly you want to use simple #id and .class or DIV tag selectors for ->find() . But you can also use XPath statements, which sometimes are faster. Also typical jQuery methods like ->children() and ->text() and particularly ->attr() simplify extracting the right HTML snippets. (And already have their SGML entities decoded.) $qp->xpath("//div/p[1]"); // get first paragraph in a div QueryPath also allows injecting new tags into the stream ( ->append ), and later output and prettify an updated document ( ->writeHTML ). It can not only parse malformed HTML, but also various XML dialects (with namespaces), and even extract data from HTML microformats (XFN, vCard). $qp->find("a[target=_blank]")->toggleClass("usability-blunder"); . phpQuery or QueryPath? Generally QueryPath is better suited for manipulation of documents. While phpQuery also implements some pseudo AJAX methods (just HTTP requests) to more closely resemble jQuery. It is said that phpQuery is often faster than QueryPath (because of fewer overall features). For further information on the differences see this comparison on the wayback machine from tagbyte.org .

Advantages Simplicity and Reliability Simple to use alternatives ->find("a img, a object, div a") Proper data unescaping (in comparison to regular expression grepping)
