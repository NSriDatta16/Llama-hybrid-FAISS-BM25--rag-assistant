Web Services Connector for Java Management Extensions (JMX) Agents , which seem to be planned for Java 7, offer an easy way to implement such a tool in any language. It is a web service / http based JMX agent standard, and can also be used to request diagnostic information from the JVM. Actually I am trying this with Delphi and it works quite good already (using the reference implementation ws-jmx-connector ). It is already a very JConsole-like application, but without graphs. I will try to implement a graphical monitor view in a free demo application for my library, which is not yet available for public download.
