Modeling the data fundamentally (especially for time series) assumes that you have collected data at a sufficient enough frequency to capture the phenomena of interest. Simplest example is for a sine wave - if you are collecting data at a frequency of n*pi where n is an integer then you will not see anything but zeros and miss the sinusoidal pattern altogether. There are articles on sampling theory which discuss how often should data be collected.
