You have some options: 1. Put the arrow between span tags before the word Back, add an id to this span object and then assign the style in the css file playing with: padding-top or bottom and also vertical-align or position relative . 2. The second option is using the image as background and then you have to create the style for this link: li a#link,#link_conten{ background-image: url(../../../img/arrow.gif); background-position: left top; background-repeat: no-repeat; } In addition, it is not common (from the semantic point of view) to put just the link (tag a) inside a paragraph (tag p). Then you have to deal with the default css rules for tag a and p but of course depends of your design
