My ordinal independent variable is numbered from 1-9, with 9 being completely satisfied with the website, and 1 being completely dissatisfied. From your description this sounds more like your dependent , that is, response variable. Since this is ordinal, you can use a rank-based alternative to anova, that is the Kruskal-Wallis test. If you should happen to have more predictors (independent variables, covariables, ...) then ordinal regression is an extension, see Kruskal-Wallis and Ordinal Logistic Regression Which model should I use to fit my data ? ordinal and non-ordinal, not normal and not homoscedastic
