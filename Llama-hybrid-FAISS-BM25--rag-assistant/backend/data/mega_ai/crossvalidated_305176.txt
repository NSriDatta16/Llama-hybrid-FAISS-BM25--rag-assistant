$P$ is sometimes used to denote probability density function. Saying that something has some distribution is just saying that this random variable has density $P$ There are different types of 'unknown'. You can assume that the form of distribution is known ( parametric statistics) or it's unknown at all ( nonparametric statistics). In machine learning linear regression is an example of parametric method, and kNN and trees are examples of nonparametric methods. If you assume that this distribution is in some family of distributions indexed by some parameter $\theta$ (for example normal distribution - $\mathcal{N}(\theta, 1)$ you can ask questions: what is $\theta$? How confident can you be about this estimate? That's an example of parametric statistics. If you don't have any clue about the distribution you can do density estimation - example of nonparametric methods. What do you mean 'evaluated'? Random variable is something that is assumed to be possible to sample from, the 'distribution' part saying that when you sample, let's say from discrete distribution, then probability of an outcome $a$ is $P(a)$.
