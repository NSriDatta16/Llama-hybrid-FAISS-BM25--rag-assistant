Improving SVM performance on data with missing features and outliers?

I'm trying to learn R for ML purposes, and right now I'm building classifier for my data (10 dimensions, ~400 elements, 2 classes), which have some outliers in it, and a lot of missing values. I'm using multi-imputation of missing values from Amelia package and e1071 SVM. My results are quite good: 80% quality on cross-validation. Is there any best practices or advices for building classifier on such a bad data? Maybe I should somehow filter outliers first? Maybe I should consider some other method for imputing missing values?
