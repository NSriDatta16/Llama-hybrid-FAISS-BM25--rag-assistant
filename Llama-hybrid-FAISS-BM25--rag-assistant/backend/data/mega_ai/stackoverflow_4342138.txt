It depends on which operating system you are developing. On Mac OS X, cookies are shared by all processes for a given user. On iOS, they are not. In both cases, cookies accepted by a given application are shared within the application process and across instances of the application. Again, from the documentation of NSHTTPCookieStorage: NSHTTPCookieStorage implements a singleton object (shared instance) that manages the shared cookie storage. These cookies are shared among all applications and are kept in sync cross-process. ( bold emphasis mine) Further, iOS Note : Cookies are not shared among applications in iOS. ( bold emphasis theirs)
