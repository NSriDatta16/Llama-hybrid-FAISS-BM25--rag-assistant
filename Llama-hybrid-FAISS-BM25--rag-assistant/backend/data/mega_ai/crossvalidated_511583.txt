Please do not use stepwise procedures for model selection. They are very bad. So are p-values (when used for model selection). See the following for further reading: Algorithms for automatic model selection Understanding why stepwise selecton based on p-values is bad Why are p-values misleading after performing a stepwise selection? ASA discusses limitations of $p$-values - what are the alternatives? How much do we know about p-hacking "in the wild"?
