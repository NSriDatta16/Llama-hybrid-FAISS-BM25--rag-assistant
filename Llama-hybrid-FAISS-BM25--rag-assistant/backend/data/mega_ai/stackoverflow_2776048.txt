Those finding of yours are interesting indeed - especially if you check out the MSDN docs Querying the Data Service (WCF Data Services) . In the first paragraph, the docs state: A query is executed in the following scenarios: When results are enumerated implicitly, such as: When a property on the DataServiceContext that represents and entity set is enumerated, such as during a foreach (C#) or For Each (Visual Basic) loop. When the query is assigned to a List collection. When the Execute or BeginExecute method is explicitly called. When a LINQ query execution operator, such as First or Single is called . A few lines further down, there's a yellow "Note" box stating: Note The set of queries expressible in the LINQ syntax is broader than those enabled in the representational state transfer (REST)-based URI syntax that is used by data services. A NotSupportedException is raised when the query cannot be mapped to a URI in the target data service. Unfortunately, I can't find any explicit list of which operators in the LINQ syntax are or aren't supported by WCF Data Services - a glaring lack in the documentation!
