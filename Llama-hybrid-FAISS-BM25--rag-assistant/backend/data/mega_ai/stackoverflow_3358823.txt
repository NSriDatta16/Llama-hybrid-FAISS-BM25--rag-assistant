Without seeing your code, the only advice I can think of is to pull the portions of your code that call .draggable , etc into a function (probably one that takes a selector), and add that function as a callback after your ajax call completes. If that doesn't make sense, or is not doable for some reason, and you can put up some working example code that demonstrates the problem, I or someone else can help you find a solution. Edit: It looks like you might need to stick the call to the above javascript function in a script tag in your response, if you're set on using taconite.
