I changed my test condition from UIGestureRecognizerStateEnded to UIGestureRecognizerStateBegan and the gesture is timed with the cell selection state change: - (void) cellLongPressRecognized:(id)_sender { if (((UILongPressGestureRecognizer *)_sender).state == UIGestureRecognizerStateBegan) ALog(@"[MyViewController] -cellLongPressRecognized: gesture began..."); } Seems counterintuitive naming the event this way, but that seems to work.
