This is not something that is built into Magento, and to do it with existing attribute mechanisms will mean that you have to make them non-required (which is nonoptimal). My suggestion would be to use 2 products for this (one for each path), and to have a sort of disambiguation page that lets you choose one of the two products. The downside to this is that you will have a more difficult time tracking the inventory on your products properly. This may be solveable by using configurable products rather than simple ones with required options. Hope that helps! Thanks, Joe
