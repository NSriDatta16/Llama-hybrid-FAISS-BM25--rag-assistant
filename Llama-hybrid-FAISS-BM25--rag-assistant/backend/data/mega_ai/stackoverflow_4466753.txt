jquery fancybox, ie8, Message: 'loading' is null or not an object

My website has an error in IE 8.0.6001.18702, which is something to do with jquery fancybox 1.3.1. Webpage error details User Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 5.1; Trident/ 4.0; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; MS-RTC LM 8; .NET CLR 3.0.4506.2152; .NET CLR 3.5.30729) Message: 'loading' is null or not an object Line: 36 Char: 4 Code: 0 URI: ....../jquery.fancybox-1.3.1.js Any ideas? It happens when i try to activate the iframe fancybox. I'm clicking a link in the form of: blah I have a link, but you'd have to sign up to the site to see the error. let me know if you want it
