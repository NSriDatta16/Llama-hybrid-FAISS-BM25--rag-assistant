(Answering because cannot comment). Here are a few links that might be helpful. I don't have experience with GWAS studies but in general, bayesian methods do not need to be corrected for multiple comparisons. It is my understanding that this is due in part to the use of an appropriate prior - from Andrew Gelman's blog : "...with normal data and a normal prior centered at 0, the Bayesian interval is always more likely to include zero, compared to the classical interval; hence we can say that Bayesian inference is more conservative, in being less likely to result in claims with confidence." As far as an "association study", that sounds to me like bayesian linear regression...
