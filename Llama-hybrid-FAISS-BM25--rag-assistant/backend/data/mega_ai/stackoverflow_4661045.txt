Excel Solver: Solving based on an average

I have a parameter in A1 that influences " TOTAL " in a random and very high standard deviation. Lets say A1 is 2...then TOTAL Values could be 1...5...17...3...2..2...etc If A1 is 1 then TOTAL Values could be 1....3...5..15...9...10..etc I would like solver to figure out which value in A1 would equate to the best AVERAGE of TOTAL after X runs. Where I can define X . In my example you can tell that A1=1 is better on average after 6 runs. However, if you run solver normally it would say A1=2 is the best, because it produced a value of 17.
