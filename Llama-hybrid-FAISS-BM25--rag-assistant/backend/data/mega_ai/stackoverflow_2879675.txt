Keeping object in memory (iPhone SDK)

I am trying to create a UIImageView called theImageView in the touchesBegan method that I can then then move to a new location in touchesMoved. Currently I am receiving an "undeclared" error in touchesMoved where I set the new location for theImageView . What can I do to keep theImageView in memory between these two methods? EDIT: I am unable to declare theImageView in the @interface as I need to create an image every time a certain point is touched. - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { ... UIImageView *theImageView = [[UIImageView alloc] initWithImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"image.png"]]; theImageView.frame = CGRectMake(263, 228, 193, 300); [theImageView retain]; ... } - (void)touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { ... theImageView.frame = CGRectMake(300, 300, 193, 300); ... }
