Confidence interval for (unobserved) sample mean

Suppose I take two samples, $a$ and $b$ , from a population (or super population) but that I only observe $b$ . However, I want to construct a confidence interval for $\bar{a}$ , the average of the sample that I don't observe. Now, a confidence interval that contains the population mean 95 percent of the time cannot also contain the sample mean, $\bar{a}$ , 95 percent of the time unless the sample mean is always equal to the population mean, which it generally is not. As best as I can tell, a confidence interval that covers $\bar{a}$ can be constructed as follows, $$ \bar{b} \pm \cdot \sqrt{\frac{S_B}{n_B} \times 2} $$ given sufficiently large samples. I want to prove that this in fact is the case. As I've likely made some mistakes in notation above, here's a simple simulation to illustrate that one does, in fact, need to double the variance. In case I wasn't clear enough above, I want a confidence interval that covers $\bar{a}$ , not $E(\bar{A})$ , 95 percent of the time. set.seed(206) func = ub_lo, 1, 0) names(unbiased) = b_lo, 1, 0) names(biased) % bind_rows() %>% rowwise() mean(y $Single_Variance) mean(y$ Double_Variance) My results are ~85 percent coverage for the single variance approach and ~95 percent coverage for the double variance approach. Note Thanks to the comments below, I have rewritten this question. The first version of this question included my argument that there is no unbiased estimator for $\bar{a}$ such that a bias terms appears that is equal in expectation to zero but that introduces additional variance in the estimator. I've removed this to focus more clearly on the question, how do you derive/prove the confidence interval for $\bar{a}$ that involves doubling the variance of $\bar{b}$ . Thanks to everyone for helping me to formulate this more clearly.
