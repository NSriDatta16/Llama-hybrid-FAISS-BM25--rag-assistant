I think this is your question: Q1: What to give to logistic regression? and Q2: I just want to predict whether a student pass or not, I don't care about anything else? Q1: Logistic regression is able to handle categorical and continuous variables. In your example, number of hours for each student in your training set is your inputs. Of course, you'll also need a binary response variable (pass or failed). Q2: Logistic regression is not a classifier, the model gives you fitted probabilities conditional to the number of hours. You can set a threshold to your model (many posts exist, please search). Or you can apply a classifier such as linear discriminant analysis and many others.
