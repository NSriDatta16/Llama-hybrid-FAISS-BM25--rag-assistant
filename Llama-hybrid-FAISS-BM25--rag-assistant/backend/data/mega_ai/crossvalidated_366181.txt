In addition to the other excellent answer, it could be useful to have a graphical summary. That could be a histogram of the differences, but even more useful could be a scatterplot of means aganst differences: A Tukey mean-difference plot (also called Bland-Altman plot). For discussion and examples see Bland-Altman (Tukey Mean-Difference) plot for differing scales . In the context of paired data we could call it a plot of change scores versus means. Also see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bland%E2%80%93Altman_plot or search this site. There is a paper dedicated to plotting paired data: https://www.jstor.org/stable/2685323?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents
