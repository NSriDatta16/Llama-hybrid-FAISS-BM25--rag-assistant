Have you created an IBOutlet for the textfield so you can connect it in Interface Builder? If not, then you need to add a textfield instance to your header file and make it a synthesized property. In your header: @interface AppController { NSTextField *myTextField; } @property (nonatomic, retain) IBOutlet NSTextField *myTextField; And in your implementation: @synthesize myTextField; Then in IB, control-click drag from the textfield to "File's Owner". A popup menu will appear and you should be able to connect it to "myTextField". To get the int value, you should be able to do: [myTextField.stringValue intValue]
