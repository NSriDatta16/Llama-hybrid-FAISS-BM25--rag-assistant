Looking for good (web) UI patterns for multi-select from a large (100+) list

We have an application where we are recording a one to many mapping of values, with the 'many' side containing 100+ options. A simple select list isn't going to work because ctrl+click is a little too fragile for this user community. This will be done in ASP.NET, so any pointers to existing controls for this purpose would be very much appreciated. The two main contenders are: scrolling checklist - Keep about 10 options visible and let the user scroll up and down to check the options they want available vs. selected lists - Two adjacent lists, available options on the left, selected options on the right, with some buttons to move items back and forth. (Any ASP controls for this one?) Any other ideas come to mind? Thanks!
