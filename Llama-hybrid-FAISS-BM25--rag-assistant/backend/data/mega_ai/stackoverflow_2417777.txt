Inheritance can be used (and abused!) in different ways. Here are the three big categories. Conceptual hierarchy: conceptually related classes can be organized into a specialization hierarchy : people, employees, managers geometric objects ... Polymorphism: Objects of distinct, but related classes may be uniformly treated by clients array of geometric objects Software reuse: Related classes may share interfaces, data structures or behaviour. geometric objects ... For a complete study of the different forms of inheritance, read On the notion of inheritance . The case that you mention, is software reuse . There is no is-a relationship, at most a has-a relationship. The goal is mostly to reuse the same code.
