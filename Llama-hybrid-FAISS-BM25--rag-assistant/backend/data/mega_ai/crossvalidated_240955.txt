The usual solution in statistics and machine learning for numerical scale problems is just to standardize, that is, to subtract a variable by its mean and divide by its standard deviation. But seeing as x only as day-level precision, you may as well convert x to a count of days since a fixed date (such as the minimum). I'm using Python ;) What on earth are you winking about?
