Logistic regression does not care about the degree of skew that you have (more events than non-events, or vice versa); the math will work out fine in that sense. Since you mention that you wish to adjust for multiple variables, you will be very limited here. There are various "rules of thumb" concerning how many events per variable should be used. 10 or 15 EPV are quite common, though one may need at lest 50 in some cases to avoid excessive bias in parameter estimation. The best thing to do is almost always collect more data, but assuming this is not possible, you will have to select the most interesting one or two variables.
