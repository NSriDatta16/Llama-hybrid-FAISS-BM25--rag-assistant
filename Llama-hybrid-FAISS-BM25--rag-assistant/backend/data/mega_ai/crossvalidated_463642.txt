Using POS Tags and NERs as Features for Text Classification or Sentiment Analysis

I am trying to implement text classification and sentiment analysis from the documents. I always use POS tags as features in the following way. Mike is playing football I would convert it into this format: Word_POS Mike_Noun is_Verb playing_Verb football_Noun I wanted to know what are the ways I can use NER as features. One of the ways I use is by taking count of NERs as Features. So my sentence would be Mike_Noun is_Verb playing_Verb football_Noun 0 0 Where 0 is the number of ORG-organisations entities and another 0 is the number of e.g., DATE entities. So I have 2 questions: What are the other ways we can use POS tags and NERs as features in Without deep learning? With deep learning Also it would be really helpful if you could share resources where I can learn more about feature engineering for Text Data.
