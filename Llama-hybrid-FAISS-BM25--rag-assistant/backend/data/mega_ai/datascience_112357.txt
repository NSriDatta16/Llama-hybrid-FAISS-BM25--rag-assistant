Feature engineering for DateTime column

I am trying to train a Model that predicts the solar power generation of my roof. This is my current dataset: https://pastebin.com/gtZcGi2m . It is built using some weather api and the actual power that was produced. I used this in ML.NET and let it automatically find the best model. The issue is, that e.g. if the solarradiation is 0, but the time is like 2pm, it will still predict generation of 2000-3000. Basically, it performs very poorly. I thought it might make sense to split the datetime column. The time component is the most important one, but also month / day has an influence. How could I prepare my values in order to receive a better model?
