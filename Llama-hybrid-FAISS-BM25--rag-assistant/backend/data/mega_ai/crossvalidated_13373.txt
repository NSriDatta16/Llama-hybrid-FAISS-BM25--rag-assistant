In your problem it sounds like the CDF will have a simple closed form that is easily inverted. In that case I'd suggest what is called the "inversion method" for generating from the distribution: Let $F(x)=P(X≤x)$. Then set $y=F(x)$ and solve for $x$. The general solution to that inversion problem is the inverse CDF, $F^{-1}$. If you generate Uniform(0,1) random numbers and plug them into $F^{-1}$ you have random numbers with CDF $F$. For example, $F(x)=1−e^{-x}$ for $x>0$ is the exponential CDF. The general solution to $y=1−e^{−x}$ in terms of $x$ is $$ x=F^{-1}(y)=−\log(1−y).$$ Then, it follows that if $u$ is a ${\rm Uniform}(0,1)$ random variable, then $-\log(1−u)$ has an exponential distribution. Edit: From your problem statement, the density is proportional to $f(x) = \frac{a}{bx} + c$ on some interval $(A,B)$. Therefore, the CDF is $$ F(x) = \frac{1}{k} \int_{A}^{x} \frac{a}{by} + c \ dy = \frac{1}{k} \cdot \left( \frac{a}{b} \cdot \log(x/A) + c(x - A) \right) $$ where $k$ is the normalizing constant , which is calculated here . This closed form of the inverse of this CDF involves the Lambert W Function (thanks, @whuber), so I'm going to be lazy and solve for it numerically. Here is a very crude method of doing that in R using bisection , implemented as the uniroot function: # Find the point at which the CDF above equals p, for parameters values # a,b,c and predefined domain (A,B) F_inv = function(p,a,b,c,A,B) { k = (a * log(B/A))/b + c(B-A) br = c(A,B) G = function(x) (a * log(x/A)/b + c(x-A))/k - p return( uniroot(G,br)$root ) } # x is a sample from this distribution with a=2, b=5, c=.8, A=10, B=20. x = rep(0,1000) for(i in 1:1000) x[i] = F_inv(runif(1),2,5,.8,10,20)
