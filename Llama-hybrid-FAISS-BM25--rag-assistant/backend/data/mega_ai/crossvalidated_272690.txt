Yes, what you describe is a logical approach. Aside (back-)transforming the response variable I would suggest considering a model that does not rely heavily on assumptions regarding the model's error-structure and/or the distribution of the response variable. Immediate regression-like alternatives would be robust regression and quantile regression . Similarly there is little reason not to use tree-based (like CHAID trees ) or gradient-boosting approaches (like XGBoost ) if you are mostly interested in prediction rather than statistical inference.
