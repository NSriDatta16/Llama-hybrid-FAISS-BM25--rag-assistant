Is it fair to rescale my data here?

Sampling Scenario I went out in the field and got 50 baby individuals. By their nature (and not due to a treatment), 25 of them belong to the category A and 25 of them belong to the category B . Goal of the study I am interested at the relationship between the category and the adult size of the individuals. As I sampled babies, I will need to let them grow for some arbitrary amount of time in the lab to measure their adult size. I also measure their size at the moment of the sample just in case! Data Here are some dummy data in R require(ggplot2) set.seed(14) d = data.frame( size = c(rnorm(25,1e3,500), rnorm(25,1e3,400), rnorm(25,5e3,3), rnorm(25,5e3-500,3)), time = c(rep("before", 50), rep("after", 50)), category = rep(rep(LETTERS[1:2], each=25),2), id = rep(1:50,2) ) d $time = factor(d$ time, levels=levels(d$time)[2:1]) dafter = subset(d, time=="after") dbefore = subset(d, time=="before") Data Analysis Here is a plot of their adult size per category! ggplot(dafter, aes(y=size,x=time, color=category)) + geom_point() + theme_classic() And here is a t-test! t.test(data=dafter, size~category) Welch Two Sample t-test data: size by category t = 620.6, df = 46.642, p-value Great! Exactly what I hypothesized! The effect could not have been more obvious! However, all of a sudden, I realize two things I let them grow for a completely arbitrary amount of time and I cannot argue that they have reached their final size (of even if there exist such thing as a final size) It is very possible that my sample was biased. I might have sampled smaller individuals of category 1 than those of category 2. Not because the population of category 1 and 2 differ in average size when they are baby but only because my sampling method may not have been ideal! Maybe the individuals of category 2 that I sampled were actually a bit older. I can't tell. I think that I should therefore investigate whether the difference in size observed at adult age is not just a consequence of their size difference at the moment of the sampling. Let's see their size before and after: ggplot(d, aes(y=size,x=time, color=category)) + geom_point() + geom_line(aes(group=id)) + theme_classic() Let's test if their size differed before t.test(data=dbefore, size~category) Welch Two Sample t-test data: size by category t = 2.7186, df = 45.646, p-value = 0.009238 alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 95 percent confidence interval: 79.19376 531.35144 sample estimates: mean in group A mean in group B 1260.241 954.968 Ouch ... there is a significant difference indeed. I should probably compute the difference in size before and after the growth. ddiff = dafter ddiff $diffSize = dafter$ size - dbefore$size t.test(data=ddiff, diffSize~category) Welch Two Sample t-test data: diffSize by category t = 1.7336, df = 45.644, p-value = 0.08974 alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 95 percent confidence interval: -31.42076 420.90597 sample estimates: mean in group A mean in group B 3739.414 3544.671 Not significant. It would be quite unintuitive to conclude that the category does not affect the size (or the growth). I think I am losing a lot of power because the variance among babies is so high. How about if I rescale my data // Please pay attention to how I rescaled them as it may differ from what I should be doing ddiff $diffScaledSize = scale(dafter$ size) - scale(dbefore$size) and rerun the t-test t.test(data=ddiff, diffScaledSize~category) Welch Two Sample t-test data: diffScaledSize by category t = 4.7205, df = 45.643, p-value = 2.262e-05 alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 95 percent confidence interval: 0.720640 1.792527 sample estimates: mean in group A mean in group B 0.6282917 -0.6282917 Looks better to me! However, I am not sure if it is really fair to rescale the size before and after. Is it? How else should I analyse these data?
