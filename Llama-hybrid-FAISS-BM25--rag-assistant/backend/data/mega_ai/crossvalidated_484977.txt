So long as you have no wish to incorporate covariate information into your sampling scheme (e.g., balancing tweets from males/females), the usual method is to take a simple random sample without replacement . This can be implemented in R using the sample.int function. In the code below I show you how to generate a simple random sample from $N$ population values. For convenience, the sample is sorted into ascending order, so it is a list of numbers of the tweets to include in the sample. (Remember to set your seed for reproducible randomisation.) #Generate simple random sample of tweets set.seed(1) N If you are looking for a randomiser that gives a "representative" sample with respect to some variables of interest (e.g., men and women, etc.) then you can use block randomisation instead of simple-random-sampling. Block randomisaton allows you to ensure that known variables in your data are distributed in a representative fashion across your sample. It is a bit more complicated than the above coding but it can also be implemented in a reproducible way using scripted coding. You should note that with any sampling method, it is possible to make post hoc checks of the distributions of known variables in the sampled and non-sampled parts. However, rejection of a random sample based on post-hoc analysis is highly discouraged and can lead to serious problems in your analysis.
