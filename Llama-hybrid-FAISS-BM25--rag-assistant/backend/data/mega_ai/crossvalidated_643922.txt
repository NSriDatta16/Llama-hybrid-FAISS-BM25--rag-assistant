Best statistical approach for determining a significant cutoff value?

Assume a study comparing fingernail length to incidence of fungal infection. Ultimately, the goal is to determine a maximum length to propose for use by animal care takers. One proposed approach: 1st perform a regression (# of individuals with fungus ~ nail length) to determine if there is a linear trend. If the trend is not strictly linear, it was proposed we use graphical exploratory analyses to visualize any clear transitions in the trend (from low to high incidence). Using this "cut-off" value, we would bin the data into 2 groups and then use a t-test to statistically analyze whether the two groups (say those with > 2 cm nails vs those with Is this sensible, or is there a more elegant or more appropriate approach?
