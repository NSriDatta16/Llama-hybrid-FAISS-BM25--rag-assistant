How can I drag tabs in JTabbedPane

I am trying to create a JTabbedPane with tabs arranged vertically LEFT with SCROLL_TAB_LAYOUT. The code snippet for this is as below: private Component createTabbedPane() { JTabbedPane tabbedPane = new JTabbedPane(JTabbedPane.LEFT, JTabbedPane.SCROLL_TAB_LAYOUT); for (int i = 0; i However, I want have the same scrolling feature with mouse dragged so that it could be used for touch screen. Is there any way to use mouse listeners on the tabs?
