Can data generated by generative models be used for training unsupervised learning models?

I'm working on a signal denoising problem. Because of not having enough data for training I'm considering using one of the generative models like VAE or GAN to generate data similar to real data for training. I didn't find any relevant precedents with regard to my use case for generative models. Is it because generative models don't work for my purpose or am I missing something?
