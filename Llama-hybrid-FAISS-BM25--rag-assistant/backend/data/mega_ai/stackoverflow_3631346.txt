I recently had the same requirement, and quickly knocked this UserControl together. It uses a short animation to draw the user's attention to the badge. Take a look at "Big Nick's" blog to see some elegant code for applying this UserControl to another UIElement as an Adorner (exactly what a 'badge' is!): http://blog.bignickolson.com/2009/10/15/overlaying-controls-in-wpf-with-adorners/ (Thanks Nick!)
