Function Cost Neural Network

Neural networks use cost functions to minimize error and make the model better for supervised models. Example: Regression cost Function: Regression models deal with predicting a continuous value for example salary of an employee, price of a car, loan prediction, etc. A cost function used in the regression problem is called “Regression Cost Function”. They are calculated on the distance-based error as follows: Error = y-y’ Where, Y – Actual Input Y’ – Predicted output enter link description here In unsupervised I don't have training. How works the function cost in clustering? Do they use competitive algorithms and select the output that has the best result?
