When you're looking at small samples it's easy to see variable results by changing the folds in your CV. That's just sampling variability. With modern computers there's rarely a reason to do anything but LOOCV. Consider the most single split train v. test with half of your data. You might get a great result or a terrible one. How much do you trust it? The result can depend a lot on what you happened to hold out and didn't. I think that's what you're seeing and where your indecision about what to do is coming from. You don't select LOOCV because it gives you the result that looks the nicest. You select it because on average, and at the limit, it gives you the highest quality estimate. You might be select folds that genuinely are more accurate with for a particular sample but you'd never know that you really hit that without knowing the population model.
