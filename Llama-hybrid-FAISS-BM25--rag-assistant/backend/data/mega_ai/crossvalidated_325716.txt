It is in fact fine to use logistic regression to summarize observed proportions lying in the range of [0-1] inclusive. In the past, such approaches were discredited when the data were in fact hierarchical and the goal of the analysis was to summarize individual level exposures which were aggregated up to a cluster level. In this particular case, it is incorrect to apply logistic regression because of ecological fallacy and non-collapsibility of the odds ratio as a measure of association. The logistic regression estimating equations are appropriate to apply to any analysis where the linear model for the log of the mean minus the log of one minus the mean is appropriate (the logit link) and when the variance of the proportion is equal to the proportion times one minus the proportion (binomial variance assumption). It turns out the latter is a rather stringent requirement, so typically analysts use a more flexible variance estimator like a quasibinomial likelihood equation, or generalized estimating equations. A problem with logistic regression (and its variants) is that it is not clear how you will validate the model. If you summarize predictive accuracy with mean squared error--a valid approach for many reasons--a non-linear least squares (NLS) estimator for the logit curve should be used instead. NLS will find the optimal S-shaped curve(s) that summarize association(s) with model predictors by minimizing the sum of squared differences from the predicted response surface. Alternately, if the desire is to apply some threshold based on a linear combination of covariates to classify subsets of fields which were over or under fertilized, linear discriminant analysis will provide superior classifications. A logistic model can be suboptimal according to a large number of predictive metrics. So ultimately, it is not the structure of the data that should determine the analysis, but the question the analyst is trying to assess.
