They are different ways and it depends on how you are currently moving the UIImageView. 1°) If UIImageView are not subclassed, who could check in the upper UIView when one is touched. To do this, use touchesBegan and touchesMoved function. UITouch *touch = [ touches anyObject ]; CGPoint location = [ touch locationInView:view ]; With the location you can find if it's touching one of your 4 UIImageView and then doing what you want 2°) The other way, little more difficult but the one I prefer. You subclass UIImageView, animate them in this class, and when you get a touch Event stop the animation and do the same things that in 1°). By the way you may need to create a delegate to call function in others classes or use some Notifications Good Luck ! Vincent
