Hard coding settings in PHP files is bad because those same PHP files will be sent around, copied, put into repositories, etc. The passwords should be treated with more privacy. Also, it's annoying to have to the source files overwrite your local copies. Note that I'm referring specifically to embedding in regular PHP files in your project's codebase. If you place your config settings in a PHP file that sits external to all of that, then none of the above applies. If you are worried about the overhead of parsing one config file, then you shouldn't be using PHP at all... However, you could limit file reads by parsing it only when a cached (e.g., memcache) copy cannot be found.
