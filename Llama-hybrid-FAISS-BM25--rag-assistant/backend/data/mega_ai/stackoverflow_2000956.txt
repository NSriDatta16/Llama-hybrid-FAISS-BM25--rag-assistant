Is having many render partial functions bad?

I am trying to design my render partial. within one render partial i have 30 other render partial functions. I am rendering one item at a time. for example, I am going to put these items in their separate renderpartial function: time username title avatar tags score user information -- each element has its separate render partial and so on so i am going to organize the render partial functions because there is going to be so many that is going to be on one page. Is this bad practice?
