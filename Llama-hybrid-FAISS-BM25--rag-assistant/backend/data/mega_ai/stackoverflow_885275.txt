Emma doesn't embed source code to html report

I have a problem with Ant and Emma a code coverage plugin, it makes report, but without source code. I got following code in my build.xml init emma making instr setting properties making report This works nice. It outputs to console: [report] processing input files ... [report] 2 file(s) read and merged in 10 ms [report] not all instrumented classes were compiled with source file [report] debug data: no sources will be embedded in the report. [report] line coverage requested in a report of type [html] but [report] not all instrumented classes were compiled with line number [report] debug data: this column will be removed from the report. [report] showing up to 3 classes without full debug info per package: [report] ... [report] writing [html] report to [C:\...] ... I want see my source code in report, how can I fix it? I studied documentation of emma and unfortunately there isn't anything related to this problem. Thank you for answers.
