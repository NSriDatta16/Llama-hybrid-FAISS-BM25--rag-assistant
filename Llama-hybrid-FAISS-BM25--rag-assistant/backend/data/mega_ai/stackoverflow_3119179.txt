How can I prevent Ext JS from including an entity body in DELETE requests using a restful store?

When Ext JS issues a DELETE request from a restful store, it includes an entity body. Although this doesn't seem to be forbidden by the HTTP spec, Google App Engine doesn't accept such requests. So I'd like to know if there is a way to prevent a restful store from including a redundant entity body on DELETE requests. Details: Using this sample as reference: http://www.sencha.com/deploy/dev/examples/restful/restful.html This is how the store is defined: var store = new Ext.data.Store({ id: 'user', restful: true, // After pressing the "Delete" button, this is the request Ext JS sends: DELETE http://www.sencha.com/deploy/dev/examples/restful/app.php/users/6 HTTP/1.1 Host: www.sencha.com User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; pt-BR; rv:1.9.2.4) Gecko/20100611 Firefox/3.6.4 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729) Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: pt-br,pt;q=0.8,en-us;q=0.5,en;q=0.3 Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7 Keep-Alive: 115 Connection: keep-alive Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8 X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest Referer: http://www.sencha.com/deploy/dev/examples/restful/restful.html Content-Length: 10 Cookie: bb_sessionhash=8d75f5e42d576fb695a02bf1d24c9ff1; etc... {"data":6} When a request in this format (with the "data" content) is submitted to Google App Engine, it replies with: 400 Bad Request
