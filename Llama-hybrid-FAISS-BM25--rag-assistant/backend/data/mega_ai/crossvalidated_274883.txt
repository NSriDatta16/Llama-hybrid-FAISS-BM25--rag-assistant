Ordinal vs. Continuous Variable and Appropriate Method for Testing Difference of Groups

This is a question about (1) whether to consider specific data as ordinal/ interval or continuous, and, (2) if the data should be considered ordinal/interval, what the best test is to see whether a treatment and control group are different and how they are different. I have data from a treatment and control sample about maize seed sales in Africa. 50 different stores were randomly assigned to a treatment and control group and each store has approximately 200 clients purchasing maize. Sales are always done in multiples of 0.25 acres between 0.25 and 2.0 acres. I want to look at whether the treatment caused people purchasing maize in the stores to buy either more or less maize. In the past, I've always treated the this as a continuous variable, calculated the average maize acres sold for each store, and compared the average maize acreage sold by treatment and control stores using a t-test. Like this: avg_maize_sales_t I'm starting to think that this is not the appropriate way to compare the two groups, since maize sales is not a true continuous variable. The data below shows number of sales for each different maize acreage amount in each group. treat Question: Is the method I've been using (averaging acreage per store and doing a t-test) appropriate for comparing the difference in acres sold, or should I treat the variable as ordinal / interval and use a different statistical test to see whether there the treatment resulted in more or less maize acres sold per client?
