Do the Neural Network results depend on the training set "data"?

I'm a medical student, interested on the medical imaging and the neural networks. I have one question: When I change the training set for a VGG16-CNN algorithm or any other CNN, will the results change? what I mean is, so many developers developed their own neural networks and then they tested their accuracy when I use the same neural network 'the same algorithms' but with different training set and with more data, will the accuracy and the results change ? I'm aiming to use one of the best neural networks to diagnose breast cancer and i'm planning to use a completely different training set, that's why i'm asking this question
