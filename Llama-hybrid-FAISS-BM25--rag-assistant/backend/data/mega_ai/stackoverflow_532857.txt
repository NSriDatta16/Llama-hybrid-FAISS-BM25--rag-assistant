If you are going to select or update just parts of the XML than object relational storage is the way to go. The only disadvantages is that since the xml is shredded internally, white spaces and formatting is removed, but as the document says it still conforms to DOM. If you are going to use the database as a storage only and all the XML manipulation is going to happen on the client side go with the LOB storage option. If you are using 11g, it now has an XMLIndex which hugely improves performance when updating/selecting XMLType fields stored with LOB option.
