Feature importance in neural networks

Hello I am using keras to develop a neural network model and I have a data of 45 numerical predictor variables, 2 categorical targets that will be predicted each with a different model. As I found, there is no feature importance model in keras. There are three options I can use, correlation ratio between the variables, kendals rank coefficient values and lasso regulation. Which one do you think is suitable to be used for feature selection in neural networks?
