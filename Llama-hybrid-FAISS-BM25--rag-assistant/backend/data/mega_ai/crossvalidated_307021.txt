Why does MCMCglmm result in small effective sample sizes for logistic regression?

I'm using MCMCglmm to run a logistic model. The model includes 10 predictors and approximately 130,000 observations across 200 people. The burn in is set to 3000 and the thinning interval is set to 10. After 13000 iterations, the effective sample size is only 8 - 20 depending on the predictor (I've also set the thinning interval to 30 to reduce the autocorrelation and the total number of iterations to 1,500,000 - but this only resulted in an effective sample size of 500 - 1000). Does anyone know why the effective sample size is so low in these models (this is not the case when I use these data to run a linear regression)? And how can I improve the effective sample size? Thanks!
