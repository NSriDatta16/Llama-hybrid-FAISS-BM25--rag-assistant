The current best way to achieve a multinode network without centralized coordination is through the use of Distributed Hash Tables . That link explains a bit and links to various implementations you can leverage. That said, you still need each machine to coordinate with at least some peers. It's just that you don't need it to coordinate with a central server. A solution using a central server that know both (all) participating machines will also work, but imposes further restrictions on anonymity and scalability, just remember what happened to Napster.
