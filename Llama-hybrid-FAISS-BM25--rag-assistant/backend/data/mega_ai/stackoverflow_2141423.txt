Easiest way is to invoke the same HTTP request as the Ajax request did. Just read the JS code yourself, filter the URL out of it and populate the parameters as the Ajax request did -just use a HTTP header tracker (Firebug?) to get them all. Hardest way is to simulate (reinvent) the average webbrowser in low-level. That is, download/interpret JavaScripts and execute them as well. This way you don't need to worry about JS/Ajax code at all and just invoke the plain HTTP request. Needless to say that this is after all fairly cumbersome. If you actually want a webapplication testing tool, have a look at Selenium . If this webapplication is actually not yours, then I hope that you have read their robots.txt to ensure that you didn't violate the law.
