Fitting a Pareto distribution to two dimensional data in R

I've looked here: How do I fit a set of data to a Pareto distribution in R? do-i-fit-a-set-of-data-to-a-pareto-distribution-in-r and I've checked out the poweRlaw library which is built for fitting data to power distributions. But all of these solutions focus on fitting data which is a single vector. I have data which is two-dimensional, A data frame that consists of two vectors of the same size and they are both power distributions. Here is the printout of the data frame softwareDevMarket: revenue companyCount 1 0.5 14908 2 1.0 3743 3 2.5 3055 4 5.0 1359 5 10.0 760 6 25.0 398 7 50.0 80 8 100.0 44 9 250.0 39 10 500.0 15 11 1000.0 12 Here is my attempt: library("poweRlaw") m At this point, I get an error because the "new" function doesn't accept data frames as an argument. I am fairly new to R, so I suspect that I am missing something fairly obvious here. I just need a good estimation of the distributions parameters so that I can find the average and standard deviation of it. Any help greatly appreciated.
