I cannot answer your question in all details, but I'm searching for C++ SOA / web service frameworks for a year now. My favorites (all OpenSource and platform independent - not ordered) are currently: GSOAP - http://www.cs.fsu.edu/~engelen/soap.html pros: proven, reliable, very fast big documentation, many support still maintained - releases every 3-6 months contras: WSDL/client generators are not free programming and embedding into existing apps isn't so easy seems to be more C than C++ Apache AXIS/C++ - http://ws.apache.org/axis/cpp/index.html pros: proven, already in use in big projects (nearly) good documentation up to date, maintenance is ensured by Apache Foundation better/nicer C++ API contras: heavy weight SDK / too many functionality for me not easy to implement it / many work to embed it into own app maybe not as fast and bigger footprint as GSOAP Staff - http://code.google.com/p/staff/ pros: very small footprint easy and fast to integrate contras: future maintenance is not clear / it's (only) a Google summer of code project very early stage support party only in cyrillic If I have to decide for a framework right now, I would take Apache AXIS - it's proven and reliable and thus ready for productive use. Further it's future maintenance is guaranteed by the Apache Foundation and I'm free to uase, modify and integrate AXIS as I want - even for my commercial applications. I hope that helped a little bit.
