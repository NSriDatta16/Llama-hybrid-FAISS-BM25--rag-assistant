Reuse of validation code in UI, BL and/or DL

I want to have client-side validation for quick response to the user without a roundtrip to the server. I also want the same validation for securing the code behind action on the business and data access layer . How do you reuse that kind of code pragmatically in ASP.NET? (note: ASP.NET, C# 3.0, .NET 3.5, Visual Studio 2008)
