Ok, I solved this somehow. I pick out every paragraph that contains a FieldCode that contains the text "MERGEFIELD" and run through every Run, pushing all other types onto a List. When I discover a FieldChar End type, I roll back and replace the four Runs making up the merge field with a single Run containing a Text node. The only problem I have left now is nested fields. E.g. Merge field inside an if test.
