If you use Jolokia (http://www.jolokia.org) (an agent based approach for JMX remoting as alternative to JSR-160 connectors), you could use j4psh, which comes as part of jmx4perl (http://www.jmx4perl.org). This is a readline based, consext sensitive command line shell with syntax highlighting. Simple array types (string, boolean, int, ..) can be given as a single comma separated list argument from within the shell for operation and attributes to set.
