What is the behaviour of this C code snippet?

Recently I saw following piece code: if ((rgb = (fp16 *)malloc(width*height*sizeof (*rgb)*3)) == NULL) rgb is declared as a pointer of some class type. In the above code, malloc() is taking arguments which is width*height*sizeof(*rgb) So it is some kind of self referential initialization(If i may call it by giving this name!) i.e. belore rgb pointer is allocated by malloc, it is dereferencing it in call to malloc. In this particular code, i saw that the pointer rgb is not initialized to NULL or anything. What would be the behaviour of such code. Normal functioning or Crash due to null pointer dereference, or a Garage pointer dereference thanks, -AD.
