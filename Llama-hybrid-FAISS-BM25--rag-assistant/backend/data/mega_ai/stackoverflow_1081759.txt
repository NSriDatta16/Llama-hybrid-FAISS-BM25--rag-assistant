Flex Embedding Hindi Fonts Problem

For the attached code, I get the following compile time error : exception during transcoding: Font for alias 'myFontFamily' with bold weight and italic style was not found by family name 'Kundli Hindi Normal' I have installed other Hindi fonts, and I get the same error for them as well. Though I don't get any error for standard fonts such as Arial, Helvetica and even "Microsoft Himalaya" @font-face { src:local("Kundli Hindi Normal"); fontFamily: myFontFamily; advancedAntiAliasing: false; font-weight:bold; font-style:italic; } Button { fontFamily: myFontFamily; fontSize: 18pt; } HBox { fontFamily: Times; fontSize: 18pt; }
