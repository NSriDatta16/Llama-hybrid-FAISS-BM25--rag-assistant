In your constructor, call CreateWindowEx with "this" as the lpParam argument. Then, on WM_NCCREATE, call the following code: SetWindowLongPtr(hwnd, GWLP_USERDATA, (LONG_PTR) ((CREATESTRUCT*)lParam)->lpCreateParams); SetWindowPos(hwnd, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, SWP_NOMOVE | SWP_NOSIZE | SWP_NOZORDER); Then, at the top of your window procedure you could do the following: MyWindowClass *wndptr = (MyWindowClass*) GetWindowLongPtr(hwnd, GWL_USERDATA); Which allows you to do this: wndptr->DoSomething(); Of course, you could use the same technique to call something like your function above: wndptr->WndProc(msg, wparam, lparam); ... which can then use its "this" pointer as expected.
