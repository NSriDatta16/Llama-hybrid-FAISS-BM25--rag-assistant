On the level of data generating processes, cointegration is a special case of linear regression. (In this sense, I disagree somewhat with @RichardHardy.) Say the time series $(x_t, y_t)$ , $t = 1, 2, \cdots$ , follow a linear regression if $$ y_t = \beta x_t + \epsilon_t, \mbox{ where } E[\epsilon_t] = 0. $$ If we agree on this terminology, that clearly a cointegrating relationship is a special case of linear regression. You might call it a "cointegration regression". The difference is distributional assumptions on data generating process $(x_t, y_t)$ , $t=1,2,\cdots$ . In a usual regression model. $(x_t, y_t)$ is stationary. For cointegration, $x_t$ and $y_t$ are both non-stationary but the linear combination $y_t - \beta x_t$ is. These two settings are very different, from both statistical and empirical perspectives. (In this sense, I don't disagree with @RichardHardy.) For example, statistically, under stationarity, OLS $\hat{\beta}$ is consistent only if $E[x_t \epsilon_t] = 0$ (or at least $\frac{1}{n} \sum_{t=1}^n E[x_t \epsilon_t] \rightarrow 0$ ). Under cointegration, $\hat{\beta}$ is always super-consistent. Empirically, cointegration is about modelling long-run equilibrium relationships whereas under stationarity the regression describes a contemporaneous relationship.
