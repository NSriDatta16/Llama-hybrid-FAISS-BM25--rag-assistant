Navigating to a specific fragment in a flow document from code behind

I have a WPF page used as an input form which contains a number of controls on one side, and a flow document reader on the other. I want to set the content of this document reader to a specific part of a flow document which is loaded when the form is loaded, (via a loaded event). I have found an article explaining how to do this, using fragments, but the examples shown are only expressed in XAML. In my case I need to update the document property of the flow document reader when the user gives focus to one the controls (I have wired up the events already) therefore I need to do this in the code behind rather than XAML. I have tried setting the document property to: Document#Control_Sport where Document is the name of XAML flow document and Control_Sport is the name of the fragment I need to navigate to. However this gives an error, it doesn't like the hash sign being there. I tried looking on MSDN but its XAML only. Is there a way I can do this through code? Any help would be appreciated.
