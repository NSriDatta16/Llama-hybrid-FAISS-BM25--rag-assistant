As @Bj√∂rn mentioned in his comment, the rules of the game are not at all negligible. The most plausible scenario seems to be a simple coin toss, where heads gives Alice a point and tails a point for Bob. The data in this setup clearly follows a binomial distribution, i.e. $$ P(\left\{ \text{Alice has 5 points} \right\} \Leftrightarrow \left\{\#Heads = 5 \right\}|\theta) = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} \, \theta^{5} (1 - \theta)^{8-5} $$ (It might seem like overkill for your problem, but the expression will play a role below.) If your prior is simply "the coin is fair", then $\theta=\frac{1}{2}$ . Since the game will end within the next three tosses (either Bob gets three points by tossing tails three times, or else Alice wins), we have $$ P(\text{Bob wins}) = (1 - \theta)^3 = \frac{1}{8} \\ P(\text{Alice wins}) = \theta^{1} + \theta^{1}(1-\theta)^{1} + \theta^{1}(1-\theta)^{2} = \frac{7}{8} = 1 - P(\text{Bob wins}) $$ So far there isn't really anything Bayesian or frequentist about this, just simple probabilistic reasoning. A Bayesian "extension" of this would be to reconsider the assumed value of $\theta$ in light of the observed data, i.e. finding $P(\theta|\text{Alice has 5 points})$ via Bayes' rule. Of course, if your prior $P(\theta)$ in this calculation is essentially a point mass at $\frac{1}{2}$ , it won't be swayed by the data. Hence, a Bayesian would probably pick a more "open-minded" prior, such as Beta distribution , which when taken together with the binomial likelihood function above neatly completes the Beta-Binomial model that will conveniently lead to a Beta posterior . (You can find a worked-out example of this model (with Python code) here .) With that posterior you could recalculate $P(\text{Alice wins})$ and $P(\text{Bob wins})$ if necessary. The MLE solution would be to find the arg max of the binomial likelihood function, which as you've hinted at is $\theta_{MLE} = \frac{5}{8}$ . With these estimate of $\theta$ you would find the $P(\text{Alice wins})$ as in your question. But this brings me back to the opening comment, on why the context of the game matters. In a real life scenario, would 5 heads in 8 tosses really lead you to question the fairness of a coin?
