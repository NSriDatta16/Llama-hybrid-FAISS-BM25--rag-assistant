Is it possible to monitor Amazon S3 resource usage via a Ruby on Rails app?

Let say, I have a web application that allows users to upload images and documents and my application stores all those assets on S3, is there a way I can monitor resource usage PER user account? For example, if a user account has a 1GB storage limit, how can I monitor how much of that allowance any individual is using? Furthermore (but this is less of an issue to me) if that user account also has a 5GB bandwidth limit, are there any tools available that allow me to monitor just their S3 bandwidth?
