Today old-school include guards are as fast as a #pragma once. Even if the compiler doesn't treat them specially, it will still stop when it sees #ifndef WHATEVER and WHATEVER is defined. Opening a file is dirt cheap today. Even if there were to be an improvement, it would be in the order of miliseconds. I simply just don't use #pragma once, as it has no benefit. To avoid clashing with other include guards I use something like: CI_APP_MODULE_FILE_H --> CI = Company Initials; APP = Application name; the rest is self-explanatory.
