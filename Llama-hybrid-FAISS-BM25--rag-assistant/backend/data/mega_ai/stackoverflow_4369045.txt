zoo ("Z's Ordered Observations") is an r package for analysis of regular and irregular time series. It provides an r-s3 class with methods for totally ordered indexed observations. It is particularly aimed at irregular time-series of numeric vectors/matrices and factors. zoo 's key design goals are independence of a particular index/date/time class and consistency with ts in base-R by providing methods to extend standard generics.
