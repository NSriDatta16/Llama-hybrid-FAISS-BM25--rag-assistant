There is advice on how to achieve this using WeakReference in the accepted answer from @Adam Robinson here . GetNumberOfInstancesInMemory would have to check a static container of MyClass object WeakReference s to see how many return thisReference.IsAlive = true; (and remove any that have isAlive = false . Any construction of MyClass would add a reference to itself to the static container. I would think there's an elegant Linq way to encapsulate the required logic. I don't know if there is any way to do this without incorporating extra code into your MyClass .
