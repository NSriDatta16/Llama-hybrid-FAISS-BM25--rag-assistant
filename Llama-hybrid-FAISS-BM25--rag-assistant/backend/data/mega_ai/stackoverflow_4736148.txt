Problem is XCode has no idea about version of iOS that you have running on your device. You need to do following: In Organizer see what exact version of iOS is on your device (say it's '3.1.3 ABC') Open terminal and go to /Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/DeviceSupport/ There you will see list of OS images that XCode has. You need to pick on that is 'closer' to one that you have on the device (say you have directory there called 3.1) and create a symbolic link like: ln -s 3.1 3.1.3\ ABC . This way you fool XCode to think that it knows exact version of your device.
