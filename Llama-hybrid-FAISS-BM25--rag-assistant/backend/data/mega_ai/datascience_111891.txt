BertTokenizer Loading Problem

I loaded this BertTokenizer previously, but now it is showing, I have to make sure I don't have a local directory. In my kaggle kernel, I don't have this local directory. How to solve it? class Config: DEVICE = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu" LR = 2e-5 TRAIN_BATCH_SIZE = 16 TEST_BATCH_SIZE = 8 EPOCHS = 10 N_FOLD = 5 TOKENIZER = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-large-uncased', do_lower_case=True) CLASSES = 3 MAX_LEN = 200 TRAIN_CSV = ".csv" TEST_CSV = "test.csv" API = "#" PROJECT_NAME = "bert-base2" MODEL_NAME = "bert-large-uncased" OSError: Can't load tokenizer for 'bert-large-uncased'. If you were trying to load it from 'https://huggingface.co/models', make sure you don't have a local directory with the same name. Otherwise, make sure 'bert-large-uncased' is the correct path to a directory containing all relevant files for a BertTokenizer tokenizer.
