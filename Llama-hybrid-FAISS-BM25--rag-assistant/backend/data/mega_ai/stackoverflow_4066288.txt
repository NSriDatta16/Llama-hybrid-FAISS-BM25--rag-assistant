None, Flex is for learning, as you learn more you use more .as and then one day... you use 0 Flex. For one it's slow. (edit - answer to comments) 'Why is flex slow' - it creates computer generated .as code. Equivalent functionality in .as is faster and smaller. 'MXML separates UI from code' - I'd say no it does not. First of ... it's XML. If you are new, check out other frameworks, like Away3d, FDT and MinimalComponents. As you get more advanced, you use less MXML and one day no MXML, you are writing pure .as. Anything in Flex can be done in HTML5/.js better. Also .as is much better than HTML5/.j It's like a learning tricycle, and good for corporate developers that do drag and drop, they think of themselves as programmers. Software engineers... don't stay with Flex for long before evolving. Here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TL2t8eOs1XE I feel sorry for you if you stay in Flex and don't advance.
