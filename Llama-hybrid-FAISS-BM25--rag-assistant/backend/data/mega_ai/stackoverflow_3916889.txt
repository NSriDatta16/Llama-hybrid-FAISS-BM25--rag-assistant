Crystal Reports is now owned by SAP, and since SAP couldn't deliver Crystal Reports Visual Studio integration according to Microsoft's deadline for every possible release, it was dropped out of Visual Studio. It's now a separate, yet free download provided by SAP. You can download the Crystal Reports Visual Studio version over here . However, as of now it's Beta 2. So you should check out the release notes provided as a PDF download on the same page. There are a lot of tricks and issues to pay attention to. Especially for 64 bit systems and non-english Windows versions.
