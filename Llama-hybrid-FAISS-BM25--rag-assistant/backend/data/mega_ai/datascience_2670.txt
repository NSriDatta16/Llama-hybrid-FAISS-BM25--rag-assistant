Visualizing deep neural network training

I'm trying to find an equivalent of Hinton Diagrams for multilayer networks to plot the weights during training. The trained network is somewhat similar to a Deep SRN, i.e. it has a high number of multiple weight matrices which would make the simultaneous plot of several Hinton Diagrams visually confusing. Does anyone know of a good way to visualize the weight update process for recurrent networks with multiple layers? I haven't found much papers on the topic. I was thinking to display time-related information on the weights per layer instead if I can't come up with something. E.g. the weight-delta over time for each layer (omitting the use of every single connection). PCA is another possibility, though I'd like to not produce much additional computations, since the visualization is done online during training.
