I understand you have a drag & drop code you want to execute only if the mouse has moved a certain distance. If so: You can hook to the mouse move event once the user has performed the initial action (mouse down on the item to drag ?). Then compare the mouse coordinates on the mouse move event and trigger the "dragdrop code" once the coordinates difference is higher then the arbitrary value you set. private int difference = 10; private int xPosition; private int yPosition; private void item_MouseDown(object sender, MouseEventArgs e) { this.MouseMove += new MouseEventHandler(Form_MouseMove); xPosition = e.X; yPosition = e.Y; } private void Form_MouseMove(object sender, MouseEventArgs e) { if (e.X xPosition + difference || e.Y yPosition + difference) { //Execute "dragdrop" code this.MouseMove -= Form_MouseMove; } } This would execute dragdrop when the cursor moves out of a virtual 10x10 square.
