Hierarchical regression in a time series dataset

I have a dataset of 250 lines and 11 columns. Each line contains data referring to a school. For each school I have its name and the number of applications, from 2012 to 2016, and I would like to predict the number of applications for 2017. I also have the neighborhood where each school is located, and the population of children in that neighborhood, from 2012 to 2017. I know I should apply some kind of algorithm related to time series, but 1) I do not have much experience with time series, and 2) maybe a time series of 5 years is too short, right? My question is whether it would make sense to transform my database to long format, previously removing the population variable of the year 2017, and apply a hierarchical regression model, with the number of applications as a dependent variable and the neighborhood and the population of children as independent variables. If this does not make sense, what type of analysis do you think is appropriate with this data to be able to make a prediction of the number of applications for the year 2017? By the way, I'm doing the analysis in Python, but I would not have any trouble doing it in R.
