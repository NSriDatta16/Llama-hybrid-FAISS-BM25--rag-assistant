Actually it looks like just making sure there is an empty gdb_should_break_here() function everywhere I need to break will work. (So long as I'm not optimising the code). Then all I need to do is a break gdb_should_break_here and gdb will stop in all the right places. Guess I overlooked it as my code wasn't really that nicely organised, and contained in a few debugging macros.
