What approach do you take for embedding links in flash messages?

The ability to have flash messages (notice, error, warning, etc) with embedded links is nice from a user interaction standpoint. However, embedding an anchor tag inside a flash message from the controller is dirty. Let's assume that a flash message like this is good for usability*: Example Flash Message Notice with an Embedded Link http://img.skitch.com/20090826-xbsa4tb3sjq4fig9nmatakthx3.png (borrowed from DailyMile.com ) What tactic would you take between the controller and view to employ something like this cleanly?
