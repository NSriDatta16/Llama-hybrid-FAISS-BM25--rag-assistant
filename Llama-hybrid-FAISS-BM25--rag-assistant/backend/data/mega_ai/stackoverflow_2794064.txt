F# Class with Generics : 'constructor deprecated' error

I am trying to create a a class that will store a time series of data - organized by groups, but I had some compile errors so I stripped down to the basics (just a simple instantiation) and still can't overcome the compile error. I was hoping some one may have seen this issue before. Clas is defined as: type TimeSeriesQueue = class val private m_daysInCache: int val private m_cache: Map ref; val private m_getKey: ('V -> 'K) ; private new(getKey) = { m_cache = ref Map.empty m_daysInCache = 7 ; m_getKey = getKey ; } end So that looks OK to me (it may not be, but doesnt have any errors or warnings) - the instantiation gets the error: type tempRec = { someKey: string ; someVal1: int ; someVal2: int ; } let keyFunc r:tempRec = r.someKey // error occurs on the following line let q = new TimeSeriesQueue keyFunc This construct is deprecated: The use of the type syntax 'int C' and 'C ' is not permitted here. Consider adjusting this type to be written in the form 'C' NOTE This may be simple stupidity - I am just getting back from holiday and my brain is still on time zone lag...
