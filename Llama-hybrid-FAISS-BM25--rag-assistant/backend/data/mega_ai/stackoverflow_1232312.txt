From the article you link to: In the second example, the browser doesn't need to create the node list object. It needs only to find the element at index i at that exact moment. This is nonsense. In the first example, the node list is created and a reference to it is held in a variable. If something happens which causes the node list to change - say you remove a paragraph - then the browser has to do some work to update the node list. However, if your code doesn't cause the list to change, this isn't an issue. In the second example, far from not needing to create the node list, the browser has to create the node list every time through the loop , then find the element at index i. The fact that a reference to the node list is never assigned to a variable doesn't mean the list doesn't have to be created, as the author seems to think. Object creation is expensive (no matter what the author says about browsers "being optimized for this"), so this is going to be a big performance hit for many applications. Optimisation is always dependant on the actual real-world usage your application encounters. Articles such as this shouldn't be seen as saying "Always work this way" but as being collections of techniques, any one of which might, in some specific set of circumstances, be of value. The second example is, in my opinion, less easy to follow, and that alone puts it in the realm of tricksy techniques that should only be used if there is a proven benefit in a specific case. (Frankly, I also don't trust advice offered by a programmer who uses a variable name like "nl". If he's too lazy to use meaningful names when writing a tutorial, I'm glad I don't have to maintain his production code.)
