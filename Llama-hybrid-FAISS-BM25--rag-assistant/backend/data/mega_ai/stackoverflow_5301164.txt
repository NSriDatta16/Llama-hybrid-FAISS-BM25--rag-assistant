How to find point between two keys in sorted dictionary

I have a sorted dictionary that contains measured data points as key/value pairs. To determine the value for a non-measured data point I want to extrapolate the value between two known keys using a linear interpolation of their corresponding values. I understand how to calculate the non-measured data point once I have the two key/value pairs it lies between. What I don't know is how to find out which keys it lies between. Is there a more elegant way than a "for" loop (I'm thinking function/LINQ query) to figure out which two keys my data point lies between?
