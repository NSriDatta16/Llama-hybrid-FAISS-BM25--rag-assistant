Locators must be default-instantiable. @ProxyFor(value=Organization.class, locator=OrganizationService.class) is where things are going off the rails. If the OrganizationService is vending instances of Organization to fulfill the Locator interface, you'll need to make it default-instantiable or inject a ServiceLayerDecorator that implements createLocator() . The reason that the first code sample works and not the second is that the second code sample is creating and mutating an Organization based on commands from the client. In this case Locator.create() must be called by the RequestFactory server code. Without knowing what paginate() returns to the client, I suspect that no instances of Organization are being returned since it would be necessary to call the Locator.getId() and Locator.getVersion() methods.
