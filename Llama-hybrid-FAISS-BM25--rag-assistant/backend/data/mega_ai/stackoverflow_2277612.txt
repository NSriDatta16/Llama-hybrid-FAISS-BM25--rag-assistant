Is there a standard way to store arbitary settings in an XML file for use by .net?

Ideally I'd be using files of the same basic structure as an app.config and pulling settings buy so long as I can get any sort of "pathed" XML storage for settings I'd be okay. Ideally given something like : I'd call something like: Settings.Get("ApplicationSettings.SomeKey"); and get "SomeValue" as an lresult. Anyone know of any easy standard commonly in place way to do this?
