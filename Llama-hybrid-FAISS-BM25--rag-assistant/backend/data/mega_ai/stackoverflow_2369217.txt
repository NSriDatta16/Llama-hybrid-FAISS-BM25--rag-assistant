Please recommend a CMS framework in Java good for making a monitoring system

I already have Java code to display and process data from a database. I would now like to implement the code as modules, and incorporate as a whole into a CMS system. EDIT2: Most important, the CMS must have good support manually written gadgets and place them using AJAX, and inter-communication between gadgets The CMS MUST support Spring, Hibernate, etc. The CMS MUST not be GPL, and preferably open source (lGPL, BSD,etc). The CMS MUST have good documentation and support The CMS MUST be secure (safe from XSS and injection) and support different levels of authorizations, (built-in or module) The CMS MUST have good navigation and tab, (built-in or module) +1, for having a good ajax paginated table module to display data +1, for using ajax to change pages with support for bookmarks and history.back() +1, for using jquery or prototype +1, for being easy to deploy, and easy to add modules +1, for supporting dynamically add/remove and drag-dropping of modules Please recommend a CMS best for the job. Thank you! EDIT: I don't need blogs or wikis or etc. I just want a framework where I can display paginated lists and time series graphs and log files. I will also host some pages for configuration. All of these code are already implemented. EDIT2: google's api for gadgets doesn't suit me. there are many problems to this: no communication between gadgets no communication between gadget and its container it's using iframe instead of ajax
