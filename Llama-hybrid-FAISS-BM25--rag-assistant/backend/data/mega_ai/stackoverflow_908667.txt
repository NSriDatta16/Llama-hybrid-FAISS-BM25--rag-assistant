While I agree with Robert that the database is where defaults should be specified, it is entirely possible your using a DataTable for a different purpose, possibly AS a data store? Anyway, to my knowledge, there should be a TableNewRow event on your DataTable. Just handle that, and add your guid that way: DataTable myTable = new DataTable(); myTable.TableNewRow = myTable_TableNewRow; // ... private void myTable_TableNewRow(object sender, DataTableNewRowEventArgs e) { e.Row[k] = Guid.NewGuid(); }
