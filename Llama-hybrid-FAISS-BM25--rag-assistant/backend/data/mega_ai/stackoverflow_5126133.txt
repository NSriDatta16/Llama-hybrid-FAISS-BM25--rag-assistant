ASP.net & SQL 2008: What is the best way to store multiple values for lists when values are of varying amounts and not repeated throughout rows?

I’m creating a web app for a school using ASP.net and SQL 2008. I have a page for users to view course descriptions. Part of the course description will include a list of the topics covered. The Topics will be different for every course and there will be a different amount of topics for every course. I will eventually data bind the topics to an ordered list in a repeater. I also need to provide search functionality on the web app. What is the most elegant and normalized way of storing those topics in SQL? I want to avoid writing VB or using client side scripting. I’ve considered: •Entering the values separated by commas in a field named topics. I don’t want to have to programmatically separate values for the repeater and I’m not sure if it is an elegant solution for the DB. •Using the XML data type for a field named topics. I think it may not be necessary and more complex than it needs to be. •Creating a separate table for each course with a PK and a field named topics. I don’t want to have to create all those tables! Not trying to be lazy just efficient!
