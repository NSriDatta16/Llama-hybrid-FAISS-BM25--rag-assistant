I believe you should use the ratio of positive to negative events that reflects your data. Logistic regression does not assume anything about the distribution of the DV, and if you change it, your logistic model will model the wrong thing. The problem is if the N in the smaller group (for you, the positive responses) is small, especially if there are many potential IVs. But that is not solved by changing the number of negative events.
