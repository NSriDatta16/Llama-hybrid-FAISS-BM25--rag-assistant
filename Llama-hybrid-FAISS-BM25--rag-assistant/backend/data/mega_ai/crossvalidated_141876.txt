How to scale a Hanning Window so that the sum of its squared weights equals the length of the time series?

I am trying to implement the following method described in " Spectrum: Spectral Analysis Of Unevenly Spaced Paleoclimatic Time Series " by Schulz and Stattegger (1997). At the 4th page, in the paragraph above the 4th equation, I have to apply a Hanning window to a segment of my time series such that the sum of its squared weights is equal to the length of the segment I am applying my Hanning window to. Any suggestions?
