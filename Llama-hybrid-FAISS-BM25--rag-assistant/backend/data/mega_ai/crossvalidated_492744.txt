I would analyze the data a bit more before forming the hypothesis; run a correlation and a multiple logistic regression on time after death of sample vs. concentration (including age, etc.). If time after death matters little, make your hypothesis simple: pre vs. post. If time after death does matter, then you'll want to form your hypothesis differently. You may need to set aside a training set & re-validate using the other set to avoid "torturing the data until it confesses" so to speak.
