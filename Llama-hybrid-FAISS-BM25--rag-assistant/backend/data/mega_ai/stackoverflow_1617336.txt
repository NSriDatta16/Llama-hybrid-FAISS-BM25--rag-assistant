If it's a long running job, maybe you can get some average run times and fake it for the user, using infrequent polling to adjust your faked percent complete. Say an average job takes ten minutes. You can figure what percent should be done each second on average, and fake update that amount entirely on the client side. Then when your thirty second timer runs out, poll the server to get the actual percent complete, and update the rate of your progress bar so the fake on the client side will finish at the new estimated finish time of the server job. You can do some math to find a middle ground between your average performance and the time you're currently measuring, but that depends on the variability of the time to run the job.
