thanks for spending your time upon my question. The Link from Robert Havery made it :) As I can see the .Contains() doesn't work (well) with Linq for Entities and .NET3.5. There is no possibility to do it without writing an Extension Method. I've tried a little bit with LinqPad and when using Linq 2 SQL, no problem with .Contains(). It did it as promised. And with Linq to Entities there was no promise, except that I always got the Exception (but this is also a promise :)). So special thanks to Robert Havery, and all others who helped me.
