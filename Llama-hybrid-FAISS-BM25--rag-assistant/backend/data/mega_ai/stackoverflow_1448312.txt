You can store the object in ViewState, this will be the page-specific storage. The object will then be serialized and injected into the page viewstate, which will make the page bigger. By storing the object in session you keep the page smaller but consume server memory resources. Alternatively, you can read the object from the database each time. This will have the advantage of displaying to the user exactly what was saved in the database.
