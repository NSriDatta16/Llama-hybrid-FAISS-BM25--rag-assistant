You could try: dictA = {} for l in lst: name = l.pop('unitname') for test in l: dictA[name, test] = l[test] Posted at the same time and with the same assumptions as Gareth's solution - however this will not give you the extra item of (name, 'unitname') = name Marcelo Cantos's solution is quite elegant, but would be easier for mere mortals like us to parse like this: dict( ((d['unitname'], k), t) for d in lst for (k, t) in d.iteritems() if k != 'unitname' )
