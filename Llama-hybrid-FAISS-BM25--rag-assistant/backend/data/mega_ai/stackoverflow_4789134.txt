3.0994415283203E-6 equates to 0.0000030994415283203 . The E-6 tells you to move the decimal point left six places. E+6 would mean the opposite.

If you're doing a performance test, it's a good idea to put the code into a 100000 or so iteration loop, and then divide the resulting time by 100000. That way you get a more accurate average.
