GL_MULTISAMPLE is an used to be extension to OpenGL, until 1.3, and whether or not it is implemented depends on your hardware/drivers/vendor implementation. You might actually want to use GL_MULTISAMPLE_ARB instead. If you are on Windows, the platform provided OpenGL headers will not include this macro. See also: http://www.opengl.org/resources/faq/technical/extensions.htm http://www.gamedev.net/community/forums/topic.asp?topic_id=536666 RA's response will simplify extension handling - I prefer the use of GLee myself, but they are pretty much interchangeable (and GLee does lazy init which helped me fix a critical issue on Solaris), but GLEW is kept more up to date (GLee is outdated now that Kos has brought it to my attention.).
