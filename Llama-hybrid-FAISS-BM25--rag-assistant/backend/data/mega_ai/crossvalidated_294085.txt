Another approach could be logistic regression. Let $p_i$ be the probability that an iten of category $i$ is sold by a male, and $n_i$ be the total number of sales of category $i$. Then you can make a logistic regression model for $y_i$ the number of sales of products in category $i$ by males (and $n_i - y_i$ being the number of sales by females). You should probably remember the possibility of overdispersion. One advantahe of this approach is that you can first try a fixed effects model, where the probabilities $p_i$ are constant (which will probably be a bad fit). Then you can expand the model with random effects for the categories, possibly using other covariables, either covariables of the product categories or seller covariables.
