You're indeed using incompatible versions of Hibernate artifacts as this can be verified using the official Hibernate Compatibility Matrix . Don't rely on some random tutorial found around the net for that. But since you're using Maven, you actually don't need to declare all Hibernate artifacts, just leverage the transitive dependencies. So just declare a dependency in the hibernate-entitymanager (especially if you're not sure of what you're doing): org.hibernate hibernate-entitymanager 3.4.0.GA And remove these hibernate , hibernate-core , hibernate-annotations , persistence-api , slf4j dependencies. And if you want to change the version of the sfl4j-api artifact that you get transitively, you should do that in the dependency management section: org.slf4j slf4j-api 1.6.1 Actually (and I'm sorry to say so) your whole pom is a big mess, try to spend some time cleaning it. Use mvn dependency:tree (or some visual fronted offered by your IDE) to do so. And let me insist, don't rely on some random (and wrong) tutorial found around the net, leverage Maven transitive dependency mechanism. PS: As of Hibernate 3.5, the various projects (Hibernate Annotation, Hibernate EntityManager) have been merged back to Hibernate Core and their versions are synchronized which simplifies a lot version management, even for Maven users.
