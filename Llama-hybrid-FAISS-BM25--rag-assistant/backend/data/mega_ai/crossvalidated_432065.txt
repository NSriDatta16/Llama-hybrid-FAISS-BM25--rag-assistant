The Beta distribution is indeed defined in the $(0, 1)$ . Hence, if you want to allow that the outcome can take a value greater than one, this cannot be done with the Beta model. However, if you would be willing to accept an upper bound, say that your outcome $Y$ is constrained in the interval $(0, A)$ , then you could still transform to $(0, 1)$ by considering instead the outcome $Y^* = Y / A$ . Nonetheless, note that the Beta distribution is defined in the $(0, 1)$ , and thus, you still have a problem with the zeros. As an alternative, you could consider treating the data as semi-continuous taking the value 0 or being positive. This is essentially a mixture model with a logistic regression submodel for the binary outcome $I(Y = 0)$ and a linear mixed model for the logarithm of the positive values. If you want to do this in R, then you can use the GLMMadaptive package. An example illustrating an analysis of semi-continuous data can be found here .
