I think you have some misunderstand about what the coefficients in logistic regression mean. See Chris's answer for more on that. I'll explain what effects does. The documentation is (in my opinion) not very clear. allEffects() calculates what are sometimes called "average adjusted predictions". For a specific variable, it sets the value of that variable to a single value for everyone in the dataset. For example, it takes the variable sex and sets everyone in the dataset to have a value of female . Then it generates predicted probabilities from this new modified dataset. Then it computes the average of these predicted probabilities. This is the value reported under sex female . The other values are produced analogously. So it's not really right to call these "effects"; they are adjust predictions. It also doesn't always make sense to compute this quantity; its interpretation is most useful when you can imagine manipulating the variable of interest, which you can't for things like sex or age. To calculate this quantity yourself, you can do the following: #Get predictions setting `sex` to `Female` for everyone p You can do this with the other variables to get the corresponding quantities. The reason you can't just convert the exponentiated coefficients to probabilities is that the exponentiated coefficients are not odds. They are odds ratios (except the intercept, which is an odds). There is no way to convert odds ratios to changes in probability because the same odds ratio can correspond to different changes in probability depending on what the probabilities are being changed from.
