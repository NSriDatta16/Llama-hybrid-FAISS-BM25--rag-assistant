in my opinion NO . As over- parametization significantly inflated forecast prediction intervals. Your data set suggests a very simple (1,0,0)(0,0,0) with 5 identified anomalies . Here is the model with a residual ACF showing sufficiency. The Actual/Fit and Forecast graph is here with Actual and Cleansed graph here The acf and the pacf of the original data is affected by the anomalous data points .It is fairly well known but not always reflected on that the acf and the pacf should be based on data conditional upon any latent deterministic structure ( in this case a few anomalies) . See @Adamo's comments here Interrupted Time Series Analysis - ARIMAX for High Frequency Biological Data? . The simple reason your solution failed was it was trying to simply fit ANOMALOUS DATA POINTS as compared to isolating their effect. In a two step procedure , AUTOBOX identified the anomalies and then efficiently identified the ar(1) structure ...Two iterations . ARIMA model identification ( https://autobox.com/pdfs/ARIMA%20FLOW%20CHART.pdf ) is an iterative process not just trying a list of models which are often heavily over-parameterized yielding non-significant structure. Models/Theory should be as simple as possible but not too simple ... Einstein ....Box and others ! I used the AUTOBOX automatic procedure which I have helped to develop. The 5 unusual points are very clear once you take into account the ar(1) structure. If you don't take into account the 5 unusual points , the picture is "muddled" or affected by the "unusual" The plot of the residuals is nice and clean here
