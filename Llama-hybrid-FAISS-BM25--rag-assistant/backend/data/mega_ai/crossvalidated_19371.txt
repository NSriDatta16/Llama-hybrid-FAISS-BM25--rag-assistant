After looking around for a bit with the help of the above answers, I realized what my problem was. I had been trying to use the predictions of other models in the same model as was used to predict them. In other words if I had 5 variables when I ran the kNN model, I'd add a new variable with the predictions of the kNN model and make a model with 6 variables when I ran the random Forest model. I found that instead the results from the models should be segmented and run as a separate model. So I'd create predictions from various models ( knn , RF , svd , etc.) then run a separate combining/blending/stacking model using just the predictions as variables and the classifications as what to predict. I think some of my problems were that in combining the predictions with the other variables, there may have been some overfitting or multicollinearity but I'm not certain. Someone else might be able to weigh in better on what I was doing wrong. Anyways thanks to everyone for their help.
