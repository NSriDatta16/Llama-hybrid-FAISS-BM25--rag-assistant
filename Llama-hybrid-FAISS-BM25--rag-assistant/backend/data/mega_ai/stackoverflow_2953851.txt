You'll need to use os.path.expanduser(path) os.chdir("~/Desktop/testdir/") is looking for a directory named "~" in the current working directory. Also pay attention to the documentation of that function - specifically that you'll need the $HOME environment variable set properly to ensure that the expansion takes place. Most of the time this wont be a problem but if the expansion doesn't take place, that's the likely reason.
