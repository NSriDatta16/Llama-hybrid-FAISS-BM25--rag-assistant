accelerations. To be able to adjust the measurement for side effects, both an accurate dynamic model of the machine and a model or estimate of the load must be available. This estimate can be determined via reference movements (free movement without object contact). After estimating the load, the measurement or estimate of the forces can be adjusted for Coriolis, centripetal and centrifugal forces, gravitational and frictional effects, and inertia. Adaptive approaches can also be used here to continuously adjust the estimate of the load. Control concepts Various control concepts are used for force control. Depending on the desired behavior of the system, a distinction is made between the concepts of direct force control and indirect control via specification of compliance or mechanical impedance. As a rule, force control is combined with motion control. Concepts for force control have to consider the problem of coupling between force and position: If the manipulator is in contact with the environment, a change of the position also means a change of the contact force. Impedance control Impedance control, or compliance control, regulates the compliance of the system, i.e., the link between force and position upon object contact. Compliance is defined in the literature as a "measure of the robot's ability to counteract contact forces." There are passive and active approaches to this. Here, the compliance of the robot system is modeled as mechanical impedance, which describes the relationship between applied force and resulting velocity. Here, the robot's machine or manipulator is considered as a mechanical resistance with positional constraints imposed by the environment. Accordingly, the causality of mechanical impedance describes that a movement of the robot results in a force. In mechanical admittance, on the other hand, a force applied to the robot results in a resulting motion. Passive impedance control Passive compliance control (also known as compliance control) does not require force measurement because there is no explicit force control. Instead, the manipulator and/or end effector is flexibly designed in a way that can minimize contact forces that occur during the task to be performed. Typical applications include insertion and gripping operations. The end effector is designed in such a way that it allows translational and rotational deviations orthogonal to the gripping or insertion direction, but has high stiffness in the gripping or insertion direction. The figure opposite shows a so-called Remote Center of Compliance (RCC) that makes this possible. As an alternative to an RCC, the entire machine can also be made structurally elastic. Passive impedance control is a very good solution in terms of system dynamics, since there are no latency due to the control. However, passive compliance control is often limited by the mechanical specification of the end effector in the task and cannot be readily applied to different and changing tasks or environmental conditions. Active impedance control Active compliance control refers to the control of the manipulator based on a deviation of the end effector. This is particularly suitable for guiding robots by an operator, for example as part of a teach-in process. Active compliance control is based on the idea of representing the system of machine and environment as a spring-damper-mass system. The force F {\displaystyle F} and the motion (position x ( t ) {\displaystyle x(t)\!\,} , velocity x ˙ ( t ) {\displaystyle {\dot {x}}(t)} , and acceleration x ¨ ( t ) {\displaystyle {\ddot {x}}(t)} are directly related via the spring-damper-mass equation: F ( t ) = c ⋅ x ( t ) + d ⋅ x ˙ ( t ) + m ⋅ x ¨ ( t ) {\displaystyle F(t)=c\cdot x(t)+d\cdot {\dot {x}}(t)+m\cdot {\ddot {x}}(t)} The compliance or mechanical impedance of the system is determined by the stiffness c {\displaystyle c} , the damping d {\displaystyle d} and the inertia m {\displaystyle m} and can be influenced by these three
