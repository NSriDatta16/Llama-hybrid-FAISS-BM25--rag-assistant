Which Format is Faster, Matlab (.mat) or NumPy (.npy)?

I am working on a deep learning problem to detect cancer in images of size 250 x 250. I have hardware limitations and I have been running out of memory. I decided to convert my images to Matlab formatted files (".mat"), with some improvement; however, I still run out of memory. I have explored some resources that highly recommend using NumPy files (".npy"). It would be costly to convert my images to NumPy files, so I would like to make sure that converting will make a difference. I am not asking for memory enhancement algorithms (e.g. batching), just the memory difference between ".mat" and ".npy" files.
