how to manage multiple asp.net applications on one hosting with subdomains?

thanks for your time and attention. I want to deploy multiple asp.net applications on same hosting with subdomains. How it should be manged ? I just created a subdomain and deploy application in its folder; when I tried to access application with subdomain it shows the following error: An application error occurred on the server. The current custom error settings for this application prevent the details of the application error from being viewed remotely (for security reasons). It could, however, be viewed by browsers running on the local server machine. Pleae guide me. thanks
