The "delta method" is textbook. Things like Neural Networks , which resolve into analytic expressions and are most efficiently trained using gradient approximators. It is applicable to methods with an analytic form whose derivatives exist including linear, polynomial, GLM (generalized linear models), GMM (gaussian mixture models). Bootstrap resampling , one of the fundamentals behind random forests, works in a large number of other areas and is considered an ensemble method. (Personally I feel like it could be abused, and one has to be able to defend the use of a uniform random distribution as a non-informative prior, or one has to be able to use some variation on Metropolis-Hastings.)
