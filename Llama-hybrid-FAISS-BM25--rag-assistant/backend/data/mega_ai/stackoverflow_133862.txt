Sorry for not answering your question directly, but... I feel strongly that the failure you refer to is one of communication, and it's incumbent on us as professionals to develop our communication skills to the point where we are respected enough and trusted enough to leverage the authority we need to improve our working environments and processes the way you suggest. In short, I don't think there is a technical solution that can solve all the problems created through poor communication in the workplace. If anything, technology has caused the attrition of direct face-to-face communication. Sorry, I'm off on a tangent again - feel free to downmod.
