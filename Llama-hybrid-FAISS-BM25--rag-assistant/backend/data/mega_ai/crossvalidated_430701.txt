Choose one variable between 50 for logistic regression

So I have a data set which consists of roughly 100 independent variables, and then one dependent binary variable (the outcome). And each variable has roughly 1000 cases. Obviously I wish to do a logistic based regression on this to get a predictive model, and I know there are several ways to reduce the number of variables, eg LASSO, VIF, even PCA. Problem is, I need to report the logistic equation, so it can be used by others, and I'm not sure PCA is good in that regard, since it creates a 'new variable' or more depending on the amount of components needed - or have I misundersgood PCA? I'm addition, roughly 50 of the variables are very colliniated. And I know that only one needs to be present, or none (if they don't make the model better). So it's not like it would make sense to have 2 or 3 of these variables in the model, since they represent something similar. So would an idea be, in order to reduce at least these variables, be to first figure out the other variables, and then after that create 50 different models with one of each of the collineated variables, and then compare fx the AIC values, and pick the best one? Or is that a wrong approach to that?
