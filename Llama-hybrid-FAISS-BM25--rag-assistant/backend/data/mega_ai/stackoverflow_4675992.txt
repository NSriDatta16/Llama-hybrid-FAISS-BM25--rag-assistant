Do I need to do anything when I create my own internal packages for my Android code?

I am refactoring my code, and I am organizing my classes into packages. But I find that my program doesn't run when I create my own subpackages (Java, not android, packages). Is there anything special I need to do if I have several internal packages in my code?
