Drupal Organic Groups: Automatically make all members group admins

I'm using Drupal 6 to build a web application which will be centered around small groups (using Organic Groups). All the groups are invite only, and once a user is a member of the group I trust him to have full groups admin rights (e.g. invite other users). Any ideas on how I can set all group members to be group admins by default. Cheers.
