Cannot reproduce, and no one has a faster computer than me. 16 threads of execution, eight cores, i7 architecture. Your PHP build or OS must be suboptimal. This is running your code exactly. `--> php tmp.php Did nothing in 0.00011587142944336 seconds .-(/tmp)---------------------------------------------------(pestilence@pandemic)- This is with usleep(1000000)... (1 second) `--> php tmp.php Did nothing in 1.0000479221344 seconds .-(/tmp)---------------------------------------------------(pestilence@pandemic)- FYI, I was using PHP 5.3.0, not that it makes any difference (in this case) past 5.0. Is your code taking less than a second to execute? If so, that'd explain your benchmarks. When I profile something for an article, I run my routine 10,000's of times... sometimes millions. Computers are fast these days. As far as the "random" part goes, this is why I take several samples of large iterations and average them together. It doesn't hurt to throw the standard deviation in there too. Also, remember not to stream MP3s or play video while testing. :p
