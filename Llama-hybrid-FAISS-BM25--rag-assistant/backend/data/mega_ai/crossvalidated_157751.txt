A simple question about MAP and MLE

I recently got this simple question from a friend. But I am quite confused about it. Suppose we toss a coin $N$ times, and got heads $m$ times. Assume the binomial distribution with $p$ which is the probability of head each toss, then the MLE of $p$ is just $\hat{p}=\frac{m}{N}$. Now if we consider this problem within Bayesian framework, and suppose we have a prior on $p$ that $p_0=0.5$ (or other value in $(0,1)$), then what is the MAP of $p$? Many thanks!
