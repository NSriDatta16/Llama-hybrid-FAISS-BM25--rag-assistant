The problem you're (probably) running into is that something comes along later and sets the template for the root block again , overriding your change. More recent versions of Magento (1.4somethingish) introduced a way to prevent this from happening. If you look in page.xml , you'll see a handle like this All One-Column Layout Pages page/1column.phtml 1 If the page_one_column handle gets applied to your request, or you manually apply it with Magento will change the template and call the setIsHandle method on the block. 1 There's code in Magento that will look for the IsHandle property, and if it's true, further calls to setTemplate will be ignored. (that's over-simplifying things a bit, but is more or less true) Try something like page/mytheme.phtml 1 And see if that helps. Keep in mind this is one of those grey areas where it's not clear if third party developers are supposed to tread. Also, changing the template for all pages may have un-desirable effect on parts of the site that expect to be in a certain template.
