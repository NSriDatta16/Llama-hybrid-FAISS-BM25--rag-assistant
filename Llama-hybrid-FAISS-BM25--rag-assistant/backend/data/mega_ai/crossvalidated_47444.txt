Wigan scores after 30 minutes. Calculate home, away and draw in percentage terms with poisson regression

I have the following exercise: Wigan v city 90 mins match: Wigan scores after 30 minutes. Calculate home, away and draw in percentage terms with poisson regression, assuming pre-match odds were 5.00 - 4.00 - 1.80 for Win/Draw/Win respectively. Please advise how to proceed with this question for my exam. ADDITION: after reading answers below and trying to answer this I got as far as below. Pls help. (NOTE: I just kept it simple and assumed 2/3 of the game left) wigan mean, avg goals per game = 1.20 manu mean = 2.20 60 mins left, so new wigan mean 2/3 x 1.20 = 0.8 new manu mean 2/3 x 2.2 = 1.47 WIGAN WIN ODDS P(wigan scores 1 or more) = 1 - Possion(0, 0.8) = 1 - 0.45 = 0.55 OR, P(MANU FAIL TO SCORE) = Poisson(0, 1.47) = 0.23 WIGAN WIN ODDS = 0.55 + 0.23 = 0.78 Quote: WHAT ABOUT P(wigan 2 AND manu 1) = P(wigan goals > manu)??? MANU WIN ODDS Poss(manu 2 or more) = 1 - [Poisson(0) + Poisson(1)] = 1 - [0.23 + 0.34] = 0.43 DRAW ODDS X = ManU scores exactly 1 and Wigan scores exactly 0 from here on, AND manu scores same as wigan from here on. PossM(1) x PossW(0) = 0.34 x 0.45 = 0.153 P(manu = wigan in scoring from here on), 1.47 - 0.8 = 0.67 Poss(0 goals given mean = 0.67) = 0.51 So P(X) = [0.34 x 0.45] x 0.5 = 0.077 0.78 + 0.43 + 0.077 = 1.28 1.28 = 100% So, 0.78/1.28 x 100% = 61% So, 0.43/1.28 x 100% = 34% So, 0.077/1.28 x 100% = 5% DECIMAL ODDS = 100%/61% = 1.64 = 100%/34% = 2.94 = 100%/5% = 20.00 Clearly I made a mistake somewhere because the odds are too long on draw at 19/1 even though draw should be a favorite or close to wigan win here.
