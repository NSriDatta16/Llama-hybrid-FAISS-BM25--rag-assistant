The Table Storage Service is generally not a good place to store entire object graphs, since there's a size limit (of 1 MB, IIRC) on each row/entity. Obviously, if you know that your object graphs will never be large, you may not care... A good alternative is often to store a serialized graph in Blob Storage . However, you must have a strategy for how to handle versioning.
