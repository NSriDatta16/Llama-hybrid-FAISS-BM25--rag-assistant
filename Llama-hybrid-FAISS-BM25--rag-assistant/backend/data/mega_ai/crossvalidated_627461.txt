It's not a textbook wholly on this topic, but Chapters 11.4 - 11.5 of Jay Kadane's Principles of Uncertainty are meant to introduce a Bayesian perspective on experimental design (how should you choose a sample size if you want to convince another Bayesian who has a different prior than you do?) and randomization (in what sense might a Bayesian care about whether units were randomized to treatments?): https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~kadane/principles.pdf
