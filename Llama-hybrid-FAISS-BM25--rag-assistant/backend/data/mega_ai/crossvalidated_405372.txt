I took 5609 daily crime values (I will send them to anybody who asks for them) for a US location and introduced them to AUTOBOX resulting in the following Actual-Forecast graph . The Actual/Fit and Forecast is busier . . Note that the OP posted data (5570 values) that had a number of omitted days which is a no-no when analyzing time series data. As is expected crime is affected by not only day-of-the-week and month-of-the-year BUT major holidays also play a significant role. Additionally three level shifts were identified along with 3 fixed-days-of-the-month including the first day of each month . Note that day 5 has the sharpest drop-off in crime i.e Sunday suggesting that even criminals respect the sabbath with crime the highest on day 3 (Friday ). Here is the acf of the original data illustrating the "fixed effect" of day-of-the-week since the final model had no need for SARIMA with the acf of the model's residuals here . The equation is here in two parts and here . Note that no arima structure was needed to generate a gaussian error structure. In other words it is more important to predict based upon the actual type of day than weighting what occurred last week or any seasonal differences. The forecasts are presented for the next 365 days ( starting at May 11, 2018 ) Weather and social habits (holidays ) play a major role in the occurrence of crime. Note that August has the most crime while December has the least . The monthly indicators could well be a proxy for temperature . Box and Jenkins loudly ( but I guess not loudly enough ! ) that their suggested tools (acf/pacf) for model identification PREMISED no deterministic structure in the data among other things. Your data is replete with deterministic structure. Following Abraham Wald ... " You need to know the assumptions underlying the test"
