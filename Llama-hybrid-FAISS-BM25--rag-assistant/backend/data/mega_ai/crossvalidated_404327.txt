Suppose you have three $x$ -values: $-1,0, +1.$ The corresponding dependent variables $Y_1,Y_2,Y_3$ are where the randomness is. Now draw the picture. You can see why, if you move $Y_2$ up or down, the fitted line moves up or down. (By just $1/3$ as much as $Y_2$ moves.) But what happens if you move $Y_3$ up or down? The fitted line doesn't just move up or down; its slope also gets bigger or smaller. Or if you move $Y_1$ up or down, then the slope gets smaller or bigger, respectively. So the line has more tendency to stay close to the data point when the data point's $x$ -value is far from the average $x$ -value than when it is near the average $x$ -value. Hence the observed residuals have a smaller variance when the $x$ -value is far from the average $x$ -value than when the $x$ -value is close to the average $x$ -value. The fitted values are \begin{align} & \left(\widehat Y_1, \widehat Y_2, \widehat Y_3\right) \\[5pt] = {} & \left( \tfrac 2 3 Y_1+ \tfrac 1 3 Y_2, \,\,\, \tfrac 1 3 (Y_1+Y_2 + Y_3), \,\,\, \tfrac 1 3 Y_2 + \tfrac 2 3 Y_3 \right). \end{align} So the residuals are \begin{align} & \left( Y_1, Y_2, Y_3 \right) - \left(\widehat Y_1, \widehat Y_2, \widehat Y_3\right) \\[5pt] = {} & \left( \tfrac 1 3 Y_1 - \tfrac 1 3 Y_2, \,\,\, -\tfrac 2 3 Y_1+ \tfrac 2 3 Y_2 - \tfrac 2 3 Y_3, \,\,\, -\tfrac 1 3 Y_2 + \tfrac 1 3 Y_3 \right). \end{align} From this one can compute the variances of the residuals.
