Can you write a permutation function just as elegantly in C#?

I like this 6 line solution a lot and am trying to replicate it in C#. Basically, it permutes the elements of an array: def permute(xs, pre=[]): if len(xs) == 0: yield pre for i, x in enumerate(xs): for y in permute(xs[:i] + xs[i+1:], pre + [x]): yield y
