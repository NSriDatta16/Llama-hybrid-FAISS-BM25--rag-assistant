GMail Drive no longer works (well) -- Google put rate limits into Gmail to prevent this kind of (ab)use of Gmail. It's like being attached to a hard drive over a bad satellite connection to Rwanda*. You might look into Amazon's S3, which is a cheap web-hosted data storage service; then ask this question again from an S3 perspective. * Incidentally, that's what I deal with at work on a weekly basis.
