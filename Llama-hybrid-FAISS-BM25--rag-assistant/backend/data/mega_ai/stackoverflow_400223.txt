There’s no usability advantage of paging over scrolling. Paging is an artifact of web interfaces that seek to minimize the amount of content sent out at once for technical reasons (e.g., network or server load, page load rates over dial-up). If you are not faced with such limitations, use scrolling. Scrolling has the following advantages over paging: The scrollbar control is standardized so most users are already familiar with it. Paging lacks standardization so it takes attention and learning to use it (e.g., where it the page links are located, whether there’s a First or Last link). The number of items shown automatically adjusts with window resizing, allowing users to optimize the number of items visible in one step and avoiding situations when there is both scrolling and paging. The scrollbar is accessible no matter where the user is in the window. Paging interfaces typically provide the page links at only the top and/or bottom of the page which can scroll out of view. Users can move as little as one item at a time to show the items they want to see together. Paging splits items into arbitrary groups which can result in the items of interest being split across pages. Users can scroll to anywhere in the list with a single drag. Paging is limited to the page links shown, generally limiting the user to move only around the immediate neighborhood. Users can multi-select any set of items to perform an action on them (e.g., copying, deleting), and users can look at any other item while maintaining the current selection. Paging generally allows and maintains only selection of the items on the current page. Users can still move one “page” at a time anyway by clicking the “track” of the scrollbar.
