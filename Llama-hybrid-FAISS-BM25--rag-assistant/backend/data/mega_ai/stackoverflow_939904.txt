Changing speed of a sound file

I'm looking to change the speed of a sound file, but am at a loss as to how to accomplish it. I'm assuming that some type of interpolation has to take place in the case of slowing it down, but am unsure how to accomplish a speed up - perhaps an average of several samples? Whether it changes the tempo or pitch doesn't really matter at the moment, I'd like to learn how to accomplish both, but would like to at least accomplish one or the other to begin. If anyone has any references to the math behind these types of operations, they would be greatly appreciated! Thanks, Ben
