You're going to have to be more specific about what you mean regarding "more elegant", as IMO there's nothing particularly inelegant about a nested foreach . That being said, the LINQ extension methods in .NET 3.5 and above can help out (specifically SelectMany ). public class Foo { public List Strings { get; set; } } ... List foos = new List (); foreach(string str in foos.SelectMany(f => f.Strings)) { ... }
