Unable to run app-client that is accessing an EJB on GlassFish v3

Environment : GlassFish 3.0.1, NetBeans 6.9, JDK 6u21 Problem : Unable to run app-client that is accessing an EJB A bugreport can be found under http://netbeans.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=183488 with the corresponding tutorial http://netbeans.org/kb/docs/javaee/entappclient.html . I understand now how the Remote interface has to be in a Java Class Library. I walked through the steps of the tutorial, but still, it does not work. Errors: http://pastebin.com/k8ARGKbX . According to http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/820-7700/gjkmx?l=en&a=view , this error message means: ACDEPL112 Error attempting to process extensions from the manifest of JAR file {0}; ignoring it and continuing Cause: The exception listed in the log file was thrown as the server tried to open the JAR file or process the extensions listed in its manifest. Solution: Make sure the manifest of the JAR file correctly lists the extensions on which the JAR depends. Doesn't mean too much to me, manifest files contain only Manifest-Version: 1.0 , should I add something here? :\ A similar discussion can be found under http://forums.netbeans.org/post-86938.html . I also asked this question at the NetBeans Community Forum http://forums.netbeans.org/viewtopic.php?t=33195 , and sent an email to the editors. Any help or ideas would be appreciated! Thanks in advance, wheelie
