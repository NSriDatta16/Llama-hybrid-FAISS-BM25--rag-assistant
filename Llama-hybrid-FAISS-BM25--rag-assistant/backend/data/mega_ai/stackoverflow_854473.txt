There's nothing WCF specific here if you are RESTful the GET for an Average would give a URI where the answer would wait once the server finish calculating (if it is indeed a long operation) Regarding getting the measurements - you didn't specify the freshness needed (i.e. when you get a request for an average - how fresh do you need the results to be) Also you did not specify the relative frequency of queries vs. new measurements In any event you can (and IMHO should) use the queue (assuming measuring your performance proves it) behind the endpoint. If you change the WCF binding you might still be RESTful but will not benefit from the standard based approach of REST over HTTP
