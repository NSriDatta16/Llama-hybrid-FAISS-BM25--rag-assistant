Variance Components in Bayesian Analysis

I've been playing around with Bayesian ANOVA versus standard ANOVA, and seem to be getting a conflict in the results that I don't think is correct. I'm curious what folk think I might be doing wrong. Assume the following data which I've saves as some R output: source("https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jebyrnes/a7a84ddf34cd9a421d9e5263cab41c3c/raw/93d8b14561c9c5e08086f68b0b05e71850220541/data.r") OK, we can fit a standard linear model here and see the F table - anova(lm(PLP1.expression ~ group, data=brainGene)) ##Response: PLP1.expression ## Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F) ##group 2 0.54025 0.270127 7.8231 0.001294 ** ##Residuals 42 1.45023 0.034529 This is great. Now, when we do a similar bayesian analysis and get the means.. library(brms) library(emmeans) brain_brm We can see the residual sigma is about 0.19 Family Specific Parameters: Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Eff.Sample Rhat sigma 0.19 0.02 0.16 0.24 3454 1.00 OK, so, to compare this sigma to the variability due to the means, I'd like to look at the sd of those groups. We can use tidybayes to do this nicely. library(tidybayes) library(dplyr) group_sd % group_by(.draw) %>% summarize(group_sd = sd(.value)) But, looking at the quantiles, the values are much lower than sigma quantile(group_sd$group_sd) 0% 25% 50% 75% 100% 0.008755747 0.115908576 0.139315614 0.162789223 0.260032777 Compare this to the F table from the least squares fit where the F value was 7. I feel like I'm missing something very obvious here as to my calculation of the sd due to group. What's wrong here? As an added bonus, if I run a multilevel model brain_brm_h The sd due to group is 0.3 - making me even more suspect of my earlier calculations.
