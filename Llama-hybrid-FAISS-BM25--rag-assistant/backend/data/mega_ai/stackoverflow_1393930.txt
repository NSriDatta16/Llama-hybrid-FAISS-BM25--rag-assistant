The question you should ask yourself, to decide if the 100 line algorithm is fine as it is or not is: Is the intent with all parts of my code obvious? If you have a block of, say, 10 lines or so that does something not obvious, then putting it in a function and giving it a good name is much better than adding a comment or doing nothing at all. "Clean code" by Robert C. Martin is a book you might want to look into if you find that you're repeatedly asking yourself questions like this.
