People often do this. They carry out a PCA (although they often call it factor analysis) and then they use it to justify replacing the calculated weights with ones chosen from $\{-1, 0, 1\}$. Although this seems at first glance a strange thing to do there is a rather old paper @ARTICLE{wainer76, author = {Wainer, H}, year = 1976, title = {Estimating coefficients in linear models: it don't make no nevermind}, journal = {Psychological Bulletin}, volume = 83, pages = {213--217}, keywords = {glm, regression} } which suggests that in the field of multiple regression replacing the weights by integers gives a model which performs almost as well but may generalise better since it is not so reliant on chance features of the data. I do not know whether anyone has tried to replicate this in the field of PCA.
