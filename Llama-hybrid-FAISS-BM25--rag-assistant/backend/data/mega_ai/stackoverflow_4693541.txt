I'd use the language that gives me the best coverage by third-party libraries for what I'm trying to do; for manipulating video data that's probably going to be a mainstream language like C++. If this project is for fun/to learn a new language then by all means, take the road less traveled. But if this is something you need to ship in a reasonable amount of time, avoiding the best tools for the job because you don't like them is unsound strategy.
