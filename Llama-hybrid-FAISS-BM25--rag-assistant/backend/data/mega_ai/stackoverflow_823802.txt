Here is what I gather from the Dr. Dobbs Article reachable from the Princeton link you gave: Ternary Search Trees are up to 10% faster than hash tables on some search problems. They are sometimes slower - depending vastly on the machine used. TRTs are a custom data structure tuned by two of the finest minds of Computer Science - Jon Bentley and Robert Sedgewick both wrote good textbooks , and have done their share of practical programming. Hash tables are considered run-of-the-mill. The constants involved are significant, as Hao Wooi Lin says. Overall, this depends on the problem you are solving. The faster development time and almost ubiquitous support for hash tables in many programming languages are often more important than a ten-percent improvement in run time.
