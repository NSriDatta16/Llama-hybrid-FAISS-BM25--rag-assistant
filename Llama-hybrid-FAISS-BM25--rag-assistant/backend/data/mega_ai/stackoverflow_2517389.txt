This is related to Eclipse Bug 62712 which is fixed in build 20090329-2000 almost a year ago. In my Galileo of build 20090920-1017 it just works when I change the background color through General > Editors > Text Editors . Here's a screen (don't pay attention to the ugly color combo, my bg defaults to white and I just picked random yellow to demonstrate that the ruler background get changed as well): In other words, just upgrade your Eclipse to include this bugfix. Did you check Help > Check for Updates ?
