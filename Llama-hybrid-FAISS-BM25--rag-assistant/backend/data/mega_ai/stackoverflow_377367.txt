Depends on the definition of "elegant" :) However, with that many ZIP codes, I think you might want to manage them in the DB too. How do you decide which ZIP codes to match against? So you could put the ZIP codes in a table of their own and do SELECT cols FROM MyTable, ZipTable WHERE MyTable.zip = ZipTable.zip
