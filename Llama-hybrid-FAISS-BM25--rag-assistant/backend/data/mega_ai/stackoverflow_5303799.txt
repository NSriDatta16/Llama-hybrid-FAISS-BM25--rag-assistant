Reputation Formula - Best Approach

I have a table in Oracle that records events for a user. This user may have many events. From these events I am calculating a reputation with a formula. My question is, what is this best approach to do this in calculating and returning the data. Using a view and using SQL, doing it in code by grabbing all the events and calculating it (problem with this is when you have a list of users and need to calculate the reputation for all), or something else. Like to hear your thoughts. Comments * (.1) + Blog Posts * (.3) + Blog Posts Ratings * (.1) + Followers * (.1) + Following * (.1) + Badges * (.2) + Connections * (.1) = 100% One Example Comments: This parameter is based on the average comments per post. • Max: 20 • Formula: AVE(#) / max * 100 = 100% • Example: 5 /10 * 100 = 50% Max is that maximum number to get all that percentage. Hope that makes some sense. We are calculating visitation, so all unique visits / date of membership is another. The table contains an event name, some meta data, and it is tied to that user. Reputation just uses those events to formulate a reputation based on 100% as the highest. 85% reputation - Joe AuthorUser been a member for 3 years.
