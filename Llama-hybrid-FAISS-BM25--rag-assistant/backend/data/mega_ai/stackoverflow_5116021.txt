Databinding and INotifyPropertyChanged doesn't work

In my WP7 app I want to update the ApplicationTitle string on all pages at the same time, when something is changed. I've searched for ways of doing it, and people talk about using databinding and the INotifyPropertyChanged interface. However, using the samples i've found, I cannot make it work. I suspect the binding to be wrong, but haven't been able to spot the error. I have a class called "RegistrationQueue" which has the following code: public void Gem() { var settings = IsolatedStorageSettings.ApplicationSettings; if (settings.Contains("regqueue")) { settings["regqueue"] = _registreringsListe; } else settings.Add("regqueue", _registreringsListe); AppTitle = "LOGIMATIC A/S - " + _registreringsListe.Count + " registreringer i kø"; } And this: private string _AppTitle; // Declare the PropertyChanged event. public event PropertyChangedEventHandler PropertyChanged; // Create the property that will be the source of the binding. public string AppTitle { get { return _AppTitle; } set { _AppTitle = value; // Call NotifyPropertyChanged when the source property // is updated. NotifyPropertyChanged("AppTitle"); } } // NotifyPropertyChanged will raise the PropertyChanged event, // passing the source property that is being updated. public void NotifyPropertyChanged(string propertyName) { if (PropertyChanged != null) { PropertyChanged(this, new PropertyChangedEventArgs(propertyName)); } } Which is basicly a copy/paste from MSDN as far as I can remember. In one of my XAML pages I've written this: And I thought it would work, but it does not. What am I doing wrong here? Full XAML for the page: --> I've then written "DataContext = "RegistreringsKø"; " in the constructor for the XAML page (loginscreen.cs)
