Company website - devise a custom-built solution or ride on top of an existing service?

I've been asked to devise a website for a small organization (with limited funding) - with internal and external facing sides. Internally it would allow sharing of documents, a blog, goal setting, more? Externally it would provide a simple but nicely designed public statement about the company's services. It may evolve over time. Should this be a custom-built solution or does it make more sense to ride on top of a platform that provides this type of service (such as?)? If it's a custom built-solution, I'm considering doing this in Rails - would there be something like this already built for Rails?
