Confused about Pattern Recognition Network in Matlab Documentation

In the Matlab documentation for the Pattern Recognition Network ( patternnet() ), I am confused about a line of code in the documentation: [x,t] = iris_dataset; net = patternnet(10); net = train(net,x,t); view(net) y = net(x); perf = perform(net,t,y); classes = vec2ind(y); Why is y = net(x) ? So, I am assuming that y is the output vector, but why is it set to the column of the input vector, x ? I see that the net is the matrix containing the information from the train() function call, but why would it be asking for the inputs?
