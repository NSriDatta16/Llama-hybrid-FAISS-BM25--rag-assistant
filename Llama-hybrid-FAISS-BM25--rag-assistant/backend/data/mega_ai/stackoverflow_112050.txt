There are plenty of cons: Speed and responsiveness tend to be significantly worse Complicated UI widgets (such as tree controls) are harder to do Rendering graphics of any kind is pretty tricky, 3D graphics is even harder You have to mess around with logins A centralised server means clients always need network access Security restrictions may cause you trouble Browser incompatibilities can cause a lot of extra work UI conventions are less well-defined on the web - users may find it harder to use Client-side storage is limited The question is.. do enough of those apply to your project to make web the wrong choice?
