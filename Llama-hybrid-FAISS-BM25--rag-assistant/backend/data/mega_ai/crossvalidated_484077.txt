The model you are thinking about: Area ~ Peptide + ( Peptide | Reaction_Time ) doesn't really make sense. The primary interest is in the association of reaction times with Area, so reaction times should be a fixed effect. On the other hand, there are 32 Peptides, so fitting this as a fixed effect would involve a lot of estimates. Presumably we can also think of these 32 peptides as a sample from a wider population of peptides, and since there are repeated measures within each peptide, these three arguments favour treating peptide as the grouping factor. So the following model would make more sense: Area ~ Reaction_Time + ( Reaction_Time | Peptide ) This will estimate a global (fixed) intercept, being the estimated Area when Reaction_Time is zero, and a fixed effect for Reaction_Time which will be interpreted as the average linear slope - that is the estimated difference in Area for a 1 unit change in Reaction_Time . It will fit random intercepts for Peptide so that each Peptide has it's own intercept, and random slopes for Reaction_Time so that each Peptide has it's own slope for Reaction_Time . The random effects in most software will be assumed to follow a normal distribution, and an estimate of the correlation between the slopes and intercepts will also usually be estimated by default.
