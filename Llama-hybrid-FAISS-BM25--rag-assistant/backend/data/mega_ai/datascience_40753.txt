Sequences of time series data with only 1 output classification

So I'm facing a problem where I have a sequence (30h of data with 10sec intervals) and which is labeled to a class (3 different classes) for the whole sequence. I'm used to work with time series who have an output for each time sample in the sequence and now I'm block with this. So far I have thought of performing a statistical study of the sequence and create a dataset where each row contains the results of that study from a sequence and the target. This way I'll have a dataset with a Y for each X (but I'll lose a lot of information from the sequences) I come here to see if any of you have faced a similar problem before or if you have any ideas of how to approach this.
