A stochastic process is weakly stationary if its mean and variance and covariances are finite and do not depend on time. A moving average process of order q (with q finite), $MA(q)$ is defined as: $$y_t = \epsilon_t + \alpha_1 \epsilon_{t-1} + \alpha_2 \epsilon_{t-2} + \dots + \alpha_q \epsilon_{t-q}, \quad \epsilon_t\sim WN(0,\sigma^2), $$ and is weakly stationary for all the values of $\alpha_j$ . So, in your example it is true that the variance and covariances change, but you can check that both are finite and do not depend on $t$ (the covariance will depend only the distance $k$ ). Moreover, even a moving average process of infinite order $MA(\infty)$ : $$y_t = \sum_{j=0}^\infty \alpha_j \epsilon_{t-j}$$ can be stationary, but we need an additional condition in order to have a finite variance: $$\sum_{j=0}^\infty|\alpha_j|
