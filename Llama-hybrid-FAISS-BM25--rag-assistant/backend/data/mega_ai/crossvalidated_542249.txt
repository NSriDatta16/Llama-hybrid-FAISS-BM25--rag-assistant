One method is to learn the "threshold-response" function $$ v \mapsto E_WE[Y|A \geq v, W]$$ where $Y$ is your outcome, $A$ is your continuous variable of interest, and $W$ are variables to adjust for. You could plot this as a function of the threshold $v$ and see if there is any natural threshold or choose a threshold that leads to a sufficiently high average outcome. An easy way to implement this is to estimate $E[Y|A \geq v, W]$ for each $v$ separately using for instance linear regression or generalized additive models. Then average the predictions across all observations to get your estimate. Specifically, perform the regression of $Y$ on $W$ using only observations with $A\geq v$ for each threshold $v$ . If inference is wanted, there are ways to get this as well. If you have multiple thresholds for different continuous variables, you can also estimate $$ (v_1,v_2) \mapsto E_WE[Y|A_1 \geq v_1, A_2 \geq v_2, W]$$ for a grid of thresholds $v_1,v_2$ and then visualize the estimates with a 2d plot. It may also be worth looking at logic regression or decision trees which allow for adaptive learning of thresholds.
