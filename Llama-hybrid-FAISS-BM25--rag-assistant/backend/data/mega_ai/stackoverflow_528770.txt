well we've had the error occur twice which was a real pain fixing :- The insert failed. It conflicted with an identity range check constraint in database 'egScheduler', replicated table 'dbo.tblServiceEvent', column 'serviceEventID'. If the identity column is automatically managed by replication, update the range as follows: for the Publisher, execute sp_adjustpublisheridentityrange; for the Subscriber, run the Distribution Agent or the Merge Agent. When we tried running the stored procedure it messed with the identities so now when we try to synchronize it throws the following error in the replication monitor. The row operation cannot be reapplied due to an integrity violation. Check the Publication filter. [,,,Table,Operation,RowGuid] (Source: MSSQLServer, Error number: 28549) We've also had a few issues were snapshots became invalid but these were relatively easy to fix. However all this is making me wonder whether replication is the best method for what we're trying to do here or whether theres an easier method. This is what prompted my original question.
