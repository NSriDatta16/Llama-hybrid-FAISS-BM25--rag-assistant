I think it should be ok, But you don't need to construct an array of phone numbers, since you have varargs as a param in Person's constructor. You can directly call Person's constructor like this. Person p = new Person("JOHN", new PhoneNumber(numbertype.HOME, "123"), new PhoneNumber(numbertype.OFFICE, "456"), new PhoneNumber( numbertype.OTHER, "789"));
