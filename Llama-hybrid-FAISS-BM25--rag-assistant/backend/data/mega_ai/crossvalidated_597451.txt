Is it ok to widen a prior during an MCMC which did not converge yet?

I am calibrating parameters of a process model. The runtime of the model is high and the calibration already ran for more than two weeks with many cores on a HPC. After almost 150k iterations I realize that the uniform prior for one parameter was too narrow. Which means that the sampler is getting very close to the upper limit of this parameter. I would prefer to not run everything again just to widen the prior of this parameter. So, the fastest (and most efficient) solution is to just continue the MCMC with adjusting the limits of the prior. Is this ok? More specifically, does this have any consequences for validity of the posterior or the calibration?
