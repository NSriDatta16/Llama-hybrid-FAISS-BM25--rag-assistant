How to interpret t-SNE plot?

I want to know how to interpret t -distributed stochastic neighbor embeding (t-SNE) plots. In particular: 1) What information do they convey, besides showing clusters? 2) In PCA we can see loadings and interpret components as factors that explain variability in the original features. Is there a similar way to do that in t-SNE? Or, can we only say "The data were well separated with t-SNE but we don't know why."?
