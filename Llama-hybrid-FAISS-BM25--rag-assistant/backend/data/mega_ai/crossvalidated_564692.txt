Cluster on variable-length time series

I have a series like this: list_1 = [5,3,6,7,8,9,0,5,5,2,4,66,7] list_2 = [6,39,6,4,7] I would like to know Is all list_2 or subsequence list 2 the same cluster with all list_1 or subsequence list_1 . Note : I saw a post Classification on variable-length time series and I try to use DTW but it does not give good results and I try to apply more deep learning but get the same results What is the best solution for the cluster?
