Is it possible to reuse my CNN trained model over a new dataset with different number of classes?

I had used a trained CNN model (VGG16) over a large dataset with 6 number of classes in FC layer it gave me a good accuracy ( for example over Testing data: loss=0.59, accuracy=0.829). When I had applied the same model over a dataset with less samples and labels (4 classes) it reduced the accuracy. Here my question is : is it possible to use model 1 over the 2nd dataset (bec I had saved the attained weights) or it is not possible due to the difference in classes number? Also if I rerun my model 1 does the accuracy would be improved or no?
