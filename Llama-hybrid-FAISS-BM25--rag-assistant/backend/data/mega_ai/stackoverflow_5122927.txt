According to this link , rails scaffolding creates varchar(255) columns in mysql. The mysql documentation says the following about varchar(255): For example, a VARCHAR(255) column can hold a string with a maximum length of 255 characters. Assuming that the column uses the latin1 character set (one byte per character), the actual storage required is the length of the string (L), plus one byte to record the length of the string. My guess is that the column type in the database doesn't support characters that are represented by more than one byte. This link has more information about common pitfalls in rails when dealing with unicode strings and more specifically, it says you need to create your database as utf8 like so: CREATE_DATABASE my_web_two_zero_development DEFAULT CHARSET utf8;
