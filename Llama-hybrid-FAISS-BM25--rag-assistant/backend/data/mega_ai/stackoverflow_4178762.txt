Integer division vs double division - optimization question

Which operation should be faster on a x86 CPU on Linux and what are the average differences (in %): unsigned int x, y, z; x = y / z; or: double x, y, z; x = y / z; The operation on double will be executed by the FPU and the CPU may continue to other commands. Is it correct? Does it depend on compilation flags (I'm using gcc with the -O3 flag)?
