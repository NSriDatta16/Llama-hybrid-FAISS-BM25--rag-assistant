What are the latest and most succesful classification algorithms at the moment?

I have googled this for some time with no luck. All i get are tutorials or articles explaining the classic algorithms like linear regression, random forest, etc. I would like to know which are the most succesful recent algorithms at this moment for classification with an implementation in Python . I'm interested specially on ensemble methods, such like XG Boost , Catboost and Light Gradient Boosting Machines . Are there any other algorithms similar to these 3 mentioned above with proven sucess capabilities? I would appreciate any help from experienced people that have tried any. I know there is not such a thing like the best algorithm for anything, what i want to know is if there are any other algorithms that perform the same or better than the ones mentioned above in general. The goal is to solve classification problems using tabular data and supervised learning. Thanks in advance
