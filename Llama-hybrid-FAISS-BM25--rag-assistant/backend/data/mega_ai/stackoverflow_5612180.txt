In theory you can use the parse_url function to obtain this, via the PHP_URL_FRAGMENT option. However, in practice I'm pretty sure that there's no guarantee that the browser will pass this information to the server. (i.e.: It won't show up in $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] , so there's no way to pass this information into parse_url in the first place.) As such, you'd need to obtain this client-side via JavaScript and forward it to the server. To do this you can use window.location.hash . e.g.: alert('The hash value is: '+window.location.hash);
