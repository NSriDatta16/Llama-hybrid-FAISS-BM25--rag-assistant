Minimizing memory footprint in C programs

What are my options for minimizing memory footprint in C programs on Linux (*nix)? As far as I know libc malloc() is using either brk() or mmap(). Memory allocated with brk() usually cannot be returned because of memory fragmentation. My program should work 24/7 and it does a lot of malloc()-s and free()-s. After starting, RSS goes up to approximately 100Mb. It is too much, because I know for sure that in any particular moment there is less than 100 Mb data in memory. Probably it is brk() fragmentation issue. So, what re my options here? Should I use another malloc() implementation, which uses only mmap()? Should I do something else? Is there something I can read concerning memory footprint issue? Thanks.
