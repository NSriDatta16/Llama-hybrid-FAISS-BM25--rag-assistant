Can I limit users to a specific range and zoom level on Google Maps?

I'm implementing a Google Map on a web-page. For the purpose of this project, I want to limit how far users can drag the map, so that they can only view a certain area that falls within two co-ordinates (one specifies north-west, the other, south-east, if you get my meaning). What's the best way to implement this using the Google Maps API? Is there a method I can call that will do this automatically?
