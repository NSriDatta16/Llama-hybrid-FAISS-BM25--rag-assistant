The default Spacy English model en_core_web_sm does not support sentiment analysis (despite class Doc having a sentiment property). To add a sentiment analysis component to your Spacy pipeline, you can use the TextBlob library, by means of the spacytextblob Spacy component: import spacy from spacytextblob.spacytextblob import SpacyTextBlob nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm') text = "I had a really horrible day. It was the worst day ever! But every now and then I have a really good day that makes me happy." nlp.add_pipe("spacytextblob") doc = nlp(text) print(doc._.blob.polarity) # -0.125 print(doc._.blob.subjectivity) # 0.9 print(doc._.blob.sentiment_assessments.assessments) # [(['really', 'horrible'], -1.0, 1.0, None), (['worst', '!'], -1.0, 1.0, None), (['really', 'good'], 0.7, 0.6000000000000001, None), (['happy'], 0.8, 1.0, None)]
