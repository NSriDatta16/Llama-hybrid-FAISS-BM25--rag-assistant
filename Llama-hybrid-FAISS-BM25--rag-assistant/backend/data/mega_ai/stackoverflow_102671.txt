If you want to generate passwords that are easier for users to remember, take a look at Markov chains. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain This algorithm can produce nonsense words that can be pronounced, so they also become easier to remember and to relay over the phone. A little Google-fu can get you some code samples in just about any language. You would need to also obtain a good dictionary to filter out any passwords that come out as actual words. Of course, these are not going to be high-strength passwords, but are really good when you need some basic access control on something and you don't want to burden your users with hard to remember passwords.
