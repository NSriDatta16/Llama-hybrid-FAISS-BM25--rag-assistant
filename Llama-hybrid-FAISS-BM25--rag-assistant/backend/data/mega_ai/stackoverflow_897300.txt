How to set amcap's default color space to YUY2?

AMcap is a app for capturing video or to preview from webcam. Its source code comes with Microsoft Windows SDK as sample. I want to (bypass the following process of user interaction in amcap code or say want to) set it as default: Ampcap menu Options Video Capture Pin ... Color Space/Compression: YUY2 Output size: 1600x1200 I have a compatible webcam and works fine on changing manually to YUY2 and 1600x1200 in AMcap app. By default it is: Color Space/Compression: MJPG Output size: 160x120 I tried to find 'YUY2' string in whole project, but I could not find it, so that I could hardcode it. It seems it is created dynamically and then operated; refer: in the file amcap.cpp nearby line no 3395.
