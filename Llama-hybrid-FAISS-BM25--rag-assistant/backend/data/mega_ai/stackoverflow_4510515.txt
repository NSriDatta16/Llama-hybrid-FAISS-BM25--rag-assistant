Creating SVG fragments with Javascript and Strings

I've seen several examples about how to use the DOM api to create SVG fragments from within Javascript, but I'm curious is there something I can use to create a SVG fragment from a string similar to innerHTML. I've tried this following: var svg = ' Hello World ' var range = document.createRange(); return range.createContextualFragment(svg); Problem is createContextualFragment() with SVG blows up with an exception in Chrome. So is there a cross browser way to do this?
