Try the GeckoFix script at http://code.labor8.eu/geckoFix , it detects the Firefox lower than 3.0 so you can customize it how you want (i.e. by adding more rules to it like detecting Firefox 2, Firefox 3, Opera and Safari). I think it could be what you're looking for. To check user agent just type in your address bar javascript:alert(navigator.userAgent) and find some specific characters you'll need to type in script.
