It's not whatever "server headers" but regular arrays. To output array contents, a programmer usually makes use of a loop , and then format output in the manner they wish: . foreach($_SERVER as $key => $value){ echo " $key: $value \n"; } Note that your output being gigantic only because you're printing out the contents of $GLOBALS variable, which being completely useless for you.
