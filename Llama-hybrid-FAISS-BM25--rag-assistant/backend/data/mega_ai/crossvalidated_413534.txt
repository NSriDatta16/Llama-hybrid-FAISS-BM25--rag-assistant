My approach ( given that it is not intermittent demand data ) is to reverse forecast. Take your time series and arrange it from last to first (without tailing zeroes) and model it to obtain predicted values for the unrecorded past. See https://stats.stackexchange.com/search?q=user%3A3382+reverse+forecasting . Additionally some researches use the term backcasting to fill in /estimate values that went unrecorded. Also see hindcast What is the proper name for a backward forecast?
