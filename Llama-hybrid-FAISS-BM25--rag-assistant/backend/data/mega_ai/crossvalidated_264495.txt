The correct way to do it would be use the median for the train data as the threshold as the transformations that are applied on the training set are to be replicated as it is on the test set. The same is true whenever you are performing normalization, also check out this link on scikit-learn . Notice that the fit transform method is called on the train set and only transform is called on the test set meaning that the transformations are repeated. You need to perform normalization on the test data (your new input data) only if you have done so on the train set(your experimental set) ,and in that case just call transform and not fit transform on your test set. Whether to perform normalization or not depends upon the algorithm used for machine learning for example Random forests can work without normalization also but logistic regression would require normalizing.
