Import an existing python project to XCode

I've got a python project I've been making in terminal with vim etc.. I've read that XCode supports Python development at that it supports SVN (which I am using) but I can't find documentation on how to start a new XCode project from an existing code repository. Other developers are working on the project not using XCode - They won't mind if I add a project file or something, but they will mind if I have to reorganise the whole thing.
