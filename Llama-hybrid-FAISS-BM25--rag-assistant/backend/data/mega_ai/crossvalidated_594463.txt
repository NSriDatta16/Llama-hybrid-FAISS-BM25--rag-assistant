How to specify nonlinear Bayesian regression model?

I'm a little confused about how to specify a regression model in Bayesian terms. I understand that for the simple case of plain linear regression, the response variable is normally distributed about the mean, which varies linearly, like so: $$ Y \sim N(\beta X, \sigma) $$ where $\beta$ and $\sigma$ are drawn from priors and an intercept can also be added. My data (sample shown below) are roughly exponentially shaped. Values can be zero, but not negative. My first impulse was to try a model with $Y \sim N(\lambda e^{-\lambda X},\sigma)$ , but I'm not sure if this makes sense and, anyway, it would allow for negative values but shouldn't. Ultimately, my goal is to estimate the variance along this curve , getting a distribution as a function of the variable on the horizontal axis. Is there a standard approach?
