Javascript this object inside intervals/timeouts

I have a method that is a big setInterval statement, and it needs access to the this object of the object that owns the method from inside the interval. I implemented a simple closure, but it doesn't seem very elegant: connect: function(to, rate, callback){ var cthis = this, //set cthis to this, connectIntervalID = setInterval(function(){ if(cthis.attemptConnect(to)){ //reference it here, clearInterval(connectIntervalID) cthis.startListening(10) //here, callback && callback.apply(cthis, []) //and here } }, rate) } You could also do it with apply or call , if you wanted to use this instead of cthis connect: function(to, rate, callback){ var cthis = this, tempFunc = function(){ if(this.attemptConnect(to)){ clearInterval(connectIntervalID) this.startListening(10) callback && callback.apply(this, []) } }ï¿½ connectIntervalID = setInterval(function(){tempFunc.apply(cthis, [])}, rate) } However, that seems even worse...
