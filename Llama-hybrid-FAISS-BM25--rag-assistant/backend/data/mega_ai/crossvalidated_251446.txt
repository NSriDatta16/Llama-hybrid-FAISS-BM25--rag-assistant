What model to use: Feature importance at each rank

My dataset contain a set of ordinal features and a rank from 1 to 10 which I'm trying to predict. I'm looking for a way to understand which feature is most important at each rank. Which model is best to use to get this information? Would learning-to-rank models (RankSVM ...) work in this case? I'm not dealing with queries in this case.
