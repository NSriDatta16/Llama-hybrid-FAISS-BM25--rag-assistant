objective-c touch-events

I've got a set of Images and would like to know which I have touched. How could I implement that...? To be more precise: A "Home-Class" will instantiate a couple of Image-Classes: Image *myImageView = [[Image alloc] initWithImage:myImage]; The image-class looks something like this: - (id) initWithImage: (UIImage *) anImage { if ((self = [super initWithImage:anImage])) { self.userInteractionEnabled = YES; } return self; } later on, I use these touches-event-methods also in the Image-class: - (void) touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event{} - (void) touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event{} My problem at the moment: the touchesBegan/Ended methods will be fired no matter where I touched the screen, but I would like to find out which of the Images has been touched.....
