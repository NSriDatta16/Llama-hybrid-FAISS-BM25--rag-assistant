which metrics are suitable for density-based clustering validation?

I'm working on a project where I use several clustering methods, mainly density based ones such as hdbscan, optics... I'm looking for a metric to evaluate clustering results that takes into account outliers and different forms of clusters. One of the evaluation metrics I found is DBCV, it hasn't received enough attention in the datascience community, so I'm not sure about its robustness. Also in runtime it is unsuitable when we have several thousand points, even in two dimensions. DBCV source code: https://github.com/christopherjenness/DBCV
