Question: If you're planning on building an Azure based system, why are you choosing to build it in PHP rather than C# on ASP.NET? .NET is Microsoft's primary platform for web infrastructure development: Azure support will come quicker and will be FAR more thorough for .NET vs. any other platform. Remember: "Just because you can doesn't mean you should" ;) I strongly encourage you to build your Azure site in .NET, not PHP.
