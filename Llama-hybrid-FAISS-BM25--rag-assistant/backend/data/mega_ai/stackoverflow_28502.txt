The biggest benefit is that it will help you understand or even uncover the architecture of your application. You'll be able to see very clearly how your dependency chains work and be able to make changes to individual parts without requiring you to change things that are unrelated. You'll end up with a loosely coupled application. This will push you into a better design and you'll be surprised when you can keep making improvements because your design will help you keep separating and organizing code going forward. It can also facilitate unit testing because you now have a natural way to substitute implementations of particular interfaces. There are some applications that are just throwaway but if there's a doubt I would go ahead and create the interfaces. After some practice it's not much of a burden.
