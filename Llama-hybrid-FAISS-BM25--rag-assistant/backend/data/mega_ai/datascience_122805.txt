In the pattern, the w column is 1.32 plus a bit of noise. In the noisy data it is 0.0 to 1.0. In other words you can drive a bus through the gap between your two targets, and that is just using one of the 4 inputs. I thought that reaching overfit was easy, as long as you increase the number of nodes. Overfitting due to adding more model capacity is when you have random noise in your data that such as a perfect split can't be done except by paying attention to the noise. See figure 1 at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting for instance. In your case the red and blue points are far enough apart that you can draw the simple black line through them, and not have to resort to the over-fitted green line. BTW, if I've not mis-read your code 80% of your data has the pattern, and target is 1 , 20% is uniform random values, with target 0 ? In which case a model could also learn just to guess the majority class. (50% of the time it is a 1 , then the other 50% it only does something one quarter of the time, and three times out of four it creates no data, so the data is in a 4:1 ratio.)
