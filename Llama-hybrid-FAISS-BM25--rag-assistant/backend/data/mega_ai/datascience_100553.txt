Classification of scanned documents in pdf files using deep learning or NLP

I know classifying images using cnn but I have a problem where I have multiple types of scanned documents in a pdf file on different pages. Some types of scanned documents present in multiple pages inside the pdf. Now I have to classify and return which documents are present and the page numbers in which they present in the pdf document. If scanned document is in multiple pages I should return the range of page numbers like "1 - 10". Input will be pdf files containing scanned target documents Output should be classified "Document Name" and Its "page numbers" Can any one guide me on how can I a build a model that can address this problem. Thankyou
