Determining if a subset of values are statistically deviant from the whole

I have a set of sports scores in Google Sheets. I have various subsets of scores for which I calculate the averages and standard deviations, e.g. scores by team, scores by slot, scores by the game for the team. I thought I would perform T-tests (which I barely understand) to determine if particular subsets are statistically significant deviations from the overall, but it seems that Google's T-Test function requires the two ranges to be the same size. What's the right way to determine if it's statistically interesting that (for example) the first games played by a team have an average score of 12.1, while the second games have an average of 15.6?
