wrapfig is the best i've found, however, you need to put the wrapfig code above the paragraph you want it to wrap into: \usepackage{wrapfig} \begin{wrapfigure} \includegraphics... \end{wrapfigure} This is the paragraph of text you want the figure to "wrap" into... etc etc. If you put the wrapfig code under the paragraph you want to wrap into, it will obviously wrap into the next paragraph, producing an undesirable result. you also mention a 'column' which makes me think you are using a multi-column layout, which probably isn't going to work that well with wrapfig. When asking a specific question about latex, you should include a minimal working example, that is, enough of your preamble and body code/text so that people can recreate your problem. EDIT: Ah. i see what you mean. wrapfig can take an optional line height argument: \begin{wrapfigure}[line-height]{r}{width} where line-height is a positive integer. your solution would probably look like this: \begin{wrapfigure}[10]{r}{2.5in} \centering \includegraphics[width=2in]{governator.jpg} \end{wrapfigure} EDIT #2: wrapfig/floatflt + enumerate, itemize = not working. the packages are incompatible with one another. For a "wrapfigure" effect with an environment, i.e., enumerate, itemize, etc etc., You should put the environment in a minipage and the graphic in in a minipage, then set the two minipages next to each other. something to the effect of (i put them in a tabular environment as well): \begin{tabular}{l l} \begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth} \begin{enumerate} \item \end{enumerate} \end{minipage} & \begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth} \includegraphics... \end{minipage} \end{tabular}
