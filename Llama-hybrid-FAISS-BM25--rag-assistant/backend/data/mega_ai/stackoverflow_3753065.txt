What you need to do is use shared code. you do this by adding an existing file to a project. In the add file dialog there is a arrow on the button that exposes the add as link option. the point of this is that you cna have 2 projects which target the different CLR's but contain the same code and namespace references ... you can leverage these to have code that works on both versions of the CLR very simply. Its really quite powerful. I have one set of tests that can target both versions. Of course you are limited to the set of common functionality but that is implicitly part of your requirements anyway. You cna even pass the objects over a service and have them deserialise nicley into the other CLR. Kinda suprising how well you can use the symetry I am currently using this for aproject and am achieving what you want and after a few hours of playing with really suprisingly painless. regards
