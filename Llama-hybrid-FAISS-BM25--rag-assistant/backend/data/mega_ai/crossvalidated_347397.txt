Using $R^2$ to evaluate out-of-sample performance

In this paper the $R^2$ is used to evaluate out-of-sample predictions for several methods including neural networks and tree based methods (see section 3.3 Evaluation and Validation). How is the out-of-sample $R^2$ computed and is it a valid performance measure? Edit: The link did not work. I fixed it now.
