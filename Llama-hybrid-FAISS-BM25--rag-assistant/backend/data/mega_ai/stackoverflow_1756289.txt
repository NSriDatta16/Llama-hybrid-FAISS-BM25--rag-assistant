Yes - Lucene records the offset of matching terms in a file, so that can be used to figure out where in the indexed content you need to look for matches. There is a Lucene.Highlight add-on that does this exact task for you - try this article , there are also a couple of questions on StackOverflow concerning hit highlighting (many of these are tailored to use with web apps and so also do things like surrounding matching words with tags) UPDATE: Depending on how you search your index you might also find that its a good idea to split your large documents into smaller sections (for example chapters) as well - however this is more a question on how you want to organise, prioritise and present your results to the end user. For example, supposing a user does a search for "foo" and there are 2 books containing that term. The first book (book A) might contain 2 chapters each of which have many references to "foo", however the term is barely mentioned in the rest of the book, however the second book (book B) contains many references to "foo", however they are scattered around the whole book. If you index by book, then you will probably find that book B is the first hit, however indexing by chapter you are likely to find that the 2 chapters from book A are the first 2 hits, followed by the chapters from book B. Finally, obviously the user will be presented with 1 hit per matching document you have in your index - if you want to present your users with a list of matching books then obviously index by book, however you might find it more appropriate to present the user with a list of matching chapters in which case obviously index by chapter.
