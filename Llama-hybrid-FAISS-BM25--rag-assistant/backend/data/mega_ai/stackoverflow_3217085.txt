You might have a look at the Apache Felix File Install . To quote from the intro: File Install is a directory based OSGi management agent. It uses a directory in the file system to install and start a bundle when it is first placed there. It updates the bundle when you update the bundle file in the directory and, when the file is deleted, it will stop and uninstall the bundle. So, all you need to do is to write a task that copies your bundle to the install directory.
