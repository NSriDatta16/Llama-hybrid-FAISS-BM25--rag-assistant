Using Amazon's EC2 service for storing video feeds and subsequent playback for client

We're planning to setup a server to record videos and save them using Amazon's S3 service. Subsequently we need to provide a mechanism to end users to view those videos online. Is it possible to store files on S3 in such a way that they are streamed to user's browsers, in a way similar to how video is visible on youtube? We haven't made a call on the video format storage mechanism so that decision is still open. Inputs on that (which enable the above) are welcome!
