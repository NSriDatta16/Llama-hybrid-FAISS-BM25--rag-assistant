One more thing to be aware of; some .NET objects require 'contiguous' memory. i.e if you are trying to allocate a large array the system may need not only sufficient free memory in your process but also for all that free memory to be in one big chunk... and unfortunately the process memory gets fragmented over time so this may not be available. Some objects/data types have this requirement and some don't... I can't remember which ones do, but I seem to recall StringBuilder and MemoryStream have different requirements.
