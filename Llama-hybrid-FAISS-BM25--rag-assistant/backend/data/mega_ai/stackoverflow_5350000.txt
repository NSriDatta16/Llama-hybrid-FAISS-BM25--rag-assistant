As I understand, you don't like that, when image is not do wide as other the padding do not change and always stays the same, right? I used Opera Dragonfly to investigate why is that, and when you look at you can find that styles of this element are: style="width: 578px; height: 399px;" . So either jQuery/JavaScript set this styles after page load and it stays the same all the time or you was the one who set it like that. No wonder why padding is constant. Possible Solutions: Always use images with the same width and height. Make changes to the script that it would change width of to fit the actual image.
