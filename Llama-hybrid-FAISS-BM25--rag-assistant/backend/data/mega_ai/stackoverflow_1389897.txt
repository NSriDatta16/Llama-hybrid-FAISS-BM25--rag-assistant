Share resources among siblings

I am looking for a method to share resources among siblings. For example, if the parent class has a File handler, is there a way in which I need to open and close a file only once. Seems like a simple problem but I can't figure it out. I know I can pass the resources as parameters but is there a more elegant way ?
