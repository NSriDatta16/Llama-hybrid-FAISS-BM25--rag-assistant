Ruby BigDecimal sanity check (floating point newb)

Is my understanding correct that with Ruby BigDecimal types (even with varying precision and scale lengths) should calculate accurately or should I anticipate floating point shenanigans? All my values within a Rails application are BigDecimal type and I'm seeing some errors (they do have different decimal lengths), hoping it's just my methods and not my object types.
