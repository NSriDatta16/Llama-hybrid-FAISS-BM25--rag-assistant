ClearCase Snapshot Views: exclude one particular directory from load statements?

Good morning, is there any way to exclude only one particular directory from a snapshot's load statement, e.g. I want to load a whole vob named ' PM_CT ' except the \PM_CT\lost+found directory ... is there an elegant way to do it? And how would I generally exclude all lost+found directories across multiple loaded vobs? Cheers and Thanks, -JÃ¶rg
