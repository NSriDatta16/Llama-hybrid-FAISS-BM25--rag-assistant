You're already using git: why not use version control to organize your exploration? Create a new branch for each new "branch" of your exploration, and fork off branches for different versions of plots as well. This method will make it slightly more difficult to combine your end results, but you could always maintain an untracked directory where you could drop in the "gems" of your analysis. You'd probably want to somehow label your files in this directory to indicate which fork/commit they came from. This method has the added benefit of making it really easy to contrast different analyses via the diff command.
