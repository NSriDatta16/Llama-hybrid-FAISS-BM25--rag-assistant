The only way I know to do this is to get the .app file in Mac, put it into a folder called "Payload". Then you have to ZIP this folder and change its name from "Payload.zip" to "MyAppName.ipa". Mac will ask if you are sure you want to change the extention, select "YES". Now you can drag and drop this file into itunes. There's no other way to do it afaik. Windows makes problems with the macosx "fork" files (if you open the .app file there is a folder named "_MACOSX" or similar... and windows breaks this).
