Platform independence is a desirable feature for software vendors because they invest a large amount of money developing a modern, sophisticated application so they don't want to artificially cut out any market segment. They want to sell their baby to as many organizations as possible. Software vendors try to convince IT departments that platform independence is a good thing because it avoids vendor lock-in. I'm sure that is importance, in theory; however, in practice most IT departments self impose vendor lock-in with their attitudes, usually concerning a particular technology vendor of high prominence.
