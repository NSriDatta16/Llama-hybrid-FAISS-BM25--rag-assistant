Visual Studio 2010 Slow to Load

I have been happily using VS 2010 for several weeks without any performance problems. I installed dotCover from JetBrains several days ago and things continued to run well, but ran my first code coverage test earlier today. I double clicked on one of the report results and it successfully took me to the referenced line of code. I inadvertantly right clicked on the line of code, brining up the context menu and the navigate menu item was hightlighted. Moments later, Visual Studio froze and subsequently crashed. I closed and reopened and Visual Studio wouldn't open cleanly. I uninstalled dotCover and was able to get Visual Studio to open, but it took several minutes just to get to the project open screen. I also am showing that devenv.exe quickly runs up to 1,500,000 K and doesn't ever recover. I'm not sure what it was running at when I wasn't having problems, but I can't believe it was this high. I am now doubtful that the problem was with dotCover, but maybe some intellisense cache or something. Who knows? I do seem to get some relief when I set an Above Normal priority on the devenv.exe process, but the machine doesn't appear to be cpu bound. Has anyone seen similar problems or have any suggestions?
