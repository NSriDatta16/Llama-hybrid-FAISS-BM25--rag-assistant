Here's how I'd do it in R. Note, I have used your original data with self-transitions (non-transitions) included. You can do the same thing with the "compressed time series," however. Say I have already constructed an edge list from your example data in the form of the following matrix el It captures the facts that state $1$ followed state $1$ (i.e., no transition) four times, state $1$ followed state $2$ twice, and so on. I now capture this same information in the form of a square $3 \times 3$ matrix. X Now I want the elements to represent proportions with respect to the rest of the elements in their own row only. That is, rows should sum to $1$ meaning that in every state there will be some transition with probability $1$ and the individual elements of the row capture the distribution of that probability across all possible next states. X These proportions can be taken as the transition probabilities. Here we see that the probability of transitioning from state $1$ to state $3$ is found at location $X_{13}$ and is equal to $0.11$. This is to say that of all the observations of the system being in state $1$ ($9$ times not counting the last one that offered no information about transition), in approximately $11\%$ of them (once) the process transitioned to state $3$.
