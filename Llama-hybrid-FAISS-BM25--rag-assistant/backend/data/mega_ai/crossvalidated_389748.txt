Anyway i can improve this multi class classification result?

I am building a multi class classification model using SVM to predict the grade for essays. What can I do to improve the result especially for class 1 and class 3? Their precision and recall are really bad. Things I have done: 1. Split train:test set to 70:30 2. Oversample the training set using smote 3. Scale the feature by using StandardScaler from Scikit-Learn 4. Perform parameter tuning by using GridSearchCv from Scikit-Learn to get the best parameter
