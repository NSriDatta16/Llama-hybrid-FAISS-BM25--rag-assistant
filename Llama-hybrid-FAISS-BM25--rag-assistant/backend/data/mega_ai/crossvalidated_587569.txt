How to estimate sampling coverage of a sample from unknown categorical distribution?

Sorry it seems a pretty basic question, but I cannot find any clue in my probability theory and statistics textbooks. Let $$X\in D$$ be a categorical random variable of unknown distribution P on domain D, where D is an unknown limited domain. Let (S,C) be a sample of X, where S={x 1 ,x 2 ,...,x n } be unique values in the sample, C={c 1 ,c 2 ,...,c n } be frequency of each unique value. How to estimate the following coverage and weighted coverage? coverage: $$v=\frac{|S|}{|D|}$$ weighted coverage: $$w=\sum_{x\in S} {P(x)}$$
