You can try to use an SVM with a Gaussian kernel. A Gaussian kernel will yield a smooth boundary. From the plot, it seems this is the case (?). With properly tuned parameters (parameter C in SVM, and Gaussian width), the SVM should be able to classify the two classes. Parameter tuning can be done by cross validation. Many SVM packages will do it for you automatically given a list of parameter candidates. In general, you do not need to come up with a formula for the decision boundary. That is the job of a learning algorithm. You may want to rescale your variables before training an SVM.
