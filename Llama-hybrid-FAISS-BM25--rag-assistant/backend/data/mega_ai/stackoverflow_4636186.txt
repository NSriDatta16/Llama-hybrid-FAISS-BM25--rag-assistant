Evaluation of gwt.xml

I'm new to GWT and trying to understand the role of gwt.xml. The documentation says that one can specify things like where you can specify different implementations based on, say, the current user agent. My question is: who evaluates these rules and when? What part of the execution stack deals with gwt.xml? Can the rules be modified runtime, by the way?
