Birthday puzzle

I need some help with Bayesian statistics likelihoods. Consider the following question: Given a number of persons. Each person $p$ knows $n(p)$ other persons â€“ $p$ 's neighbourhood $N(p)$ . Knowing a person $p' \in N(p)$ may imply (as an assumption) that $p$ knows if $p'$ was born on the same day as $p$ (neglecting the year). The probability that there are $k$ persons $p' \in N(p)$ born on the same day as $p$ is $$P_1(X = k\ |\ n(p) = N) = \binom{N}{k}\alpha^k(1- \alpha)^{N-k} $$ with $\alpha = 1/365$ . Now consider a survey where each person $p$ was asked how many of the persons $p$ knows were born on the same day as $p$ . Let the result of the survey (the evidence) be a distribution $P_2(X = a)$ giving the frequency that the answer was $a$ . By which ( Bayesian ) argument can be told which distribution $P_3(X = N)$ of the size of neighbourhoods $N(p)$ is the most probable one that would yield $P_2$ ? $P_3(X = N)$ gives the probability that a person has a neighbourhood of size $N$ . Before that: Is this question even well-posed and correctly worded? Which tacit assumptions have to be made explicit, possibly? Edit : Maybe it's easier to ask and answer what the most probable mean neighbourhood size $\overline{N}$ is, assuming that it is distributed a) normally, b) Poisson, c) scale-free.
