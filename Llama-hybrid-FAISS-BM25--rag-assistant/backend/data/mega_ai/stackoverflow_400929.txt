Applet User-agent

This is a simple question, but I didn´t found any documentation about this. When an applet makes a request, how is the user agent of the request. I want to know the applet user-agent expression to detect if a request comes from an applet. I make two test, with IE7 and Firefox 3.0.5 with JDK 1.6.0_03 and the user agent was "Mozilla/4.0 (Windows 2003 5.2) Java/1.6.0_03" in both, but I can´t generalize from two test. Thanks in advance, Jonathan.
