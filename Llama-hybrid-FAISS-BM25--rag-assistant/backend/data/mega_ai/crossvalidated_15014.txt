Comparing classifier performance

I used a SVM to perform classifications on the same sample and I get the following results: Good classifications: baseline : 78% transformation 1 : 79% transformation 2 : 63% I do not know which test to use to tell if the performance difference is significant (ie. is the transformation 1 really better than transformation 2?). Which is the adequate test? Note: transformations are transformations performed on datas (i.e. : different imputation method for missing values).
