Do i have to unsubscribe from anonymous event handlers of local variables?

If I have a code that looks something like this: public void Foo() { Bar bar = new Bar(); bar.SomeEvent += (sender, e) => { //Do something here }; bar.DoSomeOtherThingAndRaiseSomeEvent(); } Will bar be collected when the method runs out of the scope, or will I have to manually unsubscribe from the event to prevent a memory leak because of a reference to SomeEvent ?
