What are useful evaluation metrics used in machine learning

I am using CNN in order to predict codes after analyzing text. As an example, I will write "I am crazy" .. the model will predict some code " X321". All this based on CNN. I want to evaluate my model. I used Fscore (recall and precision). Can you advice me more metrics?
