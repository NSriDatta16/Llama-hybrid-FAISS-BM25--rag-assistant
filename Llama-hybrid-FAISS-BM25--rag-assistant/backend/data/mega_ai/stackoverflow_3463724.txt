Section 8.4 of the Java Virtual Machine specification states that a double or long that is not declared volatile is treated as two 32-bit variables for load, store, read and write operations. Furthermore, the manner of encoding and the order of the two 32-bit operations is not defined. The spec does encourage implementations to make the operation atomic but they do not require it.
