You should output a tensor of a shape (5,3) treated with softmax along second axis. The label (aka target variable) may look for ABACC like this: [[1 0 0] [0 1 0] [1 0 0] [0 0 1] [0 0 1]] The output of the model will be numbers from 0 to 1, summing up to 1 for each row. So you have to use argmax (again with axis=1) to get answer that you can then interpret as letters: [[0.9 0.05 0.05] # -> A [0.2 0.8 0.0] # -> B [0.4 0.5 0.1] # -> B [0.0 0.01 0.99] # -> C [0.05 0.05 0.9]] # -> C Which you will interpret as ABBCC . BTW, before going with NN, try a simpler model, e.g. random forests to predict those letters.
