Dip in xml does not work for different screen density in android simulator

I'm testing multi dpi in android, and the layout xml file seems like this: When I run it on a 480x800 mdpi(160) simulator (scale to 7 inches), it works fine, but on a 480x800 hdpi simulator, it PADDING the EditText down to the near bottom of the screen, nearly 600px, is that 400dip x 240 / 160 ? And It seems has no difference with screen size even I scaled it to 4 inches. How to let padding work under different screen density? Thanks a lot!
