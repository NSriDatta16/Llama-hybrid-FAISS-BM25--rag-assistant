How to get localStorage to work in a WebView in Xcode?

I've got a WebView in a Max OSX Cocoa Application in Xcode. This WebView is attempting to use HTML5's localStorage to save some data. It's technically working as expected (the data is getting/setting fine while the application is running), it's just not persisting when the application is closed and then reopened. Any ideas on how to get localStorage to persist as expected?
