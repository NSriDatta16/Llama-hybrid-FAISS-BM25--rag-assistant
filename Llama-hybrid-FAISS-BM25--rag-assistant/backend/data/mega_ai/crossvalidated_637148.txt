Ordinal Logistic Regression SPSS Interpretation

I have data from a questionnaire study structured like so: Age - Ordinal (18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55+) Gender - Nominal (Male, Female) AnxietyType - Nominal (Self-diagnosed, Professionally diagnosed) AnxietyYears - Scale ChronicPain - Nominal (No, Yes) Response - Ordinal (Strongly Agree, Agree, Neutral, Disagree, Strongly disagree) I am using SPSS to run an ordinal logistic regression with 'response' as my dependent variable and the other 5 as my independent variables. When putting the data into SPSS I have coded it as follows: Age - (18-24, 0) (25-34, 1) (35-44, 2) (45-54, 3) (55+, 4) Gender - (Male, 0) (Female, 1) AnxietyType - (Self-diagnosed, 0) (Professionally diagnosed, 1) AnxietyYears - Scale ChronicPain - (No, 0) (Yes, 1) Response - (Strongly Agree, 1) (Agree, 2) (Neutral, 3) (Disagree, 4) (Strongly disagree, 5) When I run the regression, this is my output with a significant result highlighted in yellow. From what I've read and understood about interpreting the results of an ordinal logistic regression, this is saying that: "The odds ratio of being in a higher category of the dependent variable for males versus females is 2.244" which is saying that males are more likely to agree more strongly than females. However, when I create a graph looking at the split of responses between males and females it shows that females are actually more likely to agree more strongly than males. I would be grateful if anyone could help me to understand what I'm doing wrong - either in my modelling or my interpretation.
