HTML form input to update paragraph

I have a multi line input text box in a webpage and want all the entered text to update another area of text in the page. How would I be best to achieve this? At the moment, I have it that when you submit the form, php writes the input to a small text file which is then embedded in the page. But, do I need to sanitize this so that people don't inject html. Also, do I need to make it add ... tags for every line in the input box? Thanks.
