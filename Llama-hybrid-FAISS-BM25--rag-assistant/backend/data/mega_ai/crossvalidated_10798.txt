Measures of autocorrelation in categorical values of a Markov Chain?

Direct Question: Are there any measures of auto-correlation for a sequence of observations of an (unordered) categorical variable? Background: I'm using MCMC to sample from a categorical variable and I'd like a measure of how well the sampling method I've developed is mixing across the posterior distribution. I'm familiar with acf plots and auto-correlation for continuous variables, but I've been stuck looking at the transition probability matrix for this categorical variable... Any thoughts?
