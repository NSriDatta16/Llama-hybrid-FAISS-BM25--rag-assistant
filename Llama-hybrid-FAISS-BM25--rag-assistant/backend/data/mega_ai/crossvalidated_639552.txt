Setting priors for categorical variables in bayesian multilevel model analysis with BRMS package (repost)

I am reposting the same question that I made on Stack Overflow . I am new with Bayesian analysis methods and I am still struggling understanding some concepts regarding priors. I am running a model with two categorical non-ordinate predictors: TOV, which has three levels (TYPEWORD1, TYPEWORD2,TYPEWORD3). Group, which has two levels (GroupSPE and GroupCONT). Every level is "nominal", i.e. doesn't contain values but only specifies a variant of the same object and they are encoded with numbers (e.g. GroupSPE is 0, GroupCONT is 1). Regarding the variable "Group", having two levels means centering it, if I understand correctly (e.g. $\text{Normal}(-0.5,0.5)$ . However, the two groups differ in the fact that both speak three languages, but one of the three is different between the groups). Does it means I have to code it in a different way with priors? What is concerning me mostly is TOV, which has three levels. In which way I have to choose priors in this case? All I know from references is that usually TYPEWORD3 is read slower than TYPEWORD2 and TYPEWORD1, and that TYPEWORD 2 is read slower than TYPEWORD1 but faster than TYPEWORD3. However, from previous analyses I saw that my model goes again these results, given the fact that in my model TYPEWORD1 is read slower than TYPEWORD 2 and 3. As I said before, I am new with Bayesian methods. Thus, if you could show how to code properly priors with practical dummy examples with the same features, would be really appreciated.
