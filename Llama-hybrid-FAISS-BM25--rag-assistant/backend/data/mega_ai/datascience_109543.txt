Assuming that sequences does not have any semantic meaning, we can adapt string distance measure like hamming distance or Levenshtein distance to compare similar sequences. Every entry in the list of sequnces will be considered like string and return similarity between sequnces. Libarary for these distance should be easily available in python. For Sequence completion you could use something like Hidden Markov Model or Sequence models like RNN or LSTM. Clustering may be a little diffcult on this. You could have done Hierarchical clustering on distance matrix but given 1000s of sequences this may be very slow.
