What questions is your data team hoping to answer?

I'm interested in hearing about what statistics problems other data teams are trying to tackle. For me, I have data on energy usage in the United States, and we are trying to figure out ways to forecast energy demand as well as figure out ways to balance heavy loads on the power grid. The statistical challenges are in short term and long term time series forecasting. Regime changes such as weekdays -> weekends further complicate the problem, as well as external factors like whether variables. Spatial correlation is also a nontrivial issue. What type of data do you have, and what questions are you hoping to answer? What statistical challenges are there?
