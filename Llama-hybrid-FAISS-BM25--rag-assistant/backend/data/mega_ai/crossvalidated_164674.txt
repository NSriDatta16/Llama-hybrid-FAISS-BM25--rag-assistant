Machine Learning Book (Python)

I'm in search of a good book about Machine Learning. Requirements: Good theoretical depth (while being a ML beginner, I hold a degree in mathematics), but accompained with good examples and plenty of practical stuff. Python as language for presenting examples, with R as a second option. Not outdated. In some other ML book advices on stackoverflow, many suggest "programming collective intelligence", but it seems a bit old (2012).
