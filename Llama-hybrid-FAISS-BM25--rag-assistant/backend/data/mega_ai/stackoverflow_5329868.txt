A 2D FFT is equivalent to applying a 1D FFT to each row of the image in one pass, followed by 1D FFTs on all the columns of the output from the first pass. The output of a 2D FFT is just like the output of a 1D FFT, except that you have complex magnitudes in x, y dimensions rather just a single dimension. Spatial frequency increases with the x and y index as expected. There's a section in the FFTW manual ( here ) which covers the organisation of the real-to-complex 2D FFT output data, assuming that's what you're using.
