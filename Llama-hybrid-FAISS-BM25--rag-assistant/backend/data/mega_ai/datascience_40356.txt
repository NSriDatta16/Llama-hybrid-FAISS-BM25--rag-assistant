How many Hidden Layers and Neurons should I use in an RNN?

I am very new to neural networks and machine learning and I have been making a Bitcoin price predictor to learn it. I was wondering about the number of hidden layers I'd need in a recurrent neural net using LSTM cells. I have 60 inputs for 30 previous days' close prices in 12-hour intervals and require 1 output for the future 12 hours. I am doing this with Keras in python 3.6. Any help would be awesome!
