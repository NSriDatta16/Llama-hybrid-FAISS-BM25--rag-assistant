Regarding the feature generation method with SVM-based classification method

When using SVM to build classifier for a collection of documents, we can use term occurrence, term frequency or even TF/IDF. I would like to know what are the main disadvantages of using term occurrence as the vector generation method? I once heard that this vector generation method can cause support vector machine to fail. How to explain this?
