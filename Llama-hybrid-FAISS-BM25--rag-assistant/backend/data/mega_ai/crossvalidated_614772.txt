Summing two equal means with equal standard deviations and calculating the sum's resultant standard deviation

Having looked at the discussions for similar questions I find none quite equate with this apparently simple case I present here. It has been calculated that the average age between female generations in the past is 23.2 years +/-3 (1 sigma). So if I go back two generations this will be on average 46.4 years, but what is the standard deviation now? Is it just the sum of the variance (ie the variance of 9 doubled) that results in an SD of 4.2? If I go back three generations the time difference will be 69.6 years +/-? Should be very straightforward? Thanks in advance.
