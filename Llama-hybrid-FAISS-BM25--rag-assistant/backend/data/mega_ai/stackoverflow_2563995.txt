I would seriously suggest you the following things: Use a "server" solution, rather than a desktop solution. That's far more reasonable if you want to share the VM environment with other developers. Use VMware's products rather than Microsoft's. From these two points it follows that you should use VMware ESX Server and related products. If you don't want to / can't invest money in it there's a free version of this product: http://www.vmware.com/go/getesxi/ , but I never used it. Whether you choose to use the enterprise version of ESX server or the free version, I suggest you put your IT organization's IT department on it.
