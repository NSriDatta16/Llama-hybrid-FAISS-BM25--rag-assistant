The results from CART can change easily (with realistic sample sizes) with small perturbations to the data. If this is the case, it seems the interpretation is not a straightforward as it seems. I've often heard some of my colleagues avoiding random forests because of difficulties in interpretation. They are built more for prediction. Even the variable importance measures that come out are based on predictive performance, but they do help with interpretation.
