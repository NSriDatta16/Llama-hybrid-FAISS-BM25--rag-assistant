You can treat this as an equivalence testing problem. What you want to do is estimate an interval for each group then check if that interval is within a given range. Without sampling error, you would expect each group to have 1/7 as proportions exactly. But with sampling error, this would not be the case. As your sample size increases, the sampling error will reduce. So because of sampling error, you should decide a-priori what the acceptable range is. To elaborate, $1/7 \approx 14.29\%$ . You can decide a-priori that the acceptable error is. For my example, I'll go with $2.5\%$ , so $14.29\%\pm 2.5\%$ is our range. If the confidence interval for the frequency of each group is within this range, then we have equivalence. If the confidence exceeds this range, then we do not have equivalence. Here's a complete example. Since you mention that you have a huge sample size, I will assume a total sample size of 3500. This means we expect each group to have a frequency of 500. In R: set.seed(12345) # For reproducibility n We see that the frequencies are pretty close to 500 for each group. Next, we run our Poisson regression using the groups as predictors of the counts: mod In this model, I predicted frequencies using 0 + Group which has the effect of removing the intercept. So we get an expected log frequency per group. For the results: mod # # Call: glm(formula = Freq ~ 0 + Group, family = poisson, data = dat) # # Coefficients: # GroupA GroupB GroupC GroupD GroupE GroupF GroupG # 6.186 6.194 6.190 6.232 6.215 6.280 6.201 # # Degrees of Freedom: 7 Total (i.e. Null); 0 Residual # Null Deviance: 36520 # Residual Deviance: 1.332e-13 AIC: 70.37 If we exponentiate any of those coefficients, we will obtain the original frequency for that group. Next, we obtain confidence intervals on these expected log frequencies: (lims Let's re-organize the lims object so the lower limit is the first column, estimate is in the middle, and upper limit is last. Also exponentiate to place everything back on the frequency scale: (lims We now have our limits. And so we want all these values to be between: (range We can plot these results to see how well we're faring: library(ggplot2) # plotting library lims $Group Group notes In this example, all the confidence intervals are within the bounds. So we have equivalence. This image from the Wikipedia article on equivalence testing and the remainder of the article is a decent explainer of what we're looking for. You can reduce the interval to say $\pm.01\%$ or even smaller if your sample size gets really large and you want tighter bounds. Reducing the bounds below what you even desire is a good idea because of multiple hypothesis testing issues. Hope this helps.
