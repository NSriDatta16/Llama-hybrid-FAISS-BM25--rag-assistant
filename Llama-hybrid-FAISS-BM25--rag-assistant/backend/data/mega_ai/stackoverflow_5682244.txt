have you looked at the drop event ? basiclly, in .net/wpf 4, there is a DragDrop class to help with these matters. Here is the MSDN documentation on the matter. [EDIT] From what I am seeing, you are dragging/dropping an image. I think what you need to do is, instead, make some custom object that holds your image AND some data. if you make the image a dependency property, you can bind to that in your listbox item, and then in your drop event, access the other properties in order to get the data that you want.
