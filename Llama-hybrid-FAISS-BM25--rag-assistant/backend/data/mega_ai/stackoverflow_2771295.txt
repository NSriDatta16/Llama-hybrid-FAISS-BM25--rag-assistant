I've just evaluted a number of skin components. Suiskin. Very easy to install (Just run .exe) Very easy to use. Skins standard components well. Does skin whole app (Needs extra line of code for any non-auto-create forms). Good demo and good range of skins. Alpha Controls Great library of appealing skins Brilliant demo program. Installation: Have to compile 2 packages and then install one of them. Do-able but not as profession as Suiskin. Skinning components work well. Skins the whole app well. Skins standard controls and also have their own component set, which gives more options. Help is translated and is only average. Help on using the skin editor is difficult and a little incomplete. Can set hue offset and saturation. Hue offset is brilliant.. basically rotates all skinned colors on the colour wheel by the given amount. so.. blue ==> pink whilst yellow ==> green etc. Basically means that one skin suddenly comes in 4 to 6 decent color schemes. Skin editor came with bug.(I use XP) Couldn't set the directory to hold the skins. This was the first (& essential) step. Found that by putting the executable in the folder with the skins it could find them. After this, the editor seemed very efficient. Don't believe the web site that tells you that the basic licence is just for 1 year. It is a lifetime licence with just 1 year of included updates. Felt like Alpha skinning application was done by someone capable who gave it great power and efficiency, but didn't bother with the fine points(like help and looking professional and some minor bug fixes). I actually went with this component set. KSDEV Professional install Skin editing program ran smoothly and professionally. Felt it was not as efficient in editing skins as alpha skins. This was one reason I didn't go with KSDEV. Professional website with good demo program. Good range of skins, but didn't feel as excited as alpha skins. This was the other reason I went alpha. I believe this component set also had a hue offset option. (It was this or suiskin, can't remember) VCLSkin very few sample skins to view on website (that I could find). Couldn't find a demo program if there was one. downloaded vcl component set, but in the zip file it said it was netskin. At this point I gave up.
