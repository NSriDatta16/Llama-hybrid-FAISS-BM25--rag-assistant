Bootstrapping on Regression Coefficient

I want to see if my logic is correct. Say that I have 250 data samples and for each of the sample I run a simple OLS $y=\beta x$. I then have 250 $\beta$. Now my objective is to see if, on average, these $\beta$ are statistically significant. I can't simply take the average of the T-Statistics coming from my 250 OLS regression. What I had in mind (and I believe this is the common practice) is to bootstrap a distribution using my sample estimates of $\beta$. Hence, if I bootstrap $n$ distributions and get the 95% confidence interval around the mean of my $n$ distributions, is it acceptable for me to see if each of the estimated $\beta$ (from my 250 OLS regression) fall outside of this confidence interval and claim for instance that 80% of my estimated $\beta$ are statistically significant?
