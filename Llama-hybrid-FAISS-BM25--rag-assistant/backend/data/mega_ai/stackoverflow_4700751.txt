You could try changeing the value instead, and do settings["birthyear"] = birthyear.Text; settings["postcode"] = postcode.Text; And maybe also try casting your settings as type IsolatedStorageSettings. EDIT: settings.Remove("birthyear"); settings.Add("birthyear", birthyear.Text); settings.Remove("postcode"); settings.Add("postcode", postcode.Text); settings.Save(); Becomes: settings["birthyear"] = birthyear.Text; settings["postcode"] = postcode.Text;
