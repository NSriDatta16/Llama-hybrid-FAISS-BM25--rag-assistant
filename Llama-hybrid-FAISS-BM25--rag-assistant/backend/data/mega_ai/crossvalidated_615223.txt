How to perform MCMC posterior sampling of $X+Y$ random variable?

Let $X$ follow normal distribution with mean $\mu_X=10$ and variance $V_X=20$ . Let $Y$ follow truncated normal distribution with mean $\mu_Y=-10,V_Y=8$ , where $Y\leq 0$ by truncation. Let $Z=X+Y$ . Denote $z_1,\dots, z_N$ be $N$ realizations of $Z$ . Now I want to recover $\mu_X,V_X,\mu_Y,V_Y$ . Suppose I put appropriate priors on $\mu_X,V_X,\mu_Y,V_Y$ . $Q:$ How do I conduct MCMC posterior sampling for $\mu_X,\mu_Y,V_X,V_Y$ ? Looking at the likelihood of $Z$ , I do not find an easy way to implement Gibbs sampling. Is it possible to conduct MCMC by data augmentation?
