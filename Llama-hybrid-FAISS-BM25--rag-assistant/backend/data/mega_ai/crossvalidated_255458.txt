GLMM, Random Effects (etc.) on sales data?

I have two years of sales data on a daily basis of 2,000 products. I am not really interested in Time Series modelling but rather on some sort of count data model. The issue is that sales are really sensitive to promotions so it's difficult to model them. In the following plot you can see how it looks like (sorry for the axis, I can't disclose what company and quantities it is about). So sales are quite steady but when there is a promotion (e.g. 50% discount) sales increase a lot in just a single day. I have tried with a model such that: $Sales=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}DayWeekAverage + \beta_{2}MonthAverage + \beta_{3}Promotion + \beta_{4}Timetrend + \varepsilon$ Where WeekAverage is a factor variable (dummies) for each day of the week, and MonthAverage for each month. The problem of this model is that it's very simple and only manages to model 1 product at a time. I think a panel structure to model the 2,000 products may be good enough because there is heterogeneity in te effects between products. I have thought on a Generalized Linear Mixed Model, but I'm not sure if this may do the trick. Also a Random Effects model may be good enough. What do you suggest? What other models would be good to model this kind of data?
