Reduce or Increase Dimensionality? Machine Learning

I had a question about machine learning and dimensionality. In many machine learning methods, we try to reduce the dimensionality and find a latent space / manifold in which the data can be represented, i.e. neural networks taking in images In other methods like SVM/kernels, we try and find a higher dimensional space so we can separate/classify our data. Why are these two machine learning methods doing completely different things with dimensionality? Or does it instead depend on the task at hand (i.e images being extremely high dimensional data so we want to lower it)? Or am I misunderstanding something? Thanks
