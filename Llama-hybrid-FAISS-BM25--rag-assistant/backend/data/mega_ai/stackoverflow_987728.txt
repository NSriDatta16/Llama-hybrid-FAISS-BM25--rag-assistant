Are you sure that you are building the config file correctly? Rick Strahl just wrote an excelent article on this very issue: http://www.west-wind.com/WebLog/posts/753705.aspx Usually when you embed a custom control into a page you need to add a @Register tag like so: in order to get a control to work in the page and show up with Intellisense. If you’re using the visual designer to drop controls you probably won’t notice this requirement because the designer automatically adds the assembly and namespace dependency for you into the page. However if you work in markup only as I do mostly, it’s often annoying to first have to register the control on the top of the page and then go back to actually embedding the control into the page to get Intellisense. An easier and application global way to do this is to declare your namespaces and control tags directly in web.config and have them apply globally: The controls section is what provides effectively the equivalence of the @Register tag in pages and once you’ve defined the tag prefix there the @Register tag is no longer required in the page. Hope that Helps, Jim
