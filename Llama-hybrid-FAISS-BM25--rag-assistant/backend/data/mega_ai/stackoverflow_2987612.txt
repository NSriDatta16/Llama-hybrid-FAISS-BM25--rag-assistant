@arul, @Doug Why did you put the time part at the end of the GUID? I thought that the leading bytes are more significant for ordering, and ordering is why the time part was introduced in the first place to prevent index fragmentation. Ok, I found the answer , and this answer from Bernhard Kircher and the site Comparing GUID and uniqueidentifier Values (ADO.NET) he references to. GUIDs generated this way would therefore not work the same way on other databases than MS SQL-Server but this is not related to LINQ-to-SQL. Sorry for the deformed URLs but I have not enough reputation to post more links.
