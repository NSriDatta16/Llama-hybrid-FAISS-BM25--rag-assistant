You tagged your question with vae , so I will assume that this is a variational autoencoder. In that case, your loss has 2 components: reconstruction error and KL divergence of the bottleneck distribution, probably balanced with a weight $\beta$ . You should plot both components separately in order to understand how the training dynamics evolve. The reconstruction loss is what will tell you if there's overfitting. The KL divergence will tell you if there is posterior collapse .
