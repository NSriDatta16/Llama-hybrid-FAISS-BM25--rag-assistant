I would go out on a limb and say that this is impossible in vanilla XSLT. With access to user-definable extension functions it is easy to offshore it to some language better suited, as you already indicated yourself by magic-here($in) . I don't think XSLT has a way to cast a number into a byte array. I can't point out a relevant section in the spec to prove it, though. Maybe someone else digs up the right paragraph. XSLT is supposed to be deterministic and side-effects free, and as such it is highly unlikely that it provides a native way to access implementation specific details like the internal number representation.
