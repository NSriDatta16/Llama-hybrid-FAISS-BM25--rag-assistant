The practice for word2vec is to use only target (hidden) embeddings. But there are some works (for example this paper ) about combining target vectors with context vectors. It's not always the case that you will achieve better results by combining embeddings. In the GloVe paper , the authors achieved a small boost in performance by summing these vectors.
