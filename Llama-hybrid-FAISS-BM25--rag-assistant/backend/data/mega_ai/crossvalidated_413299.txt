What do ellipses of PCA analysis (factoextra) mean?

Biological question: do plants that have been attacked by insects differ in their characteristics from plants that have not been attacked by insects? Data frame includes six numerical variables describing different plant traits and one categorical defining plant status (with insects/ withouth insects) To answer this I performed a PCA analysis in R using the "factoextra" package. I plotted individuals with "fviz_pca_ind" function separated by the category "with insects" and "without insects" and included ellipses. My problem: what does the argument "ellipse.level = 0.68" from "fviz_pca_ind" function mean? Confidence intervals? Standard deviations? Or simply percentage of individuals inside the ellipse? library(factoextra) res.pca My next question is: what analyses would you recommend me to show whether these two groups are statistically different? (in this case they are not, but anyway) Thanks!
