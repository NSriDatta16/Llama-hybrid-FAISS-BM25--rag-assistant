In my case, I was dragging crash reports directly from Mail to the Organizer. For some reason, that prevented the crash reports from getting symbolicated (I'd love to know why). Copying the crash reports to the Desktop first, and then dragging them from there to the Organizer got them symbolicated properly. Very specific case, I know. But thought I'd share just in case.
