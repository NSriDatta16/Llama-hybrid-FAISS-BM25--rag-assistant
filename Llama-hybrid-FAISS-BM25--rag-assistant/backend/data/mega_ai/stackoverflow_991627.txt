I think you are misusing render(:file). This is definitely not how it is intended to be used. Rendering a partial is supposed to be used to render a modular piece of erb (or whatever template lang you use) code in multiple places, not a data-load technique. You're using it (it appears) to load dynamically changing data. I think what you're really trying to do is fragment caching, but without more context, I could be wrong. For a great walkthrough on fragment caching: http://www.railsenvy.com/2007/3/20/ruby-on-rails-caching-tutorial-part-2 Probably your cron job would run a script/runner script that would create the fragment you're looking to cache. If I'm off base here, please try to clarify what type of file you're loading and what you're trying to accomplish.
