How can we activate a WPF trigger in XAML when a drag operation is occurring?

We're looking for a way to base a WPF trigger in XAML on whether or not we're in a drag-drop operation. Depending on if we are or not, we want different hovering behaviors which is why this is needed. The only way I can think of is to handle the drag start and end events and manually track the state, but that requires a code-behind, not pure XAML. Plus it seems like complete overkill, especially since we'd have to do it on every potential drop target which is a real pain. So is there an easy way to say 'Hey... I'm in a drag-drop operation so make this trigger active' or am I out of luck here? Update To clarify what we are trying to do, currently in pure XAML, you can create a style, then set a style trigger to examine the IsMouseOver property to say, draw a background highlight. Well, we want to do this, but we want to say if 'IsMouseOver' is true and if IsDragging = true then apply this trigger.
