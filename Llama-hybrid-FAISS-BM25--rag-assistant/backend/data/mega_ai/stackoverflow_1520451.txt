It is better to set the localization property on each form -- that will extract not only the strings, but also the geometry of the various components, into the base .resx file. With the nominated languages, it is quite unlikely that the original sizes of the components will be a good fit for the translation. It is generally not recommended to compose strings out of fragments because they in general will not map into the same pattern of fragments in a different language. Use of formatted strings ( String.Format ) to drop in values, yes, but anything that relies on the grammar and sentence order of the original language is unlikely to fit.
