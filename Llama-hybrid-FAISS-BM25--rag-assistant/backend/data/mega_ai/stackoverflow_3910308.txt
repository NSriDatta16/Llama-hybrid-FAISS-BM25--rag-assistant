From the W3C draft: User agents should expire data from the local storage areas only for security reasons or when requested to do so by the user. User agents should always avoid deleting data while a script that could access that data is running. You'll want to do your updates on your schedule using setItem(key, value); that will either add or update the given key with the new data.
