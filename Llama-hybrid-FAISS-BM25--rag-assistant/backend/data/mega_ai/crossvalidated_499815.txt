The setup of this test means that you, on average, score a zero on a question where you guess randomly, same as if you leave it blank. This is true regardless of how many questions you answer. There is a 50/50 chance of getting +1 from a guess, 50/50 chance of getting -1 from a guess. $$ E[X] =\sum_x xp(x)= (1)(0.5)+(-1)(0.5) =0 $$
