I think it's because it provides a preferred location and scale to the embedding. The preferred location means that the loss is no longer translation invariant, which is useful when you're working with floating point, while the preferred scale gives the margin parameter meaning. Without the hypersphere restriction, I think inflating the margin by a factor of $c$ would just scale all the embeddings by a factor of $\sqrt{c}$.
