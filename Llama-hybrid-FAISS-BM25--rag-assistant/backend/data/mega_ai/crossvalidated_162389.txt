I recommend starting with a model that includes an athlete-level intercept to account for the repeated measures within athlete, which is probably the most important hierarchical aspect of this system. I would then include population-level effects for jump (or jump cluster of you prefer to group jumps as you mentioned), ACL-injury indicator, and limb. Limb and ACL you would treat as factor variables. Limb would effectively be a set of dummy variables, with one limb chosen as the reference group. I don't know if you tested all four limbs separately, but if you did, you might consider having limb instead coded as upper-lower and left-right indicators, which you may want to interact with both each other and the handedness of the athlete if available. You might even consider a second order interaction between handedness, limb, and side of body. And then of course there are the possibilities of interaction effects among handedness, body side, upper/lower, and jump order (your fatigue measure). With all of these possible interactions you may want to use a modeling framework that will provide some automated variable selection and regularization to reduce the effects of multicollinearity and to ameliorate the curse of dimensionality. If you are looking for a regularized regression-modeling framework that allows for random effects and is really good for balancing the need for good predictions against the accessibility of easily-interpretable parameters, I suggest you try mboost (for a boosted option) or possibly MCMCglmm for a fully Bayesian option. The mboost package has the added advantage of allowing for smoothing splines to be included in the model as well as linear effects and individual level intercepts.
