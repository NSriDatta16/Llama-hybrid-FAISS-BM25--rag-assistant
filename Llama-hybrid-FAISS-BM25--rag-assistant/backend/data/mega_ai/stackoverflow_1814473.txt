Yes Since you incremented array , you no longer have a pointer to the [0] element, but a pointer to the [1] element. Do this: array->name = strdup("Robert"); array++; array->name = strdup("Jose"); return array - 1; Keep in mind that in C p[x] is nothing more than *(p + x) , or, if you like, and think about this one: (p + x)[0] . That last case is what your program was effectively doing, with x == 1. So (p + 1)[1] is the same as p[2] , and there is nothing there, hence your null result. (You can also write that as... array++->name = strdup("Robert"); array--->name = strdup("Jose"); return array; ...but if you do, a bunch of people will come along and downvote you. Was it really that hard to read? It is really our goal to write only uninspired clunky code?)
