In my field (analytical chemistry), absolute error / absolute value = relative error , so relative RMSE [at mean x] would be understood easily. I'd clarify that the value I divide by is the average, as often the relative error at the extreme values is used: error specification of measuring instruments often is relative error at maximum value in (chemical-analytical) calibration the relative error at the limit of quantitation or the lower limit of the actual calibration is important.
