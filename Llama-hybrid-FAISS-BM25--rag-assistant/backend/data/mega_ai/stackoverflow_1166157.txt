Tutorial Using R on an Amazon Ec2 using just browser for building a regression model

Assume I have huge huge data and no money for hardware for more RAM for R AND software like Windows or any non open source . Just an internet connection. and an university Amazon ec2 account. Could you please guide me to a step by step- copy and paste coding tutorial on building a model using any Package on Amazon ec2. Note- I know BIOCEP can do this, and Robert Grossman gave a tutorial on using R on Amazon Ec2. I just need a tutorial that say uses a R GUI like Rattle to build model on Amazon Ec2. Assume I am a statistican with no knowledge of Amazon ec2 or using R there
