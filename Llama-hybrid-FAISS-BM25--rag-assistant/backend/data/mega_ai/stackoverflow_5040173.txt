As you've found out, there are no easy ways to create a map with multiple inputs or multiple outputs directly from the BizTalk Mapper. The correct way is indeed to do this from a BizTalk orchestration. One way to do this that do not require to move the generated maps afterwards is to create an empty orchestration in your Maps project. This orchestration can be discarded when no longer needed. If you must move maps from one project to another, however, please, pay attention to the following points : Imported Schema Location .Net Namespaces Imported Schema Location When you create a map, the location of the input and output schemas is recorded in the generated .btm file. This location, however, takes two forms, depending upon the location of the map relative to the location of the imported schemas. If the map uses a schema that is declared in a referenced assembly, the location looks like the fully qualified name of the .net type that is generated. This is certainly the case if you have generated your maps from your Orchestrations project but it references schemas from your Schemas and Maps project. If the map uses a schema that is declared in the same project/assembly, the location is recorded as a relative path name. When you move your maps from one BizTalk project to another, you must restore the correct way to declare the schema locations. Open up the .btm file in a text editor and change the fully qualified name to a relative path like this: ".\imported_schema.xsd" .Net Namespaces Additionnaly, if you have moved your maps from one project to another, you might want to update their .Net namespace. At the time of creation, a .net namespace is associated with your map and corresponds to the one from the project it has been generated in. You can change this namespace from from the .btmp file properties in Visual Studio Solution Explorer. This way, you will always have consistent naming across all artifacts from the same project.
