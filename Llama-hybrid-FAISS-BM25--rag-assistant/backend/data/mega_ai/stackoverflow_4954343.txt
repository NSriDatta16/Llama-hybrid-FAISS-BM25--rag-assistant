I haven't done this, but I discourage this. This could cause odd things to happen. In a similar vein, Apple says not to use UIWebView inside of a UIScrollView. The reason is because a web view is a subclass of the scroll view. Nesting them can cause unexpected behaviors. Note that the table view is also a subclass of the scroll view. While Apple doesn't explicitly mention your case, I assume that it is the same idea. If yo must, subclass UITableViewCell and see what happens. It's not that difficult. Make the cell implement the UITableViewDelegate protocol.
