What Alexander said. The lab is the home of Lua, after all. Specifically, LuaInterface can allow a Lua interpreter to be embedded in your application so that you can use Lua's own parser to read the data. This is analogous to embedding Lua in a C/C++ application for use as a config/datafile language. The LuaCLR project might be fruitful at some point as well, but it may not be quite as mature.
