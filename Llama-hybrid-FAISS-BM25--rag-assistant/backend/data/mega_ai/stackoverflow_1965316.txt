I think atompub REST API is a great example of a restful service. See the snippet below from the atompub spec: POST /edit/ HTTP/1.1 Host: example.org User-Agent: Thingio/1.0 Authorization: Basic ZGFmZnk6c2VjZXJldA== Content-Type: application/atom+xml;type=entry Content-Length: nnn Slug: First Post Atom-Powered Robots Run Amok urn:uuid:1225c695-cfb8-4ebb-aaaa-80da344efa6a 2003-12-13T18:30:02Z John Doe Some text. The server signals a successful creation with a status code of 201. The response includes a Location header indicating the Member Entry URI of the Atom Entry, and a representation of that Entry in the body of the response. HTTP/1.1 201 Created Date: Fri, 7 Oct 2005 17:17:11 GMT Content-Length: nnn Content-Type: application/atom+xml;type=entry;charset="utf-8" Location: http://example.org/edit/first-post.atom ETag: "c180de84f991g8" Atom-Powered Robots Run Amok urn:uuid:1225c695-cfb8-4ebb-aaaa-80da344efa6a 2003-12-13T18:30:02Z John Doe Some text. The Entry created and returned by the Collection might not match the Entry POSTed by the client. A server MAY change the values of various elements in the Entry, such as the atom:id, atom:updated, and atom:author values, and MAY choose to remove or add other elements and attributes, or change element content and attribute values.
