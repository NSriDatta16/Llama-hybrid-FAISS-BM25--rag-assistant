You test set should not be included. TF-IDF is a transformation, you should apply it separately to your train and test matrices, after it has been extracted from your train data. I think this article could help you, here's the relevant excerpt: A subtle point about feature scaling is that it requires knowing feature statistics that we most likely do not know in practice, such as the mean, variance, document frequency, â„“2 norm, etc. In order to compute the tf-idf representation, we have to compute the inverse document frequencies based on the training data and use these statistics to scale both the training and test data. In scikit-learn, fitting the feature transformer on the training data amounts to collecting the relevant statistics. The fitted transformer can then be applied to the test data. From Chapter 4. The Effects of Feature Scaling: From Bag-of-Words to Tf-Idf in Feature Engineering for Machine Learning published by O'Rielly press.
