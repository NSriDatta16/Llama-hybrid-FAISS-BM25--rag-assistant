It depends on the browser as to what gets generated. Internet Explorer will mostly generate whatever it likes, often unclosed image tags in upper case. That's often how it will look if you inspect the DOM directly, even though it may render correctly. Firefox is more likely to do what it's told. However, in both browsers if you have invalid XHTML somewhere in your page you may be throwing the rendering engine into Quirks Mode - in which case it will do its best to render the page in the way the old-style browsers would, in being able to deal with virtually any markup you give it and at least present something to the user. The side-effect is that your efforts at standards-compliant elegance may be ignored and rendering won't appear as you expect it. So I'd look to the rest of the page first and make sure it's fully XHTML compliant, and then JQuery and the DOM should play along nicely.
