I would venture to say that NHibernate is the incumbent, and presently most popular option. The current version (4.0 by name, 2.0 by "design") of Entity Framework (EF) has marked improvements over v1.0, which has issues that led many would-be adopters to adopt another solution, namely NHibernate, or roll their own. As for the future, NHiberte has a solid following and is a mature product, whereas EF 4.0 needs to make amends for the many sins and shortcomings of the previous version, while still having its own issues, and being relatively young as a technology.
