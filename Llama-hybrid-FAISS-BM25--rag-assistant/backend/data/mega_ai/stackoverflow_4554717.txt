The interface is just a definition of methods without implementation. If you are not implementing the methods what will they do when you call them? On the other hand, an interface is not necessarily implemented by the calling class. So in your case HulkHogan can call another object's savePerson() method, without implementing it itself. But some class has to implement it somewhere for it to do something.
