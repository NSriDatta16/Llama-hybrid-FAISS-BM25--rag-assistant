Best way to create a wix fragment file based on User-defined directories to be used in MSBUILD

In the spirit of this question by Si here: WiX tricks and tips . I am trying to determine the best way to get create wix fragments based on a directories. File harvesting, so to speak. For example under the bin\release folder I could have many different folders plus files that I want to capture very easily in fragments. I have been doing this by typing them or using wixedit. Please note I haven't tried anything just done the reasearch here: A)I read a little bit on heat.( http://installing.blogspot.com/2006/04/heatexe-making-setup-easier.html ) I am not sure though about running it from msbuild? B)I found this blog article from Newagesolution which discusses using t4 script: http://blog.newagesolution.net/2008/06/how-to-use-msbuild-and-wix-to-msi.html I would like to know what others are doing to solve this.
