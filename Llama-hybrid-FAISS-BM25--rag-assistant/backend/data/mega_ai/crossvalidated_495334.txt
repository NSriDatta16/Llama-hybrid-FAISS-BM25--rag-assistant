I would be extremely wary of any rule of thumb such as this: a level 2 sample size of 250 organizations and level 1 sample size of 40 individuals per organization will be sufficient. For one thing, sufficient for what ? For another, a lot depends on the correlations within clusters, the higher the correlation, the lower the effective sample size. In my opinion the best way forward here is to do a power analysis by simulation. If you use R, then the simr package would be a good place to start: https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.12504 https://humburg.github.io/Power-Analysis/simr_power_analysis.html
