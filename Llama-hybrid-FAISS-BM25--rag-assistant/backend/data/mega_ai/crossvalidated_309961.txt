What should my goal for effective sample size be when doing Bayesian parameter estimation?

I have found some mixed messages in terms of the effective sample size to shoot for (ranging from 2,000 to 10,000) here . I'm wondering if anyone could give me more information on choosing a guideline for effective sample size? In particular, I am using a No-U-Turn Sampler.
