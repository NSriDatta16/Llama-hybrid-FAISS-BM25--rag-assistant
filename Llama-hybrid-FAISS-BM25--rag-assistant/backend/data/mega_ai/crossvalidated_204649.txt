Checking noisy data from random forest

I am running a randomforest on some unbalanced data with five classes (different behaviours). I have downsampled my data to address the balance issue but I believe there is a substantial amount of noise in one of my classes as it is often misclassified. I would like to go back and see which observations are being predicted wrongly to check that the original data is not mislabelled. Is there a way to do this?
