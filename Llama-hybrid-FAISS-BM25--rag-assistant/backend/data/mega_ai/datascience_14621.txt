You could try including "Does not have a 2nd floor" as a separate categorical variable, which you could encode as 1 or 0 in your linear model. Something like: price ~ no_second_floor + area_of_second_floor + [Other Variables] Event without the other variables, it's already going to be able to fit the data better than price ~ area_of_second_floor because, instead of forcing the price of the single-floor houses to $0, it would be able to fit it to the average price of all the single-floor houses in your data set - which is the best you can do for those houses until you add other variables besides area_of_second_floor . (Actually, it wouldn't be forced to $0 if you were to include a constant term in your model, but the constant term that best lets you fit the linear portion of the data still probably isn't what you want for the single-floor houses, some of which - as you see - are quite expensive).
