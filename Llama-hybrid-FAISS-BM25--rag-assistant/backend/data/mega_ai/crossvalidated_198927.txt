Is there a reason you're not comparing the locations of the green stars and yellow balls directly? In essence, take the average position of green stars and yellow balls in X, and then do the same for Y. We now have information on X and Y based upon the green balls and yellow stars that we can directly compare using any of the common techniques (cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, etc.).
