django fragment caching for anonymous users only

I want to use django fragment caching for anonymous users, but give authenticated users fresh data. This seems to work fine: {% if user.is_anonymous %} {% load cache %} {% cache 300 "my-cache-fragment" %} I have to write this out twice {% endcache %} {% else %} I have to write this out twice {% endif %} The only problem is that I have to repeat the html to be cached. Is there some clever way around this, other than putting it in an include? Thanks.
