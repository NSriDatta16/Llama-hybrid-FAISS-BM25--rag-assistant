MS unit testing framework has better integration (even if you use Testdrven.NET) but it take mire time to load, has some strange issues when it forgets to update the test list and only run as a 32bit process. MS has coverage tool integrated as well. I guess that choosing the correct tool mostly depends on your project and your team.
