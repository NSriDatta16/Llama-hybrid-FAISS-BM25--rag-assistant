Use a ssh implementation in java. I used Ganymede a couple of years ago, there are perhaps better alternatives now. (?) Using Ganymede, you will get an input stream to read from, and an output stream to write to. You can create a LineInputReader on the input stream and use that to read Strings representing the output from the remote server. Then use a regexp Pattern/Matcher to parse responses. Create a PrintWriter on the output stream and use println() to send your commands. Its simple and actually quite powerful (if you know regexp... It might require some trial and error to get it right...)
