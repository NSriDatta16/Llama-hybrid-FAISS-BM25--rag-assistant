It would seem Transform should be Mutate (or alternatively Mutator should be Transformer,) for consistency's sake. This seems fairly clear about the intent: static public List mutate (List originalForm, Mutator mutator); It is also a bit more verbose (but more consistent and conventional) to spec: static public boolean isTrueForAll(List source, Predicate filter); or static public boolean assertTrueForAll(List source, Predicate filter);
