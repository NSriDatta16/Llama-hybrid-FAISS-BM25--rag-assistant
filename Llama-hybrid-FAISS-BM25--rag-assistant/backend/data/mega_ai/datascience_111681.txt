NLP logistic regression

A basic doubt I have, Usually when dealing with text data for classic ML algos, We use Tf-idf which uses entire vocabulary for each row and assigns some weighted value. My doubt is can I use 5 feature columns denoting the first 5 words to occur in the sentence and keep the target variable as some specific class. Will this method work ? I am aware of RNN and LSTM, But was wondering if this would work ?
