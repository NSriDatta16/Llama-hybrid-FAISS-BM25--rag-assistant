The method you currently use now is called adjacency list model . Another model to store hierarchical data in a (relational) database is the nested set model . Its implementation in SQL databases is well known . Also see this article for the modified preorder tree traversal algorithm . A very simple method: you could store a path per object - with those it should be easy to query trees in NOSQL databases: { path: "Color", ... } { path: "Color.Red", ... } { path: "Color.Red.Apple", ... } { path: "Color.Red.Cherry", ... } When nodes will be removed or renamed some paths must be updated. But in general, this method looks promising. You just have to reserve a special character as separator. The storage space overhead should be negligible. edit: this method is called materialized path Finally, here is a comparison of different methods for hierarchical data in NOSQL databases .
