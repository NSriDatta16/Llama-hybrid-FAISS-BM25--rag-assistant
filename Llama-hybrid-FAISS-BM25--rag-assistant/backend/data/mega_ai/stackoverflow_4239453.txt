You're getting confused. All you need to learn java is the JDK (Java Development Kitt) and the JRE (Java Runtime Environment). JDK includes, JRE, so just install JDK: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html And for Java EE, you need the Java EE SDK: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/download-141771.html Additionally, you can get an IDE like Netbeans or Eclipse. Google will help you on that ;)
