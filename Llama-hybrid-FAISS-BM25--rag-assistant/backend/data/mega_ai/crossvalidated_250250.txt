The sensitivity of your model to highly correlated values will depend on the model selection. Random forest models handle correlated variables pretty well, but that doesn't mean you are really benefiting from having them there. A random forest model may pick any one of the correlated variables as a predictor without a substantial preference of one over the other. Once one is used, the importance of the other correlated variables goes down. This could affect your interpretation of the data later on if you aren't aware of the other correlations. You could incorrectly assume one of the correlated variables is more important than the other for the model. The correlation matrix is useful for exploratory data analysis. Once you decide what kind of model you want to build, you can decide whether filtering highly correlated variables is appropriate for the situation. The caret package in R has nice,simple tools for data pre-processing.
