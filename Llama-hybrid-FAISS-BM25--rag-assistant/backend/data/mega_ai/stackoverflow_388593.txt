From one of the C++ books i referred (Efficient C++ performance Techniques by Bulka and Mayhew), which explicitly talked about C++ performance aspects. One of them was; while defining constructors..initialize the other constructors also; some thing like; class x { x::x(char *str):m_x(str) {} // and not as x::x(char *str) { m_str(str); } private: std::string m_x; }; The above is some thing which caught my attention and helped me to improve my coding style... this book has more to share on this interesting topic of performance.
