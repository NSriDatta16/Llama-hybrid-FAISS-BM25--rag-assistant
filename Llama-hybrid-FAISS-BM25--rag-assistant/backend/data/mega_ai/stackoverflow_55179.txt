Why all the Linq To Entities Hate?

I've noticed that there seems to be quite a bit of hostility towards Linq To Entities particularly from the Alt.Net folks. I understand the resistance to more "drag and drop" programming, but from my understanding, Linq To Entities doesn't require it. We're currently using Linq to SQL, and we are using the DBML document to define it (once you get more than a dozen or so tables, the designer is pretty useless.) So why wouldn't the same approach work for Linq To Entities?
