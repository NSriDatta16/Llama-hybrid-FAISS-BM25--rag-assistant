Different result between Weka Java API and R's RandomForest package

I've implemented random forest with both R random forest package and Weka java api. both with same data set (train and test sets are the same) and same configuration (number of trees and mtry). However, the results are different: R - 88.96% (1338 from 1504) accuracy, Weka - 69.28% (1042 from 1504) any suggestion what could make the differences?
