From the admin go to the menu System > Magento Connect > Magento Connect Manager. Once logged into that click the "Check for Upgrades" button and then "Commit Changes" button. The rest is automatic. Your client has probably just seen a message that has been posted recently about a "Preview Release". This is not a security update that should be considered for live websites, wait until it the next message which doesn't say "RC" (meaning "Release Candidate") or "beta" (meaning "probably doesn't work").
