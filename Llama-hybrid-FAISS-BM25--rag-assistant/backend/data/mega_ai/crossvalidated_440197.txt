The language is very confusing and it doesn't help that different software packages and different authors use different names and that the acronyms (GLM, LM, LME, LMM, GLMM and more) are inconsistent as well. Within your sets of names, the following should help: Linear model - ordinary least squares regression, ANOVA, ANCOVA; the dependent variable is continuous, errors are independent Generalized linear model - Logistic regression and other methods; dependent variable may be categorical, errors are independent Linear mixed model - dependent variable is continuous, errors need not be independent; good for longitudinal data (also other kinds, such as clustered data) Generalized linear mixed model - depenedent variable need not be continuous, errors need not be independent.
