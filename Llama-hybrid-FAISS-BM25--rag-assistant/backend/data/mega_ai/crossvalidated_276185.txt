In general, I doubt that you can. Think of it as follows: you are creating a linear combination of different variables, each of which is in different units. Say, you compare cars; you take into account several variables, such as MPG (in $miles \cdot gallons^{-1}$), weight ($kg$), acceleration ($m\cdot s^{-2}$), top cruising speed ($m\cdot s{-1}$), price ($\$$), CO2 emission ($g\cdot km^{-1}$) etc. Now you are building a composite score, a linear combination of these variables, and ask the following question: if car A is better than B, then how much better? Well, if you expect an answer to your question, then in what units? Say, the answer is "A is better than B by forty two". Forty two what ? Gallons? Kilometers? Milligrams per hour? Furlongs per fortnight? Asking about the magnitude of your score, you are really asking about the unit of your linear combination. There is no such thing; you do not have an absolute scale for your scores.. However, you still can have a relative one. Is the difference between A and B large in relation to the difference between A and C? Or, better yet: is the difference between A and B large in relation to the overall differences between samples in your data set? A natural way (for a practical statistician, that is) to express this is to express the data in standard deviations as units. Knowing that almost 70% (remember the 68-95-99.7 rule?) of the data points are at most one standard deviation away from the mean gives you a pretty good feeling how important these differences are. Or, alternatively, simply show the data, on a rug plot for example. Also, since you are referring to PCA: I normally show a two- or three-dimensional plot of all points, and indicate the points of interest. The rest is in the eye of the beholder.
