Model with time as predictor but some rows have large time span

I want to model a linguistic feature (number of a certain word at the beginning of the sentence) through centuries. I am familiar with logistic regressions, Poisson regressions and GAMM to model such things through time but this time some rows have large intervals instead of a precise year, so my dataset looks like this Text Period Number A 1325 26 B 1300-1500 24 C 1410 36 D 1712 22 Is there any way I can include the interval of text B in the model together with other rows which have a more precise year specification?
