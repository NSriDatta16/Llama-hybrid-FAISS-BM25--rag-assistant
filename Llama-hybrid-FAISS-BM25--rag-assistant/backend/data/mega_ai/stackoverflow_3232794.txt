How to add and remove items with JQuery from an array stored in a hidden field

I cant seem to do this in an elegant way, and I don't understand some of the behaviour I'm seeing. I have my array stored in html like so: To add a value I must do this, is this really the cleanest way to do this? $('#myField').val($('#myField').val() + ',' + 21); And to remove I value I have to do something like this: newValues=$.grep($('#myField').val(), function(value) { return value != 3; }); $('#myField').val(newValues); Apart from this does not work.....as I get the same behaviour as illustrated here: If i do this: $.grep('1,2,3',function(value){return value!=3;}) It returns this, why do I get these extra blank elements? How do I remove 3 from the hidden input?: ["1", ",", "2", ","]
