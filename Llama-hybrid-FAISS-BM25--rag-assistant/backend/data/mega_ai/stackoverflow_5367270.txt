The result that your are accumulating in sum is dependent on the order of computation. I imagine that pgcc must have a way that you can tell that you don't care about the implications that reordering might have. But as such it can't know and it can't parallelize anything. In OpenMp you would put something like #pragma omp parallel for reduction(+: sum) in front of the loop.
