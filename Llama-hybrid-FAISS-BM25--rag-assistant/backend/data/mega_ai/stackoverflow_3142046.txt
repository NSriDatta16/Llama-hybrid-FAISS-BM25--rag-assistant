How is this superb site constructed?

I found a website last night that is simply awesome. Here's the URL: http://yourworldoftext.com/ WARNING: Site may be NSFW. And it got me thinking straight away how this site is constructed. Taking a look at the page source doesn't reveal much, but if I look at it in Firebug I see a lot of tables like this: A L L &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Y O U R &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; B A S E &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the tilecont DIV is repeated and tiled along the entire page, and the table inside occupies the entire width and height of that DIV. Then, each inside the table is one row with 16 's inside that row to make up each character. It's hard to explain, if you have Firebug installed you can simply drag it to the page and see for yourself. I thought this was pretty damn clever, but I can't work my head around how it would be stored in a database or something? I have tried looking through the JS files but to be honest there's a lot of stuff in there I either don't know or not related to how it's stored etc. I assume it's making an AJAX request to a database on every keyUp event storing the new data for that particular "cell"? Anyone have any input on how they think this is done?
