Poisson glm for rank or score data?

I have a question about analyzing a dataset that I'm currently working with. Each row of the dataset represents an individual songbird, and its reproductive success over the course of a breeding season. Reproductive success was recorded as a score or rank that was based on breeding activities that we observed for each bird. Scores were recorded as follows: 1 - unpaired 2 - paired 3 - successfully raised 1 brood of fledglings 4 - successfully raised 2 broods 5 - successfully raised 3 broods In my analysis, these scores will be the response variables, and several environmental covariates will be used as predictor variables. Typically I see that ranked data is analyzed using ordinal logistic regression, but would it also be reasonable to model this data using a poisson glm/glmm? I have experience with poisson glm's, and this distribution is often used in my field (wildlife ecology) for count data or to model age structure. This reproductive index is not commonly used, so there are not many examples I've come across that attempted to do a similar analysis. Thanks! Jay
