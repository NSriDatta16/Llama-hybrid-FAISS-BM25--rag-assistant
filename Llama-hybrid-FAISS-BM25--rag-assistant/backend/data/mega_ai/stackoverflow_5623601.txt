Stop WPF animation, storyboard begin in xaml but stopping it in codebehind?

I created an animation storyboard in xaml file. That story board begins on Button.Click. But to stop the animation I am trying to stop storyboard on my custom event in code behind. The code is not throwing any exception but When my event got fired the animation still goes continue. I think the issue is with the Stop method. Stop required the same object that begins the animation to stop it. But here the storyboard is begin in WPF xaml and I am stopping it in code behind. Any Solution, how to get Xaml object in code behind or Any alternative solution for this?? XAML CODE: Code Behind: private void EventPublisher_OnScanningFinish(object sender, EventArgs args) { Dispatcher.Invoke(DispatcherPriority.Normal, (Action)delegate() { this.StopScanningAnimation(); }); } private void StopScanningAnimation() { ServerView.StoryBoardServerScrolling.Stop(this); //---------- Not Working //this.ServerView.Server1Static.Visibility = System.Windows.Visibility.Hidden; //this.ServerView.Server2Static.Visibility = System.Windows.Visibility.Hidden; //this.ServerView.Server3Scrolling.Visibility = System.Windows.Visibility.Hidden; //this.ServerView.SearchingGlass.Visibility = System.Windows.Visibility.Hidden; }
