You guys were almost there but I had to go digging all over and try everything to finally figure it out: $(function(){ $('.ui-widget-header').draggable({cursor: 'move', revert: true}); $("#droppable").droppable({ drop: function(event, ui) { $(this).effect('highlight'); alert($(ui.draggable.find('#add_interface')).serialize()); } }); }); So the way you deal with the ui argument is like so: $(ui.draggable.find('#add_interface')) and THEN you can serialize() that, otherwise I was just getting [object Object] alerted as opposed to the serialized form
