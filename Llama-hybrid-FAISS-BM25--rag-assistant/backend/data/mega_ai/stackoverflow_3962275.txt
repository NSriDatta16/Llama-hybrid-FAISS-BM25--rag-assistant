If you can guarantee that your points of interest are nested between two = s (and there isn't an odd number of these demarcations in a given file), the flip-flop operator is a handy thing here: use strict; # These two pragmas go a long, ... use warnings; # ... long way in helping you code better my %scores; # Create a hash of scores while (<>) { # The diamond operator processes all files ... # ... supplied at command-line, line-by-line next unless /^=+$/ .. /^=+$/; # The flip-flop operator used ... # ... to filter out only 'grades' my ( $name, $grade ) = split; # This usage of split will break ... # ... the current line into an array $scores{$name} = $grade; # Associate grade with name }
