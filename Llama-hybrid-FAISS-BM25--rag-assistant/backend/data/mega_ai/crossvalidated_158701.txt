SVM for regression : confidence intervalls

I use the svm function (for regression) to make forecast like I would with for exemple the arima function: fit prediction which returns different attributes : prediction$mean which is the actual prediction prediction$lower and prediction$upper which are the boundaries of the confidence intervals on each points of the prediction$mean . I would like the svm function (from e1071 package) to return a more detailed answer than just the value (like the forecast() would). But I guess it is not implemented in the function yet. Is there another function to do it ? Or should I use bootstrap methods to try to estimate those boundaries? And if I should use this are they pre-implemented version of them instead of using sample over a for loop which is very time-consuming ?
