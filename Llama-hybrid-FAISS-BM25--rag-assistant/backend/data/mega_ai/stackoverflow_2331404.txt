Thanks scntln! I'm using this indeed in my Camera FX app. It works well for embedding EXIF tags in JPEGS (not in PNG files). Android SDK version 2.x has its own ExifInterface class that you could use instead. But if you need to support 1.6 or lower, then my sanselandroid port should work fine. I'm still in the process of pruning the sanselanandroid project more to contain only what's absolutely necessary for just writing EXIF tags. BTW: I noticed here that I spelled 'compatiable' incorrectly. Fixed that on my blog :)
