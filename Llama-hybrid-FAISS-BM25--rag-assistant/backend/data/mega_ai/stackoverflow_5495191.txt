Have a closer look at the sql statement that hibernate generates - yes it does use the "distinct" keyword but not in the way I think you are expecting it to (or the way that the Hibernate FAQ is implying) i.e. to return a set of "distinct" or "unique" orders. It doesn't use the distinct keyword to return distinct orders, as that wouldn't make sense in that SQL query, considering the join that you have also specified. The resulting sql set still needs processing by the ResultTransformer, as clearly the sql set contains duplicate orders. That's why they say that the HQL distinct keyword doesn't directly map to the SQL distinct keyword.
