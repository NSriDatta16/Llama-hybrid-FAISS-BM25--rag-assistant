How to correct for absolute values when looking at relative values?

Apologies if this is a duplicate. I have a website with a large number of URLs, and I also have data on the number of unique page-views and online feedback generated for each URL. I would like to find the URLs with the highest relative number of tickets, so I can prioritise the for attention. On the surface this is straightforward - I can just divide the number of feedback tickets by the number of page-views to get the relative ticketing rate. However, the number of page-views varies greatly, and I want to find a way to account for the absolute number of tickets as well as the relative ticketing rate. For example (in reality I have about 500,000 URLs): URL page-views tickets /popular 1000000 500 /rare 1000 5 On the surface of it, /rare has a higher ticket rate (5000 per million versus 500 per million). But in fact I would want to look at /popular at the same time. My first thought is that I should multiply the relative and absolute values together to get a normalised value. But is this statistically respectable? My second thought was that maybe I should use a funnel plot. Any suggestions very welcome.
