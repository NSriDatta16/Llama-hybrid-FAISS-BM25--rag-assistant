Example combing jquery drag and drop and tabs

I have seen some good examples of how to use jquery to do drag and drop and separately on how to do tabs. Does anyone have or know of an example that combines the two? Basically say you have a on the left of the screen with draggable objects and then you can drop them into one of the tabs on the right side of the screen. Also, would like to know how to let someone drop it into the visible tab, but also drop the item into the tab label for a hidden tab and have the object drop in there. Ideally you would want that hidden tab to become visible so the user could see that the item dropped in properly.
