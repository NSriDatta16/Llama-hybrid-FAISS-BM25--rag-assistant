The classifification table that SPSS provides is not a useful way to interpret the fit of a (multinomial) logistic regression model, and you should probably not attempt to interpret it. I think SPSS is the only software that produces that table. Example: I want to develop a model that predicts if people will either go to prison for violent assault, or be a victim of assault. I don't have a computer, so I make up a model that just predicts "No" for everyone. Most people don't go to prison and are not violently assaulted, so my model is correct 99% of the time. But my model is also useless. See also the case of John Gottman, who got famous by making the same mistake: http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2010/03/can_you_really_predict_the_success_of_a_marriage_in_15_minutes.html
