replace parts of a string with x's c++

I'm studying for a test tomorrow and doing a book problem in my C++ textbook. we have barely done much with strings, but here is my problem. // name ss# username password string data = "Santa Claus 454-90-3424 sclaus passwordy" string data2 = "Morgan Freeman 554-40-1124 mfree passwordx" and I want to write a function that can work on both of those strings if need be that will replace the social security number with xxx-xx-xxxx and the password with all x's for the number of characters in the password. how can I do this with simple string functions?
