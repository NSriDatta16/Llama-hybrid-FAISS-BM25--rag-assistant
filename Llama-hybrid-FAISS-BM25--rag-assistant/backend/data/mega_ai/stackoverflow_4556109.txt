First off, let me say that this book will do what you are asking, bring you up to speed on *nix and pretty fast. It's called "Linux and the Unix Philosophy" by Mike Gancarz. You can read it pretty quickly, it's not that long. It's in my top 5 all time favorite *nix books. If you know enough to get around on a system, then you are in better shape than you know. learning Apache is separate from learning *nix. I have several Apache books, but I honestly never use them. The Apache Foundation website has great documentation and there are a ton of forums out there to post just about any question. Apache is can be tough at first, but doable if you have the technical prowess. So to your real question, a good book for learning Linux. 12 years ago I was handed a Red Hat Linux Unleashed book and within just a few days I knew enough to be dangerous and after a week, enough to actually make Linux work for me. Between Red Hat Linux Unleashed and another book called "Unix Power Tools" I was able to move from being a drafter to a Jr. Linux SysAdmin inside 3 months. The books + hands on is what worked for me. At a minimum, please check out "Linux and the Unix Philosophy".
