Of all the graphs, the last DAG {O,I} -> E is consistent with the observations that: O and I are independent of each other. O and I are each associated with E. Conditioned on E, O and I are dependent . For instance this doesn't seem to hold P(E)=P(O)P(E|O). The equation P(E)=P(O)P(E|O) need not hold, because, the right hand side is P(O)P(E|O) = P(O,E) , which need not be equal to P(E) . A wider question, is there some algorithm which assesses causality by exploring independence first and then tries to find the graph/DAG which is most likely. Yes!
