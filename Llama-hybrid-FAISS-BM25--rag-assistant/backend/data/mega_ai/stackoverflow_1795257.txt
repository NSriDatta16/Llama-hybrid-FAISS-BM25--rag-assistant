high speed tracing

I have an embedded board with a 32 Micro-controller, and an custom built OS, Unfortunately, as of now, connection to the PC is only through serial port, Internal memory is limited to 512KB. There are at-least 10 tasks in the system Question, I want to capture the sequence in which task switch happens, And when I try to write into the RAM, it overflows ~~ And when I try to send it though serial port, the system behavior changes (as serial port is slow) There is no persistent storage like NAND FLASH, or something. Can you guys think of some Idea? If there is no way with Serial port, Can you guys recommend some other interface or than Serial port.
