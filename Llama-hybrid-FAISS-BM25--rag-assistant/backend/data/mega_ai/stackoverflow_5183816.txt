Here is an article on embedding mono: http://www.mono-project.com/Embedding_Mono It is a little different in monotouch. There was a page explaining it on monotouch.net, but it appears to have been removed. http://monotouch.net/Documentation/XCode It looks like a copy of the content is located here: http://www.guidebee.biz/forum/viewthread.php?tid=172 You basically run mtouch with the --xcode switch set on the output from your mono project. That will produce an xcode project with the fles needed to embed monotouch.
