display crystal report in asp.net page

I have built a Crystal Report in VS2008 for an asp.net c# site. I can run the rpt file and view the report. I can't get it do display in the web page. I've never used Crystal before so I may have this totally wrong. I dragged a CrystalReportViewer and CrystalReportSource onto the designer and used the menu to configure the source and report name.
