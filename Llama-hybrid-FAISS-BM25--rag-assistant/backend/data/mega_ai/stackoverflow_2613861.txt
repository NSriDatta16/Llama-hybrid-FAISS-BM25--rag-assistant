What Java/Scala or .NET web frameworks support modify source code and instantly run workflow e.i. without long rebiuld/redeploy procedures?

As far as I can see the key advantage of dynamic languages like Ruby or Python over Java/Scala/C# etc is "hot" applying of your changes to source code to the running application. What are the frameworks for JVM or .NET that support the same workflow - apply changes to configuration and source code on the fly? Can they also watch changes to custom configurations and notify application? Note: Frameworks for dynamic languages on JVM/.NET like Grails or Compojure are out of scope here. EDIT : I mean not only modification of a method body, but adding/deleting methods, fields and classes. What is average time between finishing of editing and observing changes in your browser? NICE SOLUTIONS : Play framework
