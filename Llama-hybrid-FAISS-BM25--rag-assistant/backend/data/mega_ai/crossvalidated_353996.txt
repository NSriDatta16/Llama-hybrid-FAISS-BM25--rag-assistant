Section 7.3 of the excellent book Bayesian Data Analysis in Ecology Using Linear Models with R, BUGS, and STAN by Fr√§nzi Korner-Nievergelt et al. (2015) states the following in connection with REML and ML: "For our purposes, the relevant difference between the two methods is that the ML estimates are unbiased for the fixed effects but biased for the random effects, whereas the REML estimates are biased for the fixed effects and unbiased for the random effects. However, when sample size is large compared to the number of model parameters, the differences between the ML and REML estimates become negligible. As a guideline, use REML if the interest is in the random effects (variance parameters) and ML if the interested is in the fixed effects."
