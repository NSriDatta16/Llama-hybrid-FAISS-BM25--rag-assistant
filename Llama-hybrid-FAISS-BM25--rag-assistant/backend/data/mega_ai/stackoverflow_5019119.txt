SqlProfileProvider - can you use Profile.GetProfile() in a project?

I am attempting to use the SqlProfileProvider in an application and can't seem to use it the way I want to. I would like to be able to simply call up a profile like this: Profile p = Profile.GetProfile("naspinski"); p.Organization = "new_org"; but I can't seem to find the correct way to use the GetProfile() that I seem to see scattered around the net. Is there a way to grab, read and modify profiles? I am using it in MVC 3 and will not be actually logging in as the specific user, this will be pulling users from the db that are specified. Thank you.
