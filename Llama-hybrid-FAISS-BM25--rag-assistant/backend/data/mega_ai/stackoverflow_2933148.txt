You must ensure that your voting is at least establishing a session when they first hit the page, and that the session is still active when they vote. If you're not at least requiring some type of token that you specify, the client could post data to your server all day, spoofing IP addresses and User Agents. If you're using sessions, or some other type of token access that forces the use of your forms, then it seems, according to the information that you have so far, that the votes are indeed coming from different computers. Check your web server logs for the referrer to see how they're finding the article. If you can't prove that a vote is invalid, then I think you have to accept it.
