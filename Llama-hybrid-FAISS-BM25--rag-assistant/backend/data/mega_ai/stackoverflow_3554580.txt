It depends on how sparse your playing field is. If your playing field is dense, then the space complexity of any storage algorithm will trend towards RC. (Specifically, RC/2, since once you get more active cells than inactive cells, you can just store the inactive cells instead if you really cared that much about optimal space usage.) If the playing field is sparse, you can get something that scales instead with the number of active cells by simply storing coordinate pairs per active cell or some other sparse matrix structure .
