Create HTTP packet

I would like create HTTP packet with random IP source. Apparently, Pcap.net does it. I asked here : http://pcapdotnet.codeplex.com/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=227725 , but I still have not figured out how to do it. Anybody to help me to write code ? I'm ready to do it in other langage than C#. Thank you
