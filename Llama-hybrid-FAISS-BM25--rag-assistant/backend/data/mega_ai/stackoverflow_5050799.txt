dreamlax has already mentioned the capitalizedString method . Instead of doing a lossy conversion to and from NSData to remove the accented characters, however, I think it is more elegant to use the stringByFoldingWithOptions:locale: method. NSString *accentedString = @"√ÅlgeBra"; NSString *unaccentedString = [accentedString stringByFoldingWithOptions:NSDiacriticInsensitiveSearch locale:[NSLocale currentLocale]]; NSString *capitalizedString = [unaccentedString capitalizedString]; Depending on the nature of the strings you want to convert, you might want to set a fixed locale (e.g. English) instead of using the user's current locale. That way, you can be sure to get the same results on every machine.
