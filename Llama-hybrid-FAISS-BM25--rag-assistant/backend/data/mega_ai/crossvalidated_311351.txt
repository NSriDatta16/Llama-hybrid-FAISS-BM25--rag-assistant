First, yes, you can use a non-parametric test on normally distributed data. Second, it is not the data which matters, usually. E.g. in ordinary least squares regression, what matters is the distribution of the errors . And some parametric tests don't require normality of anything. Third, parametric tests are more powerful for the purpose for which they are intended if their assumptions are met. Often, a non-parametric test has slightly different purposes. Finally, it would help if you told us the actual problem you are trying to solve. Your first paragraph about dimensions of a scale is unclear.
