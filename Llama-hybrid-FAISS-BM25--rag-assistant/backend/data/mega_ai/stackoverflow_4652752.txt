I think it's just applet security restrictions preventing you from modifying the filesystem on the client machine. Take a look at FileSaveService in JNLP. This can be used from an unsigned applet to save a file to the filesystem on the client machine. If you are trying to write to a directory on the server from an applet, you cannot do this directly. You would need to create an upload form on the server and maybe use HttpURLConnection to send a POST request to the server.
