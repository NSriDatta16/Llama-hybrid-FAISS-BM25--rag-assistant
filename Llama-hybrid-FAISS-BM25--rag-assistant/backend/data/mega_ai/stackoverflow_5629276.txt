Try this: @user = User.where(:email => params[:user][:email]).first On a side note, you may also want to push some of this code into one of your models, either the User or Company model, so that in your controller you would only have one call such as: @company.add_user(@user) The implementation details of adding a user would then be encapsulated in your model. You may also want to consider embedding the two calls to ActiveRecord::Base#save into a single transaction to avoid ending up with inconsistent data in your database.
