If you don't need to save the state of the object, then there's no need to instantiate it in the first place. I'd go with the single static method that you pass parameters to. I'd also warn against a giant Utils class that has dozens of unrelated static methods. This can get disorganized and unwieldy in a hurry. It's better to have many classes, each with few, related methods.
