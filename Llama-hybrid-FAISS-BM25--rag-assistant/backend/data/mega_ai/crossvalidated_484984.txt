Not necessarily. Search around on feature selection and model selection. Model selection is not a solved problem and it is unlikely to be solved since it is NP-hard. In my own experience, I have seen the LASSO sometimes select poor or even insanely wrong models. That is not restricted to the LASSO. Ridge regression, stepwise selection methods, searches using AIC and BIC, random forest, SVMs, ... I have seen them all fail spectacularly. I know you want a slick answer that sounds like it will work; however, this is one of the areas of statistics where we really have to work hard and use our experience. Furthermore, you are really exposing yourself to Simpson's Paradox and structural breaks if you just grind the data through a method instead of looking at it carefully with simpler approaches first. One of my favorite assignments for students is to give them some data on petroleum products. If you use the LASSO, ridge regression, SVMs, or assume a cointegrating relationship, the data give you a model that is absurd -- as in completely unrelated to the reality of refining processes. Furthermore, those models perform horribly out-of-sample; you would be better off without a model. With some theory to guide the modeling and looking at the data in smaller time groupings, however, the expected structure emerges.
