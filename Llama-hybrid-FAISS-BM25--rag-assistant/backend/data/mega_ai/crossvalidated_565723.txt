How to deal with zero-inflated data with negative values

Participants in a survey answer two questions similar to this: What is your estimate, how on average a woman performs in this test (from 0 to 100)? What is your estimate, how on average a man performs in this test (from 0 to 100)? The dependent variable is the difference between these two answers. Thus of course the DV is highly zero-inflated because the majority doesn't assume that there will be difference. Although depending on the treatment, the age, gender and education of the respondent the DV varies. The models that are a good fit for zero inflated data mostly deal with counted data, thus they assume that DV is non-negative. Here ( https://fukamilab.github.io/BIO202/04-C-zero-data.html ) and here ( https://stats.oarc.ucla.edu/r/dae/zinb/ ) for instance. How should I deal with it? Here is the distribution of DV across four treatments, for illustration.
