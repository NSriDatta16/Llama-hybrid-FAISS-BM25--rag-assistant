You have to be more precise. First of all your question may be re-expressed as “should I use a multivariate analysis or N univariate analyses?” Well, if you want to maximize the amount of info used by your model (which would be optimal), then you have to use multivariate analysis for the obvious reason that the model will capture the interaction between the time series.. however, this must be weighted against the additional computational complexity, which may be high if you have 100 time series.. However in this case you do not have too many data points as you are working with very low frequencies, so: on one hand, this is a con because you have a few data but on the other hand, the good news is that your computational complexity will not explode (however, remember that you will pay for this in the form of increased standard errors in light of the tight dataset of 12 months for 10 years datapoints). Clearly the multivariate analysis has a lot more parameters than the univariate one on the same number of funds..
