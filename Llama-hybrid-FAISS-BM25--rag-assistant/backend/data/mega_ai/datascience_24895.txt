Logistic Regression is used when you know that the data is lineraly seperable/classifiable and the outcome is Binary or Dichotomous but it can extended when the dependent has more than 2 categories. Linear Regression is used to find the relation and based on the relation between them you can predict the outcome, the dependent variable should be numeric. What kind of usecases are you expecting? give an example so that we can extend it further.
