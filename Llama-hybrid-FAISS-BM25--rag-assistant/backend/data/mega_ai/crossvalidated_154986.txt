Write code and explain some term in Logistic regression analysis by R

We want to do the logistic regression analysis to consider the effect of Age, CD4 on drug resistance mutations. The code that we wrote is: logist.summary(glm(DRM ~ Age, data = Database, family = binomial),"wald") The results are: log.OR OR lower.CI upper.CI p.value (Intercept) -0.31 0.74 0.05 9.95 0.8169 Age -0.07 0.93 0.86 1.00 0.0525 However, we want to do the test like, we will consider whether, 20 years old differences between the subjects, what the results is? Is it relative to DRMs? We wrote: logist.summary(glm(DRM ~ I(Age+20), data = Database, family = binomial),"wald") Results: log.OR OR lower.CI upper.CI p.value (Intercept) 1.17 3.22 0.05 190.62 0.5742 I(Age + 20) -0.07 0.93 0.86 1.00 0.0525 I want to ask: Is the code we wrote correct? Can you help me explain what is meaning of these table? Why it is the same results for the Age and Age+20? But differences in the Intercept? What does intercept meaning in this case?
