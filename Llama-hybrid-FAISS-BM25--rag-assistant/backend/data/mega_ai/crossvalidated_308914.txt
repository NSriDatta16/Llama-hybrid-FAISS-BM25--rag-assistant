I agree with the comments of whuber . It's pretty hard to make an estimate of the uncertainty if all you have is averages. Let's say one study has only measured two, and another one has measured a hundred litter bins. Any reasonable analysis would take the uncertainty of those measurements into account and not take the first one too seriously. If you don't know anything about where these averages come from, it's pretty hard to interpret them anyway. This is I think a much bigger issue than the rounding off, if you really want to model this as a distribution. If it looks like a Poisson shape to you, and that's why you use this, perhaps a gamma distribution or lognormal distribution is a better choice. One principled way to make it work is to put some priors on the number of litter bins measured in each of the studies. You could implement such a thing in a probabilistic programming environment like stan or pymc . However, I think the answers are going to be very sensitive to your priors on these averages. As it is, these averages just don't convey much information at all if you don't know how many measurements are done. Would you trust your study if all of them had actually only two measurements? What if one of them has a really large survey size but you base your regression lines on other, far less certain averages? Answer to comment below What is the best way to model a response of non-negative non-integer values that are representative of count data? In theory, if you average five poisson variables, so five pure count-data variables, then the outcome is distributed as a Poisson distributed by 5. The sum of Poisson variables is again Poisson distributed, and the average is the sum divided by five. But you don't know the number of Poissons added together, so that doesn't really work. I don't really know anything about this domain, I don't know if the underlying variables are modelled well as Poisson variables, or something else. Other comment Do you have advice between gamma and lognormal Same answer actually (sorry can't help without more knowledge / information), I think that's where you need information on the process that created these numbers, and how you want to model it. What are litter size values? Why do you think these are best modelled as a Poisson?
