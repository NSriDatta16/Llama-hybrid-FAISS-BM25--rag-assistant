Without paying too much attention to your actual code here, the most important mistake your making is that the == operator will NOT compare two strings. In C, a string is an array of characters, which is simply a pointer. So doing if("abcde" == some_string) will never be true unless they point to the same string! You want to use a method like "strcmp(char *a, char *b)" which will return 0 if two strings are equal and something else if they're not. "strncmp(char *a, char *b, size_t n)" will compare the first "n" characters in a and b, and return 0 if they're equal, which is good for looking at the beginning of strings (to see if a string starts with a certain set of characters) You also should NOT be passing a character as the pointer for %s in your fscanf! This will cause it to completely destroy your stack it tries to put many characters into ch, which only has space for a single character! As James says, you want to do something like char ch[BUFSIZE] where BUFSIZE is 1 larger than you ever expect a single line to be, then do "fscanf(inp, "%s", ch);" Hope that helps!
