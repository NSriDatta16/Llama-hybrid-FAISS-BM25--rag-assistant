Let's think about this for a moment. Continuous state space means that there are infinitely many states linked via transition probabilities such that they are all accessible by traversing a single graph (let's suppose). The expected values in such a case are asymptotic, meaning that they either have a cleverly constructed closed form (such as mean of a geometric distribution), or have to be approximated, usually via simulations, such as above. TLDR: There is no general expression for absorbing states in infinite state markov chains.
