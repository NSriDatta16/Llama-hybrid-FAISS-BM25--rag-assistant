Is it necessary to transform the features before applying machine learning algorithm?

I have a dataset which contains features with skewed distribution and I want to feed it to a machine learning algorithm ( being general here). Do I need to always transform the features so that its more of a normal distribution? or is it ok to not to do so and guarantees a good estimate? What are the advantages/disadvantages of doing so? Thanks!
