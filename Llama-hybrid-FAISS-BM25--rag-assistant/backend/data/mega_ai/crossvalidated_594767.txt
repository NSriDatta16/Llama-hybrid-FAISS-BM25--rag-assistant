TOTALLY FINE Anything you can do with the features (the $X$ ) of a linear model, you can do with the features of a generalized linear model like a logistic regression. Thatâ€™s part of the beauty of generalized linear models: just apply a link function $g$ and, at least in some sense, treat the problem like a linear model. $$ g\left(\mathbb E\left[Y\vert X\right]\right)=X\beta $$ However, this is equivalent to calculating the proportions for each of the two $X$ groups. When it comes to confidence intervals, life gets harder, since the usual methods for calculating the confidence interval for a difference between two proportions do not obviously drop out of the logistic regression parameter confidence intervals. Ditto for hypothesis testing.
