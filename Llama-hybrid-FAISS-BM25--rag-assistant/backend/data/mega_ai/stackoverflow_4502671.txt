Methods of pulling data from a database

I'm getting ready to start a C# web application project and just wanted some opinions regarding pulling data from a database. As far as I can tell, I can either use C# code to access the database from the code behind (i.e. LINQ) of my web app or I can call a stored procedure that will collect all the data and then read it with a few lines of code in my code behind. I'm curious to know which of these two approaches, or any other approach, would be the most efficient, elegant, future proof and easiest to test.
