Neural Network Training

I try to recognize pictures of every digit. I have removed everything else than the digit so that there is almost no noise other than the digit is placed differently on the pictures. I use Neuroph's image recognizing gui and have some questions about training. It seems that the larger resolution I use for the pictures the worser the training becomes. Why is this? I have 100 pictures in my training set. 10 of each digit. Is that maybe too little? Why is every training no matter what i do just converging to some number usually between 2-3 in total network error. Here is a picture of one of the trainings It doesn't learn much
