Different results when running model.predict on the same input?

I have trained a Keras classification model with TensorFlow. Every time when I run the model.predict(data) on the same input data I get different results. The interesting thing is, for example, if I run 10 predicts on the same data, the average does give the correct classification. Is this normal behavior or have I done something horribly wrong?
