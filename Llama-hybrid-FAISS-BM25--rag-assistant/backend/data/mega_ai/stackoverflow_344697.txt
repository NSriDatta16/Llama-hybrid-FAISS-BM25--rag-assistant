Googlebots Ignoring robots.txt?

I have a site with the following robots.txt in the root: User-agent: * Disabled: / User-agent: Googlebot Disabled: / User-agent: Googlebot-Image Disallow: / And pages within this site are getting scanned by Googlebots all day long. Is there something wrong with my file or with Google?
