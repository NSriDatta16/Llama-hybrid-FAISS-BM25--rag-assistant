It seems a little strange that you are doing a document ready inside the click event. It would make more sense to do it like this. $(function(){//Document ready $('zoom button').click(function(){ $("#draggable").draggable( {containment: '#imgContainer', scroll: false }); }); }); I think thats what you need from the code provided. Maybe that will solve the issue.
