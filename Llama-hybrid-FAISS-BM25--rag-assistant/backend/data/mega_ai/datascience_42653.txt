What is the correct format of the test input for LSTM neural network?

I have learned some tutorials for LSTM time series prediction. According to that tutorials, My training data format would be like, NOTE : This data is only for example. this is not the real data. x y x1 x2 x2 x3 x3 x4 . . . . x9 x10 I am using the basic LSTM Model , model = Sequential() model.add(LSTM(len(input), input_shape=(1, look_back))) model.add(Dense(1)) model.compile(loss='mean_squared_error', optimizer='adam') So after model.fit() . I am confused a bit how to test predict the next value of the series. I don't know How to find the next time series Data x11 ? I also tried with shown below inputs to find the x11 , Methods: [x10] Or [ x2,x3,x4,...x10] As far as i learnt method 1 is right. But Method 2 provides better accuracy than Method 1 . So I don't know which way is correct to predict the next time series data ? Thanks in advance.
