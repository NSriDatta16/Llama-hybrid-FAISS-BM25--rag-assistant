Trying to understand utility of Cox vs. logistic regression

I am refreshing myself on the different types of regression models and am getting a little stuck between logistic regression and Cox regression/survival analysis. Here's an example: Let's say you are evaluating an intervention. You have two groups - an intervention group and a control group. You have follow-up data on everyone through the 1-yr mark and you want to compare fatality risk between the groups. Is it more appropriate to do survival analysis so that you can factor in different the different lengths of person-time or is it more appropriate to just do logistic regression (yes/no person is alive at the 1-year mark)? It seems like the benefit of survival analysis is that it allows you to factor in censoring and that many people who are alive at the 1-yr mark may die after you've finished following-up. But in this case, if the question is specific to each group's fatality risk within 1-yr... does factoring in censoring matter?
