Thanks for the advice. I verified both the registry permissions and the full-trust issue. It turns out that, although I specifically built my application to .Net 3.0 (based on the standard organizational image), there was a dependency on .Net 3.5 SP1 that I still don't fully understand. The solution to my problem was to install .Net 3.5 SP1 on all the affected computers. I just wanted to close the loop. Thanks, again, to all who contributed ideas.
