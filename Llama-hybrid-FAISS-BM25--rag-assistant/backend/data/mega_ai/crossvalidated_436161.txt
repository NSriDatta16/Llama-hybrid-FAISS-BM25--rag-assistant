Displaying Time-Series Data as One Graph

I have the following graph, built from Matplotlib: The top area bar graph is the volume of transactions processed for a given day. The bottom line graph is the average processing time for that day. Does it make sense to combine them together into a single graph (i.e., the line graph overlaid on the bar graph)? Is there any good way to display them together as a single graph without the data being too convoluted?
