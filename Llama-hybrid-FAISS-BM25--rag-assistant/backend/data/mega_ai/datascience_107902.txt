Statement #3 - "No conclusion can be made whether tea or coffee influence dental health." is the most useful interpretation of the studies. " Correlation is not causation ." Those studies show the relationship but it not clear what drives the effect. Maybe having certain teeth quality drives beverage choice. Or other variables that have not been measured (e.g., location or age) are influencing the observed relationships. One option to directly evaluate statements #1 and #2 is an experiment where people are randomly assigned to a drink a beverage and dental health is measured.
