I'd let them have the right to exist if they are testing some "legacy code" - code that no one really has a good grip on. No, if they are in there to put on a show of "high code coverage". It's a first step to getting some confidence in the code. The invisible check is :"no exceptions are thrown". However once you've wrapped up the app in some smoke tests like these, the next step would be to turn the implicit check into an explicit check - put on your thinking cap and come up with observable changes that you can assert from your tests. You can use tools like TestLint to catch tests like these.
