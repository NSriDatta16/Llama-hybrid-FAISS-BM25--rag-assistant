Ruby shortest way to write rnd hex

What I have is a method used to generate random hex values. E.g 666 or FF7 However, I don't think it looks simple/elegant at all.. What I want is to make it more simple which perhaps will make my code shorter as well, but I don't know how. That is why I need tips or hints Here is my code so far: def random_values random_values = Array.new letters = ['A','B','C','D','E','F'] for i in 1..15 if i As you probably see, I do not generate random numbers. I just shuffle the array containing the values I want, meaning all the numbers in the array are unique, which is not needed, but was the easiest solution for me when I wrote the code. I am most concerned about the return line .. If only it was possible to write like: return 3.times { random_values.shuffle[0] } or return random_values.shuffle[0].to_s *3 Thanks in advance!
