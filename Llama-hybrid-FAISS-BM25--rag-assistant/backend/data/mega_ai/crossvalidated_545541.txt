Can Deep Recurrent Networks (Modelling of Sequence / Panel Data) handle feature vectors of different dimensions?

I am currently learning on sequence modeling with the coursera course from deeplearning.ai about RNN in general as well as the GRU and LSTM. However I am now one week in and still not sure, if these algorithms can model the data we are interested to analyze. What we want to analyze We have panel data with some waves (i.e., sequences, e.g. from $T_1$ to $T_8$ ). With some questionnaires assessed at every timestep (e.g. our outcome, let's assume it could be Depression Sumscale measures with the BDI), and some shared predictors between all sequences (e.g., age, gender, daily activiy). This, as far as my understandings goes, could work fine with a many-to-many architecture where $T_x = T_y$ . Open Question Can RNNs (either RNN traditional, GRU, or LSTM) handle differences in the input of $x^{ }$ ? E.g. a questionnaire on quality of relationships is assessed at timepoits $x^{ }$ and $x^{ }$ , but was dismissed for all further waves. Or a newly developed questionnaire on fear related to Cov-19 was introduced in $x^{ }$ ? So my question is, can RNN handle such form of input data?
