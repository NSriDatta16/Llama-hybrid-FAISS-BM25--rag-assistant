what if the residual series from arima() not looks normal?

My time series is here and my code is here . I fit a model to a series with arima() in R with ARMA(5,5) and regression on some covariates. fit5 = arima(x, order=c(5,0,5), xreg=covaraites, include.mean=F) I am now checking if the fitted model is adequate. The residual series looks like: The residual series pass the Ljung Box test with a p value 0.3859. The ACF and PACF of the residual series are as follows (seems it is uncorrelated, right?): The qqplot for the residual series is as follows: qqnorm(fit5$residuals, asp = 1) qqline(fit5$residuals, asp=1) It looks okay within (-2, 2). I wonder if it is not okay to be Gaussian? IIC, arma model requires its residual series to be a white noise but not necessarily Gaussian. But arima() fits the model using MLE (assuming Gaussian residual series?). So if my residual series can't be taken as Gaussian, how shall I revise my model and what function in R I can use to fit to my time series?
