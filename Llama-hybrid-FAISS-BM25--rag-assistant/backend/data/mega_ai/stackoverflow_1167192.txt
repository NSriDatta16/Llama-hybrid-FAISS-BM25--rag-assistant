Remove spaces in file names apache

1.Hi, I have a internal use only file upload script that uploads the files to a directory. When I upload something from my computer with a spcace in the name i.e example 1.zip it uploads with a space in the name thus killing the link in a email. Is it possible to make apache remove the space when its uploaded or make it a underscore? The second problem I am having is how would I parse this to make the link an email link with the url of the file as the body of the email amd the email addy anything? if (move_uploaded_file($_FILES['file']['tmp_name'], $uploaddir . $_FILES['file']['name'])) { // uploaded file was moved and renamed succesfuly. Display a message. echo "Link: " . "http://example.org/" . $_FILES["file"]["name"];
