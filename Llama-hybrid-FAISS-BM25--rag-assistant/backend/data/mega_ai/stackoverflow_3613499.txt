If you're on an optimization kick, my advice is to get off it :-) Optimization is something that should be done in response to a performance problem, not a whim. If there's no performance problem, all optimization is wasted effort. Empty fields rarely make a large difference to data retrieval in a properly designed schema since most queries should, as much as possible, use indexes only for deciding which rows to get. Once the rows are discovered, that's when you go to the table to get the actual data. And speed of indexing won't change just because the column is stored in another table. If it needs to be indexed, then it needs to be indexed. I prefer my schema to be as simple as possible (while still mostly following 3NF) so as to avoid unnecessary joins.
