Wordpress menu issue on IE!

So I am building a site for a client. The problem is the menu I made doesn't work on IE. Here's the site: http://robertnogueira.com You'll see that the topmost menu isn't where it is supposed to be.. I know this could be a very simple problem to fix. But since I am new to web development I really can't find a way to fix it... Please help me figure it out.. Thanks!
