It looks like you have a classification problem and like you already know the correct classes. So I guess that you are asking for a supervised method from the area of Machine Learning (ML). To find some ideas about ML in general and get some method you can have a look at the paper A Few Useful Things to Know about ML . Beside simpler methods you could have a look to implementations of neural networks. In the paper Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification , but be aware that they classify for sentiments and also have whole sentences as input. Moreover, there are also projects with an API available, which give you a class for a given word. I am not able to remember one. Maybe some other user know more about that.
