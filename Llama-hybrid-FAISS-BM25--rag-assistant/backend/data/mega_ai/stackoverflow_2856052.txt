Nokia says no : It is not possible to make changes to the window flags once the window has been created without causing flicker. Flicker is unavoidable since the window needs to be recreated. But sometimes if you're stuck with a flashing effect that's kind of ugly like this, you can intentionally drag it out to make it seem like something "cool" just happened. Maybe pop up a little progress bar that's not in the window, say "Adjusting Window Properties!"...fade the window out of existence and then back in, and close the progress bar popup.
