This sounds like a decentralised "Agent" based approach. The "traditional" way of writing multithreaded code is a bit like a micromanagment at work - the boss hands out all work, and everyone else is expected to wait around expectantly for it to be given to them. Any work that needs to be passed between team members is passed via the boss. An Agent based approach is like empowering everyone on the team to seek out and get the job done, passing work between the team members as required. The boss knows what's going on, but has a executive monitoring role only.
