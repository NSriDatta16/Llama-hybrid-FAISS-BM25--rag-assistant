To what extent does machine learning make use of tensor algebra/calculus?

Is it useful to know something about tensor algebra or tensor calculus if one is interested in deeplearning? My question relates to both ML practice, and ML theory (but perhaps more to ML theory). EDIT : the existence of n-index arrays in ML is what motivates my question, but I am asking about the tools of tensor algebra/calculus. (Tensors can be represented by n index arrays, but the analysis is more abstract).
