I usually use a separate query like "select count(*) from table " to get counts because I usually need not only the count but a summation of the number of units or the average price or whatever and it's easier to write a separate query than to make more variables and say "TotalUnits = TotalUnits + rs("Units").value" inside the loop to display the results. It also comes in handy for the times you need to show the totals above the results and you don't want to loop though the recordset twice.
