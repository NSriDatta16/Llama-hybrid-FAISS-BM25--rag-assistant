As pointed out in the comment, this is a special case of the Negative Hypergeometric distribution . So the answer is, on average, $$\frac{m}{m+1}(n-m)$$ innocents will be killed before all $m$ traitors are killed, meaning $$\mathbb{E}(X) = \frac{m}{m+1}(n-m) + m$$ people total are killed on average. In other words, $\frac{1}{m+1}$ will be the average fraction of innocents that survive (independent of the total number of innocents). Pretty interesting result IMO. Even if you have a million innocents and just 9 traitors, only 10% of the innocents will survive on average if you keep killing randomly till the traitors are all gone.
