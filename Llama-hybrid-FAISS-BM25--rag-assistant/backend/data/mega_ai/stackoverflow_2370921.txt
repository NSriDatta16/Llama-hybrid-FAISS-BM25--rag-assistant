Tiles encoding problem

I'm trying to use UTF-8 encoding for the Spring application I'm developing but I have problems in getting the correct encoding when inserting attributes from tiles. I have this fragment in my JSP template: .... and in my tiles XML config file I have something like: ... I have check in eclipse that this files have UTF-8 encoding. The word passed in title attribute is not shown correctly (the accented characters are shown in a wrong way) in the page though the rest of the JSP is correct (for instance the JSP fragment which is inserted in header). If I change the encoding to ISO-8859-1 the title is OK, but the rest odf the page is wrong. It seems I cannot get to change the encoding to UTF-8 in my tiles file. I have also looked for "ISO-8859-1" in the files I've created and I haven't set up this configuration in any file. Can anyone tell me how can I set up the correct encoding for tiles? Thanks
