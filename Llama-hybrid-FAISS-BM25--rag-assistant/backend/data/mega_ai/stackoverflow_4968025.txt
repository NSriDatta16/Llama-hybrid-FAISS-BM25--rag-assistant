Expanding on Chris Kuehl's comment about SSH-ing with Java, you may want to look into one of these: JSch Ganymed SSH-2 I would assume (but I haven't looked into it) that with one of these one could feasibly write code that SSH's into a machine, then executes commands on it, capturing the output. It may be as simple as loading one of those libraries, writing code that connects via SSH to the machine, executes and captures the output of: cd your_dir , ls -R , then prints it.
