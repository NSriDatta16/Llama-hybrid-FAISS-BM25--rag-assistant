Interpreting spline results from scam

I would like to know how can I be able to interpret the results from fitting splines with the scam package. My data points are taken from the chileancredit dataset available in the package smbinning . Here are my x and y data points: library("scam") library("zoo") data(chileancredit, package = "smbinning") chilean_clean y is the moving average of a binary target variable. With the scam function I could fit a convex spline to my datapoints (I specified 5 parameters in total): spline_fit However, the five coefficients I could get from scam , I'm having trouble interpreting them: (Intercept) s(x).1 s(x).2 s(x).3 s(x).4 0.9275358 -4.3564887 -4.8378830 -4.8522646 -4.8950387 The first term is the intercept, however I've lookup up in the results of scam for knots or cuts - seems like there is none. I don't know how I could interpret the smoothing parameters without the knots. Anyone has any idea? Thanks.
