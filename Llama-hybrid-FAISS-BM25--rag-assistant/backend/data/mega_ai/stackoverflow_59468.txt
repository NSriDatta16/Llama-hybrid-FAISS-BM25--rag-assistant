To be honest, I think you tend to see this kind of thing happen over time, no matter how disciplined the organization is. It's natural for new methodologies to come bundled in the form of new libraries, frameworks, or even languages. Keep in mind that a .NET shop may well have been a ASP/VB shop at one time. They'll probably still maintain older systems for clients, because there's little benefit to rewriting everything from scratch. I'm not sure anyone has the luxury to keep everything "the same," because language issues are minor compared to library or framework issues -- especially the ones you build yourself.
