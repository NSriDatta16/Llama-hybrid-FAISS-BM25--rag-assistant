My feeling is that the question is about blatant political activism, is not evidence of anything relevant, and my concern is that such things should not be posted on this site. The chart shown, is propaganda, and propaganda is problematic no matter who is presenting it for whatever reason. Does that mean that we should neglect the application of statistics to a problem because the propaganda problem itself is absurd? Actually the need is striking. Lies, damned lies, and statistics is a historical reference to this, and underlines the magician's trick of misdirection to use our own preconceptions to fool us en mass. Can we find any stable data concerning terrorism? Sure, but we really have no motive for doing so. For example, let's take the number of US attacks from @MatthewGunn's Table, above and plot that. As the data is noisy, I also did a running average of the $\mu_{i}=\frac{1}{2}X_i+\frac{1}{2}\mu_{i-1}$ type. In either case, it is clear that the number of terrorist attacks has decreased significantly since 1995, and that this improvement appears bottomed out circa 2006-13. To continue our magic trick, let us point out that a lack of terrorist attacks means a lack of deaths from attacks no matter how noisy the relationship is between attacks and deaths caused. True enough, we do not know that the ratio between terrorist attacks and deaths caused is an absolute constant in time, but any such hypothetical effect would arguably enhance the result. So, is it worth investing billions or trillions in anti-terrorism just to reduce the number of terrorist attacks from five dozen to one dozen per annum? Obviously not. Terrorism is obviously not the problem. The terrorism magic trick relies on public perception fostered by obviously irresponsible journalism delivered on behalf of the desperately unscrupulous for digestion by the gullible. Then our "saviors" in the alt-left media, e.g., CNN , who are the progenitors of terrorism mythology$^1$ to begin with (e.g., CNN's three weeks of continuous loop narrative and images of 9/11 Twin Towers' attack), seek to debunk the nonsense they created by dangling it in front of our eyes, while pulling a fast one with finger counting. Indeed, this propaganda was so effective that it resulted in decreased Freedom of the Press . Relations between the media and the Bush administration sharply deteriorated after the president used the pretext of “national security” to regard as suspicious any journalist who questioned his “war on terrorism.” Now, does the OP question mean anything? The propaganda sheet cited by the OP is being used in a discussion of vetting of refugees, not terrorism. Of the 1000 current, ongoing FBI investigations for terrorism more than 300 (nearly 1/3rd) are being conducted on refugees Source: Jeff Sessions, US Attorney General . The FBI in 2016 had 12,486 FTEs working in Counterterrorism/Counterintelligence . The FBI is one of 13,160 law enforcement agencies that, as of October 31, 2015, collectively employed 635,781 sworn officers . As counterintelligence is not counterterrorism per se, and assuming proportionality one would expect at least 15,000 active investigations of refugees for crimes other than terrorism. Now, considering that in 2015 in the US there were an estimated 1,197,704 violent crimes, and 7,993,631 property crimes , 15,000 active investigations of refugees hardly seems exaggerated. However, refugees from certain lawless societies bring bad habits with them, like sticking a knife in you for recreational purposes, which although not terrorism per se, is also a useless distinction, and, when prison records are examined (e.g., in New York State, which unusually, actually keeps records) there are indeed some ethnic groups who have a high prison population. Overall, 10.0% of NY prisoners are foreign born. Of this 10% or 5,510 detainees, the largest subgroup, 2,697, reported birth in one of the island nations in the Caribbean basin, and not the Near East (only 78 detainees). So, yes, there is a problem with crime among the foreign born if the NY figures are any indication. Of the 19,889,657 NY State residents, Caribbean born are 1,080,000 or 5.4%. Among the prison detainees, 4.9% are Caribbean Islanders. So, it would seem they are just as bad as everyone else. Now concerning the Near East born, for all 50 states in the US, if I had to take a guess, I would guess ($H0$) that they are like everybody else with respect to crime, until proven otherwise. Moreover, the general lack of data for refugee crime and the lack of general definitive finding leaves us to speculate that the question itself is not statistically interesting. That is, we might be far better off looking at the socioeconomic status of a potential refugee; education, wealth, social status, occupation, etc. than at the isolated fact that someone is, or is not, a refugee. There are certain neighborhoods I would not walk around in at all, and others in which I would feel safe. This has less to do with which ethnic groups are in those neighborhoods than how much crime occurs in them. Preventing criminals from entering the US seems reasonable, no matter where they are from. That we find ourselves in a ridiculous political environment is a call to arms for searching out the truth. The only solution to that problem is to analyze well enough to find the truth and present that, and statistics is a very powerful tool for doing just that. Only the truth has enough economic leverage to be worth investing in. However, models have to achieve significance to be worth talking about, and, it is up to us to do exactly that. In conclusion, I see no evidence in the OP's chart that merits consideration. It is off-topic for the topic it pretends to discuss, and is meaningless. Then what is the problem, and what is its solution? The problem: Islamic culture regards Western culture as degenerate, and Western culture regards Islamic culture as a relic of the 12$^{\text{th}}$ century. The solution: 1) Islamic culture should be allowed a minimally acceptable degree of cultural isolation from the West. 2) Western culture should be allowed its own beliefs, which are sometimes difficult to accept even for those in the West, and without interference from Islamic culture. While many people are busy misunderstanding President Trump, I note that he wishes to end the problematic practice of promoting Western values as if they were an international "gold" standard. Indeed, this is less a right wing nationalist view than a simple recognition of the fact that the world is not, and may never be, ready for a mono-culture. Dowd C, Raleigh C.
