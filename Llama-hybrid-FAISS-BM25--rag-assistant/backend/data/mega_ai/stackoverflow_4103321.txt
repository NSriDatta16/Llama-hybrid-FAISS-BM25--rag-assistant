Magento - How to insert product image in transactional email

Basically I would like to include the product image to the New Order Email sent when ordering a product. I started in email/order/items/order/default.phtml with this code getItem() ?> getItem()->getOrder() ?> How do I use this code to fetch the image? Mage::helper('catalog/image')->init($_product, 'image')->resize(250) thanks for helping :)
