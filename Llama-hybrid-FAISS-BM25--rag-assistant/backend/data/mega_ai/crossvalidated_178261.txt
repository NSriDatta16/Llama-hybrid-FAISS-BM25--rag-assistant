The trouble with weighting is that your results will be arbitrary. For example, if you organize your responses on a 1-6 scale (1 being strongly disagree and 6 being strongly agree), then you're saying that the "distance" between a 1 and a 2 is the same as the "distance" between a 2 and a 3. (Here I use "distance" to indicate difference or the gap between what one number represents and another number represents.) What I would suggest is, depending on your analysis, looking into an ordered model of some sort. The ordering indicates that StD In broad strokes, ordered logit is going to be a fancy regression method that works with categorical data that has an order but isn't necessarily equally spaced out. Regression (as you may remember) is a way to measure the association between two variables by saying if one variable changes by $X$ amount, we expect the other variable to change by $Y$ amount. (I know you haven't taken a stats class recently, so hopefully this elucidates some of the ideas. There should be information online about how to conduct this sort of analysis.)
