There are three basic alternatives for building such an SMS server: 1) Attach mobile phones or USB GSM sticks to the server and use these for SMS communicaton. Limitations are Limited volumes (however your 100 SMS/day should be fine). Possibly rather unreliable due to consumer hardware (e.g. phone/stick firmware is not built for 24x7 operation, you may need to reset devices regularly; most mobile phones require a battery in order to function, batteries wear out). Possibly not placable in data centers, due to RF rules and mobile network coverage. Mobile number scheme limited to SIM MSISDN. 2) Connect the SMS to a network operators SMS gateway. Network operators use these exactly for this scenario: bulk SMS communication. These are proprietary and usually talk an "easier" to digest message transport protocol. Limitations: You are bound to the network operator, connection-wise and protocol-wise. Possibly delays in communication since the gateway might do store-and-forward. Depending on pricing scheme might make sense only for high volumes. 3) Connect the SMS server to the mobile operators SS7 network, adding it as a network element. Limitations: Complex implementation. Requires dedicated hardware (an SS7 interface card) and drivers to be programmed. Requires non-trivial network integration with network operator including extensive testing. Requires an E1/T1 line (or bigger, or SIGTRAN) for connection this is typically a data center thing, but not available in every data center. Expensive, in terms of pricing scheme and operation. Assuming I understand your requirements, for your case I would go for option 1) and place the SMS server where it has good coverage, i.e. not necessarily in the data center. Sell it as a head-end for the server infrastructure. If putting it in the data center is a must, then go to option 2) and check out your mobile network operators SMS wholesale offerings.
