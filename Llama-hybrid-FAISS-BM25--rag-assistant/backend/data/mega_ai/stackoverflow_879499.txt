It's more elegant if you materialize an auxiliary numbers table: SELECT num FROM numbers WHERE num IN (2,6,1,8); And this is also useful when combined with another table. For instance, I've had a case where I needed to populate large configuration tables with changes from piecewise results: Big SP or Excel sheet or report identifies missing cost centers in config gives a large set of results which need to be inserted with varying data in some groups. Paste partial results into a individual comma separated lists: INSERT INTO {stuff} SELECT {stuff}, 130 as line_item FROM numbers WHERE numbers.num IN ({pasted a section of results}) INSERT INTO {stuff} SELECT {stuff}, 135 as line_item FROM numbers WHERE numbers.num IN ({pasted another section of results})
