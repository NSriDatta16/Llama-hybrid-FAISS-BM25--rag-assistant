One explanation could be that partial correlation is higher than regular correlation, i.e. the regression $$ y_t=\beta_0+\beta_1 x_s+u_t $$ yields an insignificant $\beta_1$ while $$ y_t=\beta_0+\beta'_1 x_s+\alpha_1 y_s+v_t $$ yields a significant $\beta'_1$. That could happen. For Granger causality test it is the partial correlation that matters. ould you tell me though how could I very that on R. Since I don't think there is a function to verify the partial correlation between two time series Partial correlation depends on what other variables you are considering. Run a regression model and check the coefficient significance â€“ that will tell whether the partial correlation is significant. That is what the Granger causality test is doing. (So you already know the answer.)
