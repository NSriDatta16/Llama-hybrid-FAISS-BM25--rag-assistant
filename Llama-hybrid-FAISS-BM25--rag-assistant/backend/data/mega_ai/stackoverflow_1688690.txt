How can I easily add storage to a VirtualBox machine with XP installed?

When I installed Windows XP on a VirtualBox machine, I made the hard drive only 10 GB since and assumed it would expand in size (as do hard drives in VMWare as far as I can remember, isn't this true?). In any case, I'm trying to install Visual Studio 2010 beta on this Virtual Box XP image and it has run out of disk space. Googling for an answer, I'm finding complicated tutorials like this which show you how to increase the size of a VirtualBox hard drive "in just a couple hours ". But I can't imagine it would be that hard to either: increase the size of a virtual disk (after all, it is virtual) create a new hard drive of, say, 20 GB and just attach it in the virtual machine as the D: or E: drive How can I easily add storage space to a VirtualBox machine with XP installed?
