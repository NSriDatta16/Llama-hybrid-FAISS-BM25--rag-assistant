Magento has a data sync service you can check out, and I expect that your backend/ERP system may have a dedicated bridge as well. If not, you can use the Webservices built into Magento to build a sync'd system. Make sure to choose a single system of record for your inventory information and have the other system feed from it for information. Hope that helps! Thanks, Joe
