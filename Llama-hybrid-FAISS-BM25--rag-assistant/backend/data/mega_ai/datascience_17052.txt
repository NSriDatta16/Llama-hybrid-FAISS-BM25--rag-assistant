Predict customer action from previous buying history

I'm trying to predict what service a customer wants when he comes to our office from his previous transactions history. I have 7 years transactions data(3 crore txns) and good amount of customers are frequent ones.Each service is personal to each customers. sample data [ { "customerId":"1xxxx", "txns":[ { "serviceId":"12ds23", "date":"2016-08-03T08:43:33Z" }, { "serviceId":"1dsd89", "date":"2016-09-03T08:43:33Z" }, { "serviceId":"1dbbb89", "date":"2016-10-03T09:43:33Z" } ] },{ "customerId":"2xxxx", "txns":[ { "serviceId":"dds2dfsd", "date":"2016-08-03T08:43:33Z" }, { "serviceId":"dsdsdsdf", "date":"2016-09-03T08:43:33Z" }, { "serviceId":"sdfbb9", "date":"2017-10-03T09:43:33Z" }, ... ... ] }, ... .. .. ] Can someone please advice which Machine learning technique or statistical approach would be best in this case. I can think of a Decision tree classification/Logistic regression model taking date(month,day,day of week) as features for predicting the service he wants as Class labels
