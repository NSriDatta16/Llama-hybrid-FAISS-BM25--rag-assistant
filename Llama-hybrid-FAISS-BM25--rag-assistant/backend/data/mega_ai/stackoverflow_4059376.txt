Answering in the context of allocating memory, when you invoke the memory allocator and request 24 bytes of memory, it must be able to locate a single block of at least 24 bytes of unallocated memory. If it has 16 bytes of memory starting at one address x and another 8 bytes starting at an address y such that y > x + 16 or y (that would create a gap), then the allocator cannot satisfy your request for 24 bytes even though there is a total of 24 bytes free.
