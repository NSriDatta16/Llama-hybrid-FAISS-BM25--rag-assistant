Consideration of type/unit errors relevant in statistics and correlation studies?

In http://www.academia.edu/1067827/Defence_of_Empirical_Evidence , Paul Cockshott argues that "type error" must be considered. So, the type of the average cost of the unit of oil is dollars/barrel, while the type of the average of cost of the unit of pencil is dollars/pencil. He argues that these two are basically incomparable, so are inappropriate for correlation studies. My question is, is this true?
