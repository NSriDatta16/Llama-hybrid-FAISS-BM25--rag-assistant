I'd suggest you reconsider your design, browsers are not the most responsive of applications on a good day for a variety of reasons. In addition to this the design of embedding a database in the browser session (no matter how light) is placing explicit demand on the thin client. The thin client may or may not have the resources to support the requirements. If you have explicit control over the thin clients (corporate environment?) it would be best to leverage some desktop technologies or applets (java?) outside of the immediate browser context.
