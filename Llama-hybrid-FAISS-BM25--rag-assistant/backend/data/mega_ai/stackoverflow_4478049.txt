I doubt that the error you get has to do anything with the forwarding. The error is STG_E_REVERTED, and that is related to structured storage (which your method appears to be completely unrelated to). The error is apparently particularly frequent in SharePoint applications. Edit : Structured Storage is a Microsoft API for persistence in COM.
