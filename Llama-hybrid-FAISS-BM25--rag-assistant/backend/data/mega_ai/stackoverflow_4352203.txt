Any PHP function that will strip properties of an object that are null?

I am returning a json_encode() of an array of objects pulled from an ORM. It includes lots of properties with a null value. What is the neatest way to remove these properties that are null? I guess I could iterate over the properties, look if they are null and then unset() that property, but surely there must be a more elegant way?
