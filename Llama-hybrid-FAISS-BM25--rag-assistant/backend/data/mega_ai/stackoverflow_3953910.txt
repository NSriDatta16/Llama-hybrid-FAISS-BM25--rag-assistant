C++\IronPython integration example code?

I'm looking for a simple example code for C++\IronPython integration , i.e. embedding python code inside a C++, or better yet, Visual C++ program. The example code should include: how to share objects between the languages, how to call functions\methods back and forth etc... Also, an explicit setup procedure would help too. (How to include the Python runtime dll in Visual Studio etc...) I've found a nice example for C#\IronPython here , but couldn't find C++\IronPython example code.
