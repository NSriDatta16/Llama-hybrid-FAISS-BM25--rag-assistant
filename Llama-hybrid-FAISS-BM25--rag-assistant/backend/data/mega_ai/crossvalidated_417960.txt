How would you fit ARIMA model with lots of autocorrelations? discusses the need for anthropogenic variables (deterministic input series) rather than using memory or sines & cosines ( see Is Prophet from Facebook any different from a linear regression? for a discussion along these lines) in building models. I have seen very successful applications where 96 hourly models are used in conjunction with daily patterns based upon calendar effects while incorporating user specified supporting predictors both at the interval level and at the daily level. Take a look at Forecasting hourly time series with daily, weekly & annual periodicity where I built a model for 1 of the 24 hours ... you would have 96 models one for each of the 15 minute intervals.
