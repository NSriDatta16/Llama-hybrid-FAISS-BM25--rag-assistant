you need to add a div outside of your container and then make it droppable by adding a function similar to: $("#droppableDiv").droppable ({ drop: function() { alert('dropped'); } }); instead of the alert('dropped'); part you could add a little bit of code that removes the img element from the container div. here is a example that does some other thing but makes use of droppable and draggable objects, maybe it can help you understand how it works! hope this helps -Fortes
