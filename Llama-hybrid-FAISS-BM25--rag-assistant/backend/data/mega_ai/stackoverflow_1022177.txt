According to this page on MSDN properties and methods do have some essential differences. Especially when it comes to returning arrays, properties perform a shallow copy of the whole array before returning it, so that is one situation where you want to use a custom function instead. However, as I explained above, I wanted to know if the program would suffer from a performance penalty if I used properties instead of functions in any way. Overall I did find out that properties are on average about 5% slower than functions for some unexplained reason. It could be because properties boast a whole range of "invisible" objects such as propertydescriptors and the like. Besides that, the implementations seem to be fairly similar.
