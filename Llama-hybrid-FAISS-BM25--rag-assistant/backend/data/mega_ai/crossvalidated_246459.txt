Computation of log-loss optimal function

I am new to machine learning. Though I know the basic concept of loss functions, Bayes optimal function, Bayes Risk etc. as well as the fundamental concepts of probability, calculus and so on, I canâ€™t seem to figure out the following exercise: Let $Y_I = \{-1,1\}$ and $f: X \to \mathbb{R}$. Compute explicitly the minimizer $f_L(x)$ of the logistic loss $$ L(y, f(x)) = \text{log}(1 + \text{exp}(-y\,f(x)))$$ in dependency of $\mathbb{P}(Y = 1| X = x)$. What do I have to do here? Obviously I have to minimize some function but minimizing the loss function itself does not work. I revisited the lecture notes and apparently it is $$ \arg\max\limits_{y} \mathbb{E}[L(y, f(x)), \mathbb{P}(Y = 1|X = x)].$$ This is equivalent to $$\arg\max\limits_y \int_{\mathbb{R}} L(y,f(x))\mathbb{P}(Y=1|X=x),$$ right? But what is $\mathbb{P}(Y=1|X=x)$ exactly? And how to proceed?
