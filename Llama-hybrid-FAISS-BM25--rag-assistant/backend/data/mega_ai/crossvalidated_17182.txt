I am relatively new to Bayesian methods, but one thing that that irks me is that, while I understand the rationale of priors (i.e. science is a cumulative endeavour, so for most questions there is some amount of previous experience/thinking that should inform your interpretation of the data), I dislike that the Bayesian approach forces you to push subjectivity to the beginning of the analysis, rendering the end result contingent. I believe this is problematic for two reasons: 1) some less well versed readers won't even pay attention to the priors, and interpret Bayesian results as non-contingent; 2) unless the raw data is available, it is hard for readers to reframe the results in their own subjective priors. This is why I prefer likelihood ratios, they put the subjectivity at the end by simply quantifying relative evidence values and leaving it up to the reader to apply their own subjective criteria to determine whether they believe the evidence is sufficiently in favor of either model involved in the ratio. (Astute critics will note that even the likelihood ratio is "contingent" in the sense that it is contingent on the parameterization of the models being compared; however this is a feature shared by all methods, Frequentist, Bayesian and Likelihoodist)
