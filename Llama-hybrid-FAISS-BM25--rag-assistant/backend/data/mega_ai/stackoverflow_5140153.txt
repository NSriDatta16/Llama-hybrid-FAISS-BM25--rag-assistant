You can define file as a resource in rails routing. Then you have your RESTful routes. It doesn't matter for rails if you have a file- or a database-resource. The RESTful routes are the same. The unique identifier for your files could be the unique filename: "/files/file.pdf". I would suggest you to use an abstraction to perform operations on the filesystem (like an Object-Relational Mapping for database access). I could think of carrierwave for example. It handles file uploads and provides basic operations like delete/destroy. Also it allows you to change you storage volume (file, gridfx, amazon s3). I'm not sure what you mean with different instances of a filemanager. It would be possible to define a file manager for each user. For instance with carrierwave you can define custom storage dirs: # mount uploader in user class class User mount_uploader :file, UserUploader end # define user uploader class UserUploader I hope you get an idea!
