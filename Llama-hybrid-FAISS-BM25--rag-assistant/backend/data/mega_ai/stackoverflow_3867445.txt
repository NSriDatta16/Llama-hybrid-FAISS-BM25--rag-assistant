Double my money: my framework uses doubles for monetary amounts

I've inherited a project in which monetary amounts use the double type. Worse, the framework it uses, and the framework's own classes, use double for money. The framework ORM also handles retrieval of values from (and storage to) the database. In the database money values are type number(19, 7), but the framework ORM maps them to doubles. Short of entirely bypassing the framework classes and ORM, is there anything I can do to calculate monetary values precisely? Edit: yeah, I know BigDecimal should be used. The problem is that I am tightly tied to a framework that where, e.g., the class framework.commerce.pricing.ItemPriceInfo has members double mRawTotalPrice; and double mListPrice. My company's application's own code extends, e.g, this ItemPriceInfoClass. Realistically, I can't say to my company, "scrap two years of work, and hundreds of thousands of dollars spent, basing code on this framework, because of rounding errors"
