I would suggest that you consider placing your outer transaction in a stored procedure as well so that you maintain all of your nesting within TSQL (use EXEC to call other stored procs). SQL Server is a surprisingly rich development / data management environment and will permit you to manage your transactions in ways that ADO handles clumsily. Keep in mind, too, that it is almost always more efficient to gang a bunch of SQL together in a stored proc than it is to make multiple calls over an ADO connection.
