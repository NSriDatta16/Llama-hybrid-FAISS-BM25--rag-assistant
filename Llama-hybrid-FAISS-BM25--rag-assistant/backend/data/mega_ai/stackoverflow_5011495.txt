It means you are hitting a file length limit in Silverlight isolated storage. The base storage location for isolated storage can be in a path with a very long name - it looks something like: C:\\Users\\kevind\\AppData\\LocalLow\\Microsoft\\Silverlight\\is\\1325qaxz.ekn\\xyro13wm.cn0\\1\\s\\qc4wuhalx4ciu4u5hbqqfohd3y3y4m1guyj5xuv5ml5y5qjbjmaaaeea\\f (and can be even longer on XP, where the base is C:\Documents and Settings) Given that, it doesn't take much to hit the 260 character file path limit. The base path plus the internal path (inside isolated storage) plus the file name has to be less than 260 characters. I've seen two different failure modes in this case: Trying to create a directory where the total path length (base path plus new path) is longer than 260 characters. This results in a PathToLongException raised by IsolatedStorageFile.CreateDirectory Trying to create a file using IsolatedStorageFileStream, where the total path length (base path plus internal path plus file name) is greater than 260 characters. This results in an IsolatedStorageException (IsolatedStorage_Operation_ISFS) raised by the IsolatedStorageFileStream constructor. As far as I can tell, there's no real solution to this problem aside from catching the exceptions and carrying on. It's an unfortunately limitation of Silverlight. There's a good article about the issue here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dd458794.aspx
