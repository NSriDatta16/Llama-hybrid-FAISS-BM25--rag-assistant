I used to be very afraid of merges, but I've never seen a case where SVN's automatic merge failed. It can mess up business logic obviously because two edits may logically conflict without physically conflicting, but I don't think it will do an automatic merge unless it's appropriate. If you don't have regression tests, your cow-orker may be right due to the fact that there is no review of the "Logic Merge"; but if you have decent test coverage it's really not worth the time. I really dislike SVN's "merge syntax" for conflicts, but most tools seem to hide it.
