Significance of Difference between Two Extremes (Maxima/Minima)

I am comparing two different populations (with different sizes) of models, for each individual I have a score. I'd like to compare not only the difference of the two means but the maximum value. I've learnt in the past to perform significance test when comparing averages between groups but this is the first time that I'm trying to do the same with an extreme value (maximum in this case). To summarise, my question is: what is the right way to know whether the difference $max(P_1) - max(P_2)$ is significant?
