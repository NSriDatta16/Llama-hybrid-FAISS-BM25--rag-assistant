What should be the best CNN model for Feature extraction of images for Image-Image search engine using LSH?

I have images something like the below: And like this: I have a huge data around 20M or so am I want to apply de-duplication and improve the search for this Image data. What I have in mind is to use Train and Extract Features from a CNN based Network and apply LSH: Locality Sensitive Hashing or Approximate Nearest Neighbour: ANN . I want to know that which model should I use to extract the features. I am thinking about training Siamese network (Maybe ResNet based architecture, if possible) or any of the pre trained Imagenet classifiers like pre trained VGG, ResNet, MobileNet etc. Which one should I use because I think I have a different use case because it is more like an OCR kind of approach rather than Classifier . For training purposes, I think I can have around 100K-1M images. Also, can I use U-Net or AutoEncoders?
