As described in Ganesh's post, you want to do IO in a pure function , which isn't possible. Ways to express your program (*you'll have to use length ind > 3 anyway) 1 Use error (best way) as shown in the other posts 2 Use pattern guards ( non exhaustive patterns -exception will occur) 3 Implement the IO properly: retrieve ind dat = if ind >= 3 then do return [exC ind d | d retrieve will have the type retrieve :: [Int] -> [[String]] -> IO [[String]] 4 Use Maybe to express that the computation may fail. retrieve :: [Int] -> [[String]] -> Maybe [[String]] retrieve [] dat = [[]] retrieve ind dat | length ind > 3 = Nothing | otherwise = Just [exC ind d | d
