The answer is No. Random forests don't need k-fold CV. As an example, when I compare RF classification results with other classifiers for which k-fold CV was used, I only perform a single run with the entire input dataset for the RF model. RF will take care of the training and testing data by itself -- so it is unlike many other classifiers, and this is by design (by Leo Breiman).
