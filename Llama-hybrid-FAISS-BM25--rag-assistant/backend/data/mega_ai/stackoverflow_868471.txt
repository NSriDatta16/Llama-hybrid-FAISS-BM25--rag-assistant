Ideally you should learn MVC first as it forces you to learn and understand the various parts of the web such as HTTP Requests, the statelessness of the web, HTML, CSS, etc. As a result, if you ever decide to use webforms, or are forced to use webforms, you understand how things are abstracted away and can better code to the efficiencies of the application. The appeal of drag and drop from webforms might be very very appealing at first. But after a little time, you can see how nice MVC is for the fact that it forces you to take total control of your code from the get go. Personally, I dabbled in webforms for a little bit -- but after using MVC, there's no going back. And on a side not, MVC is built on top of webforms, so you can always use them if you want to.
