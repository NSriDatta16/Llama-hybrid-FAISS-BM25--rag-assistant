How to interpret high P-value and low Mcnemar's Test P-value in Caret R?

I am using the caret R package to evaluate machine learning models. This gives me a lot of information about different metrics. I am confused about my result why the P-value (0.998) is extremely high and the Mcnemar's Test P-value (0.004427) is very low. I don't understand what it means that there is suggest a big difference between those two metrics. This is the Confusion Matrix and Statistics: Could anyone please explain how to interpret these P-value results?
