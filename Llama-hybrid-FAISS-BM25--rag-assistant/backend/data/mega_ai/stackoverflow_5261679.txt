Replacing #defines constants

I am currently working on a project (in C) and we using #defines for default variables. This variables are used to layout a battery buffered ram structure. Now we have different customers that have different layouts. In the past we would just create a whole new piece of software. Now we are trying to get away from this fragmentation and use the same code base. We have a general library (used across all projects) that has a set of #define s and declares the structures. Currently we have a custom header file(which contains #defines for that project) and it gets compares these to #define s in the general library. If different it throws an error. We want to keep the custom header file but I am trying to find a solution for replacing the #define s in the general library. One idea is to replace them with some sort of variable another is to use some sort of preprocessor define. In the past we have used ifdef s but the code is really cluttered and horrible to follow so we are trying to get away from that as well. Anyone have any solutions?
