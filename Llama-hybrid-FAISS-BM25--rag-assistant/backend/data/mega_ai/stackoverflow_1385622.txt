SQL has to do perform the same steps to gather the required information to prepare for a GROUP BY or for the 'equivalent' DISTINCT query: same filters, same sorting etc. The difference is in the final step, which here Postgre calls 'Group' or 'Unique'. When a GROUP BY query does not include any aggregate in its SELECT, 'Group' and 'Unique' are essentially the same thing (even if they boil down to distinct methods in the code of the server). In the presence of some aggregate such as say COUNT(*), MAX(some_field) etc. the 'Group' step is a bit more resource intensive as it needs extra storage to store the tally, the min etc. and it needs to increment or compare with it etc. I would go with the GROUP BY approach, as it may would to add aggregates in the SELECT, if such info was desired at some time, without changing the query much. Even if the actual count was not displayed it may be nice for the application to show the domains in descending order of this count.
