Some changes you could make to make it work: Bars is nested in Foo not the opposite, so instead of BarsController you should write your new action inside your FoosController as follow: def new @foo = Foo.new @bar = @foo.bars.build end Inside your foo model you should have: accepts_nested_attributes_for :bars Your view: Don't forget the create action inside your FoosController: FoosController def create @foo = Foo.new(params[:foo]) if @foo.save redirect_to @foo else render :new end end Finally, pay attention to the validations written in your models! For instance it is possible that some fields (that you forgot to fill during your tests) are necessary for your form to be valid! Happened to me recently!
