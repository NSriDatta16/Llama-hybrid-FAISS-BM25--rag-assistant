Yes, you can use ObjectOutputStream/ObjectInputStream for simplicity, or you can convert the BigInteger to a byte[], and serialize that value instead of the entire Object. The latter would save a significant amount of storage space over serializing the entire Object. Also, if you use stream classes that are not already buffered, remember to wrap your OutputStreams and InputStreams in BufferedOutputStream and BufferedInputStream to improve performance, and flush() after you're done writing (if you don't flush() the BufferedOutputStream, the InputStream may stall or hang waiting for input). If you're worried about bandwidth or file size, you can also wrap your streams in GZipOutputStream/GZipInputStream for automatic compression. I wouldn't worry about compressing the data unless you actually observe poor performance or huge files, however.
