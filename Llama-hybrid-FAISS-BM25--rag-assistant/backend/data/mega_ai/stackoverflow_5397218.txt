Get all Image Elements within a Grid->Canvas using LINQ?

i'm using a Grid within my Application which Contain some Canvas Elements which Contain some Images or Textblocks. e.g.: Now i need to get all Image Elements within the Grid. Currently i'm using several foreach loops and if-statements to achive this. But i was asking myself if there isn't a more elegant way using LINQ so fetch all Image Elements from the Grid. But unfortunely my LINQ Knowledges aren't that well so i didn't found a way to get the to the Children of the Canvas Element. Maybe someone has a good Solution to this. Thanks in advance and kind regards Kornelis
