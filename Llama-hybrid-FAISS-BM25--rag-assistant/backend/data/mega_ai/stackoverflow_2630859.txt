What files in Magento have no purpose being in source control?

I am looking to clean up the file that we store in source control (SVN) for the Magento projects we are working on. Which files/folder are have no purpose being in SVN, ie the ones are not necessary for the site to function, or are only transient? So far I have identified var\cache var\session media\temp var\locks downloader\pearlib\download downloader\pearlib\cache There are some I am unsure about: var\report downloader\pearlib\docs media\catalog\product\cache\ Can anyone provide a definitive list?
