In multi-class logistic regression, does SGD one training example update all the weights?

In multi-class logistic regression, lets say we use softmax and cross entropy. Does SGD one training example update all the weights or only a portion of the weights which are associated to the label ? For example, the label is one-hot [0,0,1] Does the whole matrix W_{feature_dim \times num_class} updated or only W^{3}_{feature_dim \times 1} updated ?
