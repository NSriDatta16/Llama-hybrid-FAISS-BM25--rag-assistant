I would recommend proceeding by analogy to the OLS case. In OLS, you interpret $R^2$ as total variance explained and decompose it additively into contributions from each predictor. First, you need an alternative to $R^2$ that makes sense for ZIP regression. You could look at the various pseudo-$R^2$ , or look at measures of deviance . Once you have an "$R^2$", it is straightforward to adapt OLS variance decomposition to ZIP regression. Essentially, you will add your regressors to the model one by one and record the increase in "$R^2$" as you add it. Since this depends on the regressors already in the model, you need to repeat this for all possible orders in which your regressors could enter the model, and finally average over all orders. Gr√∂mping (2007, The American Statistician ) has some pointers to literature.
