OK, so after a bit of fiddling, here's the answer (which may seem obvious to some, but the count() function in MySQL was giving me some grief): @post = Post.find(params[:id], :include => {:comments => :user}, :conditions => "comments.blocked = 0 OR posts.comments_count = 0") comments_count is a counter_cache field, so I'm getting around the explicit use of the MySQL count() function. It feels like a kludge, but for now I'm OK with that. If anyone has a more elegant solution, please let me know!
