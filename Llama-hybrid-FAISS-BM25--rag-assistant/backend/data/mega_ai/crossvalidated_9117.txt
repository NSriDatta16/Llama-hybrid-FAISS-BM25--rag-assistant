I can recommend Tableau as a good tool for data exploration and visualization, simply because of the different ways that you can explore and view the data, simply by dragging and dropping. The graphs are fairly sharp and you can easily output to PDF for presentation purposes. If you want you can extend it with some "programming". I regularly use this tool along with "R" and SAS and they all work together well.
