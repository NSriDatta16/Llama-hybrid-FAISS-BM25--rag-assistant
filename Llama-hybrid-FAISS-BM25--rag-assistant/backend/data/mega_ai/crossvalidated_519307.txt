Machine learning explainability is an area of active research, quite popular in recent years. This question cannot be answered briefly, because there are many research papers, tutorials , and even books on this subject. It would be an impossible task to summarize them in few sentences. I would encourage you to check the freely available online book Interpretable Machine Learning by Christoph Molnar that deals with this subject. TL;DR for model-agnostic explanations of individual predictions, you can check methods such as SHAP or LIME . However, keep in mind that those methods approximate your model to give you the explanations, so it is always possible that those explanations may be incorrect.
