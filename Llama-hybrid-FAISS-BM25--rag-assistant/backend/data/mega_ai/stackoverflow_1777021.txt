Which open-source project can be used a 'showcase' for mid-size project MAKEFILE management?

now i need to design/organize the source-code structure and makefiles for the next project. This is a software implemented largely by C++ and supposed to be used normally on Linux. It will include following components: projecthome/3rd_party_lib_boost/ hdr and src projecthome/3rd_party_lib_from_vendor/ hdr and src # libraries that will use 3rd party libs projecthome/lib_base_struct/ hdr and src projecthome/lib_utilites/ hdr and src # applications that will generate binaries, they depend on the above libs, these applications will be developed on after another, while the number of libraries are likely to be fixed. projecthome/app_1/ hdr and src projecthome/app_2/ hdr and src # shell scripts that run the above binaries projecthome/sh # python scripts that analyze the logs projecthome/py # the configuration files that need to configure the binaries projecthome/config # how to build? this is the most difficult party now I need to address projecthome/build Now I need a way to organize the above files, and most importantly, the makefiles. This is the first time that I design such an 'architecture' by myself. So I come here for advices. I think the most convenient way is to download an open-source project's source and use it as a model. Can any one recommend a mid-size project who has similar structure as above? oh, my project is not very large, i think it should have 10k-20k lines of c++ code another thing is that, I hope the above components will not depend too much on each other, because at least one application will be sub-contracted to people outside of the company, I don't want him/her checkout the whole projecthome directory to compile. Can anyone give me a clue ? thanks a lot!
