Embed a flash movie in Wordpress post

I am trying to get this flash carousel to show up in a Wordpress post. I can right click on the blank space where it should be and bring up the flash options menu, but no movie is showing. It links to an xml document that pulls in the images and text. Is it an xml issue? Below is what I placed in my wordpress template header to allow the flash movie to run: /scripts/swfobject.js" type="text/javascript"> function MyFunction(p1){ alert("You have clicked on: " + p1); } Everything is where it should be including the reference to the swfobject being in the themes "scripts" folder. Now here is the code I put in the post I am working on: is replaced by the Flash content! (see "SWFObject embed by Geoff Stearns ..." below) Place your alternate content here and users without the Flash plugin or with Javascript turned off will see this.--> var so = new SWFObject("3dcarouseldev.swf", "3dcarouseldev", "780", "460", "8.0.0.0", "#ffffff"); so.addParam("quality", "high"); so.addParam("scale", "noscale"); so.addParam("menu", "false"); so.addParam("salign", "lt"); so.addParam("wmode", "transparent"); so.addParam("flashvars", "configfile=3dcarousel.xml"); so.write("flashcontent"); Any reason this won't work even though I am linked correctly to all support files? Does Wordpress not like embedding Flash? The hosting is on Godaddy if that helps any. Thanks!
