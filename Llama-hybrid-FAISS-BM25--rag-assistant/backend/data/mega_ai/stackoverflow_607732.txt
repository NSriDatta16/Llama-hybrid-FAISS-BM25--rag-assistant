That's going to depend a lot on the device itself as well as the UI that you're putting on it. Many touchscreens (excluding multitouch) average the area touched, so chances are you don't want to put UI items any closer than fingertip area to cut down on mis-touches. Touch screens need to be calibrated post installation, and even then there might be some parallax depending on the screen type or the natural angle from which the screen is being viewed. You might also consider visual feedback on touch down and only let the event through on touch release. When you get a touch, display an x larger than a fingertip centered on the point of contact and let it track until the touch is released. That point is the click point. Above all, user test, user test, user test. If you're really worried about size - make it fluid so you can change it easily and test it on real users under real circumstances. Did I mention user testing?
