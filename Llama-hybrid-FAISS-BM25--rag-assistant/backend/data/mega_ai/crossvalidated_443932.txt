Computation of the intercept in logistic regression model

I'm trying to understand the way the odds of the reference groups are computed. Let's consider an example from this paper . Data can be summarised in the table: The reference group is Older and New . The authors run a logistic regression model and found that: So, exp(β0) = exp(−2.121) = 0.12 is the chance of death among those individuals that are older and received new treatment. How can this chance of death (0.12) can be computed directly from the data? Why it's not just 6/34? Thanks!
