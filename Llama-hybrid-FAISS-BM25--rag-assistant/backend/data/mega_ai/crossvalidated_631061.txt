For the Differential Attrition Rate test, you could consider a Chi-Squared Test of Independence, if you have sufficiently large samples - with small samples, this test has low power. An alternative is Fisher's Exact Test. Here's how we can do a Differential Attrition Rate test for pre to post, and post to follow-up # Calculate the number of dropouts and completers at each stage data $dropout_pre_post pre - data $post data$ dropout_post_follow $post - data$ follow # Create a contingency table for pre to post # This is a test of attrition from pre to post: table_pre_post $pre, data$ dropout_pre_post), ncol = 2) # Fisher's Exact Test fisher.test(table_pre_post) # And similarly for post to follow-up: # Create a contingency table for post to follow-up table_post_follow $post, data$ dropout_post_follow), ncol = 2) # Fisher's Exact Test fisher.test(table_post_follow) With only three groups and small numbers, power could be an issue. These tests might not detect a difference unless it is quite large. Be cautious with the interpretation of the p-values, especially with small sample sizes. If possible, supplement these tests with a qualitative assessment of attrition reasons, which might provide additional insights into whether attrition is likely to be differential or selective. For the Selective Attrition Test, which assesses whether the characteristics of the dropouts are different from those who remained in the study, you could use a logistic regression model which can be used to model the probability of dropout as a function of group and other relevant covariates. Another, perhaps more appropriate possibility would be a survival analysis, as suggested by Demetri Pananos in the comment to the question. This would likely require a reshaping of your data, but is specifically designed for "time to event" data, which you seem to have.
