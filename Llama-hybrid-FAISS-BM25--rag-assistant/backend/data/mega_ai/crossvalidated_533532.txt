There’s a discussion if Is random state a parameter to tune? There are known results of non-reproducible results of neural networks or reinforcement learning algorithms when using different seeds. One of the answers to the above thread applies to your question as well: … As a consequence, random state values which performed well in the validation set do not correspond to those which would perform well in a new, unseen test set. Indeed, depending on the algorithm, you might see completely different results by just changing the ordering of training samples. Yes, results depend on the seed, but you have no guarantee that the seed that worked for the cross-validation splits would work equally well for model trained on the whole data.
