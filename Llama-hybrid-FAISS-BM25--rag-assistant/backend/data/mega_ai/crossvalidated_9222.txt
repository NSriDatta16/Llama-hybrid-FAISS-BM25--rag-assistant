There's a thread on the R-help list about this; see for example: http://tolstoy.newcastle.edu.au/R/e8/help/09/12/9200.html The first suggestion there is to repeat the test a large of number of times with different jittering and then combine the p-values to get an overall p-value, either by taking an average or a maximum. They also suggest that a straightforward permutation test could be used instead (of the two, that's what I'd prefer). See the question Which permutation test implementation in R to use instead of t-tests (paired and non-paired)? for some examples of permutation tests. Elsewhere in that thread, Greg Snow writes: Adding random noise to data in order to avoid a warning is like removing the batteries from a smoke detector to silence it rather than investigating the what is causing the alarm to go off.
