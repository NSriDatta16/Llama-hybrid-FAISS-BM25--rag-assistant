I finally managed to train a neural network with desired quality (almost 100% overfitting): # set NN input % dense1 %>% dense2 %>% dense3 %>% dense4 tsne_model Inputs were Z-normalized, and outputs were scaled to [0;1]. Training took about 10,000 epochs with batch size (500,000 / 64), but I varied this number during training, and learning rate that worked well was 1e-4 to 5e-5. Generated image: Correlation test: Final epochs: I could go on, but this quality is just enough. Some thoughts about what was important: I failed using elu activations in surpsiging way: produced image contained intersecting lines representing densed points at different angles, which made me think it was local minima and it looked weired and more like modern art. When I used parallel layers for x and y coordinates the image contained two orthogonal lines with dense points (like a sniper crosshair), which was also a kinf of local minima. I also experimented with input and output preprocessing, and output layer activation. Surprisingly, when an output layer was linearly activated, the image became quadratic. Besides, a batch size was really important . Again, surprisingly, the larger batch size I set (let's say 500,000 / 8) the worst the converge I got. What worked well is smaller batch size, and this is really solid as I observed this numerous times. After 3 weeks of on-and-off experiments I found that classic tanh and sigmoid and with classic preprocessing works well. I cannot say analytically why this configuration behaves well, it is very black box, but somehow I found it intuitively. But the funniest thing is: Since I overfitted heavily, and I had found that overfitting starts pretty early, meaning that tSNE produces stochastic and noisy patterns to learn, the neural network prediction that I got on the new data (which are actually news texts) looks like a muddy spot as if there are no clusters. It is laughing at my efforts. Don't overfit. ) But if I did not overfit, I would get a blurry picture as well, hmm.
