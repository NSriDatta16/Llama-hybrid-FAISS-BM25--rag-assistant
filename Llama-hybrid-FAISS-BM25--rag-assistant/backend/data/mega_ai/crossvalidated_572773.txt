How to do hypothesis testing with real-valued data

Disclaimer: I don't mean real-valued data in the sense that the data could be any number in $\mathbb{R}$ , I mean it rather in that there is no proportion/percentage. Let $A$ be a dataset that has $n$ samples of how many semesters students needed to graduate from college in school X in 1950, let's assume the mean is $\mu_A$ . Let $B$ be a dataset with $m$ samples that contains how many semesters needed to graduate from college in school X in 2000. let's assume the mean is $\mu_B$ , with $\mu_B>\mu_A$ . Then, we formulate the null and alternate hypothesis as follows: $$H_n=\text{Students need on average $\mu_A$ semesters to graduate in year 2000 in school X}$$ $$H_a=\text{Students need on average more than $\mu_A$ semesters to graduate in year 2000 in school X}$$ How would one go about calculating the p-values here? One way I thought of is: calculate the standard deviation of $A$ , thus characterizing the distribution of $A$ (mean and variance are known), then I can use that distribution to calculate the likelihood of $\mu_B$ . However, that way feels very wrong because I am not using $m$ or the standard deviation of $B$ . For p-values, I usually see the formula $z=\dfrac{\hat{p}-p}{\sqrt{pq/n}}$ , where the $p$ s are proportions, and $n$ is the sample size of the dataset collected to presumably show evidence against the null hypothesis. However, I don't know how to apply that analysis in this case. I would imagine there are tons of ways for doing this. I just haven't been able to find one. I'd appreciate if someone could explain or share some resources.
