To view output & type commands for GDB, make sure the output window is open. In the top-right of Xcode 4 you have 3 groups of buttons labeled 'Editor', 'View' and 'Organiser'. Make sure the middle botton of the 'View' group is enabled. On the bottom, the output window should now be visible. To the top-right of that output panel, there are 3 visibility toggle buttons. Make sure either the middle one (watch window + output console) or the right one (just the console) is selected. Hope this helps.
