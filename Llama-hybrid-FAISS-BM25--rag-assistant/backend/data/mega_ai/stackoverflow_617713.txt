Running SWT components within a Swing App

I was wondering if anybody had any experience trying to run a complex SWT UI hosted inside a Swing component. I've managed to get a very simple demo going but if anyone else has tried and failed / succeeded to do this it'd be great to learn from their experiences. So to reiterate my application is a Swing app I wish to make use of a complex SWT UI component (drag and drop, popup windows and dialogs) - anybody managed this?
