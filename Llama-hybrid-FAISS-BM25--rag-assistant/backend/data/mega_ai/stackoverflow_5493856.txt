The solution we took with this problem was to create an archive table then regularly ( every 15 minutes, on an app server) crunch the data and put it back into the tables that were used to generate reports. The archive table of course did not have any indices, the tables which the reports are generated from have several indices. Some stats on this approach: Short Version: >360 times faster Long Version: The original code/model did direct inserts into the indexed table, and the average insert took .036 seconds, using the new code/model inserts took less than .0001 seconds (I was not able to get an accurate fix on the insert time I had to measure 100,000 inserts and average for the insert time). The post-processing (crunch) took an average 12 seconds for several tens-of-thousands records. Overall we were greatly pleased with this approach and so far it has worked incredibly well for us.
