Setting the polynomial kernel degree to 50 is likely causing the SVM to severely overfit to the data, which would explain the 9% you are seeing. Increasing the degree helps the SVM make an appropriate generalization, but when you start to see the validation/test accuracy decrease, then the SVM is starting to overfit.
