Seq to Seq modelling - ML Algorithms to use

Am new to ML. While I learnt the classical ML concepts like Linera regression, Logistic regression, Boosting and tree based techniques, now am slowly trying to learn Deep Learning techniques like CNN, RNN, LSTM ,GRU tech My question is a) What are the techniques that we can use to perform Seq to Seq modelling? ex: I give a input sequence and get an output sequence. For ex: If I would ask what are the techniques that I can use for classification tasks, you guys would suggest algos like a) Logistic, b) Trees (Random Forest, Decision Tree), c) SVM, d) NN Similarly, I would like to know what are the algorithms and techniques that I should learn to perform Seq to Seq modelling? Is it only the below? a) RNN (LSTM, GRU) I am a noob but I see online that people talk about transformers etc. Is transformers an algorithm? Can provide me the list of algorithms and techniques on how can I do seq to seq modelling? Basically, I am looking to fill values under the column algos that can be attempted table (shown below) for problems that involve Sequence input and Sequence output can help please? Data type n op variable type Objective Algos that can be attempted Sequence 10K Sequence Predict a Sequence LSTM Sequence 10K Sequence Predict a Sequence GRU Sequence 10K Sequence Predict a Sequence ?? Sequence 10K Sequence Predict a Sequence ?? Sequence 10K Sequence Predict a Sequence ?? Sequence 10K Sequence Predict a Sequence ??
