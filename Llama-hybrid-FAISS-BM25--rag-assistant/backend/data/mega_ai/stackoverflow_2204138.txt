Needing a design pattern/example link for iPhone network connections

I'm sorry if this is a basic question. I've been googling, searching StackOverflow, and looking through example code for hours and haven't found anything satisfactory for my skill level. I'm wanting something like a design pattern for handling network functions on the iPhone SDK. I have heard of people using a singleton class but have heard there are better ways for asynchronous connections. Would NSOperation be useful? I am fairly new to object oriented programming but am needing to make occasional calls to my webserver through HTTP for my current app and hope to find a solution that is easily reusable. I've looked through the NSURLConnection docs and can get the basic functionality but the programming structure is messy and I'm not sure how to better organize it. Is there sample code for this that separates out these functions into their own class? A link to an example that does this would be greatly appreciated! thanks!
