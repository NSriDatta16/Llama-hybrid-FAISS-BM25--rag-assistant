How do you output the current element path in XSLT?

In XSLT, is there a way to determine where you are in an XML document when processing an element? Example: Given the following XML Doc Fragment... In XSLT, if my context is the Element "Ele111", how can I get XSLT to output the full path? I would want it to output: "/Doc/Ele1/Ele11/Ele111". The context of this question: I have a very large, very deep document that I want to traverse exhaustively (generically using recursion), and if I find an element with a particular attribute, I want to know where I found it. I suppose I could carry along my current path as I traverse, but I would think XSLT/XPath should know.
