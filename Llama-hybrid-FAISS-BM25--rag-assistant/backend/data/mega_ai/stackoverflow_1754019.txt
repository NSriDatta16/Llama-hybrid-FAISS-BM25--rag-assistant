xsl loop to split a fragment tree every n times

This is a sample of my XML, it can possibly have thousands of rows of items in a range of categories. What I want is some sort of loop that will allow me to create a header for every 100 items regardless of the product type. That's easy enough but in this header I want a sum of the amounts of just the 100 items directly under that header. Currently I have tried to slpit the tree into groups of 100 so I can perform a sum function on every group. I have been a few days at this problem but I fail to produce a complete working solution. My output should look something like this (if the n was 3): Header Total=173.45 text,99 text,69.95 text,4.50 Header Total=43.99 text,10 text,9.99 text,24 Header Total=38.99 text,5 text,9.99 text,24 Header Total=10.50 text,5 text,1 text,4.50 Header Total=19.99 text,10 text,9.99
