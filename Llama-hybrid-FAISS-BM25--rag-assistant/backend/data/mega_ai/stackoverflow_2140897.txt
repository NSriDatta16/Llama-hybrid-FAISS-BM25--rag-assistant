Put the data in a LongBlob. The power of a database is to be able to search and organise data so that you are able to get only the part you want for performances and simplicity issues : you don't want the whole database, you just want a part of it and want it fast. But from what I understand, when you retrieve a user's data, you retrieve it all and display it. So you don't need to sotre the data in a normal "database" way. What I would suggest is to simply format and store the whole data from a single user in a single column with a suitable type (LongBlob for example). The format would be an object with a list of columns and rows of type. And you define the object in whatever language you use to communicate with the database. The columns in your (real) database would be : User int, TableNo int, Table Longblob. If user8 has 3 tables, you will have the following rows : 8, 1, objectcontaintingtable1; 8, 2, objectcontaintingtable2; 8, 3, objectcontaintingtable3;
