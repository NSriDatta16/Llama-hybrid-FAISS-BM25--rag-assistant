SVM mathematical background

I try to get the basic understanding behing SVM algorithm, however I have a problem with basic mathematics. I follow the lecture Support Vector Machine . Suppose the two classes can be separated by a hyperplane:$(w \cdot x) + b = 0$ Acoording to wikipedia , hyperplane is defined as $n(r-r_0)=0$, does it mean that $b=-w \cdot r_0$? I tried to consider 2-dimensional case, when $w \cdot x +b =0$ is a line, but it's completely doesn't make sense, $b=-w \cdot x$, where $b$ should be a constant, how can I generalize it to a 2 dimensional case. In addition, why $w$ is actually orthogonal to the plus and minus plane?
