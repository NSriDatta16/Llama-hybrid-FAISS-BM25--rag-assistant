Does $\text{cov}(a_1' X, a_2' X) = 0$ imply $a_1 \cdot a_2 = 0$?

Let $X$ be a $p$ -dimensional random vector with $p$ principal components $y_1, y_2, \dots, y_p$ . By definition, a restriction put on the second principal component $y_2 = a_2'X$ is $$ \text{cov}(y_1, y_2) = \text{cov}(a_1' X, a_2' X) = 0 $$ It is also known that $a_i$ are simply eigenvectors, so we also have $$ \forall i \ne j, a_i \cdot a_j = 0 $$ I wonder if it's a coincidence in the context of PCA. In other words, does $\text{cov}(a_1' X, a_2' X) = 0$ imply $a_1 \cdot a_2 = 0$ ? I tried to prove it, but didn't get very far $$ \begin{equation} \begin{aligned} 0 &= \text{cov}(a_1' X, a_2' X) \\ &= \text{cov}(\sum_{k=1}^p a_{1,k} X_k, \sum_{m=1}^p a_{2,m} X_m) \\ &= \sum_{k=1}^p a_{1,k} \sum_{m=1}^p a_{2,m} \text{cov}(X_k, X_m) \end{aligned} \end{equation} $$ Can I get $a_1 \cdot a_2 = 0$ from here?
