loop over all textboxes in a form, including those inside a groupbox

I have several textboxes in a winform, some of them are inside a groupbox. I tried to loop over all textboxes in my form: For Each c As Control In Me.Controls If c.GetType Is GetType(TextBox) Then ' Do something End If Next But it seemed to skip those inside the groupbox and loop only over the other textboxes of the form. So I added another For Each loop for the groupbox textboxes: For Each c As Control In GroupBox1.Controls If c.GetType Is GetType(TextBox) Then ' Do something End If Next I wonder: is there a way to loop over all textboxes in a form--including those inside a groupbox--with a single For Each loop? Or any better/more elegant way to do it?
