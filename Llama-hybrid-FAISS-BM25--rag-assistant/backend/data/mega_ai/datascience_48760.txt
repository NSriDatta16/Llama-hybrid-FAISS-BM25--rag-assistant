Both answers are good. The opposite happens a lot, if you look for "eye pupil detection from synthesis" in Google you will find a lot of papers using Unity Eyes to train different models. Particularly I like the work of Chao Gou in the matter: In Learning-by-Synthesis for Accurate Eye Detection, he trains a model in pure synthetic data and shows remarkable results and compares to the use of part synthetic and part real data. Also, there is work from this and other authors using GANs to improve synthetic data to reach better results. See for example A Hierarchical Generative Model for Eye Image Synthesis and Eye Gaze Estimation , Rendering of Eyes for Eye-Shape Registration and Gaze Estimation and Cascade learning from adversarial synthetic images for accurate pupil detection Is important to note that noise and other real photography distortion can drop CNNs accuracy by a bunch if not trained to face it.
