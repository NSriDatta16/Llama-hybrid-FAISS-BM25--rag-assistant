I think that you can use the Image.GetThumbnailImage() to get a thumbnail of required images and place them in picturebox controls which will be created dynamically depending on the count of images to be displayed and then use the drag and drop to drag image from a tumbnail picturebox control to a panel for displaying the full size image etc.
