I'm pretty sure the Visual Studio RAD plugin has some sort of drag and drop interface. I wouldn't recommend this tho as it gives you very little control over your UI, RIM are stopping support for it shortly (sorry, can't find the article where I read this). As far as I know there isn't anything else, you'd be best to read the tutorials on RIM's site and trying to create something from that. Here is a link to a similar question asked on the Blackberry support forum.
