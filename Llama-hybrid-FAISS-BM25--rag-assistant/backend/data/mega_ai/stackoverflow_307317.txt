Hmm... I thought that google used their vast corpus of data (the internet) to do some serious NLP (Natural Language Processing). For example, they have so much data from the entire internet that they can count the number of times a three-word sequence occurs (known as a trigram ). So if they see a sentence like: "pink frugr concert", they could see it has few hits, then find the most likely "pink * concert" in their corpus. They apparently just do a variation of what Davide Gualano was saying, though, so definitely read that link. Google does of course use all web-pages it knows as a corpus, so that makes its algorithm particularly effective.
