How do I select nodes that DO NOT have a particular child node?

A rather simple problem... XML Fragment: false true 1000 I'm trying to write an xpath query that will select all bean s that do not have a . I cant figure out how to say "beans not having this child" in xpath. Note that I cannot rely on the "electric" property to be false each time the "wattage" is absent. (also, this example is kinda contrived). Thanks :)
