I'd say that doing it the way you describe is a recipe for disaster, I would still recommend to do the overall design up front. Of course during the project you will need to change the design, it is never set in stone, flexibility is a must! (That's where the refactoring has to come in). I would also recommend to do the more detailed design for a module just before you start coding it. But a solid general design is worth its weight in gold: It gives all developers a common base from which to start, a common idea or perhaps vision, of the goal. Without that everybody will do as he/she thinks best, with the result that everybody does things in a different way. And suddenly you have to refactor a lot, just to align everybody to what has emerged as the apps architecture. The resulting code is ... not very elegant.
