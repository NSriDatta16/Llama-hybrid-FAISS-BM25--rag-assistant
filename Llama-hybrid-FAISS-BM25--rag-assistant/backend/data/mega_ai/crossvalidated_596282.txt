If you want to transform your prediction from a time series problem to a cross-sectional one , you could simply create a unique indicator for each land (or house) based on the location coordinates $ x $ and $ y $ and then only retain the most recent land or house transaction (based on the latest date). This ensures that all land / houses are equally weighted, once you fit a regression model. Such an approach using the cross-section of houses to make price prediction based on individual features of the houses is known as hedonic regression in the economics literature (see, e.g., https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_regression ). While hedonic regression may work well for classical real estate price prediction, it might be problematic in your case since your land / house transaction prices probably vary much more over time. Hence, youâ€˜d have to retrain your model on a regular basis to be able to make reasonable predictions. In addition, if the variables you have shown above are all variables included in your data set, I would not recommend to go with the hedonic regression approach, since you have not many variables to base your cross-sectional prediction on. Personally, I would probably either try to make predictions with a vector autoregressive (VAR) model or a dynamic panel regression model. This ensures that you use the time series as well as cross-sectional information in your data. A panel data structure also keeps track of how many times a particular house / land has been sold. The downside probably is that these models are slightly harder to implement. There exist also regression models tailored to spatial prediction problems, such as the spatial autoregressive model (SAR) or spatial error (SEM) model. However, these are essentially variants of (V)AR approaches, at least to my knowledge. So, one of these models might be worth a try. Hope this helps.
