Oracle's PL/SQL is something of a special case, being a language heavily based on Ada, rather than simple DML with some procedural constructs bolted on. Whether or not you think this is a good idea probably depends on your appetite for procedural code in your DBMS and your liking for learning complex new languages. The idea of a subroutine, to reduce duplication or otherwise, is largely foreign to other database platforms in my experience (Oracle, MS SQL, Sybase, MySQL, SQLite in the main). While the SQL-building proc would work, I think John's right in suggesting that you don't use his otherwise-correct answer! You don't say what form your repeated lines take, so I'll offer three potential alternatives, starting with the simplest: Do nothing. Accept that procedural SQL is a primitive language lacking so many "essential" constructs that you wouldn't use it at all if it wasn't the only option. Move your procedural operations outside of the DBMS and execute them in code written in a more sophisticated language. Consider ways in which your architecture could be adjusted to extract business logic from your data storage platform (hey, why not redesign the whole thing!) If the repetition is happening in DML, SELECTs in particular, consider introducing views to slim down the queries. Write code to generate, as part of your build process, the stored procedures. That way if the repeated lines ever need to change, you can change them in one place and automatically generate the repetition. That's four . I thought of another one as I was typing; consider it a bonus.
