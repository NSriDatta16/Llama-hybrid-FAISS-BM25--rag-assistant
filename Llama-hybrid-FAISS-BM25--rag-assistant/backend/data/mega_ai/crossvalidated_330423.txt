Why are there recommendations against using Jeffreys or entropy based priors for MCMC samplers?

On their wiki page , the developers of Stan state: Some principles we don't like: invariance, Jeffreys, entropy Instead, I see a lot of normal distribution recommendation. So far I used Bayesian methods that didn't rely on sampling, and was kind of happy to have understood why $\theta \sim \text{Beta}\left(\alpha=\frac{1}{2},\beta=\frac{1}{2}\right)$ was a good choice for binomial likelihoods.
