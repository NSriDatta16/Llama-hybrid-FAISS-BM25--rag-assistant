Distribution of conditional posterior for Gibbs sampling

The following is a description of how the authors (Yongning Wang & Ruey S. Tsay) of this (2019) paper Clustering Multiple Time Series with Structural Breaks want to perform Gibbs sampling to obtain cluster memberships. i.e. let's say c can become 1,2 or 3, meaning an individual n can belong to cluster 1,2 or 3. If I perform Gibbs sampling I get stuck, as the posterior distribution they describe is non-standard. How do they get to the probability statement? It seems like the big term before $\eta_{sc}$ is simply a scalar and does not influence individual draws.
