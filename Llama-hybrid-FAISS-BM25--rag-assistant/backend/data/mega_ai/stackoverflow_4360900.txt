If you consider your stores, then you are doing just fine. But regarding the traffic you're getting, it seems that you need to provide some extra features to Magento to let it fire up. For this, you can have some of the following:- Install APC (Alternative PHP Cache) or XCache (or any other alternative) and configure the use of it in your Magento back-end. It dramatically increases the speed of Magento. You can have Magento's cache stored in memory (tmpfs in Linux). You can also tell Magento to save sessions into Memcache so that your sessions are in memory & distributed. Check your Magento's Index Management section for any requirement of indexes, every month or bi-monthly. If you do find any indexing required, then do it immediately & clear the cache from your Cache Management. Check your database every week or bi-monthly for any overhead in any of your database's tables. If you do find any overhead, then "optimize" those tables immediately. Try reading some of these articles , to know more about these. Also, upgrading to 1.4.1.1 will help you out in terms of features provided by Magento. But for performance, I think it will be best to wait for some more time, until Magento releases its version 2 in the market, in which some performance issues may be taken care of by Magento. Hope it helps.
