FYI, I went with SPCache at the end. It is indeed a very unusual SharePoint class: Well documented, simple and straight-forward to use, painless to manage. It does offer the one thing HttpRuntime.Cache does not do: Allowing me to create my own subcaches and invalidating this without wiping the entire HttpCache. I could achieve the same using a Dictionary inside the HttpCache, but locking around that has some potential issues. I reflected on the SPCache and found a solid, thread safe implementation, so that's what I went with. As a caveat: SPCache seems to be SharePoint Server only, not for Foundation.
