The official naming conventions aren't that strict, they don't even 'forbid' camel case notation except for prefix ( com in your example). But I personally would avoid upper case letters and hyphenations , even numbers. I'd choose com.stackoverflow.mypackage like Bragboy suggested too. (hyphenations '-' are not legal in package names) EDIT Interesting - the language specification has something to say about naming conventions too. In Chapter 7.7 Unique Package Names we see examples with package names that consist of upper case letters (so CamelCase notation would be OK) and they suggest replacing hyphenation by an underscore ("mary-lou" -> "mary_lou") and prefix java keywords with an underscore ("com.example.enum" -> "com.example._enum") Some more examples for upper case letters in package names can be found in chapter 6.8.1 Package Names .
