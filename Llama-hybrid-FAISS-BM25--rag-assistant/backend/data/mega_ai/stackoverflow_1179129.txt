Preprocessor directives supported by the RIM compiler

This isn't really clearly documented, but a shallow search reveals that RIM's RAPC compiler does support preprocessor statements (with some project file modification). We've been using the simple #ifdef , #else , and #endif directives for quite some time now, as supporting platforms 4.1 through 4.7 with one code base is nearly impossible without them, but I began wondering recently if there are other supported directives which aren't quite as well documented; something akin to C's #elif for example, or even rudimentary equivalency directives?
