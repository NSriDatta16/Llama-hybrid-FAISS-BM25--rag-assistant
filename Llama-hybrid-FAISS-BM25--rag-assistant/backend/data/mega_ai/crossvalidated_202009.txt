Three thoughts: That many samples until convergence sounds like there are issues with your model/priors. The diagnosis would require seeing the model -- and also more knowledge than I have. Some models are just hard, sometimes you can use tricks that make them more amenable, and sometimes you have an outright error. Most MCMC samplers have a thin=n argument that says to only save every nth sample. I couldn't find it for rjags but I assume JAGS supports an option like that. You might consider switching to rstan (directly, or via rstanarm or brms ). Each iteration takes longer, but in general each iteration is less-correlated and of better quality, so it's not unusual to use 3-5K iterations rather than tens-of-thousands. (In particular, Stan is better at ridge-like distributions than other samplers. As an example of someone who switched to Stan and saw a huge improvement: Managing high autocorrelation in MCMC ) The difference between Stan and JAGS is that JAGS (like BUGS) is a language to describe a model, while Stan is more executable. For example, a JAGS for is not an actual loop, but rather a plate specification, while in Stan a for actually is a for loop.
