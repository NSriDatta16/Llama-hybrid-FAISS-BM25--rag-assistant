Semantic HTML markup for a copyright notice

When a web site is licensed under Creative Commons, I use the rel-license microformat . When a web site is licensed under regular copyright, I have a boring paragraph element. &copy; 2008 Example Corporation That id attribute on there is just for CSS styling purposes. I'm wondering if there's some better way to markup a copyright notice that is more semantic. Is this a job for Dublin Core metadata? If so, how do I go about it? (I've never used Dublin Core before.) Some web sites advocate using a meta tag in the head element: Which might be seen by search engines, but doesn't replace the user-visible notice on the page itself.
