Has anyone had a similar problem? Yes, yo have that case because svn has info about that file in .svn dir. run svn update deleted all files as svn delete command FYI: when you delete file using svn deleted it is deleted and info of local svn storage is updated, if you deleted the folder this way don't be surprised that folder still exists, it is because use folder as root for its storage and it will be deleted after commit.
