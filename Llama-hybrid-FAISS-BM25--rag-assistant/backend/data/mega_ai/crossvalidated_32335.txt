My understanding of this question is a little different from the previous answers, so let me put my views too. From your example of using correlation for classification, the correlation is over all the samples within the class w.r.t to a test sample, i.e., trying to find which class has the largest number of "templates" that match your test sample the most. Such is not the case with the SVM. The key to the SVM is, it tries to find the subset of samples that belong to two classes that separate the two classes. In that regard, what SVM tries to do is a clever "template matching" to choose a class. To me that is the plus (a big one) in SVM. Also, I would like to add that I do not agree with the comment that swapping linear kernel with more "sophisticated" kernel is any different. Again, it is a clever way for template matching in an RKHS (and you can find similar analogy to finding correlations in that RKHS)
