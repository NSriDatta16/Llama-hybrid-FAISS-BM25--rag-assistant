You would best respect the pairing of the data, with something similar to McNemar's test. That test, however, is just for things like before/after paired differences and doesn't directly take your two treatments into account. Your second suggestion, with some modification, is one way to approach your situation. Agresti discusses this in Section 10.2.6 of the second edition of Categorical Data Analysis . As with the McNemar test you only examine those whose status changed. You code those who changed status as 1/0 depending on the direction of change, rather than -1/1 as you propose. You fit a logistic regression model to those pairs alone, using artificial response $y^* =1$ when $(y_{i1} = 0, y_{i2} = 1)$ , $y^* =0$ when $(y_{i1} = 1, y_{i2} = 0)$ , no intercept, and predictor values $x^*$ . Here, $y_{i1}$ and $y_{i2}$ are the outcomes (diabetes status in your case) for individual $i$ at times 1 and 2, respectively. A predictor value $x^*$ is the difference in predictor values between the two time points, $x_i^* = x_{i2}-x_{i1}$ . In your situation with two treatment groups, you code that with a single binary predictor. If you had more than 2 time points, you could consider a mixed model instead to deal with both multiple observations within each individual and the missing data. With only 2 time points, however, that doesn't really help . Do think carefully about the nature of your missing data and how best to deal with it . You also might consider whether an all-or-none diabetes outcome value is wise here. That disease occurs on a spectrum, and modeling of some continuous measure (like fasting blood glucose or hemoglobin A1C) could be highly preferable.
