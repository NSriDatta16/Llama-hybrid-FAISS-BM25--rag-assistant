How do I list associated attributes in my Rails 3 view?

I have a Customers model: class Customer and a Phone Numbers model class PhoneNumber In my view, I'm doing this: Last name First name and here is my controller for this action: def index @customers = Customer.find(:all, :limit => 10, :order => 'last_name') flash.now[:notice] = 'Enter customer last or first name. Fields are case-sensitive.' end In the table in my view, I want to show the first phone number found for each customer listed in a phone number column - like: Last Name first Name Phone Smith John 3258889322 Jones Davey 3412555232 I've come up with multiple solutions to this problem, but none was very elegant. There must be a 'Rails Way' to do this that is really snazzy, as this seems like a common situation for a web application developer to be faced with.
