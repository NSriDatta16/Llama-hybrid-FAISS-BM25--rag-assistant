Increase number of iterations in a logistic regression

I have achieved 68% accuracy using glm with family = 'binomial' while doing logistic regression in R. I don't have any idea on how to specify the number of iterations through my code. Any suggestions on it? Will application of stochastic gradient descent work for epoch. If so, how do I apply it in my code? I want to increase the accuracy of my model. Following is my code: rm(list=ls()) library(dplyr) data1 % as.matrix.data.frame() accuracy = sum(diag(tab))/sum(tab) print(accuracy) print(tab) table(testset$VALUE, testset$outcome)
