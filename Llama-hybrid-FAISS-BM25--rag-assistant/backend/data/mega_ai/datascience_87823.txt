What type of machine learning are able to return feature importance?

I've been using random forest to calculate feature importance however I've asked myself why random forest? so my question became what other machine learning models can calculate feature importance? and is there pros and cons between each models? I've did some research and here are some that I've found Statistical correlation score -> calculating each X variable with Y. (statistical method) coefficients in linear models -> Logistic, linear regression, regularizations(L1, L2, elastic net) Tree based algorithms -> ex: decision tree, RF, boosting algorithms permutation importance score I would like to know if there are any other methods. Thanks in advance!
