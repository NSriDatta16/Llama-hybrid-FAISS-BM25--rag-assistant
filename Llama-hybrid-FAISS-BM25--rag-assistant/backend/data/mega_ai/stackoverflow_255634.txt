You can store your common task macros in .vim files, like this for example, and then you can load them with the command :so file.vim Here you can find a bunch of useful macros, also I recommend you to learn well the useful q macro recording command, it's very very powerful... The macros created with the q command are stored in a register, qq stores the macro in the q register, so when you end the recording you can simply paste the macro, with "qp and save it, later you can load it by simply yanking the macro into a register i.e.: "qY , the macros are only text and remember you can use any register instead of q. There is a Vim Script for storing q macros: marvim : Macro Persistent Storage and Shareable Repository for VIM Also take a look to the Vim Scripting Language .
