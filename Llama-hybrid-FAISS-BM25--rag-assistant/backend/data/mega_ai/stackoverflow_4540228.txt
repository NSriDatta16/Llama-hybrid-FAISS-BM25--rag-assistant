I see two ways to say this (out of many possible). The first is to say it is O(N) where N is the total number of characters. The other you could say is O(N*M) where N is the number of strings and M is the average number of characters per string. Note that this is actually the same as my above answer. You could say M = k/N , so you get O(N*k/N) or O(k) where k is the total characters in all the strings.
