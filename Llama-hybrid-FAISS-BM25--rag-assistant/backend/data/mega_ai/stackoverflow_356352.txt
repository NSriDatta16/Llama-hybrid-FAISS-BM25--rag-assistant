For logging, you should probably actually have another higher level of error. These are the levels I usually implement (as swiped from DEC back in the 80's). DEBUG - a very low-prioity message that the developer just put in to help diagnose what's going on in the event something goes awry. INFORMATIONAL - No problem, just reporting progress the user might be interested in. WARNING - Something that could possibly be an issue in some situations, but may also be just fine. ERROR - A definite problem. The user must be informed, but the program will try to keep going. FATAL - A problem so bad that the program can't go on. The second is, since you are calling this a "progress panel", I assume you are planning on implementing some kind of progress bar. There has actually been a fair bit of research into progress bars . The main thing is that, whatever you do, don't let the bar get slower as it progresses. That makes it seem to drag on forever. Lastly, it sounds like you are considering some sort of status message line. If you are looking for some good status messages, I suggest you use some of these . :-)
