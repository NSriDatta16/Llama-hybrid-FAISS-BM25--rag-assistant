An excellent topic which is, sadly, not given enough attention. When discussing multiple parameters and confidence intervals, a distinction should be made between simultaneous inference and selective inference. Ref.[2] gives an excellent demonstration of the matter. Simultaneous confidence intervals mean that all the parameters are covered with $1-\alpha$ confidence. Selective confidence intervals mean that a subset of selected parameters are covered. These two concepts can be combined: Say you construct intervals only on parameters for which you rejected the null hypothesis. You are clearly dealing with selective inference. You may want to guarantee simultaneous coverage of selected parameters, or marginal coverage of selected parameters. The former would be the counterpart of FWER control, and the latter of FDR control. Now more to the point: Not all testing procedures have their accompanying intervals. For FWER procedures and their accompanying intervals, see [3]. Sadly, this reference is a bit outdated. For the interval counterpart of BH FDR control, see [1] and an application in [4] (which also includes a brief review of the matter). Please note that this is a fresh and active research field so that you can expect more results in the near future. [1] Benjamini, Y., and D.
