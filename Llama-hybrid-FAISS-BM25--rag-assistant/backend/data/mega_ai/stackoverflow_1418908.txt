If your container is EJB-aware, or if you are using spring, you can request a EntityManagerFactory. @PersistenceUnit private EntityManagerFactory emf; Another option is to use Spring or any other IoC to inject EntityManagerFactory or EntityManager (with the correct scoping). EMF is thread safe, so you can share an instance across an entire application. No need to recreate one for each operation. EM (EntityManager) is not thread safe so unless you want to do synchronization (you don't) by "definition" it is not reusable. Take a look at the link below, it provides good information on the subject. https://blueprints.dev.java.net/bpcatalog/ee5/persistence/webonlyapp.html IMHO the best way is to use an IoC to take care of the injection of the EntityManager and/or EntityManagerFactory.
