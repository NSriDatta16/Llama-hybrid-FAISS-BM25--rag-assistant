As others have said, MongoDB does not have single-server durability right now. Fortunately, it's dead easy to set up multi-node replication. You can even set up a second machine in another data center and have data automatically replicated to it live! If a write must succeed, you can cause Mongo to not return from an insert/update until that data has been replicated to n slaves. This ensures that you have at least n copies of the data. Replica sets allow you to add and remove nodes from your cluster on the fly without any significant work; just add a new node and it'll automatically sync a copy of the data. Remove a node and the cluster rebalances itself. It is very much designed to be used across multiple machines, with multiple nodes acting in parallel; this is it's preferred default setup, compared to something like MySQL, which expects one giant machine to do its work on, which you can then pair slaves against when you need to scale out. It's a different approach to data storage and scaling, but a very comfortable one if you take the time to understand its difference in assumptions, and how to build an architecture that capitalizes on its strengths.
