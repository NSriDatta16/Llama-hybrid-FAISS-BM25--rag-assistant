After reading this and this , I tried it on mine by fitting the 2-input model i.e. text and numerical. The result remains similar even several attempts on tuning the hyperparameters e.g. embedding dimension, epoch, activation. What is causing this behaviour? How can it be improved? The data is imbalanced with yes=65% and no=35%.
