Is the Mann-Whitney U Test appropriate for assessing the busiest day of the week?

We have ten years of data where the average overall reveals that Monday is the busiest with the most visits to the hospital. We would like to provide a p-value to support that observation. Given that the Mann-Whitney U test is a test of the hypothesis that " a particular population tends to have larger values than the other " - then could use this test to assess that the cohort of "all Mondays" is larger than the cohort of "all other days"? Would that be an appropriate use of the Mann Whitney U test to provide assess confidence such as p (NOTE of clarification: This question is different than the answer here as we are not asking for the most appropriate statistic for assessing busiest day which that question asks, instead we are asking specifically whether Mann-Whitney U test is appropriate to use in this particular class of problem.)
