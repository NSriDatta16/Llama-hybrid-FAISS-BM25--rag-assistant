If you need some local storage without any fuss, you should definitely also look at SQLite . It has great .NET support including support for Entity Framework, and is basically frictionless and needs no installing a server or anything like that (just include some DLL's in your application's deployment - xcopy or otherwise). It also allows you to encrypt the entire database file (*.s3db) to protect its contents.
