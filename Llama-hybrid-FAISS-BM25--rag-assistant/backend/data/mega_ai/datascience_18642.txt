How to "count" certain events in a time series

What techniques are suitable and what do I need to learn in order to detect and count the number of "events" (pic) that consist of: a) shape 1 3 and 4 and not of (2 and 5) or b) of all shapes above the blue line with a certain minimum "volume" like shapes 1 and 4? My first idea is to use a window function and somehow integrate the area but i want to be sure to use an appropriate procedure. I havent worked with time series before and I dont know were to get startet. I have to use python for this project.
