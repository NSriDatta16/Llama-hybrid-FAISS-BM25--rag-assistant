Line: 177 Char: 9 Code: 0 URI: http://www.google.com/selenium-server/core/scripts/selenium-testrunner.js Hi guys, i'm just starting to learn up on selenium and while testing using mostly test cases and test suite creating using selenium IDE firefox, i'm having some problem getting it to work properly in internet explorer. this is the cmd line that i'm using: java -jar "selenium-server.jar" -htmlSuite *iexploreproxy "http://www.google.com/" tests/OR_Discount_UAT_Suite.htm results.html -userExtensions user-extensions.js i try using the *iexplore but kept getting session id expired error and try with the proxy version instead. i can now see the testrunner but keep getting the access denied error. i then try the same cmd line using firefox: java -jar "selenium-server.jar" -htmlSuite *firefox3 "http://www.google.com/" tests/OR_Discount_UAT_Suite.htm results.html -userExtensions user-extensions.js FYI, i've already unchecked the auto detect proxy setting in IE8. and i can get everything running perfectly. so im not sure what's the problem right now :( anybody can help? thanks! Updates: I'm seeing this proxy under LAN setting, i think it's set by selenium: file:///C:/DOCUME~1/Melaos_~1/LOCALS~1/Temp/customProfileDir985530/proxy.pac and the content is: function FindProxyForURL(url, host) { return 'PROXY localhost:4444; DIRECT'; }
