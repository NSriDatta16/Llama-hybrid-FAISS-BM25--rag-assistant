Alternatives to the multinomial logit model

I am trying to estimate a model of occupational choice with three choices. Are there any alternatives to using the multinomial logistic regression when handling such unordered categorical outcomes? When dealing with binary dependent variables there seems to be several choices such as the LPM model as well as the binary probit and logit model. When dealing with unordered categorical variables the literature however keeps recommending the multinomial logit model without comparing it to alternatives.
