You can't, that's what hashes are for. Because of that, many sites have an option to reset the password (i.e. putting into the db the hash of the new password you provided). You usually don't find the option to retrieve the current password (i.e. having it sent to you by mail). If a website does offer this functionality, it means that they are not storing password hashes, but either plaintext or encrypted passwords. Since storing a hash is the best practice, you should steer clear from sited that offer password retrieval. And you should steer clear from developping such a site yourself ;-)
