Do Data Miners realise Machine Learning cannot establish Causality?

Do people in Machine Learning (or, more generally, in Data Mining) realise that no causal link can be inferred from a correlation? My impression of the ML/AI community is that most people involved have a Computer Science background. I think it uncontroversial to point out that this is not a Science in the academic sense (think Physics, Chemistry, Psychology). Therefore, most of these people have no formal training in the Scientific Method, in Statistics or even in Mathematics. " Correlation does not equal causation " is lesson nr. 1 in Statistics. In order to establish causal links, experiments are required (under some very special circumstances, other techniques are available). To me, this seems a fundamental and disastrous limitation to Machine Learning. ML will do fine with describing data (and classifying it), but it will never substitute an experiment. The application of ML is, therefore, limited in scope. My question is about the atmosphere within the ML community. Do people within the field recognise this limitation? Or do people think the causal-inference problem is not fundamental and will be solved in the future by better CPU's and better algorithms? Do they restrict the use of ML to descriptive analyses? Or do they, erroneously, assume ML can help us understand and influence the world? Is there a lively debate on this topic within the community? And are there articles/blogs related to these issues?
