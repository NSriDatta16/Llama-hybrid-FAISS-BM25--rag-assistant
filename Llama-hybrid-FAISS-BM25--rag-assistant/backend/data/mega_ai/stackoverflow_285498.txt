I'm not a python guru, but I found this question interesting so I googled around. This was the first hit on "python embedding API" - does it help? If the attributes belong to the global scope of a module, then you can use "PyImport_AddModule" to get a handle to the module object. For example, if you wanted to get the value of an integer in the main module named "foobar", you would do the following: PyObject *m = PyImport_AddModule("__main__"); PyObject *v = PyObject_GetAttrString(m,"foobar"); int foobar = PyInt_AsLong(v); Py_DECREF(v);
