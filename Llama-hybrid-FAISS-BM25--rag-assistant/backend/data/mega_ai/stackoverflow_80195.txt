High Availability Storage

I would like to make 2 TB or so available via NFS and CIFS. I am looking for a 2 (or more) server solution for high availability and the ability to load balance across the servers if possible. Any suggestions for clustering or high availability solutions? This is business use, planning on growing to 5-10 TB over next few years. Our facility is almost 24 hours a day, six days a week. We could have 15-30 minutes of downtime, but we want to minimize data loss. I want to minimize 3 AM calls. We are currently running one server with ZFS on Solaris and we are looking at AVS for the HA part, but we have had minor issues with Solaris (CIFS implementation doesn't work with Vista, etc) that have held us up. We have started looking at DRDB over GFS (GFS for distributed lock capability) Gluster (needs client pieces, no native CIFS support?) Windows DFS (doc says only replicates after file closes?) We are looking for a "black box" that serves up data. We currently snapshot the data in ZFS and send the snapshot over the net to a remote datacenter for offsite backup. Our original plan was to have a 2nd machine and rsync every 10 - 15 min. The issue on a failure would be that ongoing production processes would lose 15 minutes of data and be left "in the middle". They would almost be easier to start from the beginning than to figure out where to pickup in the middle. That is what drove us to look at HA solutions.
