LSTM: How Do I Predict A Single Label Multiple Steps Ahead?

I'm building an LSTM neural network using the Tensorflow tutorial below. https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/structured_data/time_series#single-shot_models It shows you how to build single-step models as well as multi-step models. However, I want to predict a single value multiple steps ahead, rather than a sequence of values. For example, given (t-2), (t-1), (t), I want to predict (t+3) only. I do not want (t+1) or (t+2). How do I go about this? My code is exactly the same as the one in the tutorial.
