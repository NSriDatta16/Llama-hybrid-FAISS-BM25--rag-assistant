The point of Bayesian sequential updating is that no mater if you update prior with likelihood over all of your data at once, or if you do this sequentially, the result would be the same. This wouldn't hold if different observations had different weights. If for some reason you need to assign different weights to different samples (e.g. survey weights), that this would work the same in sequential and all-at-once updating. However if you don't have good reason for doing so, usually you do not want different samples to affect the result to different degree.
