I don't know whether this would be considered elegant, but with this input: Configurations LCD Monitor CRT Monitor Monitors Printer 12 11 This XSLT: / Will give you this output: Configurations/Monitors/CRT Monitor/ Configurations/Monitors/LCD Monitor/ The paths still have an extra trailing slash, you'd need another little bit of conditional XSLT to make the slash only get emitted when you aren't at the first level. It is vital that you category hierarchy is correct, otherwise your transform can easily get into an endless loop that will only stop when it runs out of memory. If I was implementing something like this in a real system I'd be tempted to add a parameter to the catWalk template that incremented on each call and add it to the test so it stopped looping after 10 calls whether or not the parent had been found.
