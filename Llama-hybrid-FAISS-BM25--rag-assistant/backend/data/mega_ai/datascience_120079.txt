Don't know if you got an answer, but I recently had a similar question when looking at a transformer implemented in code.The QKV projection step does not seem to involve a bias, as shown in this code snippet from ( https://github.com/lucidrains/x-transformers/tree/main ) to_qkv = nn.Linear(dim, inner_dim * 3, bias = False)
