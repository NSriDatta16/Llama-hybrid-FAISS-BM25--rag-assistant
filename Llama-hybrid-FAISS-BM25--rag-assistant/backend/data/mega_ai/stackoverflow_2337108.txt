Will NHibernate attempt to save the same object twice in this scenario?

Lets say I have two entities: Stable , and Pony . Stable has an IList with a HasMany mapping configured with Cascade.All() . That means that if I do session.Save(myStable) , each Pony in the collection will be saved. However, what happens if I do this? Pony myLittlePony = new Pony(Color.Brown); Stable myStable = new Stable(WoodTypes.RichMahogany); myStable.Ponies.Add(myLittlePony); session.Save(myStable); session.Save(myLittlePony); Will NHibernate try to save myLittlePony twice ? or is NHibernate "smart" enough to know that myLittlePony has already been persisted to the DB? Are there any performance implications from doing something like this?
