As far as I can see the frequentist bit is reasonable this far: Let $H_0$ be the hypothesis that the sun has not exploded and $H_1$ be the hypothesis that it has. The p-value is thus the probability of observing the result (the machine saying "yes") under $H_0$. Assuming that the machine correctly detects the presence of absence of neutrinos, then if the machine says "yes" under $H_0$ then it is because the machine is lying to us as a result of rolling two sixes. Thus the p-value is 1/36, so following normal quasi-Fisher scientific practice, a frequentist would reject the null hypothesis, at the 95% level of significance . But rejecting the null hypothesis does not mean that you are entitled to accept the alternate hypothesis, so the frequentists conclusion is not justified by the analysis. Frequentist hypothesis tests embody the idea of falsificationism (sort of), you can't prove anything is true, only disprove. So if you want to assert $H_1$, you assume $H_0$ is true and only proceed if you can show that $H_0$ is inconsistent with the data. However that doesn't mean $H_1$ is true, just that it survives the test and continues as a viable hypothesis at least as far as the next test. The Bayesian is also merely common sense, noting that there is nothing to lose by making the bet. I'm sure frequentist approaches, when the false-positive and false-negative costs are taken into account (Neyman-Peason?) would draw the same conclusion as being the best strategy in terms of long-run gain. To summarise: Both the frequentist and Bayesian are being sloppy here: The frequentist for blindly following a recipe without considering the appropriate level of significance, false-positive/false-negative costs or the physics of the problem (i.e. not using his common sense). The Bayesian is being sloppy for not stating his priors explicitly, but then again using common sense the priors he is using are obviously correct (it is much more likely that the machine is lying than sun actually having exploded), the sloppiness is perhaps excusable.
