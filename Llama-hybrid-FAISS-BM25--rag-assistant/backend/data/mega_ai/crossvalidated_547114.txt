Bayesian Hypothesis Testing: Bayes Factor vs Comparing the Posterior Distribution

If we are to choose between two hypotheses $H_0$ vs $H_1$ , it seems natural to compare the posterior probabilities $P(H_0|D)$ vs $P(H_1|D)$ and pick the one with the larger probability. In other words, we can look at the posterior probability ratio $\frac{P(H_0|D)}{P(H_1|D)}$ . Yet, we often use the size of the Bayes factor to choose between hypotheses: $$ \frac{P(D|H_0)}{P(D|H_1)} = \frac{P(H_0|D)}{P(H_1|D)}/\frac{P(H_0)}{P(H_1)} $$ The two ratios are usually different because usually $P(H_0) \ne P(H_1)$ as $$ P(H_i) = \int_{\Theta_i} \pi(\theta) d\theta $$ I think choosing the hypotheses using the two criteria is equivalent to making a decision under $a_0-a_1$ loss with different $a_0, a_1$ values, but, still, I wonder why we would want to choose different $a0, a_1$ values for essentially the same task and why not choosing any other values. I have seen people use the Bayes factor all the time, yet rarely see people use the posterior probability ratio (although it is mentioned in some textbooks). Why is that?
