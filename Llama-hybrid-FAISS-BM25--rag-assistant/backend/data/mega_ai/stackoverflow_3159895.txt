Drupal: Views, can the displays have different styles for the view?

I've created several displays for my View. I thought that I could assign different styles (Gallery, Table, etc) of the view for each display but I realized that only 1 Style is used for all Displays. The reason I wanted to change is because I'm using DraggableViews, and I would like to keep the same order for all displays, when the user drag some items on the display with draggable nodes. THanks
