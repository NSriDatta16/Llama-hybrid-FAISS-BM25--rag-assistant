Sharepoint 2010 Content Organiser Rule to move to external Drop Off Library

Wondered if it's possible to have documents which land in the Drop Off library say of Site A and for them to be moved to the Drop Off Library of Site B. Thing here is that Site A and Site B are both on different site collections with unique URLs. Any help much appreciated Thanks
