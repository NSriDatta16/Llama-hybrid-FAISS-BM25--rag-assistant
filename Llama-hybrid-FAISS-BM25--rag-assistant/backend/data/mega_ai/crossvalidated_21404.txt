As babelproofreader mentioned , those that have a successful algorithm tend to be very secretive about it. Thus it's unlikely that any widely available algorithm is going to be very useful out of the box unless you are doing something clever with it (at which point it sort of stops being widely available since you are adding to it). That said, learning about autoregressive integerated moving average (ARIMA) models might be a useful start for forecasting time-series data. Don't expect better than random results though.
