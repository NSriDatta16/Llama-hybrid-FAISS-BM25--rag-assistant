How to get matching string by performing search on Lucene?

I would like to know how can I get the matching string results by performing search on a Lucene index ? I have tried to install the Perl module Lucene::Search::Highlight and failed over and over again. Is there another I can get the relevant fragments of text that Lucene "thinks" they relevant for my search phrase?
