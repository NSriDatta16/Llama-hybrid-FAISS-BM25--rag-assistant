Mostly following the Java code convention . I try to not make it matter what kind of class an object is. If I for instance have five different strings, the name of each variable should describe what information/content the variable represents, and not that is is a string. I find it often silly to try coming up with variations of a variable just because it exists both as a method argument and a class variable. I mostly use the same name with this syntax this.theVariable = theVariable A method should be as short as possible: as few lines as possible, and as few nested levels as possible (i.e. max one if-statement, and not ifs inside ifs etc.) Robert Martin's Clean Code is highly recommended!
