Non-significant effect but significant coefficient. Should I remove the effect?

I did a logistic regression. $Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + \beta_2(X_2=1) + \beta_3(X_2 = 2)$ All of the predictors are categorical. $X_1$ has two level e.g. Yes/No, $X_2$ has three levels e.g. Low/Medium/High. The likelihood Ratio Tests showed one of the IVs is not significant (Chi-square = 4.73, df = 2, p=0.094). Let's say this variable is $X_2$. However, one of the coefficients of $X_2$ is significant e.g. $\beta_3$. Suppose the final model is $Y = -0.09 + 0.78X_1 + 0.5(X_2 = Medium) + 0.6(X_2 = High)$ My question is 1) Should I remove $X_2$ from the model then re-run the regression? since the effect of $X_2$ is not significant. What if the analysis aim is to find relationship of $X_1$ and $X_2$ in changes in OR of Y? 2) Is it correct to interpret that: $X_2$ has no statistically significant effect on the model. The log odds ratio of approving the application is increased if the income is high compared to low (p=0.038).
