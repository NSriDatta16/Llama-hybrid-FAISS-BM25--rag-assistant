OS developers make a great job in order to abstract the underlying physical world. Their purpose is to provide the average developer with a common interface to many hardwares so he can focus on its application and develop code that is portable, easier to maintain and able to gain optimizations on OS updates. So for an average developer making an average application, I think it is better not to ask too many questions about hardware.
