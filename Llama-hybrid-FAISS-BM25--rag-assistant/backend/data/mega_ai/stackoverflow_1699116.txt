need to add textBlocks to a group box and clear when data is loaded in a graph control

I'm creating a graph control. what i'm doing for adding x and y axis tally labels is i'm adding a text block to each tally mark and show the value related to that tally mark. but when i need to load data form the database and redraw the textbolcks again and refresh the graph area i can't remove the older textblocks they are still on the graph pane. to overcome this problem i thought to put the text blocks in side a group box and when graph pane is redrawn to delete the group box elements and put them again.. is this approach correct? please tell me how to put elements to groupbox in code behind class? and please tell me if their is any other solution to my problem. regards, rangana.
