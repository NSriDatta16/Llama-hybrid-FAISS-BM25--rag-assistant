Elegant method for drawing hourly bar chart from time-interval data?

I have a list of timesheet entries that show a start and stop time. This is sitting in a MySQL database. I need to create bar charts based on this data with the 24 hours of the day along the bottom and the amount of man-hours worked for each hour of the day. For example, if Alice worked a job from 15:30 to 19:30 and Bob worked from 12:15 to 17:00, the chart would look like this: I have a WTFey solution right now that involves a spreadsheet going out to column DY or something like that. The needed resolution is 15-minute intervals. I'm assuming this is something best done in the database then exported for chart creation. Let me know if I'm missing any details. Thanks.
