WatiN FireEvent not passing event properties in FireFox

This had been logged as a bug in sourceforge though now deleted. I'm using FireFox 3.6 with associated jssh. I can see in Firebug that the Event Properties are not being set. I'm trying to drag and drop with code below var mouseDownEvent = new NameValueCollection {{"button", "1"}, {"clientX", "0"}, {"clientY", "0"}}; firstStoryRow.FireEventNoWait("onmousedown", mouseDownEvent); There are workarounds for passing these properties but not they're not nice. Does anyone know if this is an genuine limitation within WatiN or something I'm doing wrong?
