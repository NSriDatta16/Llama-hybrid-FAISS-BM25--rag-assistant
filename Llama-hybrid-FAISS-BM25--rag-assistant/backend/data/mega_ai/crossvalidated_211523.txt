Principal Component Analysis PCA Terms and relationships: eigenvalues, eigenvectors, loadings, score matrix, and SVD

I've read many websites, blogs, pdfs on this top but struggle to put the picture together in simple math terms, that explains how some of the terms relate to each other / are computed. Let's assume that we use Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to solve the PCA problem with input matrix $X$, assuming $X$ has zero mean and unit variance, the SVD of $X$: $X = USV^{T}$ Now, $S$ is the vector of eigenvalues , sorted in decreasing order. Can someone please explain, in math terms, how are the following terms defined? e.g. Explained variance ratios = $\frac{S}{sum(S)}$ PCA Loadings == eigenvector of $X^{T}X$ == $V$? Score matrix $T$, $T == U * Diag(S) == XV$? Actual PCA components = eigenvectors of $X$? Eigenvectors, can you get them from the SVD results?
