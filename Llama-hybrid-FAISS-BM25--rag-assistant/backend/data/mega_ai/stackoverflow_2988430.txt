ccTouchesBegan not firing in cocos2D?

Hello, I have created a layer for a demo game application using cocos2D Framework. I have integrating cocos2d with existing application. I need to detect Touch Events for that. But I am not able to Detect that.I have used ccTouchesBegan. - (BOOL)ccTouchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { [self ccTouchesEnded:touches withEvent:event]; } Even simple touchBegan event is also not fired. do I have to add anything like delegate or Protocol for that ? I am new in iphone development and also I am learning cocos2d programming for game development . please help.
