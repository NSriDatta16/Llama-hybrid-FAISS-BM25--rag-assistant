I think that Table Storage will do, but maybe AppFabric Caching service would be better fit depending on what you need, but remember this last one is still in CTP. For what you say, I'll go with table storage. Do something like retrieve last messages in a table partitioned by userId and keyed by DateTime is very fast. Cheers
