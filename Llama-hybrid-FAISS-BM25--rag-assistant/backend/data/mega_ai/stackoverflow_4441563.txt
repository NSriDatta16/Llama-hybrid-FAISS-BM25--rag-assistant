Limiting to 576 bytes is very common. Most of the Internet protocols such as DNS do this. Most real-time streaming protocols also use smaller packets since it has the added benefit of providing lower serialization delay and less impact if a single packet is lost. Some protocols have ways of negotiating a larger packet size, though often not in a way that's as robust as PMTU discovery (DHCP, for example allows a maximum message size negotiation). There's also stuff that defaults to 1500 or so and lets the user lower it if necessary. Most implementations of SNMP seem to do something like this. In any event, the DF bit isn't generally set, so the consequence of being overly optimistic is fragmentation, not brokenness.
