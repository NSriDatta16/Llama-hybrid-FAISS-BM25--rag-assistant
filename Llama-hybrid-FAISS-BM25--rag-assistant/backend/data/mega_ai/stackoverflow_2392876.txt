It is possible to transfer into a block, but not in a way that bypasses declarations with initialization. A program that jumps from a point where a local variable with automatic storage duration is not in scope to a point where it is in scope is ill-formed unless the variable has POD type and is declared without an initializer. [Example: Code: void f() { // ... goto lx; // ill-formed: jump into scope of `a' // ... ly: X a = 1; // ... lx: goto ly; // ok, jump implies destructor // call for `a' followed by construction // again immediately following label ly } --end example] The transfer from the condition of a switch statement to a case label is considered a jump in this respect.
