Prevent opening of Application on browser refresh

I have an ASP.NET/C# application that exports some data into an Excel spreadsheet using COM interop at the click of a Button control. When I click the button, Excel is opened with the generated spreadsheet. For what it's worth, here is the button code: This works fine, except when I click the button, close the subsequent spreadsheet, and refresh the page. When the page is refreshed after clicking the button, the call to Export_Workbook() is made again and so the spreadsheet opens again. Firefox, for example, says this when you refresh: "To display this page, Firefox must send information that will repeat any action (such as a search or order confirmation) that was performed earlier." This is something I want to avoid. I'm sure there's a better way to accomplish what I'm trying to do, I'm just not sure what the best approach is. Edit I've accomplished this by doing the following: protected void Export_Workbook(object sender, EventArgs e) { Response.Redirect(Request.Url.AbsolutePath, false); ItemList.Prepare_Workbook(); } Not a particularly elegant solution, but it works. I'm still open to suggestions.
