Testing association in repeated measures with zero in contingency table

I have a small dataset of repeated measures data (each participant ( id ) has up to two samples taken) and would like to determine if there is an association between a dichotomous predictor ( predictor ) and the dichotomous outcome ( outcome ) by running a logistic regression through GEE. However, when examining the data I have the following contingency table: predictor outcome 0 1 0 16 0 1 13 9 Thus my model fails to converge: gee::gee(outcome ~ predictor, data = df, id = id, family = binomial, corstr = "exchangeable") Error in gee(outcome ~ predictor, data = df, id = id, family = binomial, : Cgee: error: logistic model for probability has fitted value very close to 1. estimates diverging; iteration terminated. Since these data are correlated, I imagine implementing Fisherâ€™s exact test isn't appropriate. Are there alternative statistical approaches to examine this relationship? Example data are here: df
