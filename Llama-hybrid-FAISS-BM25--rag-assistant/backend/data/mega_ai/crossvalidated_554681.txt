Reconstruction error in PCA?

I'm using PCA for a while, but recently I read about reconstruction error which I cannot understand... For example let's consider dataset consisting 5 variables: $X_1, X_2, X_3, X_4, X_5$ . Additionally I obtained two variables $Z_1$ and $Z_2$ by using principal components analysis using two components which are linear combinations of $X_i$ , $i = 1,2,3,4,5$ . What in this case I should perceive as a reconstruction error? The most logical thing for me would be: Calculate RMSE of $Z_1$ with $X_1, X_2, X_3, X_4$ and $X_5$ . Output is then 5 numbers. Calculate RMSE of $Z_2$ with $X_1, X_2, X_3, X_4$ and $X_5$ . Output is also consisting 5 numbers. What I would say is that reconstruction error is mean of those 10 numbers. Am I correct?
