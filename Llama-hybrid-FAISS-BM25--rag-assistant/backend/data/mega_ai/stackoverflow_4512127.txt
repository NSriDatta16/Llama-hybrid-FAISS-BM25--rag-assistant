Flowing from John M Gant's idea of adding underscores then capitalizing, I think this regular expression should work: ([A-Z])([A-Z][a-z])|([a-z0-9])([A-Z]) replacing with: $1$3_$2$4 You can rename the capture zones to make the replace string a little nicer to read. Only $1 or $3 should have a value, same with $2 and $4. The general idea is to add underscores when: There are two capital letters followed by a lower case letter, place the underscore between the two capital letters. (PATId -> PAT_Id) There is a small letter followed by a capital letter, place the underscore in the middle of the two. (RoomNO -> Room_NO and FirstName -> First_Name) Hope this helps.
