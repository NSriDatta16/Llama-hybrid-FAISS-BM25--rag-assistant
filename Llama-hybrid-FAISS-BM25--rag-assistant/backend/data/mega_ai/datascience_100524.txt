I checked the sigmoid documentation from here and for a confirmed it should return only one result. So what's the problem here? You have used 2 Neurons at the output layer. So, each is responsible for one output. Either , change the neuron count to 1 and y_true to the 1-D array . Or change the activation function to Softmax . text=["the product was horrible"] rnnmodel.predict(text) This will not work. The embedding layer expects Label encoded data. So the first approach is correct.
