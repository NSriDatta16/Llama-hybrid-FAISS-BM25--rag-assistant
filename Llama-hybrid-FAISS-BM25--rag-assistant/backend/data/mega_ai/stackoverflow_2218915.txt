From the jQuery keypress documentation (the last paragraph of the introductory text): Note that keydown and keyup provide a code indicating which key is pressed, while keypress indicates which character was entered. For example, a lowercase "a" will be reported as 65 by keydown and keyup , but as 97 by keypress . An uppercase "A" is reported as 97 by all events. Because of this distinction, when catching special keystrokes such as arrow keys, .keydown() or .keyup() is a better choice. It even literally mentions about the arrow keys ;) Thus, you really need to hook on either the keydown or keyup events. Here's an SSCCE with keydown , just copy'n'paste'n'run it. No, you don't need to do a browser-compatible check on the event , this works in all browsers from IE6 up to with Firefox. SO question 2217553 $(document).keydown(function(event) { switch (event.keyCode) { case 37: alert('left'); break; case 38: alert('up'); break; case 39: alert('right'); break; case 40: alert('down'); break; } }); Press one of the arrow keys.
