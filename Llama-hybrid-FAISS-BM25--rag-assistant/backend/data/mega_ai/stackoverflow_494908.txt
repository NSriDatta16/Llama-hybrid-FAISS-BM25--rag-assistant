I've come across a similar situation recently. We were using the file system to store serialized trade details. These would only be looked at infrequently and it wasn't worth the pain to store them in a database. We found that Windows and Linux coped with a thousand or so files but it did get much slower accessing them - we organised them in sub-dirs in a logical grouping and this solved the problem. It was also easier to grep them. Grepping through thousands of files is slower than changing to the correct sub-dir and grepping through a few hundred.
