I assume what you are saying is true and that perturbations can only add to the execution time. When we are talking about execution time we are talking about $n_i$ not $r_i$. What we are doing is performing $n$ executions and taking the mean of these results to obtain $r_i$. Now that we have defined our problem, a good probability distribution which fits your profile is the exponential distribution. Lets define a random variable $X$ which is the execution time of a fixed piece of code. PDF: $$P(X=x)=\begin{cases} \lambda e^{-\lambda(x-a)} &, x\geq a \\ 0 &, Otherwise \end{cases}$$ We perform $n$ executions of the code and average these results. Hence, let's define another random variable $Y$ which is the mean execution time. $$Y = \frac{1}{n}(X_1+X_2+...+X_n)$$ By the central limit theorem we know that, $$P(Y=y) \sim N(\mu,\sigma^2)$$ This is a profound result, and therefore you do not need to worry about the "left skewness" of each execution. Regardless of the probability distribution of $X$ averaging these results, $Y$ results in a Normal Distribution. Hence, to answer your first question. With enough data for $r_i$, the mean and standard deviation of $r$ is enough. Obtaining the correct value of mean and standard deviation leads to your second question on "how many observations of $r_i$ do we need to report a statistically significant values?" This question unfortunatly has no straight answer, you can read this page which showcases the information required such significance level and standard deviation. If you dont have this information, I always say, more data never hurts and only time will be a limitation.
