Handling case weight in the Random Forest packages in R

I checked both the randomForest and the rfsrc packages in R, but couldn't find an easy way to apply observation/case weight when training the random forest model. Is there any way to do this? As an alternative I thought about replicating my observations (e.g. replicate once if the observation has a weight of 2), but think this would be inefficient and difficult for non-integer case weight.
