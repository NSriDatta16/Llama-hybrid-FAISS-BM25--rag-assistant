how to change zIndex .dragndrop question

first, have to look at this dragndrop ( http://code.google.com/p/jquery-drag-and-drop/ ) what i want to ask is , isit possible to add a ACTIVE "window" onClick??? example: i got 3 window dragable, name drag1 , drag2 and drag3 drag1 zIndex="98" drag2 zIndex="99" drag3 zIndex="100" when i click on the drag1, change the drag1 zIndex value to highest than all the other drag. after that, i click drag3, also change the drag3 zIndex value to highest than all the other drag. also high than the drag1 example2: set a ACTIVE drag onClick???
