Have you tried dragging a Navigation Bar to a view in the View Controller's NIB? That will create a Navigation Bar with a Navigation Item under it. You can then create a connection between the navigationItem outlet in your File's Owner (whose class should be set to your View Controller class) and the Navigation Item, which is "under" the Nav Bar.
