In terms of whether or not it's possible - it's possible, but not in the way you're trying. Keep in mind that this will translate to a URL which will get parsed by MVC and the different parameters will get passed to the action either as direct parameters or through a model binder. I would recommend that you try to figure out what the URL will have to look like and then maybe do some custom code to generate the URL (maybe use a custom helper function/extension method). If you combine this with a custom model binder you should have a pretty elegant solution which does exactly what you want. For example, if your list has 3 objects of type string you could write a helper to generate a url like this (let's say the list contains 'first', 'second', and 'third') /Controller/Action?obj1=first&obj2=second&obj3=third Now you simply need to write a model binder that looks for entries called 'obj1','obj2', etc and simply add the results into a list.
