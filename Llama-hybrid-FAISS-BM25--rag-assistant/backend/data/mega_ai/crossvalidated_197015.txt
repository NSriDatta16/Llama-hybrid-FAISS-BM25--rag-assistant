Is Random Forest the only algorithm to measure the importance of input variables ....?

I have three time series say (Stock price open, Stock price high, Stock price low) and one output (Stock price close) and I need to know which of the 3 inputs has a greater effect on my output. R's Random Forests' (importance) ' %IncMSE yields the importance for this case. Are there any other algorithms apart from Random Forest, to measure the importance of a input variable?
