input type="image" vs type="submit"

I programmed for a long time checking for StructKeyExists(form,"Update") until I change my input from type="submit" to type="image". IE doesn't send the name of the control back when type="image", but instead sends Update.X and Update.Y. Old Way: New Way: My first thought was that I should just add two characters to my logic from: But I would like a solution that handles both type="submit" and type="image". Right now my logic is: Q: Is there a more elegant way to check for which button has been pressed? Assuming there is more than one button on the form of course, because if I only had to check to see if the form was submitted, I would check to see if form.fieldnames existed.
