Setting best SVM hyper parameters

I have a non linear data set, and I am using SVM (RBF kernel) to build a classification model, but not sure how to set the best hyperparameters of the SVM, C and gamma in Matlab fitcsvm . And is it acceptable if it is trial and error approach setting arbitrary values, until finding the best performance?
