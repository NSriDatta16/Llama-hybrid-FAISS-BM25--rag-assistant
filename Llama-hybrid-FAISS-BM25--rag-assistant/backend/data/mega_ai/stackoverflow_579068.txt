This isn't a terribly elegant solution, but if you save a new .xls spreadsheet that's simply a tab-delimited (or CSV) file, you can have Matlab generate formulas and when Excel opens the document the values will populate. In Perl, I've handled it something like this: open(OUTPUT,'>tmpfile.xls'); print OUTPUT "1\t2\t=A1+B1\n"; close(OUTPUT); And when tmpfile.xls is opened in Excel, cell C1 will display as 3, which will dynamically update appropriately if A1 or B1 are changed. (I'm not good with Matlab, so I have no knowledge of any sort of plugins)
