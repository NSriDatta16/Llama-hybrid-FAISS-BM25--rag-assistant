How to extract all coefficients in the multiple linear model (R)

I would like to extract all coefficients from the linear regression model. By default, the reference category coefficient is omitted, but I need it along with the other coefficients. Consider the following data: library(conjoint) data(chocolate) And this function: Conjoint(x = cprof, y = cpref, z = clevn) 1 intercept 8,6849 2 milk -1,0891 3 walnut -0,7328 4 delicaties -0,9224 5 dark 2,7443 6 low -0,5709 7 average 0,1188 8 high 0,4521 9 paperback -0,0287 10 hardback 0,0287 11 light -0,1686 12 middle 0,1734 13 heavy -0,0048 14 little -0,6466 15 much 0,6466 Returns all coefficient values. I need to do this in a conventional regression model like lm or glm or whatever, also returning the p values, like this: Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 8.68487 0.12648 68.667 I need to return kind4 , price3 , packing2 , weight3 , calorie2 , in this table above (includes p values), but I haven't found any way to do that. The coefficients would need to be together in this table.
