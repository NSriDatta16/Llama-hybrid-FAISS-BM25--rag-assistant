Can I change my property definition so that the user does not need the parens? No. The crux of the issue is that the default property ( Parameters ) is not an indexed property but instead returns an ADODB.Parameters object. Although ADODB.Parameters is has indexed Item property, it is one level too deep. Since you can't change ADODB , you might consider adding a helper method. You can then use this method instead of your property. Public Function CmdParameter(ByVal parameterName As String) As ADODB.Parameter Return Cmd.Parameters(parameterName) End Function
