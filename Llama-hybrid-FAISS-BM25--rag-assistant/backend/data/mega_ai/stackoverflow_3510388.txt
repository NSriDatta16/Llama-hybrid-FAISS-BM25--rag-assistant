Android: Optimize for high-dpi devices only but still support (small- and) medium-dpi screens

I'm building a game with graphic assets in hdpi resolutions (hence I put the files in drawable-hdpi directory). I don't want to have a corresponding mdpi resolution of the images, and I will code everything in 240-dpi based pixel coordinates. Is it possible to still allow mdpi and ldpi devices to run the app, by automatically scaling the graphics from the hdpi version?
