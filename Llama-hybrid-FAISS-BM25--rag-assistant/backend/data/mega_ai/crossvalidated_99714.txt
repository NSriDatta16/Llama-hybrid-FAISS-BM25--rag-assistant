How to perform power analysis for repeated measures with observation error?

I am interested in producing two raster maps of the same areas but separated in time. I would like to take the average value of all pixels in each map and test if there is a difference in that mean between the earlier and later map. Each pixel has an observation (aka measurement) error of, say, 3 meters. I would like to see what sample size (number of pixels) I would need to detect a difference (given $\alpha = 0.05$) of 0.01 meters. I have read up on power analyses, but I can't find anything addressing repeated measures with observation error. Any help would be greatly appreciated!
