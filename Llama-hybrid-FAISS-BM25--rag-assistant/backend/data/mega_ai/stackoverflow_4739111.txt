I'm not sure WF is right tool for this job. What I don't see in your description of the problem is a need for integration between modules and systems. That's where the sweet spot for using WF is, trying to harness together different external systems to attack a single process (the "Workflow/Flow-Chart") in an organized and monitorable fashion, allowing visibility into the current state of the process and being able to "stay alive" awaiting the external systems responses in a non-blocking fashion. I'm just not sure that what is being described is worth the overhead that WF would bring.
