What Objective C preprocessor / Compiler / Iphone SDK do behind the scene?

I do see tutorials like this one http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8X-vDtEwpeo They're good but they just describe the recipe so I still don't understand the logics what's happening behind the scene: What Objective C preprocessor / Compiler / Iphone SDK do when one drag from Interface Builder to Fileowner. Why this name "file owner" ?
