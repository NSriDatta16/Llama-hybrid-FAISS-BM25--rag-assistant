@Thomas gave you a good explanation of your problem. The global variable tos declaration is in the header file 2.h which is included twice via #include in 1.c and main.c . If you want to share the variable tos you should declaration it in 1.c or main.c, and modify 2.h to declare it as an extern , e.g.: 1.c: int tos = 0; 2.h: extern int tos; Then you can access tos from main.c, but the variable is only defined once. Sidebar: Just a suggestion for your own benefit, and for the benefit of sharing future questions in StackOverflow, try to minimize the source code, to the bare necessaries of generating the error. To the point where the program is trivial, because then the bug will be easier to isolate (for you and everyone else), and clearer for the reader, what they should focus on. As well, @Thomas suggestion of The C Programming Language is strongly encouraged as an excellent recommendation for any C programmer.
