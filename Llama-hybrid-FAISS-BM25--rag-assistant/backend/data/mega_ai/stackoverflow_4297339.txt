This is a known bug in the command line parsing in CMake . It's getting confused with the extra = sign and thinks the variable name is CMAKE_C_FLAGS_RELEASE=-O2 -msse -fmessage-length with the value 0 ! One way to get the option in the cache in the correct format is to use the cache editor. After running cmake initially, run make edit_cache then press t to toggle advanced options, Ctrl-n down to the CMAKE_C_FLAGS_RELEASE option, hit Enter to edit it and type in the value you want. After that type c then g to configure and generate the Makefiles. Alternatively, just edit the cache with your $EDITOR and enter the correct line: CMAKE_C_FLAGS_RELEASE:STRING=-O2 -msse -fmessage-length=0 This isn't very elegant, but it should get you motoring.
