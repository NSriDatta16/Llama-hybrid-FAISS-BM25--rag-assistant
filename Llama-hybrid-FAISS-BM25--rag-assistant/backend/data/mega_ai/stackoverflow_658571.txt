Stop storing your employee ID's in the database right justified and do any justification AFTER you pull them out when you want to display them. Edit : Employee Number should be stored at the very least as varchar(10) (assuming that it can accept non numeric characters) or as an integer (if it is an actual "number" as it is assumed to be). Upon retrieval of the number, you would then right justify it if necessary in whatever application you are displaying it in. Note : I said this in comments but it needs to be made explicitly clear: Trying to work around the underlying problem is only going to lead to more problems down the line and an overall sense of confusion among the different developers who work on the project and will inherit the project in the future.
