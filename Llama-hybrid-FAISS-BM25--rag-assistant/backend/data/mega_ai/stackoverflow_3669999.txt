If you are writing a client application and the lifetime of the application is short after this destruction sequence then it seems a reasonable pragmatic solution. I would encourage you to add some logging and to attempt to collect release logs (at least from your internal testing). If you are writing a server application and this destruction is not during the shutdown of the server then I would discourage this behaviour as your server frequently running out of resources is unlikely to be good. In both cases any known deadlock issues should be chased with a high priority by the development team - even if the effect is hidden from the customer.
