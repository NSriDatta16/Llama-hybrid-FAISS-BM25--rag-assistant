Strategy for modeling a multiple web app subscription system

I am working on a system using php/mysql where I am allowing users to subscribe monthly to various, small browser based web apps. Each app will have different subscription terms and plans. The apps are all currently built and they reside within the same framework. I am in the modeling phase so I am looking to make this system as flexible as possible wheren the terms from one plan to the next will vary. Any thoughts on how to elegantly model this?
