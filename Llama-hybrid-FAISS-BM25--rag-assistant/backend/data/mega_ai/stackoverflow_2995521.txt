JSF2 - Why does render response not rerender component setting?

I am getting the following problem: After my view is restored, validation of field causes JSF to skip to Render response phase (because required field is empty). But even though the current value (empty string) is rendered to show to user that he/she did not fill anything, the following statement is not executed: Is it a bug or a feature? Please help. Complete test example (Netbeans 6.8 project) is here: http://www.221b.cz/so/JSFTester.zip From the tutorial: "If the request is a postback and errors were encountered during the apply request values phase, process validations phase, or update model values phase, the original page is rendered during Render response phase" ( http://java.sun.com/javaee/5/docs/tutorial/doc/bnaqq.html ) Does it mean that if view is restored in "Restore View" phase and then any apply request/validation/update model phase fails and skips to "Render response" that Render response only passes restored view without any changes to client? Managed Bean (TesterBean.java): package cz.test; import javax.faces.bean.ManagedBean; import javax.faces.bean.RequestScoped; @ManagedBean @RequestScoped public class TesterBean { // Simple DataStore (in real world EJB) private static String storedSomeValue = null; private String someValue; public TesterBean() { } public String storeValue() { storedSomeValue = someValue; return "index"; } public String eraseValue() { storedSomeValue = null; return "index"; } public String getSomeValue() { someValue = storedSomeValue; return someValue; } public void setSomeValue(String someValue) { this.someValue = someValue; } } Composite component (field-component.xhtml): &nbsp;* Page (index.xhtml): Testing page Why is field's background color not set to yellow? NOTICE: Field has yellow background color (mandatory field with no value) Fill in any value (eg. "Hello") and press Store NOTICE: Yellow background disappeared (as mandatory field has value) Clear text in the field and press Store QUESTION: Why is field's background color not set to yellow? Press Erase NOTICE: Field has yellow background color (mandatory field with no value) EDIT, following Brian's suggestion (field-component.xhtml) &nbsp;* But still not working even if I got rid of JSTL:-( Seems that only value attribute is updated with new value from http request in h:inputText but the rest of attributes are not reevaluated in phase Render Response.
