Moving averages

I have 14 yrs monthly price of coconuts of a particular market. In order to identify the trend how do I know if I have to calculate 30 day, 60 day, 90 day, ... moving averages. What is the basis for choosing the period? How do I compare the moving averages plotted for different periods?
