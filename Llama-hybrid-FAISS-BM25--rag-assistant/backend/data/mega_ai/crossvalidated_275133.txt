So this one does not go unanswered. The confusion over the role of the intercept was answered by @Wolfgang in comments, it is ignored in this function, as documented. The test for residual heterogeneity tests whether the variation between studies is larger than expected. With so many studies it has power to detect quite small differences. In any event it is better to inspect the data to establish the source of the heterogeneity. The test for moderators is a test for their overall effect. In this case since there is a single moderator with three levels it tests for the overall effect of that moderator.
