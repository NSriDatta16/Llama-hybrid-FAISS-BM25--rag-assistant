using jQuery ajax post to submit serialized data

I a problem that has been driving me nuts for awhile now. Here is the set up: I have a draggable list that is being used for user navigation. I would like to save how the user orders the list to a database so it is the same the next time they load the page. I am using (or trying to) use an ajax call to save the order. Here is my jQuery: $(document).ready(function() { $( "#sortable" ).sortable({ revert: true, stop: function(event, ui) { var aResult = $('#sortable').sortable('toArray'); postChanges( aResult ); } }); }); function postChanges( result ) { $.ajax({ type: "POST", url: "model/customNav.cfm", data: {order: result }, timeout: "5000" }); } On the cfm page "CustomNav" I have a simple cfdump to dump the form variable out to make sure the data is getting sent correctly: (I tried to post an image but I am too new, I will try and "draw" the results from the cfdump) |struct | |Fieldnames| ORDER[] | |ORDER[] | 3,2,1 | The problem is, how do I access the order data? I figured because it was dumping the form structure, I would use dot notation to gain access to the order (i.e. form.order). That does not work. When I try and dump form.order I get an error saying the variable order is not found inside form. I suspect it has to do with how I am sending the data to the coldfusion page, however I am not sure what I am doing wrong. So my question is, if I am sending the data correctly to the coldfusion page, how do I access it? If I am sending the data incorrectly, where did I go wrong? Thanks much!
