Is there a way to save iPhone app data (export it and import later for testing?)

Suppose we are doing a big change and require user to run some migration code from version 1.0 to 2.0. The migration will make changes to data in userdefaults, files and other persistence methods. What is a good way to just export all the app specific data (in the device or simulator) and be able to import it back later so we can run multiple test on our migration code? I know in xcode's organizer, you can expand an app in your device and press the export button. This seems like the exact thing I need but I couldn't find an import button. Any ideas?
