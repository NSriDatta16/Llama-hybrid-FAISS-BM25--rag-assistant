Don't do this by yourself...Leverage these "superb programmers"...hopefully they are still working with you on this project. Pair Programming is a great way to expand your knowledge the fastest. You can read all of the books in the world, but nothing beats good old hands-on experience. Heck, if you are in a support rotation, take the phone for a few weeks...those irate customers on the end of the phone are a sure-fire motivator. :) I was a technical lead on a project where only two of us had any experience with Hibernate & Spring (and ironically JUnit). The two of us frequently paired with these "junior" developers to the point where they simply began to demonstrate that they "got it". It didn't happen overnight, but between pairing and writing good tests, we now have a team of 5 experienced developers. Good Luck!
