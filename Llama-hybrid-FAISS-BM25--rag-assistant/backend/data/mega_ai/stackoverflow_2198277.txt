Both of your questions deal with storage duration and scope. First, when you dynamically allocate an object, the object and a pointer to it is valid until you free it. If it is an automatic variable (i.e., not dynamically allocated by new , malloc , etc., and not declared static ), the variable goes out of scope as soon as the object's scope ends (usually that's the } at the same "level" as the one in which the object was defined). It also has "automatic storage duration", which means that the storage for it also goes away when the object is not in scope. For your second question, tmp has a scope that ends with the ending } of create . It also has the same storage duration. A pointer to tmp is only valid within that storage duration. Once create() exits, the pointer to tmp becomes invalid, and cannot be used.
