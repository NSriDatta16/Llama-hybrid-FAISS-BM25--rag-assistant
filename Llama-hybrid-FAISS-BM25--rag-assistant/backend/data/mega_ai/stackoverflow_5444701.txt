How do I fix a ConvertException while importing a csv file with the filehelpers library

I am processing a csv file that occasionally has text in an int field due to user input error. It is the first column and basically it is supposed to be a unique record id. I am catching the errors using engine.ErrorManager.ErrorMode = ErrorMode.SaveAndContinue; What I would rather do is just have the error ignored and replace the text with a numeric value of my choosing and still have that row included with the processed results. I would even be fine with the process just sticking in the default value that I have declared in the file definition class file: [FieldNullValue(typeof(int), "0")] One other thing is I am determining what file to parse at runtime like so: Type t = assembly.GetType(assemblyName.Name + ".FileDefinitions." + className); FileHelperEngine engine = new FileHelperEngine(t); So I am not sure how to implement D.Lambert's suggestion in the context of what to put in for So to clarify there are 7 different file definitions (class files) that get uploaded/processed, but all of them have the CustomerId field.
