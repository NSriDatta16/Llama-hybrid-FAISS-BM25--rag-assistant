My guess is that you're right: you can't accurately predict the dependent variable using these features. Since your models have training errors near the base rate, the features don't seem to have much predictive value. It's possible, but very unlikely, that a predictively useful relationship exists that neither the logistic-regression model nor the neural network was able to capture.
