Showing the relationship between known and unknown factors is distinct from demonstrating that new factors improve the model. PCA will how all factors (but just the factors) are related in a reduced-dimension space. You could then regress the major PCs against the response variable. Or do multiple regression. Note that regression type will depend on the type of response data, which was not specified (yes/no?). Random forests are another possibility; not the liveliest discussion but good to get started: Random forest - binary classification vs. regression?
