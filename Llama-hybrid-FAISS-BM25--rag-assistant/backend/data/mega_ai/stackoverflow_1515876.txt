How to set IFRAME's background color to the BG-color of it's parent document?

I am working on a Joomla 1.5 website and a little self-contained php application, which I want to show within an IFRAME inserted in an article. The template I am using for the website has a dark grey background and the IFRAME shows grey background when loaded in Firefox (I don't quite know why this is so, but I like it like this). However, when the page is loaded in IE, the IFRAME has white background (understandably). How can I make the IFRAME copy the background color of its parent document also in IE? Also, I have another unanswered question related to IFRAME usage and Joomla 1.5 , which I would like to point your attention to.
