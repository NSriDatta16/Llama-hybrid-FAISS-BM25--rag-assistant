Creating and destroying threads every 1/30th of a second is probably not going to be that performant. People will say profile, but others with any significant multithreading experience will say reduce the number of system calls. In this case, it would be easier to create those threads once and figure out a way for them to execute requests from the main thread. If that is all you are doing, you can probably just use #pragma omp task and #pragma omp taskwait .
