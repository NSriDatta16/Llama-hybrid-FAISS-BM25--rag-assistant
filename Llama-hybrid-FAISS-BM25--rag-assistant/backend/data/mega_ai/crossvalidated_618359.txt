Statistical test for P(x|a)>P(x|b)>P(x|c)

I have three within-participant conditions (a, b, and c). I hypothesize that compared to condition a , some event x is less likely under condition b and is even less likely under c . Namely P(x|a)>P(x|b)>P(x|c) . Using ANOVA I can check that the probability in the three conditions is different , but I have a stronger hypothesis. I can have two independent t-tests (for the hypotheses P(x|a)>P(x|b) AND P(x|b)>P(x|c)), but I'm not sure how to integrate their results. Using some model, such as linear regression, I can test a specific functional change in probability (e.g. linear) across the three conditions, but it's a stronger hypothesis than what I currently have. What is an appropriate statistical test for my hypothesis? Example: I hypothesize that greater alcohol consumption is associated with a reduced likelihood of shooting a basketball into a hoop. I calculate for each participant the ratio of successful throws when they consume: 0, 5, or 10 units of alcohol. Averaging these ratios across participants, I find that P(success|0)>P(success|5)>P(success|10), but I am searching for some statistical estimate of the significance of this finding.
