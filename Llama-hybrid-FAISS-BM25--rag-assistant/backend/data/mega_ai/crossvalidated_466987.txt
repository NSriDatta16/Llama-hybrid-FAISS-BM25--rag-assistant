You are not misunderstanding anything as far as I can tell. You are presenting a solid story with logical supporting arguments. I could stop here and I think your question would be answered, but let me add some other comments that might be relevant. The (augmented) Dickey-Fuller test is based on an autoregressive model for the time series of interest. It is testing presence of a unit root against a specific alternative, a stationary process. The universe of cases explicitly considered is restricted to these two (both being autoregressive processes). They are used for deriving the distribution of the test statistic under $H_0$ and probably for examining the test's power against the specific alternative. (It has been a while since I read the original paper, so I do not remember the details; feel free to correct me.) In reality, not all time series are autoregressive with constant parameters and all the other nice features we tend to assume about them. You could very well argue none of the real-world time series follow any of the relatively simple models that we use. So the test should be understood as a simplification. Moreover, perfect stationarity is not necessary in practice. Approximate stationarity is good enough to get approximately correct results from models and tests that rely on the assumption of stationarity. Even though we know that all models are wrong, we still find some of them useful. I suggest using and interpreting the (A)DF test in this perspective. Responding to comments: arguably inferring any specific alternative from rejection of the $H_0$ is even worse than inferring the $H_0$ from non-rejection You can test the assumptions of the test. If there are no violations, a rejection of $H_0$ typically points to a specific alternative by construction of the test statistic. If so, inferring $H_1$ need not be so problematic, since the data contains something characteristic of $H_1$ ; otherwise the test statistic would not pick it up. at least the $H_0$ (in many tests) has a point shape, so something specific is tested, and we are entitled to say "data are compatible with the $H_0$ ". Can anything like this be stated for the stationary DF-alternative? $H_0$ as considered in the DF test contains the single undersirable parameter value (the root being equal to unity); $H_1$ contains all the desirable alternatives (the root being less than unity; keep in mind that values in the negative territory are usually irrelevant in practice). The possibility of an explosive process (the root above unity) is ruled out a priori. (Though there are versions of the test which have explosive process as the alternative, ruling out lower-than-unit roots a priori.) Thus it is quite satisfactory to have the test set up as is, targeting the single undersirable outcome and (hopefully) rejecting it with a high degree of confidence. In other words, the DF test targets a specific violation of stationarity, one that is probably more pernicious than others when it comes to messing up estimator's properties and inference. I think one incurs smallers losses by neglecting, say, a shift in variance than a unit root. The former only makes estimators inefficient, while the latter makes unconditional moments undefined/infinite etc. So a test that allows testing the $H_0$ of a unit root and (hopefully) rejecting it at a low significance level makes sense.
