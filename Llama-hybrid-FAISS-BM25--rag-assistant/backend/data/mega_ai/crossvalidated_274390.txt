A complete set of poll results can be found on the 538 website. When the issue of correlation comes up, it's usually in the context of errors being correlated. Let's suppose Pennsylvania has a prediction of 50% +/- 3% and Ohio is 50% +/- 3% and Michigan is 50% +/- 3%. Then, one would think that the probability candidate A wins all 3 is .125 and the probability that candidate B wins all 3 is .125, if they were independent events. But obviously they aren't independent. For one thing, late news events would show up on the news in all 3 states. For another, the weighting adjustments made (e.g. to adjust for the relative number of Democrats interviewed, the relative number of young people, etc.) will tend to be made similarly across states by the same pollster. This introduces correlation among the errors, particularly the nonsampling errors. If it were me, I'd start by looking at the Rasmussen state level polls, in part because Rasmussen is often accused of having a Republican bias, and compare these to some other polling organizations that also have frequent state level polls. Are the differences systematic? Are the errors relative to the final vote biased? Does the bias tend to follow any particular characteristic of the state (e.g. states which lost a lot of factory jobs)?
