Aswan, there is a simple way to do this by leveraging Palm's facebook application. Essentially your app would be making a service request to the facebook app which would then pop-up and ask the user to confirm a status update or photo post. More info here . If you don't use this solution, you will need to craft your own AJAX requests to authenticate with Facebook and make whatever updates you desire. Which solution are you interested in? Also are you using the Ares IDE or Eclipse?
