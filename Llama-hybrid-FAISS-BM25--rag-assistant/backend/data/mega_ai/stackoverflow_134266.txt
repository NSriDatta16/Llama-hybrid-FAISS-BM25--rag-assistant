How to interpret code metrics (calculated by SourceMonitor)

After reading the answers to the question "Calculate Code Metrics" I installed the tool SourceMonitor and calculated some metrics. But I have no idea how to interpret them. What's a "good" value for the metric "Percent Branch Statements" "Methods per Class" "Average Statements per Method" "Maximum Method or Function Complexity" I found no hints in the documentation, can anybody help me?
