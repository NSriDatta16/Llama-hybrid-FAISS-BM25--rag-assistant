Facebook like frontpage for anonymous users

I'm currently building a site where I want anonymous users to see a page which talks about what the site is about, but shows no content. It only offers two options Register Login (username & password field) Once the user logs in, they should be redirected to a specific frontpage. I tried using drupal/front module, but that did not work. Anynmous access was always shown as access denied I think I could LoginToboggan to redirect authenticated users but not sure what to do about the frontpage. thanks
