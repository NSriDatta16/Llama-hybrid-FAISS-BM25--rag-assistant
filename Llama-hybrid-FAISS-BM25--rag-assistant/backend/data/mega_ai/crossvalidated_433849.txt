Correlation between multivariate random variable and univariate random variable

Suppose you have a univariate random variable, $X$ , and a bivariate random variable $Y = (Y_1, Y_2).$ What does the notation \begin{equation} Cov(X,Y) = 0 \end{equation} mean? Does it mean \begin{equation} Cov(X,Y_1) = 0 \hspace{0.5cm}\& \hspace{0.5cm} Cov(X,Y_2) = 0? \end{equation} Example of where this notation is used (Poole, West, Harrison: Applied Bayesian Forecasting and Time Series Analysis [I will find page number when I can]): The general univariate dynamic linear model is written as \begin{equation} Y_t = F'_t\theta_t + \nu_t, \hspace{1cm} \nu_t \sim N(0, V_t), \\ \theta_t = G_t\theta_{t-1} + \omega_t, \hspace{0.48cm} \omega_t \sim N(0, W_t), \\ (\theta_0 \mid D_0) \sim N(m_0, C_0). \end{equation} The two stochastic series $\{\nu_t\}$ and $\{\omega_t\}$ are assumed to be temporally independent and mutually independent, i.e. $Cov[\nu_s, \nu_t]$ , $Cov[\omega_s, \omega_t]$ , $\forall s \neq t$ , and $Cov[\nu_s, \omega_t]$ , $\forall s,t$ are zero. Here $\omega_t, \forall t$ is a multivariate random variable, and $\nu_t, \forall t$ is a univariate random variable.
