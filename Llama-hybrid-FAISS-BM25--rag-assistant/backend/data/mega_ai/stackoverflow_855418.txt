You might want to override the touchesBegan:withEvent: method of the UIView (or subclass) that contains your UIImageView subview. Within this method, test if any of the UITouch touches fall inside the bounds of the UIImageView instance (let's say it is called imageView ). That is, does the CGPoint element [touch locationInView] intersect with with the CGRect element [imageView bounds] ? Look into the function CGRectContainsPoint to run this test.
