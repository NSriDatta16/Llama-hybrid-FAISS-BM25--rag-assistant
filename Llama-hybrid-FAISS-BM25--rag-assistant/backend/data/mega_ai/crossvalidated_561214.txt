Append the two datasets and create a new variable denoting which dataset each observation belongs to. Fit a logistic regression that includes the predictors, the dataset variable, and the interaction between the dataset variable and each of the predictors. The coefficient on each interaction term corresponds to the difference between each coefficient in the two datasets. For an omnibus test of whether the models differ at all, fit a model without the dataset variable and compare it to the full model using a likelihood ratio test.
