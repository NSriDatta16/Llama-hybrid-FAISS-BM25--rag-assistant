Check Is multicollinearity really a problem? and Why is multicollinearity not checked in modern statistics/machine learning . TL;DR if you are interested in building a predictive model, multicollinearity should not be a problem in most cases. It would be a problem if you used a model that does not do any regularization (e.g. standard linear regression), but would not be a problem for most of the machine learning models. If you find that you have problems with convergence, you could start seeking for fixes, but otherwise you can treat it as innocent until proven guilty.
