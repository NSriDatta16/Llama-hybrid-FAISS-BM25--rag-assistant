mysql ndb cluster add data node

This is my config.ini file options affecting ndbd processes on all data nodes: [ndbd default] NoOfReplicas=1 # Number of replicas DataMemory=80M # How much memory to allocate for data storage IndexMemory=18M # How much memory to allocate for index storage # For DataMemory and IndexMemory, we have used the # default values. Since the "world" database takes up # only about 500KB, this should be more than enough for # this example Cluster setup. TCP/IP options: [tcp default] portnumber=2202 # This the default; however, you can use any port that is free # for all the hosts in the cluster # Note: It is recommended that you do not specify the port # number at all and allow the default value to be used instead Management process options: [ndb_mgmd] hostname=192.168.1.10 # Hostname or IP address of management node datadir=/var/lib/mysql-cluster # Directory for management node log files Options for data node "A": [ndbd] # (one [ndbd] section per data node) hostname=192.168.1.10 # Hostname or IP address datadir=/usr/local/mysql/data # Directory for this data node's data files Options for data node "B": [ndbd] hostname=192.168.0.20 # Hostname or IP address datadir=/usr/local/mysql/data # Directory for this data node's data files SQL node options: [mysqld] hostname=192.168.1.10 # Hostname or IP address # (additional mysqld connections can be # specified for this node for various # purposes such as running ndb_restore) I want to specify second data node on 192.168.0.20 server. What changes do i need to do on 192.168.0.20? It is a very low end machine so, I want don't want mysqld to run there. can anyone provide any input on this.
