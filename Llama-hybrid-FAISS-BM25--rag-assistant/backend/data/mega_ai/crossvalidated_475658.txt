To be frank I am still not very clear about your data but here are some points that you may find helpful: Your data is a time series, call it $X_t$ . First identify the random variable(s) of interest. Your question seems to suggest that the time lapse between notes has some randomness and you probably want get some sense of measure of the spread of this/these random variable(s). So the variable of interest is $\Delta X_t := X_t-X_{t-1}$ . At this point, knowing your data you should think whether you from theory expect $\Delta X_t$ to be independent and identically distributed random variables, or distinct RVs correlated to each other in some way. For example, you may be expecting a pattern that after every 4 time lapses the fifth time lapse should be more or less same as the first one or uou may not expecting a pattern at all and expect that each of the time interval should be more or less same (i.e. independent). Strictly speaking you can skip the above step and simple model the time series, $Z_t=\Delta X_t$ . For example ARIMA modeling or spectrum estimation. But step 2 can help you save time. Measuring regularity: If $Z_t$ is indeed i.i.d., then sd is a good measure. Smaller the sd, more closer (amd thus regular) are the time elapses between notes. If not, then the autocovariance function plots or the periodogram may be more insightful for checking regularity. Hope this helps. If not better to paste the plot of $Z_t$ here for our understanding.
