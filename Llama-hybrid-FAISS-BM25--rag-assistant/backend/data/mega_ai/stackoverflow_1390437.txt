SQL Server AVG function oddity

I am seeing some odd behavior in SQL Server AVG calcuation. On manual calculation, you get 49.277588 but SQL Server is reporting that the average is 50.9914 as shown below. Question: Can someone explain the difference and why this is happening? You can try out the query on AdventureWorks2008 Database with following query select C.ProductCategoryID, P.ProductSubcategoryID, AVG(P.ListPrice) as 'Average', MIN(P.ListPrice) as 'Miniumum', MAX(P.ListPrice) as 'Maximum' from Production.Product P join Production.ProductSubcategory S on S.ProductSubcategoryID = P.ProductSubcategoryID join Production.ProductCategory C on C.ProductCategoryID = S.ProductCategoryID where P.ListPrice <> 0 group by C.ProductCategoryID, P.ProductSubcategoryID with rollup [Update] Answer Here is the result of Weighted Average calculation in Excel
