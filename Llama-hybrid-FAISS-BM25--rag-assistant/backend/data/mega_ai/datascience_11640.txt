Implementing Frequently bought together using a DB

We have a classic structure of an online shop database (products, customers, sales) and we want to implement a Frequently bought together feature. Our software is in ASP.NET and we do not know PHP to reverse engineer how this is being done in Magento. And all we need is a simple Frequently bought together (not with discounts like Magento offers). I understand that this is machine learning and one of the more common ways is Jaccard coefficient. Is that the recommended way? My main question however is what the View I create in the DB should look like? What is the structure of the table that Jaccard coefficient and other relevant tests require so that used best?
