Binomial distribution is a distribution of sum of i.i.d. Bernoulli random variables and their likelihoods are equivalent . If you are getting different results under both representations of your data, then you are doing something wrong. Moreover, unless I misunderstand your problem, you are making things overcomplicated. Beta distribution is a conjugate prior for $\theta$ parameter of binomial distributions, what leads to beta-binomial model . Under beta-binomial model, posterior predictive distribution of your data follows a beta-binomial distribution parametrized by known number of trials $n$ and parameters $$ \alpha' = \alpha + \text{total number of successes} \\ \beta' = \beta + \text{total number of failures} $$ where $\alpha,\beta$ are parameters of beta prior. Marginally $\theta$ is distributed as beta with parameters $\alpha',\beta'$ . MCMC is not needed in here since the posterior distribution is directly available in closed-form since conjugacy.
