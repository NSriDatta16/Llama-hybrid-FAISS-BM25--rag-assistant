This will tell you very quickly if a string contains duplicates: bool containsDups = "ABCDEA".Length != s.Distinct().Count(); It just checks the number of distinct characters against the original length. If they're different, you've got duplicates... Edit: I guess this doesn't take care of the frequency of dups you noted in your edit though... but some other suggestions here already take care of that, so I won't post the code as I note a number of them already give you a reasonably elegant solution. I particularly like Joe's implementation using LINQ extensions.
