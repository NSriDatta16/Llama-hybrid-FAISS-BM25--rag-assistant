Leave one out cross validation for neural network perfomance

When using leave one out cross validation in neural network, do I have to fix the epoch number for each training model? The test results of these models are averaged to show performance. So can I choose best result for each model (the epoch number will be different) or do I have to fixed epoch number for each model (the epoch numbers will be same but the results are not all best)?
