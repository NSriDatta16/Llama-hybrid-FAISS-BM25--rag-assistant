You have 4 ways. First - Change app/code/core/Mage/Catalog/etc/wsdl.xml after line 188 add Second - Change logic of Api Model app/code/core/Mage/Catalog/Model/Category/Api/V2.php in code add this attribute to the new object. Third - Report bug to the magento and wait until it resolved (near 1-2 month) Fourth - And least create you extension where you just override app/code/core/Mage/Catalog/etc/wsdl.xml add your paramters to the WSDL file, change API model in your extensions for additional parameters. My proposal use 4th way.
