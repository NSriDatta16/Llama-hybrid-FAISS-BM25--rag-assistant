The variance inflation factor is only about the independent variables. You can calculate it the same way in linear regression, logistic regression, Poisson regression etc. Whether the same values indicate the same degree of "trouble" from colinearity is another matter. For this, I like to use the perturb package in R which looks at the practical effects of one of the main issues with colinearity: That a small change in the input data can make a large change in the parameter estimates.
