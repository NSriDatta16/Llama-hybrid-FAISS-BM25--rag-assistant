If you've profiled the app, then you've really answered your own question - if there's no measurable performance hit for using , then it's not worth worrying about. Internally, Tomcat will construct a new HttpServletRequest and associated gubbins, but it's probably smart enough to do keep it lightweight. The lesson is to not assume there's a performance problem with Feature X until you've actually observed it. A good alternative to is JSP 2.0 tag files . These allow you to encapsulate reusable content, like with a , but with a clearly defined interface for the fragment, and without incurring the overhead (however small that may be) of . I much prefer them, I think it's a more elegant approach. (Bonus Answer) There is an include mechanism that inlines: . This performs a compile-time inlining of the included content. You have to be careful with that one, though, since if you change the content of x.jsp at runtime, the "host" page won't be recompiled.
