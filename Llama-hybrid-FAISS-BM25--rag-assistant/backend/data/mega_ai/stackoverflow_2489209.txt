embedding pascal

Is anyone aware of a Pascal interpreter/compiler which is embeddable in C++ (or anything else other than Pascal) applications? I am cloning (for lack of a better word) an application which uses an Object-Pascal compatible scripting language and needs to be script compatible. Am I going to end up writing an interpreter? (!)
