Evaluating tbats multiseasonal time series (R forecast package)

I'm using the TBATS model of the forecast package (version 8.0) with Google Analytics data, to forecast web trafic containing multiseasonal effects ( msts ). Before asking my questions, I'll explain the methodology I used. Methodology Data I have two year of daily data that contains two columns like these : date sessions 2015-01-01 2667 2015-01-02 3542 2015-01-03 2383 2015-01-04 2772 2015-01-05 7797 2015-01-06 7599 I created a data.frame with the Google Anlytics API, that includes the data until the end of February 2017, with the intention of using it as a train set. I created another data.frame with with the month of March 2017, with the intention of using it as a test set. Model I did a multiseasonal time series, to take into account the daily, monthly and annual seasonality : y.msts Results Here is the time series components, residuals and forecast I obtained : components With the accuracy function of the forecast package, I obtained the following results with the training set : accuracy(fc) ME RMSE MAE MPE MAPE MASE ACF1 Training set 99.63043 1008.008 672.8444 -0.372223 10.10871 0.3125927 -0.06044894 Questions How to include a test set in the accuracy function? Is the accuracy function the best way to evaluate a forecasting model? What is the best way to create a test set without changing the date in the code every time (for example, by always taking the last month as a test set)? Any recommandation to improve the overall methodology from a statistical point of view?
