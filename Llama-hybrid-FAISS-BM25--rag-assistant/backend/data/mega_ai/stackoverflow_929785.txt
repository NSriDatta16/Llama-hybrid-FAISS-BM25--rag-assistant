Halting a playing sound sample on iPhone using AudioServices

I am implementing a sound effect that plays while a user is dragging a UISlider. Here is the IBAction: called by the UISlider's Value Changed event -(IBAction)playTone4; { AudioServicesPlaySystemSound(soundID4); } I would like the sound to halt when the user is not dragging the slider but has not released it. Is there a way to do that? There doesn't seem to be an AudioServices Stop SystemSound() function.
