Technically, it would be possible to create an agent to do this by instrumenting the code in question to inject assert or if tests automatically. This would involve a bit of bytecode inspection and transformation (e.g. using ASM ). In my opinion, it would take extraordinary circumstances to warrant this. You'd have to be careful not to instrument any classes that rely on being able to process NaN internally. I'm not aware that anyone has written such an agent. If you're looking for a silver bullet, I don't think there is one.
