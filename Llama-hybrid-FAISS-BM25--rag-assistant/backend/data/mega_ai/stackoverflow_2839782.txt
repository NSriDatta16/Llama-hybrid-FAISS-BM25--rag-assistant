Correct, since there is no dynamic memory allocation in the program. My Suggestion is to use vector.reserve() function to reserve the size of the vector which will improve program performance. Basically when you add an element to CArray(MFC) or std::vector it reallocates necessary memory and copies the elements so it will lead to memory fragmentation and will degrade program speed.
