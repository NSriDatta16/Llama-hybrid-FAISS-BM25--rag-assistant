How to activate thickbox from a query string on the end of a url

I'm new to programming, and this website. I have what is hopefully a quick question about using thickbox, and jquery to display an overlayed video on a website. My problem is that I want to have the overlay displayed when someone clicks a link from an email. So the link would be something like: mywebsite.com/landingpage.html#playVideo and then everyone else who visits the web page has to click on a link to activate the overlay. I've seen documentation about how to use js to have the overlay play for everyone who visits the site, but not for specific people from an html link. I'm very new at this stuff and mostly function as a designer, but I'm familiar with basic programming and know enough to get myself in trouble in situations like this. I'm under a deadline and anything anyone can do to help would be appreciated. I guess you could call it a permalink to a piece of content displayed in thickbox on a page. Thank you in advance... var tb_pathToImage = "images/loadingAnimation.gif"; @import "css/thickbox.css"; Video Overlay Example Click here to see my video
