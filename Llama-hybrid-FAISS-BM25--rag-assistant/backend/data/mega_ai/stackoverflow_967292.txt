This is less of a question and more of an incomplete spec for a full software package. However, I'll do my best to help you out here. Regarding single vs multithreaded: You certainly can write this in a single thread. In this approach you would probably just keep the fragment state in a data structure, and use poll() to read from all of the sensors and serial port. If you went for the multithreaded approach, you probably want to wrap your serial port access (and any other shared resources) in a mutex using pthreads. Yeah, so I don't see any other questions you're asking here. What exactly are you looking for in addition?
