Does standardization require the existence of normally distributed features?

In some resources, websites, and blogs, I saw an assertion related to standardization operation in machine learning, and I could not make sure whether it is really true or not. The assertion is given below. The features have to be normally distributed so that standardization operation performed on that data set can provide benefit for it. In other words, if the features are not from Gaussian distribution, scaling them by standardization is meaningless. Is this really true? I am asking, because many people around me do not check whether the features are really distributed in a Gaussian form, and directly apply standardization process.
