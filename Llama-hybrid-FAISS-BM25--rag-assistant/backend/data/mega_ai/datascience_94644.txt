Does the SimpleRNN in Keras have a hidden state, or does it just use the output value as the hidden state?

When using tf.keras.layers.SimpleRNN ,does this SimpleRNN have a hidden state, or does it just use the output value as the hidden state. That is, does it follow the formulas $h_t = \tanh(w_h\cdot h_{t-1} + w_x\cdot x_{t-1}+b_h)$ , $y_t = w_o\cdot h_t + b_o$ ? Or is $h_t=y_t$ ? If the input is of length 5, and I make keras.layers.SimpleRNN(1) , why are there only 6 parameters according to the summary. There should be 5 for $w_x$ , 1 for $b_h$ , 1 for $w_h$ , and possibly 2 for output, for a total to 7 or 9.
