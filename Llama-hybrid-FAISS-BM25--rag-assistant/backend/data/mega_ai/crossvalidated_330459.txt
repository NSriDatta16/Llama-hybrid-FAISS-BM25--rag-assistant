Feature selection before DNN classification

I have a dataset with 600 variables and 5000 observations which I want to use for a classification problem (sick/not sick) but I'm worried about multicollinearity so Im trying to figure out a good way to do some feature selection before running my neural network. Things I've considered are PCA and stacked auto-encoders. I'm kind of a n00b when it comes to ML and Deep learning though so I would love some advice on what methods I could/should apply?
