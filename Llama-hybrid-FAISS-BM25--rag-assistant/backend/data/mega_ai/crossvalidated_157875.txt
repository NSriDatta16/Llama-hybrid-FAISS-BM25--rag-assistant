Logistic regression coefficients and exp(coefficients) meaning and relationship

Suppose that we have this output for Logistic Regression: Coef EXP(Coef) X1 2.45 11.67 X2 0.40 1.449 X3 -4.1401 0.0159 Here X3 has highest absolute Coefficient value but lowest EXP(coef) values. If we want ranking these variables based on importance we should rank based on Coef or EXP(Coef) ? As we can see all Exp(Coef) are positive. How we can consider negative coefs here?
