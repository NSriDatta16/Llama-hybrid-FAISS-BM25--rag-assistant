Sync between two TextViews

I have two Textviews (A and B) that display HTML text. They have the same text, but different text size. Can I do the following: Scroll textview A, and when it stops, texview B will show the same paragraph? In same context - can I use HTML bookmarks (IDs)? P.S. I do not want to use Webviews! Thanks in advance
