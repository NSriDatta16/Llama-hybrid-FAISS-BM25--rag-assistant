Itzik Ben-Gan has a great row-number generation method which does not use tables but only constants and cross join. Very elegant in my eyes. from http://www.projectdmx.com/tsql/tblnumbers.aspx#Recur ;WITH Nbrs_3( n ) AS ( SELECT 1 UNION SELECT 0 ), Nbrs_2( n ) AS ( SELECT 1 FROM Nbrs_3 n1 CROSS JOIN Nbrs_3 n2 ), Nbrs_1( n ) AS ( SELECT 1 FROM Nbrs_2 n1 CROSS JOIN Nbrs_2 n2 ), Nbrs_0( n ) AS ( SELECT 1 FROM Nbrs_1 n1 CROSS JOIN Nbrs_1 n2 ), Nbrs ( n ) AS ( SELECT 1 FROM Nbrs_0 n1 CROSS JOIN Nbrs_0 n2 ) SELECT n FROM ( SELECT ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY n) FROM Nbrs ) D ( n ) WHERE n You can replace the 180 with any number. instead of the select you can use the generated sequence for your insert.
