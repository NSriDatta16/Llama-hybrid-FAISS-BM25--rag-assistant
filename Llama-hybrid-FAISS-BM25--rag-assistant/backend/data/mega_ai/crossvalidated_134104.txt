Why do we divide by the standard deviation and not some other standardizing factor before doing PCA?

I was reading the following justification (from cs229 course notes) on why we divide the raw data by its standard deviate: even though I understand what the explanation is saying, it is not clear to me why dividing by the standard deviation would achieve such a goal. It says so that everyone is more on the same "scale". However, its not entirely clear why dividing by the standard deviation achieves that. Like, whats wrong with dividing by the variance? Why not some other quantity? Like...the sum of absolute values? or some other norm... Is there a mathematical justification for choose the STD? Are the claims in this extract a theoretical statement that can be derived/proved through mathematics (and/or statistics) or is it more one of those statement that we do because it seems to work in "practice"? Basically, can one provide either a rigorous mathematical explanation of why that intuition is true? Or if its just an empirical observation, why we think that works in general before doing PCA? Also, in the context of PCA, is this the process of standardizing or normalizing? Some other thoughts I had that might "explain" why the STD: Since PCA can be derived from maximizing the variance, I guessed that dividing by a related quantity such as the STD, might be one of the reasons we divided by the STD. But then I considered that maybe if we defined maybe a "variance" with any other norm, $\frac{1}{n} \sum^{n}_{i=1} (x_i -\mu)^p$, then we would divide by the STD of that norm (by taking the pth root or something). Though, it was just a guess and I am not 100% about this, hence the question. I was wondering if anyone knew anything related to this. I did see that there was maybe a related question: PCA on correlation or covariance? but it seemed talk more about when to use "correlation" or "covariance" but lacked rigorous or convincing or detailed justifications, which is what I am mainly interested in. Same for: Why do we need to normalize data before analysis related: "Normalizing" variables for SVD / PCA
