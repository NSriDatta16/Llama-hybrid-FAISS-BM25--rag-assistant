Parsing my flat-file on iPhone is a pain in the ***, please Help me out

I am programming an iPhone App which is supposed to parse a flat-file from the web, create managed objects from the flat-file and later on should display them in an UITableView. There are no problems with the saving and the displaying, but I just can't get the hang of a good Parser. Thats the file I want to parse: Flat-file AS far as I know, I can't use the NSXMLParser for this task (because obviously there are no tags). So I at first tried to programm a NSScanner which should get me the interesting properties --> didn't work out Now I am using this method: - (void) parseMemberDataWithURL: (NSString *)urlString { self.memberTempCounter = 1; //Get data from web self.downloadedText = [NSString stringWithContentsOfURL: [NSURL URLWithString: urlString] encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding error:nil ]; memberArray = [downloadedText componentsSeparatedByString:@";"]; while (self.memberTempCounter I am using the memberTempCounter to identify the property. The problems are: This only works out in like 3 of 4 times.1 of 4 times the App crashes and I have no Idea why... The method has a performance like a 1962 VW Beetle. Parsing the whole chunk of data takes up to 3 Minutes on my iPhone 3G Any Ideas or a simpler way to do this? I would be really gratefull. Thanks in advance: -)
