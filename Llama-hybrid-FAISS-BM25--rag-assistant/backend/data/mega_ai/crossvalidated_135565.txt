Optimizing a time-series with multiple predictors

I have a few questions about turing a univariate time series into a multivariate time series and optimizing the predictors. Here is the univariate data: index 22 26 34 33 40 39 39 45 50 58 64 78 51 60 80 80 93 100 96 108 111 119 140 164 103 112 154 135 156 170 146 156 166 176 193 204 My first step here was to of course create a ts object in R and visualize the data: tsData I interpreted this plot as a deterministic time series with a trend and perhaps a bit of seasonality Examining the acf and pacf plot confirms the trend component of the time series My first question has to do with creating trend & seasonal variables for the time series using the decompose() function in R which yields the following plots: I understand that the decompose() function in R has created a list of vectors for the trend, seasonal and random components of the original time series but what am I suppose to do with them? Should I cbind() them to my univariate data and model: lm(index ~ trend + seasonal + random) index trend seasonal random Jan 2012 22 NA -23.8940972 NA Feb 2012 26 NA -19.4357639 NA Mar 2012 34 NA 6.8350694 NA Apr 2012 33 NA -7.5399306 NA May 2012 40 NA 4.3142361 NA Jun 2012 39 NA 9.5017361 NA Jul 2012 39 45.20833 -6.3524306 0.14409722 Aug 2012 45 47.83333 -0.8315972 -2.00173611 Sep 2012 50 51.16667 -1.1232639 -0.04340278 Oct 2012 58 55.04167 2.2517361 0.70659722 Nov 2012 64 59.20833 11.2100694 -6.41840278 Dec 2012 78 63.95833 25.0642361 -11.02256944 Jan 2013 51 68.87500 -23.8940972 6.01909722 Feb 2013 60 73.87500 -19.4357639 5.56076389 Mar 2013 80 79.04167 6.8350694 -5.87673611 Apr 2013 80 84.12500 -7.5399306 3.41493056 May 2013 93 89.83333 4.3142361 -1.14756944 Jun 2013 100 96.58333 9.5017361 -6.08506944 Jul 2013 96 102.33333 -6.3524306 0.01909722 Aug 2013 108 106.66667 -0.8315972 2.16493056 Sep 2013 111 111.91667 -1.1232639 0.20659722 Oct 2013 119 117.29167 2.2517361 -0.54340278 Nov 2013 140 122.20833 11.2100694 6.58159722 Dec 2013 164 127.75000 25.0642361 11.18576389 Jan 2014 103 132.75000 -23.8940972 -5.85590278 Feb 2014 112 136.83333 -19.4357639 -5.39756944 Mar 2014 154 141.12500 6.8350694 6.03993056 Apr 2014 135 145.79167 -7.5399306 -3.25173611 May 2014 156 150.37500 4.3142361 1.31076389 Jun 2014 170 154.25000 9.5017361 6.24826389 Jul 2014 146 NA -6.3524306 NA Aug 2014 156 NA -0.8315972 NA Sep 2014 166 NA -1.1232639 NA Oct 2014 176 NA 2.2517361 NA Nov 2014 193 NA 11.2100694 NA Dec 2014 204 NA 25.0642361 NA When I use the auto.arima function in the forecast package is this all happening under the hood? It seems to me that the auto.arima() selected a MA(1) term and a differencing term to deal with the trend? Is my interpretation correct? What is drift? plot(forecast(auto.arima(tsData, stepwise=FALSE))) Forecast method: ARIMA(0,0,1)(0,1,0)[12] with drift Model Information: Series: tsData ARIMA(0,0,1)(0,1,0)[12] with drift Coefficients: ma1 drift 0.9622 4.5780 s.e. 0.4698 0.4352 sigma^2 estimated as 176.6: log likelihood=-44.52 AIC=95.05 AICc=96.25 BIC=98.58 Error measures: ME RMSE MAE MPE MAPE MASE Training set 0.2459764 7.673429 4.967187 -0.7272714 4.661455 0.08876581 ACF1 Training set -0.0791942 What happens if I'm interested in expanding the model to include other time series variables such as spend_1 and spend_2? do I need to create trend and seasonal and random variables for each of these spend variables or do I just plug them into the auto.arima as external variables: auto.ariam(tsData, xreg=spendData, stepwise= FALSE) spend_1 spend_2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 209 0 0 0 0 0 239 0 0 0 553 0 216 0 0 0 161 0 449 107 0 53 0 120 81 242 0 100 80 482 0 708 81 54 240 688 0 80 0 254 108 183 84 104 191 183 84 243 167 0 108 0 0 0 191 0 191 0 167 0 0 Once I build this multivariate time series model how do I interpret the coefficients for spend_1 and spend_2? How do to optimize them in order to maximize the index variable where the model was something like: lm(index ~ spend_1 + spend_2 + trend + seasonal + random) Thanks all for the advice please let me know if I can clarify anything further.
