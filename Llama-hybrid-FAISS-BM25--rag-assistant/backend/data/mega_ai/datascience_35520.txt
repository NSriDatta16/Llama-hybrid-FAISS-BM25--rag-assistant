You could possibly try the MDI algorithm based on this paper. The authors have achieved great results in detecting anomalies for spatio-temporal time series data. It is based on comparing the probability distributions on specific intervals of the time series as compared to the rest of the time series. The paper describes how they approach this seemingly complicated combinatorial optimization problem. Also, they have released there code . It even comes with a GUI for non-spatial but temporal data.
