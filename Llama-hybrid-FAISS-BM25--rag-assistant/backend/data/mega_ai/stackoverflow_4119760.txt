Rails iteration

This is a pretty frustrating newb question, but I can't seem to get iteration of objects to work at all in my rails project. I have two models, "Photo" and "LandUse" which both have a has_and_belongs_to_many association. Everything works as expected in the console. However, in the photo show action I cannot seem to decipher what code would produce a list of the land uses associated with the photo. My code looks like this: That doesn't produce any output. I also tried: ... and that also doesn't work. In the console if I try something like this: photo = Photo.first photo.land_uses I get a list of all the land uses that the photo belongs to, no surprises. So how do I iterate through that list of uses and print the name of each use? I'm new to Ruby, but if I were trying to do the same thing in PHP is would be a simple foreach loop: foreach($photo->land_uses as $use) { echo $use->name; } So what am I missing here? Update: here are the models as requested: --Photo Model-- class Photo true validates :place, :presence => true validates :city, :presence => true validates :country, :presence => true has_attached_file :file, :processors => [:watermark], :styles => { :standard => "631x631>", :marked => { :geometry => "631x631>", :watermark_path => "#{Rails.root}/public/images/watermark.png", :position => 'Center' }, :thumbnail => "174x130#" }, :storage => :s3, :s3_credentials => "#{Rails.root}/config/s3.yml", :path => ":user_id/:year/:month/:id/:style.:extension" geocoded_by :location, :latitude => :lat, :longitude => :lng after_validation :fetch_coordinates def location [place,city,state,country].delete_if{|val| val==''||nil}.join(', ') end end -- LandUse Model -- class LandUse RE: Error Messages... I don't get an error message with either the for or each approach, I just get a blank space where there should be a list of land uses. Thanks!
