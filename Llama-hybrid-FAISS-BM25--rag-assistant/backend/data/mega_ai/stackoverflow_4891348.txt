What am I missing? Instances of String are objects. char[] is not an object. char is not an object. char[] has little to do with String . char has even less to do with String . For now, I've read the char[] element into a String and used that for setText but that seems kinda inelegant. I'd delete the char[] and do something that makes sense in Java. char[] is virtually never used in Java due to all sort of issues (e.g., encoding problems for Unicode). For example, use a String[] for arrays of strings.
