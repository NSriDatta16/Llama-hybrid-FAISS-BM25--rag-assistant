For public websites: yes. Internal Corporate sites: it's still "un-supported" (IE is forced, FF is sneaked in) Chrome's market share is increasing every day. If you want about 10% of your users to miss out, feel free not to test. It's a cost and maybe it's acceptable to put "unsupported" message for chrome user agents. You best bet would be to look at your web stats for your site and see what the percentage of chrome users is. Monitor your user base and see if they have adapted chrome. Remeber you are building your site for your users. http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_stats.asp
