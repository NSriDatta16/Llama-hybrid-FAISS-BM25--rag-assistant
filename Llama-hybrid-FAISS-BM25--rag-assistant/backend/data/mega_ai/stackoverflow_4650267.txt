I fell in this same error today (for the second time actually) and I finally realized what's the issue here. I don't knwo abount others ORM but using nHibernate you can't share an Id over two different classes (subclasses). That's not the way inheritance is supposed to be in nHibernate. Table-per-class hierarchy is meant to have separate tables to specify a parent table (in your issue you are trying the opposite). All this actually make sense since to access Client or Employee you actually refer to the Person Id (at first I didn't paid attention to this but now is totally clear). The solution is to refactor the domain model and change the relationship between you classes from as "is-a" to a "has-a" relationship and expose common properties (if needed) via an interface.
