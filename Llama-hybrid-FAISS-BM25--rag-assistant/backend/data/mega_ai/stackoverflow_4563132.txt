Because decomposition is a computer science fundamental: Solve large problems by decomposing them into smaller pieces. Not only are the smaller problems more manageable, but they make it easier to keep a picture of the entire problem in your head. When you talk about a monolithic program in a single file, all I can think of are the huge spaghetti code that found its way into COBOL and FORTRAN way back in the day. It encourages a cut and paste mentality that only gets worse with time. Object-oriented languages are an attempt to help with this. OO languages decompose problems software components, with data and functions encapsulated together, that map to our mental models of how the world works.
