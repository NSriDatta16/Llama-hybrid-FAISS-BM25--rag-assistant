Basically, you seem to be filling 1000 arrays with the numbers from 0 until 200000. I would fill up one ArrayList, then just use copy constructors to fill up the rest: class MyClass{ List numberList; public MyClass(){ ... } // Copy constructor public MyClass(ArrayList otherList){ numberList= new ArrayList (otherList); } } MyClass storage[][][] = new MyClass[10][10][10]; List prototypeList= new ArrayList (200000); for(int i =0; i This has the advantage of eliminating the resizing of lists, and working with consecutive chunks of memory (which eliminates memory cache hits - in your original loop, you access different list objects in rapid succession, which surely can not all fit into the same memory cache at once).
