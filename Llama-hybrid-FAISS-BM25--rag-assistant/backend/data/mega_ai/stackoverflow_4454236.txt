The first compiler error is going to be your best clue: c:\program files (x86)\microsoft visual studio 10.0\vc\include\utility(454): error C2447: '{' : missing function header (old-style formal list?) I'm guessing that what's happening here is you may have a class or struct declaration with no ending semicolon. So you have something like this: struct Foo { } // But overall, pay close & special attention to the first compiler error. As @Billy mentions in the comments below, the rules for struct and class are the same. In either case, you need the semicolon. Also, old-school C code will often typedef structs like this: typedef struct tag_Foo { } Foo; // Here, you still need the semicolon.
