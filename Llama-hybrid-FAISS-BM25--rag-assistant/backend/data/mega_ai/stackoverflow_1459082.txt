I can say that writing WPF with IronRuby is pretty cool, and if you invest a little time metaprogramming your environment, it can be awesome. However, there are the downsides - data binding doesn't work with IronRuby objects (you must use CLR objects for that - look at my blog post for the workaround), but this should improve on .Net 4. Pay attention that IronRuby is expected to go RTM only in November. Having said all that, I do recommend you check it out. You might fall for it like I have :) Shay.
