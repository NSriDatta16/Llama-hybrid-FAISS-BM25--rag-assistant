How do you switch 2 different Views by using Drag Gesture in Android?

so im trying to create an interface where the user can drag their finger from the right to the left to get to the second view, and the first view being dragged will move from right to left. very similar to an android device home screen, where the user can drag a screen to the left or right and another screen will emerge from there. I have so far a View switcher where flipper will store two xml files. But i do not know how to use the drag gesture? any examples would be greatly appreciated. Thank you
