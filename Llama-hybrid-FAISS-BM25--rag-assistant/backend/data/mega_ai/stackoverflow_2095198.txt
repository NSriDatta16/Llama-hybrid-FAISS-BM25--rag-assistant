I'm thinking out loud here, so just ignore it if it is stupid, or if I misunderstood the scenario. Give each target a dispatchertimer. Let this tick every 0.1 seconds or so when the user is dragging the element or an animation is playing. On each tick, broadcast the current position using some sort of global messenger class. You would need some sort of unique identifier for each target so that the Line objects can listen to the events from the messenger, determine whether it is "their" target object that has moved and, if so, redraw themselves accordingly. For my suggestion to work well I guess you would need to start/stop the dispatchertimer whenever the animation starts or stops. Otherwise you will probably end up with poor performance. How many objects are you anticipating will be on the screen at the same time?
