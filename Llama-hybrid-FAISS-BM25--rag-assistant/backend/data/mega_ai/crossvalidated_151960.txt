The lasso penalty will force some of the coefficients quickly to zero. This means that variables are removed from the model, hence the sparsity. Ridge regression will more or less compress the coefficients to become smaller. This does not necessarily result in 0 coefficients and removal of variables. See the picture above, taken from onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat857/node/158 The circles represent the error function and the magenta area the possible values for the parameters. You can see that in the left graph that the function is likely to hit the possible value space on one of the corners, on the axes. This implies that Î²1 is 0. On the right, where the space of allowed values is round due to the quadratic constraint, the function can hit the possible space in more arbitrary places
