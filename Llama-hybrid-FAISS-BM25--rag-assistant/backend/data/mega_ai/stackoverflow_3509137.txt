symfony form - delete embedded form object

I have a two Symfony forms: ShoppingListForm ShoppingListItemForm I'm embedding the ShoppingListItemForm inside the ShoppingListForm many times. i.e. A shopping list contains many items. So the ShoppingListItemForm consists of two widgets: item_id (checkbox) shopping_list_id (hidden - foreign key) What I would like to do is delete the corresponding ShoppingListItem object if the object exists and the checkbox is left unchecked. I'm not sure how this delete would occur? Would I use a post validator to see which fields have/haven't been checked? I'm a bit lost on this one.
