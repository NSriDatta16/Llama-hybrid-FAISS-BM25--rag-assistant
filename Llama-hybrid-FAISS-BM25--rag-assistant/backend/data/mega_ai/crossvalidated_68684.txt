Missing values on weekends in transportation forecasting

I am currently analyzing transport volume time series (private consumption goods) on a daily basis. I am trying to fit an auto regressive model an than also include exogenous factors (as weather, web search activity etc.). There are two obvious seasonal patterns. During the week and during the year. However, all values at Saturday/Sunday are zero (trucks are not driving). Just ignoring weekends is not feasible, because the exogenous variables in the model occurring at the weekend influence transportation volumes during the week, e.g. web search activity on saturday influences transport volume on monday. How can this missing values be handled appropriately?
