Google Gears drag and drop upload

I recently watched the google wave video from google i/o where they said you can drag and drop files from windows explorer to the browser and upload them using gears. Can someone point me in the right direction to do this myself? I've browsed around the gears api page on google code and can't really find any examples that even come close to this.
