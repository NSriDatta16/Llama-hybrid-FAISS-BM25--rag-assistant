i have already found a solution to my problem. as i mentioned previously, even if i use the method "Build and Archive" to compile a binary (in .IPA) to be installed in my tester's device, occasionally i will still get the error The application "" was not install on the iPhone "" because the signer is not valid. This is because the provisioning profile is not being installed properly to the device... (you can verify whether your provisioning profile is being installed by Settings -> General -> Profiles) What i have done to resolve this issue is, i will copy my provisioning profile and .ipa file to my tester. Then my tester will drag both of the files into his iTunes. This will ensure that the provisioning profile is being installed to the device. then woalla!
