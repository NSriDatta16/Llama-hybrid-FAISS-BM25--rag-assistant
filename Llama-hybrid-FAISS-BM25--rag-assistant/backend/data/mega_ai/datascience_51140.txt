On a (cough) safer bet, I was planning on using PCA after a log transform and the scaling of the data, since it would help to orthogonalize it and, I suppose, improve K-Means's performance. Is this better or worse than simply applying PCA without the log transform? This is your solution, this is the normal, most used and best practice on what to do with skewed data
