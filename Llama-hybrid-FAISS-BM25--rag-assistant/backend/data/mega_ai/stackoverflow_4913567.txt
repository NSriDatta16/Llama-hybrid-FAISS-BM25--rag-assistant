Exists is a keyword or function in many languages, especially in SQL. Alternatively, one may be referring to some thing's existence, which is a meta-tag usage and is discouraged because the tag doesn't add any functionality. (I.e. you or future questioners are unlikely to search for "exists" when meaning existence of a file or such.)
