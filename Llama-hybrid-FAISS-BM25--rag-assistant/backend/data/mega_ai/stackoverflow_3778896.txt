I would look at Linq To Active Directory found on CodePlex You'd also have to define "my network". Your subnet? Your Organizational Unit? Your domain? Your forest? Also consider where your LDAP server is that you are querying. Is it close or is it on the other end of a remote link? Also what do you consider "online"? Do you expect to be able to ping it? Do you expect to be able to connect to it and perform an operation? There are many things to consider here. Also if you have other infrastructure components such as an SCCM / SMS server they can often be queried much faster since all of the discovery data has flowed up into the data warehouse.
