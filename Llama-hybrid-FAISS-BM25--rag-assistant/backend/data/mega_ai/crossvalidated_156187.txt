Calculate the average rate of success

It sounds like a simple problem but I am unsure about the methodology I should follow. A company developed processor with a new innovative way and they tested the processors to see if they pass the basic quality assurance test. They tested 100 processors and they want to know the average rate of the processors that pass the test. Also, they want to develop a model that can calculate the rate and infer it from a set of data collected. It sounds like a simple problem where I have to find the success rate. If that's the case I would simply find the number of processors that passed the test and divide it by the total number of process that were used in the test. Is that right? I don't understand what kind of model I should develop for that.
