A database would be the best solution semantically speaking. If you want to use one table with columns time and person_id , where time is encoded as UNIX time (easily adaptable to other formats though), you might just want to run: SELECT time FROM table WHERE person_id = 0 AND time > 1234567890 LIMIT 1; Keeping to your original PHP only solution, a semantically sensible solution might just be to run a while loop to search for the next available time slot. $timeslot = $desired_timeslot; while(in_array($timeslot, $apts)) { $timeslot = get_next_timeslot($timeslot); } return $timeslot; Of course, you'll have to define the function get_next_timeslot() to suit your encoding/organizing method.
