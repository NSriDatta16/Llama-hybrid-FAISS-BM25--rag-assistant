How to open a local app file in another app via an intent?

To preface my question, couple things to note. I don't want to store said file on the sdcard in this case. The file also cannot be storage directly in the apps local files directory. It needs to be in a subdirectory, so it cannot write the file using openFileOutput() and MODE_WORLD_READABLE. The app may download files small files like pdfs and store them locally in a subdirectory. I would like to be able to have the user open these files if they have an app that can open them. For example here is an intent for sending a pdf: Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW); intent.setDataAndType(Uri.fromFile(path), "application/pdf"); startActivity(intent); path being something like: /data/data/packagename/files/subdir/example.pdf That intent will open a pdf viewer, but the viewer is unable to open the file. I assume this is a permissions issue. I tried Mark Murphy's suggestion here: http://groups.google.com/group/android-developers/browse_thread/thread/4e55d869213483a9/b7270078ac1a2744?lnk=raot of using Runtime.getRuntime().exec("chmod 755 " + fileName); but it didn't make any difference. He also suggested a Content Provider but I would like to avoid it if I can because it seems like a lot just to get this file over to another app. If the content provider is the only option, do I have to save the file to the content provider or can I just use the content provider as a pass through to get it to the other app when I need to? Thanks, let me know if I'm not being clear.
