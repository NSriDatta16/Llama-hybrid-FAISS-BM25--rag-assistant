Since you are looking at hourly observations over time, your data would often be called "time series" data. A common way to look at if the residuals are correlated is by looking at autocorrelation . That is, the correlation of the series with itself. We often look at correlations by lag, such that we look at how correlated an observation is at time $t$ with time $t + 1$ . In R, we could do something like: cor(lh[1:(length(lh) - 1)], lh[2:length(lh)]) Which correlates all of the values of lh (except for the last data point) with the very next value of lh . So this looks at time $t$ correlated with time $t+1$ for $t = 1, 2, ..., T - 1$ where $T$ is the total number of times. lh is a built-in time series in R. Running the above code returns 0.5807322 , showing that the time series is autocorrelated. This will produce correlated residuals if it is not accounted for in the model. I suggest looking into the area of time series analysis (I like Introductory Time Series with R by Cowpertwait and Metcalfe). What you need in particular seems to be the ACF plot, which is covered here: Interpretation of this ACF plot , and can be run in R with: acf(lh) And returns: The y-axis is a correlation, and the x-axis is the lag. This shows that the data is dependent on adjacent time points (lag = 1, as shown above with the cor call), but probably not any further time points (lag = 2, 3, ...).
