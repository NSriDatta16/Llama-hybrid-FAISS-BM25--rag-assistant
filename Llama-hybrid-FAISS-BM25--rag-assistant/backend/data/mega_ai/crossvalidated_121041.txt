How to determine if there is a spatial dependence in data?

My data consists of data measured at different positions (250 measurements in a 5x5 grid). It has been proposed that results may be somewhat dependent on the position. Looking at the data I don't think this is the case. What statistical test can I do to show this? My current idea is to do an F-test between the set of all the data and the results averaged at each position with a null result indicating that they can be described by the same distribution and so any position dependent component is small. Is this approach correct and is there a better way of showing this?
