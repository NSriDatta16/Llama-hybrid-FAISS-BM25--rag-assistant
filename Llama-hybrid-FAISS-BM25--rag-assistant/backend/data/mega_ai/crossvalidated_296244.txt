Comparing p-values from pairwise permutation tests

I have three time series A, B, and C with the same length. Calculate pairwise measurements among A, B, and C, and perform pairwise permutation tests among A, B, and C for the correlation with the same number of surrogates N for each test. That gives p-value for the measurement for each pair. Declare that I have more confidence in the measurement between A and B than in the measurement between B and C if the p-value for A and B is smaller than the p-value for B and C. Is the last step ok?
