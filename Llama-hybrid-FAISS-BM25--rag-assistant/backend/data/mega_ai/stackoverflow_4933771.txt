So after waiting 2 months for an answer from the iTunes team, which never came, I have figured out a way around this issue and got my app to upload. The key is to make the bundle identifier match the bundle id that is registered in iTunesConnect. In this case the bundle id in iTunesConnect was in the form of 1234567890.com.companyname.appname. Some how when I first created my app I had included the bundle seed id which from my research should not have been included when the app was created in iTunesConnect. To resolve the issue, I created a new App ID in the provisioning portal in the form of 1234567890.1234567890.com.companyname.appname and then created a new distribution mobile provision based on this new AppID. I downloaded and installed the mobile provision in xCode Organizer. In the info.plist of my xCode project I set the bundle identifier to 1234567890.com.companyname.appname. This allowed xCode to match the mobile provision to the specified bundle identifier in the info.plist and successfully build and sign my app with a bundle identifier that matched the bundle id in iTunesConnect. In organizer I was able to validate and upload the app successfully.
