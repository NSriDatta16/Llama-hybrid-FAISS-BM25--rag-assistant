show rating average from database with jquery rating plugin

So I was able to make it work, nothing difficult however I have a small problem. if the tutorial/article has a rating of 5 then 5 stars will be yellow, same if it is a rating of 4 or 3. But when the rating is 0 it will still make the first star yellow instead of making them all grey. I'm using the plugin found on http://zensoftware.org/archives/483 and here is a link to a text file containing the code -> http://cmstutorials.org/code.txt I don't think it's because of the plugin because when I remove the attribute selected="selected" all the stars become grey. so I guess it's something with my code
