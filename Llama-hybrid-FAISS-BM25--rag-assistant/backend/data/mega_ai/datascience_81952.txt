The whole setup of training, validation and testing do make sense only if the samples are independently and equally distributed. Have a look at Foundations of machine learning (Definition 2.1 "Generalization error" and Definition 2.2 "Empirical Error"). Thus it is very important that the distribution of the test set remains the same . Otherwise you cannot deduce anything from the results.
