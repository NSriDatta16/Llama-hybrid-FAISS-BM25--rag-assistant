Markov switching models are a type of statistical model used to capture transitions between different states in a time series. They are a generalization of the classical Markov chain model and can be used to model complex state transition processes. To learn more about Markov switching models, some reference sources that you might find helpful include: Markov Switching Models by James D. Hamilton (1994): This is a classic book that provides a detailed introduction to Markov switching models and their applications in economics and finance. Markov Switching Autoregressive Models by Andrew C. Harvey (1990): This book provides a comprehensive overview of Markov switching autoregressive models, including their estimation, inference, and applications. Modeling Economic Time Series with Markov Switching Regime by Bo Honor√© and Lars Peter Hansen (2020): This paper provides a modern overview of Markov switching models and their applications in economics and finance. It covers recent developments in the field and discusses current challenges and future directions. Markov Switching Regimes in Macroeconomic Time Series by Peter C. B. Phillips and Jianjun Lu (1996): This paper presents an overview of Markov switching models and their application to macroeconomic time series data. It covers the basic theory and methodology of these models, as well as their empirical performance and limitations. Markov switching autoregression models Python implementation : This notebook provides an example of the use of Markov switching models in statsmodels to replicate a number of results presented in Kim and Nelson (1999). It applies the Hamilton (1989) filter the Kim (1994) smoother. https://www.aptech.com/blog/introduction-to-markov-switching-models/ Hamilton (1989) switching model of GNP
