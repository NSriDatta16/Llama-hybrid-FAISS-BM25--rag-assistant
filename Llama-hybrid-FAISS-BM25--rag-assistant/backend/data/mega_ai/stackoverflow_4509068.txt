You asked: Does Magento allow seperate admin users for each store? The free version (Community version) of Magento doesn't have this feature. There will be a single admin. But the admin can create user and roles. So, some users can be assigned only to product and category addition page. And some users can only be assigned to Sales part. Separate admin for each store : This feature is present in Enterprise version of Magento but its cost is too high. At present, it Starts at $12,990 USD/yr In my opinion, using or not using Magento depends upon the functionality you are searching for your shop. If you need lots of features and functionalities for your Shop then go for Magento. If you just want general functions like displaying product, adding to cart, and checkout (that's all), then you may search for any other open source shopping cart. You may try Oscommerce . I have not used it much but I think there is a Oscommerce module for multi admin login for each store.
