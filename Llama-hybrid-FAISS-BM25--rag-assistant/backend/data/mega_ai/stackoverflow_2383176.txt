Another option is to use interfaces; set-up code contracts that allow you to program aganist a defined interface without having to worry about the impmentation underneath. This also allows you to define multiple interfaces that focus on specific tasks, this allows your code to be much more maintainable and flexible. Then, for common methods, put them in a helper class that your implementations can leverage off.
