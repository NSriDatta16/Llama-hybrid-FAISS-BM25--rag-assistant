With your data ... the mean would be the best model. However if one of the series was 280,290,300,310 .. my "best forecast would be 320 ... Additionally if the data was 100,80,100,80 , I would want the software to predict 100 . So it all depends on the ratio of signal to noise ! The stronger the signal the less data is needed to empirically identify the model and vice-versa . Time series methods are not limited to a certain number of data points just some time series algorithm's are . Finally consider the series 120,90,90,90 ... I would want the forecast to be 90 essentially disregarding the errant 120. Similarly 90.100.90.100.90,100,50,100 .. I would expect 90 as the next value and seriously challenge/authenticate the "50".
