How to get Gallio and NCover 1.5.8.2 to work on the command line?

I have seen some examples that use gallio such as this: Gallio.Echo.exe Widget.Tests.dll /runner:NCover /runner-property:NCoverCoverageFile='C:\Temp\WidgetCoverage.xml' /runner-property:NCoverArguments='//eas .*.Tests;Gallio;MbUnit;OtherIgnoredAssembly' When I run this, it gives me an error stating that the '//eas .*.Tests;Gallio;MbUnit;OtherIgnoredAssembly' can not be found? I am looking for an example on how have the correct NCoverAgurments for 1.5.8? I need to register the CoverLib.lib COM object as well?
