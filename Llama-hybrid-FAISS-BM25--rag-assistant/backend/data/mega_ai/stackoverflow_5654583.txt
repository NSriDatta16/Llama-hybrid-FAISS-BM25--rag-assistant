I'd recommend loading via ajax, checking the response as the user pimvbd mentions, but also place a dummy rule at the end of your stylesheet that styles a hidden element with a declaration you can check. For example, give a hidden div border: 987px and check to see if the hidden div's border is in fact 987px. Yes, it introduces a dependency on that style and that element. I've had endless discussions on this with many people, and there's not really a better way (yet). Hopefully s get some attention in browser releases in the near future...
