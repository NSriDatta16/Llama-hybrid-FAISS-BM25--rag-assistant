how to manage millions/billions of small values in a "database"

I have an application that will generate millions of date/type/value entries. we don't need to do complex queries, only for example get the average value per day of type X between date A and B. I'm sure a normal db like mysql isn't the best to handle these sort of things, is there a better system that like these sort of data. EDIT : The goal is not to say that relational database cannot handle my problem but to know if another type of database like key/value database, nosql, document oriented, ... can be more adapted to what i want to do.
