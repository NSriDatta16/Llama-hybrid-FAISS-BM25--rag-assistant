I think you are going about that in the wrong way. You don't care where the drop goes to, you just know it was dropped. In the DropEvent, download the file to a temporary location and then set the mime data to be what was downloaded. Granted this may end up with a second copy to the hard drive, it will be cross platform from the start. You may be able to optimize it afterward with platform specific calls. Take a look at Dropsite example to see how the mime data works from other sources... Edit: It looks like the double copy method is the standard if you don't write a shell extension (for windows at least). Filezilla and 7zip both do that, they return a "text/uri-list" mime type with a temp location. This way explorer copies the data from the temp location to the real one. Your application can do the same, create a temp file (or just the name) with no data. Using the delayed encoding example , create the data on the drop. This whole operation is very platform specific it appears. On Linux (running KDE) I can drag and drop just based on mime type. It appears that windows is not as flexible.
