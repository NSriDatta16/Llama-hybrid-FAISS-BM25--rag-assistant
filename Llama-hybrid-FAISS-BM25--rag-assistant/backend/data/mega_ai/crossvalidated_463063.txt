A. What is the "latent variable" in K-means? Is it the assignment of the data points to the clusters? The latent variables in K-means are discrete, and you can just paraphrase "Assign each data point to the nearest cluster centroid" as "Compute one hot over latent variables (for each sample) using current cluster centroid." B. What are the parameters "theta" that we are trying to compute in K-Means? "theta" represents the centroid(only mean, no variance), and you can also rephrase "Recompute the position of each cluster's centroid" as "Use the averaging to compute new centroid from categorical one hots (in each of the k categories)". C. In the maximization step for K-Means, which MLE formula and what model are we using to recompute theta? I understand that we recompute the centroids as if they are the "center of mass" of all the data points in a given cluster, but what kind of "model" is that? The formula of the expectation(assign each data point to the closest cluster center using a hard assignment) is $$z_n^{(t)}=\text{arg max}_k(x_n-\mu_k^{(t)})^T\Sigma_k^{-1(t)}(x_n-\mu^{(t)})$$ And for the maximization(set $\mu_k$ equal to the mean of all data points assigned to cluster $k$ ) step it is: $$\hat \mu_k=\text{arg max}\langle l_c(\theta)\rangle \Rightarrow \mu_k^{(t+1)}=\frac{\sum_n \delta(z_n^{(t)}, k)x_n}{\sum_n \delta(z_n^{(t)}, k)}$$
