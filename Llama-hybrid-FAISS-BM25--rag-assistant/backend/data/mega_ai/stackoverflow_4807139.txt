If you are in need of a .net based enterprise level ecommerce platform I would recommend Microsoft Commerce Server. It is a highly customizable platform, rich in features, and it has many options for back end integration as it uses web services for communication with the back end. If you choose you could also use BizTalk as middleware, and you could then leverage the built-in adapters for commerce server, as well as the adapters for many other systems (ERP, warehouse, etc).
