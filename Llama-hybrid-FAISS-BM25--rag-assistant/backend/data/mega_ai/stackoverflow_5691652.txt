Program works in Eclipse debugger but not anywhere else...?

The following code segment: private class ConnectionControl implements Runnable { public void run() { while( true ) { if( !cnnct.isInMsgEmpty() ) System.out.println( "Incoming message: " + cnnct.getInMsg().getPayloadString() ) ; } } } Works when I run it in eclipse debugger and place a breakpoint at the System.out line. However, if I run it normally I don't get the "Incoming message..." output. Any thoughts on why this would be or how even to debug it??? Ahh figured it out... had a deadlock situation going on where two threads were using the same resource. Thanks for your help guys! Cheers!
