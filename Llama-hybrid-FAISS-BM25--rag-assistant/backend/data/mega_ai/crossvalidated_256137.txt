The beta regression model can have two submodels: (1) a regression model for the mean - similar to a linear regression model or a binary regression model; (2) a regression model for the precision parameter - similar to the inverse of a variance in a linear regression model or the dispersion in a GLM. So far you have just used regressors in (1) but just a constant in (2). I would encourage you to check whether the model D_Ratio ~ BL | BL with the regressor BL in both parts leads to an improved fit. If not, then you can probably best report the coefficients from the mean equation as you would for a binary regression model. And then you can add the precision parameter estimate (as you would in a linear regression), the pseudo-R-squared and/or log-likelihood and/or AIC/BIC. If the regressor plays a role in both parts of the model, then probably report both sets of coefficients. You can also use the function mtable(betareg_object,...) from the memisc package to generate such a table. Export to LaTeX is also available. Furthermore, you might consider a scatterplot of D_RATIO ~ BL with the fitted mean regression line plus possibly some quantiles (e.g., 5% and 95%). The vignette("betareg", package = "betareg") has some examples like that.
