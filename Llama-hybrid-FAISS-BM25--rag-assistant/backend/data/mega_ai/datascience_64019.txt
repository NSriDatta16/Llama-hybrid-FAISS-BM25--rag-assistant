Bayesian network in Python: both construction and sampling

For a project, I need to create synthetic categorical data containing specific dependencies between the attributes. This can be done by sampling from a pre-defined Bayesian Network. After some exploration on the internet, I found that Pomegranate is a good package for Bayesian Networks, however - as far as I'm concerned - it seems unpossible to sample from such a pre-defined Bayesian Network. As an example, model.sample() raises a NotImplementedError (despite this solution says so). Does anyone know if there exists a library which provides a good interface for the construction and sampling of/from a Bayesian network?
