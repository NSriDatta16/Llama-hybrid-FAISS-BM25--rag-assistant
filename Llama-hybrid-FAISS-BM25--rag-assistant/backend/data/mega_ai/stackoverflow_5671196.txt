Windows Azure - SQL Azure Session vs Database Query Suggestions

Greetings, Windows Azure only supports SQL Azure Session State for multiple instances. I'm thinking what whether storing the objects in session will boost any performance for given scenario below: Scenario: I've got MVC Application where it's header and footer are populated from DB. I've created ApplicationController which inherits from controller. This applicationcontroller in turn will be inherited by actual controllers such as Home/Account etc. I'm thinking of loading all these footer/header value in to session and use the session object for any subsequent requests. Does anyone know whether this will boost any performance? Only reason I'm asking is that SQL Azure Session would do the same thing i.e. query SQL Azure Session storage for each request? Thanks.
