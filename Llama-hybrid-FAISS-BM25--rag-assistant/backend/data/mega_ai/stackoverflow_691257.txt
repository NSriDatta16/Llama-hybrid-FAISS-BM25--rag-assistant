I had this same sort of problem, storing a shopping cart state in Session but having it randomly return null instead. I think I found the answer on Bertrand Le Roy's blog, which seems to work for me: Session loss problems can also result from a misconfigured application pool. For example, if the application pool your site is running is configured as a web farm or a web garden (by setting the maximum number of worker processes to more than one), and if you're not using the session service or SQL sessions, incoming requests will unpredictably go to one of the worker processes, and if it's not the one the session was created on, it's lost. The solutions to this problem is either not to use a web garden if you don't need the performance boost, or use one of the out of process session providers. Blog
