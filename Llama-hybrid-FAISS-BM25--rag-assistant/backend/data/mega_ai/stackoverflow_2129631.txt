There is a way to hide the data, its called steganography . There's an author of a number of articles covered on CodeProject , who wrote a framework for doing exactly this. The title of the articles were 'Steganography ' in a series from 1 up to 12 I think. This is the website that is affiliated with the author. There is a also a obfuscator called 'Phoenix Protector', found here , which can obfuscate the .NET code, personally, I have not tried it but it sounds good. Hope this helps, Best regards, Tom.
