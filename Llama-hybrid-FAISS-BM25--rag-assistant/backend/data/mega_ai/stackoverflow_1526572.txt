Edit: (Sorry, seems I was only half awake when I wrote this paragraph. Of course you're right, everything should be rolled back by default.) You could check what the transaction manager is really doing, for example by enabling debug output for it. Assuming log4j: log4j.logger.org.springframework.transaction=DEBUG The transaction manager gives you very nice log output about created and joined transactions, and also about commits and rollbacks. That should help you find out what isn't working with your setup.
