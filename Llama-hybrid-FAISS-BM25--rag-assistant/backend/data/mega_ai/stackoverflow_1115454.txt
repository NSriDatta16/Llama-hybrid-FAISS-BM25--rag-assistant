Why dont you create an event that all three forms listen to and get them to change the background colour when listening to the "change colour" event? And you could store the colour in a static variable so that when the form gets loaded, the background colour could be set to that stored in the variable. In order for the screen to remember the colour settings, why not store the colour selected in a user preferences file? Try the "IsolatedStorage" functionality to save a preferences file.
