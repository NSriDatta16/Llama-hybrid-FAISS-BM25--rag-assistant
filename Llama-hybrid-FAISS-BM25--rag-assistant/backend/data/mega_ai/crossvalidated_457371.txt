t test for stationarity of time series

How is the t test used for testing the stationarity of time series. I have tried to search literature which says that if the mean , standard deviation and higher moments of the partitioned time series are not significantly different it can be called a stationary series, but I do not find it enough to perform the quantitative test myself
