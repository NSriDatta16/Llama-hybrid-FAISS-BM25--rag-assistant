It looks good so far. One thing that you could do is to move the ID ( staffID and studentID ) up to the Account class, calling it something like accountID . It seems that all accounts that you create need an ID, so moving this up makes sense. One benefit of this would be to simplify your DataStorage class by having a single Collection . Even if you would like to keep your Staff and Students separate, you could also use Map instead of a List in DataStorage , as this would make lookups faster and easier.
