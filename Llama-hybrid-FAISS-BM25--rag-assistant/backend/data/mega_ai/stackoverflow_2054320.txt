I've was involved in developing a website that did exactly this. Short Answer: This isn't something a widget can do. Long Answer: The main problem is that when the user navigates to a new page, the old one is entirely thrown away - this includes the media player. There's no way around this - to keep the music playing, you have to entirely prevent static loads. We solved this problem by using AJAX to replace content on the site when a user tried to navigate, and as far as I know this is the only feasible approach. Basically we'd capture link clicks and do an AJAX load, swapping out the relevant HTML in the DOM with the HTML fetched from the server. Speaking from experience, writing a site that operates in such a fashion is significantly more work. At first blush it may seem easy, but there are a lot of edge cases to consider (GET args suck), and there are a lot of parts to bring together to create a nice user experience (fragment-based URLs, back button support, the list goes on). Additionally, you still have to deal with static page loads, so you'll likely have to create a bit of a framework around your whole dynamic loading. That being said, if you really really must have this feature, there are benefits. When all was said and done, the site I worked on actually had a better user experience than most others: page loading was faster, resources (CSS, images, etc) were automatically cached, AJAX pagination/form validation was essentially free, and we ended up doing some cool things with login/logout. But it was a lot of work to get to that point.
