Polite criticism: anything from vixra.org should put you on red alert. The phenomenon of seeing heads lead over tails is formally encapsulated by the concept of ballot-sequences . According to Bertrand's theorem, suppose after $n$ steps we observe $p$ heads and $q$ tails, with $p>q$. Then the probability that the number of heads always exceeded the number of tails up to time $n$ is: $$\frac{p-q}{p+q}.$$ Roughly speaking, this implies that if you force the number of heads/tails to equal each other at time $n$, then the chance of heads leading tails up till then is approximately $\frac{1}{n}$ More generally, if you want to calculate all the ways of there being at least as many heads as tails up to time $n$, where the number of heads equals the number of tails (note that the time must be even), then you're looking at Dyck paths , which are counted by Catalan numbers. Note that this allows for the number of heads equaling the number of tails at times prior to $n$. The typical average height of a Dyck path is $\sqrt{\pi n}$. The "mechanism" here a result from 2D random walk theory, which says that the number of heads will equal the number of tails infinitely often with probability 1. This means that you will, perhaps after a very long time, always return to heads=tails. And then do so again and again. This result is also irrespective of conditioning. This means that if you're in a situation where you have $p$ heads and $q$ tails with $p>q$, then you will still return to heads=tails, again possibly after a very long time.
