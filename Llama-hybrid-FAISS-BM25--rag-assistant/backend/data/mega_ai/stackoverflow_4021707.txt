Coordinates won't change when rotated Objective c

I am rotating a wheel which various subviews (UIImageViews and UIButtons) However when I ask it to display each and every centre of every subview, it is giving me the same value everytime. -(void) touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { } -(void) touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { NSSet *allTouches = [event allTouches]; int len = [allTouches count]-1; UITouch *touch =[[allTouches allObjects] objectAtIndex:len]; CGPoint location = [touch locationInView:[self superview]]; float theAngle = atan2( location.y-self.center.y, location.x-self.center.x ); totalRadians = theAngle; [self rotateImage:theAngle]; } - (void)touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { } -(void) rotateImage:(float)angleRadians{ self.transform = CGAffineTransformMakeRotation(angleRadians); CATransform3D rotatedTransform = self.layer.transform; self.layer.transform = rotatedTransform; int count = 0; for (UIView *subview in self.subviews) { count++; //these values are always the same NSLog(@"%i %f %f", count, subview.center.x, subview.center.y); } } May someone please tell me why the values are always coming the same even after being rotated and placed in a different position? Thanks!
