Retransform data into original form?

I have a time series data which consist of 24 hours of the electricity demand. I transform the data into stationary from through differences, Now after forecasting for one year, I want to transform the data into its original form to check the accuracy of the model. I want to explain my question by an example dat ori [1] 0 19 18 7 9 10 11 12 13 17 19 By using the diffinv which is the inverse of the difference, but the result I obtain is the original data dat . Know can any one help me that how I obtain the original data dat , mean the result of dat and ori are different.
