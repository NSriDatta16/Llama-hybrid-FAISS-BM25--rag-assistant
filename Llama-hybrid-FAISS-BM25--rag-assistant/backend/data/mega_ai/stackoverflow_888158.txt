If using .NET, there's a built in class that was made precisely for this purpose. TimeZoneInfo ( http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.timezoneinfo.aspx ) as taken from the article: A TimeZoneInfo object can represent any time zone, and methods of the TimeZoneInfo class can be used to convert the time in one time zone to the corresponding time in any other time zone. The members of the TimeZoneInfo class support the following operations: Retrieving a time zone that is already defined by the operating system. Enumerating the time zones that are available on a system. Converting times between different time zones. Creating a new time zone that is not already defined by the operating system. Serializing a time zone for later retrieval. Hope this helps.
