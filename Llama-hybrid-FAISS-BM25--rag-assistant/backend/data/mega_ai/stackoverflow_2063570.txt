Django templating: wrap first n words of paragraph in tag

Using the standard Django templating system, is there any snippet/reusable template tag to have the first n words in a piece of text wrapped in a tag so I can style them? What I'm ideally looking for: {{item.description|wrap:"3 span big"}} which outputs: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. If this would be, for any reason, not feasible or really difficult to obtain, I can use JavaScript and do it client side, but I'd like more to be able to do it on page output.
