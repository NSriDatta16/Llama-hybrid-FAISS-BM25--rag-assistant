I think you will always need new . If you want to load a class file and instantiate whatever class is in there, I think the only really reliable way is by using get_defined_classes() before and after the inclusion. Any difference ( array_diff() ) between those two lists you would instantiate. I have done this in past projects but wouldn't do it today any more, out of concerns for elegance and performance. The best way IMO is to be really strict with naming. So that when you load random.class.php you define the convention that there is one class named random in there, and instanciate that automatically: $classname = "random"; require "$classname.class.php"; $$classname = new $classname(); // Produces an object instance `$random`
