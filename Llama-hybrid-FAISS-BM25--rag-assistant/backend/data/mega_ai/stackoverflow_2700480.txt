I've read the wiki links on normalization many times but I have found a better overview of normalization from this article . It is a simple easy to understand explanation of normalization up to fourth normal form. Give it a read! Preview: What is Normalization? Normalization is the process of efficiently organizing data in a database. There are two goals of the normalization process: eliminating redundant data (for example, storing the same data in more than one table) and ensuring data dependencies make sense (only storing related data in a table). Both of these are worthy goals as they reduce the amount of space a database consumes and ensure that data is logically stored. http://databases.about.com/od/specificproducts/a/normalization.htm
