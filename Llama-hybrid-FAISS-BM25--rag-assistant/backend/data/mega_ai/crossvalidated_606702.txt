robust linear mixed model(rlmer): how to unpack the three-way interaction

I found a three-way interaction effect (each of the three factors has two levels) during a robust linear mixed model(RLMM). I'm wondering how to unpack this interaction. What I had done is: first separated it into two more RLMMs based on the two levels of factor 1. and then for further simple comparisons, I used paired or unpaired Mann-Whitney nonparametric tests. It's a bit troublesome. I don't know whether there exists a function like pairs() to get the results of all the simple comparisons once. Thank you for your attention!
