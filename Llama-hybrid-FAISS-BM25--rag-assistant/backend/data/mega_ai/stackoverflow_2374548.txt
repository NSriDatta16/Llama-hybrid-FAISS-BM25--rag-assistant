ASP.net Tracing would be the one I'd go for. It'll show you when each method in your page/control is called and you can also output additional data to the trace as well. It's primarily intended (I guess!) as a debugging tool, but I think it'll be more than adequate to show you the exact lifecycle a page is undertaking. To turn on tracing, add the following to your web.config file: As Jim Schubert pointed out in a comment, you can also modify the @page directive of a specific page to enable tracing: You can then access the trace details by navigating to "Trace.axd". If you're using a remote server (i.e. not Cassini or IIS on localhost) then change the localonly="true" to localonly="false" in the snippet above. Having an understanding of what goes on under the hood in WebForms can be very useful, it certainly makes solving some of the oddities and edge-cases a lot easier.
