Meta-analyzing incidence (count) data with many zero cells

I am conducting a meta-analysis on the incidence of a rare event. I have 15 single-arm studies with events occurring in only 2 studies. The metarate function in the meta package allows for meta-analysis of incidence, but the only option I can find for managing zero-count data is a fixed increase in zero data. I would rather use a more-evidence based approach such an alternative continuity correction. Is there a way to do alternative continuity correction with metarate? I am open to other evidence-based methods and other package solutions. PS I considered logistic regression as there are many strategies for zero-count data (zero inflated, negative binomial, and hurdle models) but I am dissuaded by the fact that I have no important covariates because this analysis is at the level of the study, not the patient.
