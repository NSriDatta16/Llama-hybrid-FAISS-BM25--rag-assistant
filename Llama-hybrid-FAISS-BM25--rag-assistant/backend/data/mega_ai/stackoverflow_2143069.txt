How do I access other fields in the current row in a query from a custom VBA function?

I would like to write some custom VBA functions to perform calculations on particular fields in a set of queries. This is what I currently have: Public Function TVM(LEN_SEC As Double, ADT_CUR As Integer, TRK_PCT As Integer) TVM = LEN_SEC * ADT_CUR * TRK_PCT / 100# End Function This works fine, but when I create the query I have to do something like this: SELECT TVM([LEN_SEC], [ADT_CUR], [TRK_PCT]) AS TRK_VMT FROM System; I would prefer to do this instead: SELECT TVM() FROM System; Is there a way to access the current row being output by the query from within the VBA function? Something like this: Public Function TVM(LEN_SEC As Double, ADT_CUR As Integer, TRK_PCT As Integer) TVM = CurrentRow.Fields("LEN_SEC") * CurrentRow.Fields("ADT_CUR") * CurrentRow.Fields("TRK_PCT") / 100# End Function These calculations are frequently used in time-sensitive custom generated reports, by several users of varying skill level and attention spans - the simpler I can make the interface for them, the better it is for our QA team. Thanks!
