split magento sites into separate magento instances

I've been tasked with splitting up a Magento store with many sites into many independent installations. Is there any easy way to accomplish this task? I was thinking of just copying the entire store and database, and then deleting the other stores from the duplicate, and continue this way until the task is done, and then delete all the sites off of the main store. Are there any inherent problems with this approach, or anything that I should be aware of before embarking?
