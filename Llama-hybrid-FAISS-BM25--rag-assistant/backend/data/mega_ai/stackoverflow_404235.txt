MVC, in and of itself, doesn't require that you write any framework. It simply means you keep your view, controller and model code separated. I use MVC (or MVP) for even simple mobile apps as I have found the separation of control to be hugely advantageous when writing tests (not to mention when changing UIs). My guess is that you don't do a lot of unit or integration testing right now, so it's not near as obvious how much making this division helps the quality and readability of your code. I'd highly recommend you read Fowler's coverage of UI architectures .
