Have you profiled your execution, and found them to be a source of slow down? Consider their usage. Are they mostly for error messages outside the normal flow of your code? As far as reserving space... Some implementations probably reserve a small buffer before any allocation takes place for the stringstream. Many implementations of std::string do this. Another option might be (untested!) std::string str; str.reserve(50); std::stringstream sstr(str); You might find some more ideas in this gamedev thread . edit: Mucking around with the stringstream's rdbuf might also be a solution. This approach is probably Very Easy To Get Wrong though, so please be sure it's absolutely necessary . Definitely not elegant or concise.
