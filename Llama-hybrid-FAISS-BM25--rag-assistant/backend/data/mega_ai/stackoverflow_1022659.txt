As Robert writes, SQLite files should work on any platform. If you decide to switch to MySQL or PostgreSql you can run the following (standard) command to save your database on the Windows machine: manage.py dumpdata > mydbdump.json and then configure the settings.py on the Linux machine for the MySQL or PostgreSql database and run: manage.py syncdb manage.py loaddata ./mydbdump.json I have successfuly done this on several occasions to switch from MySQL to SQLite it worked fine. Just for reference, you can omit the listing in the dumpdata command to dump data for all installed apps but it will not be possible to load it back in. The all-inclusive dump will contain some internal Django records such as default content types and user authentication which are also created by the syncdb command. So you get errors like IntegrityError: columns app_label, model are not unique List the specific apps that you want to dump and load and it will work.
