How to access images directly from Google Cloud Storage (GCS) when using Keras?

I have developed a model in Keras that works perfectly when reading data stored locally. However, I now want to take advantage of Google Cloud Platform's GPUs for training the model. I have set up the GPU on GCP and am working in a Jupyter notebook. I have moved my images to Google Cloud Storage. My question is: How can I access these images (specifically the directories - training, validation, test) directly from Cloud Storage using the Keras' flow_from_directory method of the ImageDataGenerator class? here's my directory structure in Google Cloud Storage (GCS): mybucketname/ class_1/ img001.jpg img002.jpg ... class_2/ img001.jpg img002.jpg ... class_3/ img001.jpg img002.jpg ...
