How to embed a Font in a PDF with RDLC

i am using Microsoft.Reporting.WebForms.LocalReport to generate some PDF, everything works like a charm, but now evil marketing wants to use a custom font (they are using such crazy arguments as "corporate identity" and stuff). i already goggled around and now i know that i need ReportViewer 2008 SP1 or greater the font has to be marked as embedding allowed the font has to be TrueType but it still doesn't work. i belief that RDLC does not support this feature, does anybody know if this is the case? unfortunately i cant use Server-side reports cause i am lacking a Reporting Server. tia
