Unlimited Online File Storage

Well, I would like to build a file hosting website just like other already did, but it is going to be something different by adding search engine, allowing download and upload in full speed for any user, and so on. Unfortunately the web hosting plans, which declared to support UNLIMITED SPACE rarely allows me to host files on those space. So what I need is the unlimited file storage service which could host all of my users' files. I found Amazon S3, already provides such service, but could anybody recommends me for other better ?
