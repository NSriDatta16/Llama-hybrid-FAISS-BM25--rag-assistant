Getting a Python function to cleanly return a scalar or list, depending on number of arguments

Disclaimer: I'm looking for a Python 2.6 solution, if there is one. I'm looking for a function that returns a single value when passed a single value, or that returns a sequence when passed multiple values: >>> a = foo(1) 2 >>> b, c = foo(2, 5) >>> b 3 >>> c 6 To be clear, this is in an effort to make some function calls simply look nicer than: a, = foo(1) or a = foo(1)[0] Right now, the inelegant solution is something along these lines: def foo(*args): results = [a + 1 for a in args] return results if len(results) > 1 else results[0] Is there any syntactic sugar (or functions) that would make this feel cleaner? anything like the following? def foo(*args): return *[a + 1 for a in args]
