How are deterministic/logical nodes represented mathematically in directed graphical models?

Various software for performing inference on graphical models support logical(a.k.a deterministic) nodes. PyMc, Winbugs, Smile are the ones I'm aware of. Based on the different inference methods used by these software (PyMc and Winbugs use MCMC, Smile uses message passing etc), this extension to graphical models formalism appears to be supported in both exact and approximate methods. I have failed to find any resources that explains how deterministic nodes are processed while fitting models, especially with MCMC methods. Where can I find a good explanation of how deterministic nodes are processed during sampling? There are many resources that explain step by step how sampling algorithms work, but I am yet to see something that covers deterministic nodes
