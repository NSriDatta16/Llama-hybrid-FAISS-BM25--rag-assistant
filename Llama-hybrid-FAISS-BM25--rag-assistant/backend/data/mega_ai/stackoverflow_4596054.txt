GZipStream compresses a stream of bytes, it does no more than that. It does not embed file info in the stream, so you need to embed it somewhere. The easiest way to restore the file name is to name it with the original name e.g. Sample.bak.zip. If that doesn't work for you can use SharpZipLib ( samples here ) which does the embedding of the file info for you. If you don't want to go that either of thoes you can either create your own file format and embed the file info or you can try and implement the standard gzip format
