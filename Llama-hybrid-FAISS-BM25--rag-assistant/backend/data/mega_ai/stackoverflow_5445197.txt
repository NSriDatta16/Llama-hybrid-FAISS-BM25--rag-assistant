Like most problems in programming, context is everything . You need to think about the expected access patterns of your data, and then design your storage system appropriately. If you insert something once, and then access it 1,000,000 times, then who cares what the insert cost is? On the other hand, if you insert/delete as often as you read, then those costs drive the decision.
