Both methods yield the exact same point estimate; in a sense, the one-step regression method is using the two-step method implicitly. You are correct that the naive standard errors are incorrect for the two-step method, and it indeed should not be used. The authors of the paper do not propose using the naive standard errors from such a regression. Any tests they perform are omnibus tests of whether the focal predictors or "confounds" explain variance in the outcome, and they propose likelihood ratio tests to examine that. If machine learning methods are involved, a nonparametric permutation test must be used because the degrees of freedom for such models are ambiguous but required to adequately perform a traditional likelihood ratio test. It can be useful to partial out covariates from the focal predictor to visualize the partial relationship between the focal predictor and the outcome after controlling for the covariates.
