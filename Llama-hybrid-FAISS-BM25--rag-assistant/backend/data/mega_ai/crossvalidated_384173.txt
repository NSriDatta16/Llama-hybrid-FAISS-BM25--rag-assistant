Compute p-value (or more appropriate significance test) manually for time series data correlation value

My knowledge of stats is pretty basic. Hopefully this has a simple answer. I have a matrix of time series data for which I've computed covariance values, and normalized those to get correlation values from -1 to 1. I want to perform a significance test for each of these correlations. To give a concrete example, say we have heart rate and weight measurements for a patient on each of 5 doctor's office visits over the past year. These may appear to be correlated based on this small $n$ , but I want a significance test that accounts for sample size. $p$ -value is what I'm used to, but there may be something more appropriate. To complicate things, I am performing linear interpolation (optionally) on missing values I want to do this calculation manually, not using R or Excel or anything like that. Any resources, formulae or pseudocode you can provide will be appreciated. Update: I did find this handy table that shows significance cutoffs for n, but I would prefer to compute this on the fly instead of using a lookup table https://webstat.une.edu.au/unit_materials/c6_common_statistical_tests/test_signif_pearson.html Example data might look like: time | heart rate | weight --------------------------- 1 | 75 | 150 2 | 76 | 153 3 | 77 | 154 4 | 78 | 158 5 | 79 | 160
