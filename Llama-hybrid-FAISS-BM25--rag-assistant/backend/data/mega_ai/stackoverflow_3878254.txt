JNLP isn't cooperating JFileChooser Access Denied

I feel really dumb...... So I am writing a Java app, and if you can help me get this to work you'll be able to see it. so my jar file is here: http://team2648.com/OTIS2/admin/OmniNode2.8.jar I would like it to be able to be used as a Java web-start application, i was following the tutorial here: http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/webstart/deploying.html so I wrote the following JNLP file as directed: OmniNode Mapper Techplex Engineer But as you'll see if you download the jnlp http://team2648.com/OTIS2/admin/test.jnlp and run it, We get the following error(On a PC): access denied (java.io.FilePermission C:\Users\MyUserName\Documents read) Exception java.security.AccessControlException: access denied (java.io.FilePermission C:\Users\Techplex Engineer\Documents read) at java.security.AccessControlContext.checkPermission(Unknown Source) at java.security.AccessController.checkPermission(Unknown Source) at java.lang.SecurityManager.checkPermission(Unknown Source) at java.lang.SecurityManager.checkRead(Unknown Source) at java.io.File.exists(Unknown Source) at java.io.Win32FileSystem.canonicalize(Unknown Source) at java.io.File.getCanonicalPath(Unknown Source) at sun.awt.shell.Win32ShellFolderManager2.createShellFolder(Unknown Source) at sun.awt.shell.Win32ShellFolderManager2.getPersonal(Unknown Source) at sun.awt.shell.Win32ShellFolderManager2.get(Unknown Source) at sun.awt.shell.ShellFolder.get(Unknown Source) at javax.swing.filechooser.FileSystemView.getDefaultDirectory(Unknown Source) at javax.swing.JFileChooser.setCurrentDirectory(Unknown Source) at javax.swing.JFileChooser.(Unknown Source) at javax.swing.JFileChooser.(Unknown Source) at omninode28.NodePanel.(NodePanel.java:61) at omninode28.EditPanel.(EditPanel.java:31) at omninode28.Driver.main(Driver.java:25) at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method) at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(Unknown Source) at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(Unknown Source) at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Unknown Source) at com.sun.javaws.Launcher.executeApplication(Unknown Source) at com.sun.javaws.Launcher.executeMainClass(Unknown Source) at com.sun.javaws.Launcher.doLaunchApp(Unknown Source) at com.sun.javaws.Launcher.run(Unknown Source) at java.lang.Thread.run(Unknown Source) So those files it points at: this line: fc = new JFileChooser(); So this leads me to believe that i need to ask the user permission to write to their system. I am befuddled. Any help would be super, Thanks Edit... Should I just make users download the Jar directly? pros cons?
