How to summarize multiple time series like dataset

I am running an experiment where I am sampling CPU utilization every second. A snippet of the data from each experiment run is something like this: timestamp cpu1 cpu2 cpu3 cpu4 1.581015e+09 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.581015e+09 41.6 57.4 54.5 47.0 1.581015e+09 84.3 72.5 46.6 82.8 1.581015e+09 1.0 83.7 1.0 2.0 1.581015e+09 33.0 43.3 44.4 37.8 I am using pandas to explore the data. To ensure validity of the experiment, I repeat the experiment 20 times. Now I have 20 of each of the dataset above. My question now, is what is the best strategy to: Summarize the data. Graph a summary of the data If I only had one run, I would like to graph the data in a line chat, but now that I have 20, not sure how to proceed. Find the average at each second across all the 20 dataset? Or is there any recommended approach to handling this?
