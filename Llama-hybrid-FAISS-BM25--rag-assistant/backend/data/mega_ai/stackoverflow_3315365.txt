Summing non-integers in Python

Is it possible to take the sum of non-integers in Python? I tried the command sum([[1], [2]]) to get [1, 2] , but it gives the error Traceback (most recent call last): File " ", line 1, in sum([[1], [2]]) TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'list' I suspect sum tries to add 0 to the list [1] , resulting in failure. I'm sure there are many hacks to work around this limitation (wrapping stuff in a class, and implementing __radd__ manually), but is there a more elegant way to do this?
