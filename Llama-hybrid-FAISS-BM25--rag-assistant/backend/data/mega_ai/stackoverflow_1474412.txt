Maybe what you want is to add files to a solution folder as «links», i.e., keeping the files where they are but giving them a different organization inside the solution. (when you add an existing file to a solution folder or to a normal project folder, if it is in a different corresponding physical folder, the file is copied). It usually stays unnoticed, an option in the «Add > Existing Item ...» dialog where you can choose "Add As Link", instead of the "Add". This allows to share files amongst projects, or, simply, organize them differently. What I oftem miss is the possibility to add "virtual" folders inside a project, for organizational purposes, without breaking the namespace/folder best-practice.
