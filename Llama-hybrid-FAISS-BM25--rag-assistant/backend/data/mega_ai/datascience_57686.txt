Beta Regression You could use beta-regression. I have no practical experience with this type of regression. However, it might be the right method for your task. As far as I understand, the link function is chosen so to restrict $\hat{y} \in [0,1]$ . Here is an R implementation , where the docs say: Fit beta regression models for rates and proportions via maximum likelihood using a parametrization with mean (depending through a link function on the covariates) and precision parameter (called phi). Example: library("betareg") data("GasolineYield", package = "betareg") summary(GasolineYield$yield) Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. 0.0280 0.1165 0.1780 0.1966 0.2705 0.4570 br = betareg(yield ~ batch + temp, data = GasolineYield) preds = predict(br, newdata=GasolineYield) summary(preds) Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. 0.04571 0.10309 0.16364 0.19655 0.26429 0.50792 Regression Models For Ordinal Data Ordinal Logistic Regression could be used for this problem since classes are ordered and multinomial classification does not take the order of classes into consideration. In practice, this algorithm doesn't scale to many classes or many observations because its computationally expensive. Here is an example of fitting a cumulative link model (CLM) such as the proportional odds model to data using the ordinal package in R . require("ordinal") fm1 |z|) contactyes 1.5278 0.4766 3.205 0.00135 ** tempwarm 2.5031 0.5287 4.735 2.19e-06 *** --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 Threshold coefficients: Estimate Std.

An example would be using xgboost with reg:logistic as the objective function. However, many libraries may not support this behavior as they need the target be either one or zero.
