In your code, name1 is dereferenced but name2 is not. Try (*name1).name = "Robert"; and *name2 = "J"; and I hope you will see the parallels. Also, for this example to work, you will need to initialize name2 to point to some mutable storage. For example, char *name2 = malloc(99); strcpy(name2, "Rose"); then you will change "Rose" to "Jose" . I recommend you watch the video Pointer Fun with Binky .
