Trying to use different image size to test my trained model

I have built my model using images which are all 512x384, I then exported the model through .pkl and am hosting it on Render, the UI is built on React App where the user will input their chosen image I am aware that I could resize the images, either on the client side when the user inputs the image, on the server side using python, or I could change my model to accept different image sizes, could anyone advise what the simplest, most elegant solution would be for this?
