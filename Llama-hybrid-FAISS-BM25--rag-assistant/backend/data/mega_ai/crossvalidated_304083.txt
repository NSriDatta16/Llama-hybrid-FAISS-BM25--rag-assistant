I am going to take the question literally: Someone with no background in statistics. And I'm not going to try to give that person a background in statistics. For instance, suppose you have to explain the difference to the CEO of a company or something like that. So: Logistic regression is a tool for modeling a categorical variable in terms of other variables. It gives you ways to find out how changes in each of the "other" variables affects the odds of different outcomes in the first variable. The output is fairly easy to interpret. Neural networks are a set of methods to let a computer try to learn from examples in ways that vaguely resemble how humans learn about things. It may result in models that are good predictors, but they are usually much more opaque than those from logistic regression.
