Why do researchers in economics use linear regression for binary response variables?

Lately, I have had to read several papers in economics (a field that I'm not too familiar with). One thing that I've noticed is that even when the response variable is binary, linear regression models fitted using OLS are ubiquitous. My question is therefore: Why is linear regression favoured over for instance logistic regression in the field of economics? Is this simply common practice or is it a procedure that is actively advocated (in papers, by teachers, etc.)? Please note that I am not asking why using linear regression with a binary response may be a bad idea, or what the alternative methods are. On the contrary, I am asking why people use linear regression in this setting because I know the answers to these two questions.
