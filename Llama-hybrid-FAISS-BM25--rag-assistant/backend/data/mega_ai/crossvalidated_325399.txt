Study path to Bayesian thinking?

I am six years into a business role and have a bachelor's in physics and applied math/stats. Sean Carroll's (Caltech physicist) "The Big Picture" opened me to the idea that Bayesian statistics is one useful way of thinking about anything - inevitably you hold a prior and you should update your credence as additional information becomes available. Is there a path to training your intuition to thinking this way? Critically, it would require repeated practice with verifiable answers through either a course, or self study that includes many problems and solutions. I do not believe simply reading will do. Possible resources, having read every related question on this site I could find: "Probability Theory" by Jaynes. Pro: analytic; intuitive explanation of bayesian statistics. Con: prerequisites; missing problems/solutions. "Doing Bayesian Data Analysis" by Kruschke. Pro: includes problems & solutions; requires only "algebra and rusty calculus". Con: works in R, which I think provides for less intuitive learning than the analytical (I may be wrong). If it is a multi-year path I need to take, starting elsewhere, I am happy to do so! Ideally, I would avoid the frequentist methods, as I have no use for them. My goal is not to be a scientist, but to leverage insight into how reality works to go above and beyond the established thinking in business. Many thanks for any suggestions!
