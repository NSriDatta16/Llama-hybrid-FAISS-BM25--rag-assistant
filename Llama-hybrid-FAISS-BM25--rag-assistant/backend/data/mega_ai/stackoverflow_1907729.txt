In the definition of login , particularly in the docstring, it appears as though the intended behavior is to open up a browser in order to have you log in that way. def login(self, popup=False): """Open a web browser telling the user to login to Facebook.""" import webbrowser webbrowser.open(self.get_login_url(popup=popup)) Looking at the facebook page User:PyFacebook_Tutorial that you linked, it looks like the example with login is a "Desktop Applications" example. You want to follow the "Web Applications" section. I'd encourage you to simply press ahead with the tutorial there.
