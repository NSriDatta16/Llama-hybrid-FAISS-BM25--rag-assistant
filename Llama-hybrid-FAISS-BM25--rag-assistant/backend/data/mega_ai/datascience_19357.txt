Detecting anomalies with neural network

I have a large multi dimensional dataset that is generated each day. What would be a good approach to detect any kind of 'anomaly' as compared with previous days? Is this a suitable problem that could be addressed with neural networks? Any suggestions are appreciated. Additional information: there are no examples, so the method should detect the anomalies itself
