Correlational Approach If you are just looking for correlations between continuous and binary variables, then this is specifically what the point biserial correlation is for. The point biserial correlation is just a simplification of the normal Pearson correlation. The formula for it is: $$ r_{pb} = \frac{(\bar{y}_1 - \bar{y}_0)\sqrt{PQ}}{sd_y} $$ where $\bar{y}$ is the mean of the continuous variable for each group, $P$ is the proportion in each group and $Q$ is just $1-P$ . From Cohen et al., 2002 , we can see how to estimate it. Below is a table from the book (p.30): We would just plug in the values in the table to our formula like so: $$ r_{pb} = \frac{(66.0 - 69.5)\sqrt{(.429)(.571)}}{2.45} = -.707 $$ Note that the $sd$ used here is the standard deviation without a Bessel correction, so it uses $n$ rather than $n-1$ . Regression Approach However, if you believe there may be some relationship between all three variables (two continuous and one binary), and there is some kind of explanatory mechanism behind it, then you may need a regression-based approach, where you simply enter each of these variables in depending on what their functional relationship is. For example, we may have reason to believe (I don't actually know in your case) that the cosine function values and precision predicts correctness. Then you can fit this as a logistic regression, where the two continuous variables are entered as predictors and correctness is used as the dependent variable: $$ \text{correctness} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{precision} + \beta_2 \text{cosine} + \epsilon $$
