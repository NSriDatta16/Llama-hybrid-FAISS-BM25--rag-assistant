You solve this, simply, by not using the same #define at the top ... It would be better to use BLAH_A_HPP and FOO_A_HPP etc so that the #define also includes the namespace name. Edit: Well personally I recommend doing the following: 1) Don't name headers the same (ie use different file name ... this doesn't always help) and use different #define names.. 2) Don't name classes the same thing. Put 1 class per header and name the header after the class 3) If they are differentiated by a namespace use that namespace in the file name AND #define 4) Add an ID to you #define that is unique to you (I could use GOZ for example) 5) Make use of #pragma once. Its useful for the compilers that ise it. Its all a matter of taste though. Choose a scheme that works for you and stick with it. There is no right or wrong. As long as it works and is consistent.
