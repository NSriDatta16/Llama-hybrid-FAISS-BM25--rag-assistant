What measures the y-axis in stat_smooth, ggplot2 in R?

I am fairly new with logistic regression. I have a binary response. And did this plot. The binary response is: Y = 0: The student fails Y = 1: The student succeed library(ggplot2) ggplot(data = both, aes(x = age, y = succeed)) + stat_smooth(method = 'glm', family = 'binomial') + theme_bw()+xlab("X")+ylab("The student succeed") What is the y-axis? estimated probability that the student succeed? Or estimated log odds of a student succeed? Feeling a little confused. Could someone explain what they are I have on the y-axis?
