as an example of what you can do at an interview if you don't remember/don't know the "official" algorithm, my first idea was - traverse the tree in the regular pre-order dragging a level counter along, maintaining a vector of linked-lists of pointers to nodes per level, e.g. levels[level].push_back(&node); and in the end print the list of each level.
