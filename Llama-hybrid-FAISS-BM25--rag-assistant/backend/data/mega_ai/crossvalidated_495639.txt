Correlation between subsequence of time series

For some time-series prediction, I would like to use the correlation between the subsequence of time-series. But I'm confused that Does it really interpretable to use the correlation between subsequence because generally the correlation between dimensions is used and correlation is used in multivariate time-series. Let T be univariate time series and t1,t2 are subsequences of T. Can we use correlation for some prediction? My intuition: As the values are time-dependent, the current window has an impact on the next window. So finding correlation is meaningful. Any kind of answer or reference is appreciable.
