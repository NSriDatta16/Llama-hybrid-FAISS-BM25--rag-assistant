Catalyst create schema can't connect but I can

So I can connect with (obviously I replaced all the real values) mysql -u username -p -h db.dbhostname.com dbname But when I run Catalyt's create script I get $ ./script/dasgift_create.pl model DB \ DBIC::Schema MyApp::Schema create=static \ components=TimeStamp \ dbi:mysql:dbname:db.dbhostname.com username p@55w0rd DBIx::Class::Schema::Loader::make_schema_at(): DBI Connection failed: DBI connect('dbname:db.dbhostname.com','username',...) failed: Access denied for user 'username'@'whereiam.com' (using password: YES) at /opt/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.9/DBIx/Class/Storage/DBI.pm line 1104 Its behaving like the db server isn't allowing connections from whereiam.com, but I can connect via the command line just fine, and tried opening the db up to connections from anywhere temporarily, still with no success. Sorry for what little information I could provide, but that's all I have presently.
