I agree with what everyone else have said (that you really should just use a table) - however I will try to come up with a solution to your issue too. I don't think there's an elegant way to overcome the "loop more than once" issue, but at the very least we can make it a bit "easier" to add new columns to the list: var myList = (List )ViewData.Model; var myColumns = new Dictionary >(); myColumns.Add("Name", new List ()); myColumns.Add("Email", new List ()); myColumns.Add("Phone", new List ()); foreach(var person in myList){ myColumns["Name"].Add(Html.Encode(person.Name)); myColumns["Email"].Add(Html.Encode(person.Email)); myColumns["Phone"].Add(Html.Encode(person.Phone)); } Then now you can do this: It is still poor performance compared to using the -tag and really I don't see why you'd want to avoid that in this scenario.
