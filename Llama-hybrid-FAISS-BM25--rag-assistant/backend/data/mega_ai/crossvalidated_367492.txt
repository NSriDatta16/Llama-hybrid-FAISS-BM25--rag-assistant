The seed will change which data gets placed in the train, test, and validation groups. If you only have 11 cases in one class and 7989 in the other, then you can imagine that each seed differs in the amount the small class is distributed to the three train, validation, and testing groups. Decision trees, like random forest, use the traits in a class to split branches. If you only have a class size of 2 vs 8, the split will vary very widely.
