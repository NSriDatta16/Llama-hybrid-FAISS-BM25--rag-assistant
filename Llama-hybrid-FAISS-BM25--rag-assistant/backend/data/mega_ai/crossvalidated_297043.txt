First, I am not sure if negative binomial regression restricts your intercept and slope to be both $a$. I am assuming that is not the case. Given two scenarios, where $x$ differs by $k$ time: $$\ln(E(y)) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \ln{x}$$ and $$\ln(E(y')) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \ln{kx}$$ Subtract the first one from the second: $$\ln(E(y')) - \ln(E(y)) = \beta_1 (\ln{kx} - \ln{x})$$ $$\ln \frac{E(y')}{E(y)} = \beta_1 (\ln{\frac{kx}{x}})$$ $$\frac{E(y')}{E(y)} = \exp^{\beta_1 (\ln{k})}$$ So, if $x$ changes by $k$ times, average of $y$ changes by $\exp^{\beta_1(\ln{k})}$ times. Suppose $x$ increases by 20% and $\beta_1$ is 0.79, then $y$ changes by $\exp^{0.79(\ln{1.2})} = 1.155$ times, a 15.5% increase. Predicted change in $y$ is expressed in percentage or factor, not in its own unit.
