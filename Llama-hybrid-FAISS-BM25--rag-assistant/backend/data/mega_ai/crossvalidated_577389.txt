How does the Cross-Correlation Function of these two series suggest "bove average value of SOI is likely to lead to a below average value of..."?

library(astsa) soi= scan("soi.dat") rec = scan("recruit.dat") soi=ts (soi) rec = ts(rec) ccfvalues =ccf (soi, rec) ccfvalues Reproduce these results with https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat510/lesson/8/8.2 . How is it determined from this cross-correlation plot that: Note! The correlations in this region are negative, indicating that an above average value of SOI is likely to lead to a below average value of “recruit” about 6 months later. And, a below average of SOI is associated with a likely above average recruit value about 6 months later.??
