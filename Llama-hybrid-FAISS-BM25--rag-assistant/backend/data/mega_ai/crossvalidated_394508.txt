How to deal with mixed data type in deep neural network?

My dataset has 300 numeric features, each of them ranges from 1 to 500. In addition, I have 1000 categorical features (0 or 1), around 90% are 0's (kind of sparse). To run deep neural network, I typically standardize my dataset for all numeric values. My questions is: With these mixed data type, how should I do standardization on these data? Should I just standardize the numeric variables and leave those categorical variables as it is? or take everything and do standardization? If I just have those categorical variables (0 and 1), should I just run the model as it is or normalize them? What if those data are very sparse? What if those categorical variables are counts data (from 0 to 10), does it make sense to standardize them?
