Is it correct to say the Neural Networks are an alternative way of performing Maximum Likelihood Estimation? if not, why?

We often say that minimizing the (negative) cross-entropy error is the same as maximizing the likelihood. So can we say that NN are just an alternative way of performing Maximum Likelihood Estimation? if not, why?
