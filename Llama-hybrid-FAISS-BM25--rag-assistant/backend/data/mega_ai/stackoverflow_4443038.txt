You probably need to set a SSL certificate for your local host. 1) Run --> "mmc" 2) File --> Add/Remove Snap-In... 3) Under "Available snap-ins" select "Certificates" and "Add > " 4) Select "Computer account" 5) Click "Next" 6) Click "Finish" 7) Click "Ok" 8) Look in Personal --> Certificates I think you should have a 127.0.0.1 9) Click and drag that certificate to "Trusted Root Certificate Authorities" Then whatever address you use, you need to change that URL to 127.0.0.1 (not localhost) as that won't work. The certificate should then be valid and I think you will be able to get past authorization. If you are having other problems then it's probably not your certificate, so ensure your services, behaviors and bindings are accurate. A way to help you use WCF tracing to see what exactly the problem might after that, I will shamelessly point you to my blog post. :) http://jtstroup.net/post/Wcf-Tracing.aspx Good luck.
