Using jQuery to list all checked values of a checkbox group. Works in FF and Chrome NOT in IE

This code works like a champ in FF and Chrome to return a comma delimited list of checked values: $('#lifesteps-group-0 :checked').each(function() { if (allSteps.length === 0) { allSteps = $(this).val(); } else { allSteps = allSteps + ',' + $(this).val(); } }); Basically the lifesteps-group-0 div has all of the checkboxes in them. Like I said above it works beautifully in FF and Chrome, but only works for the first checkbox in IE. Also here is the format of the checkbox group: Began preparation as a missionary canidate Began a small group, helped in a church plant Any ideas oh jQuery GURUS? Thanks, Josh
