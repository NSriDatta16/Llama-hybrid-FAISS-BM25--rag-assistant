Note : I assume that you are using a NSTextView and that you can access its text storage (NSTextStorage). I think it is not possible to only change the font's size over a text that use multiple fonts. In NSAttributedString, font's size is part of the NSFontAttributeName attribute which controls both the font and the size. One solution is to iterate over the selection and use the attribute:atIndex:longestEffectiveRange:inRange: to capture the range when each font apply, change the font's size and then use the addAttribute:value:range: to set the new font over the range. Update : If you take a look at the GNUstep GUI source code for NSTextView (under LGPL), you will see that their implementation use the range iteration.
