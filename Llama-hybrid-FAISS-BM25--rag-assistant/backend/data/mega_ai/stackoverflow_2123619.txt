Just a thought, but you could perhaps create an ordered test and add the same tests twice: add all tests once, then all tests again in the same order. In your test context keep a count of the number of times each test has been run. I believe that the context is static so it should only be created once, then reused as more tests are run. In the test set up, use the XmlStorageManager if the test count is even and the DbStorageManager if the test count for that test is odd.
