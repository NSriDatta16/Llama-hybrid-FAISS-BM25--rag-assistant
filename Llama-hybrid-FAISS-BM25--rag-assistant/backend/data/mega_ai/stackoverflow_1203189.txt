I think if you broke the polygon back into it's vertices, and then applied a function to find the largest convex hull , and then find the center off that convex hull, it would match closely with the "apparent" center. Finding the largest convex hull given the vertices: Look under the Simple Polygon paragraph. Average the vertices of the convex hull to find the center.
