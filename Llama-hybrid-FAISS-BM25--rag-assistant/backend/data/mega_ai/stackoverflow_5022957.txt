Does anyone know a work around to get this data? There is none. I don't think even Flash based uploaders do this any more. The original location is none of the receiving site's business any more - that is the new rule; you need to change your programs accordingly. I'd like to be able to do this with AJAX instead of submitting the form That wouldn't be possible even if you had the full file name - you will not get read access to a local file (barring some new HTML 5 shenanigans that aren't widely supported yet.)
