Yes, jsonp call-authentication is tough, because the browser-client needs to know the shared secret. An option would be to make the end-point anonymous (no authentication necessary). This comes with other security wholes (server is open for attacks, anyone can call it). But you could handle this by either only exposing very limited resource and/or using rate-limiting. With rate-limiting only a certain number of calls are allowed by one client in a certain range of time. It works by identifying the client (e.g. by source-ips or other client footprints). I once experimented with one-time tokens, but they all somewhat failed because you have the problem of getting the token itself and protecting multiple retrievals of the token by bots (which comes again to the need of rate-limiting).
