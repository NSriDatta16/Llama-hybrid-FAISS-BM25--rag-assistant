Can Granger causality be used in average values?

I have gene expression data for several genes in different time points (but I guess the type of data doesn't make any difference for this question). I would like to use Granger causality to see if changes in expression in one gene could be related to changes in another. However, the individuals in each time point are different. Therefore, I cannot pair an observation in t with one in t+1. I thought about using the average gene expressions for each gene in each time point, in order to circumvent this pairing problem, but someone told me that that wouldn't be correct. That might be so, but I still don't get exactly why. Many examples of Granger causality I see are not exactly paired. Does it, or does it not, make sense to use Granger causality in averages?
