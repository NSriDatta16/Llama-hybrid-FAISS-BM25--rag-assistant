Annotations of Annotations in Java 5/6

I am setting up Hibernate Caching and want to cache certain entities in different regions. For example, some entities can be "stale" for up to 5 minutes, some for an hour, and some (like lookups) won't change for weeks. To facilitate easy config of regions in my code, I'm trying the following: I created an annotation named @LookupCache (and @DailyCache etc) @Cache(region = "lookups", usage = CacheConcurrencyStrategy.READ_ONLY) @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME) public @interface LookupCache {} And I am adding that annotation to my Hibernate/JPA entity: @LookupCache public class Course {} This way, I can easily change the region or attributes of the @LookupCache without having to change the annotation params of every class. However, the cache loader doesn't pick up this inherited @Cache notation. How do I get the @LookupCache annotation to inherit the annotations that are applied to it? Update: To clarify, the @Cache annotation is a built-in hibernate annotation used by second-level caches like EHCache. I can't modify the @Cache annotation to make it inheritable by other annotations (my client doesn't want to maintain a special fork of hibernate). This is probably my only option though.
