Using Bayesian Lasso with an informed prior

I'm looking for advice on how best to go about setting an informative prior for the Bayesian Lasso and BART (I'm applying these in R using the rjags and bartMachine packages) I have 3 proteomics datasets, each measuring the same 123 proteins for patients and controls. I want to train a Bayesian model on dataset 2, using a prior distribution based on knowledge gained from dataset 1, and then test the performance of the Bayesian model in predicting patients from controls in dataset 3. At the moment, I'm applying a ridge regression model to dataset 1, and obtaining the regression coefficients for all 123 proteins. My initial idea is to try and use these regression coefficients to centre a prior on beta. Could this work? Does anyone have any advice regarding creating an informed prior based on results from past experiments?
