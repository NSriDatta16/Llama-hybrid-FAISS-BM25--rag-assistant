Remove all empty HTML tags?

I am imagining a function which I figure would use Regex, and it would be recursive for instances like to remove all empty HTML tags within a string. This would have to account for whitespace to if possible. There would be no crazy instances where I am pretty terrible at regex but I imagine this is possible. How can you do it? Here is the method I have so far: Public Shared Function stripEmptyHtmlTags(ByVal html As String) As String Dim newHtml As String = Regex.Replace(html, "/( \s* )/Usi", "") If html <> newHtml Then newHtml = stripEmptyHtmlTags(newHtml) End If Return newHtml End Function However my current Regex is in PHP format, and it doesn't seem to be working. I am not familiar with .NET regex syntax. To all those saying don't use regex: I am curious what the pattern would be regardless. Surely there is a pattern which could match all opening/closing start tags with any amount of white space (or none) in between the tags? I've seen regex that matches HTML tags with any number of attributes, one empty tag (such as just ) etc. So far I have tried the following regex patterns in the above method to no avail (as in, I have a text string with empty paragraphs tags that didn't even get removed.) Regex.Replace(html, "/( \s* )/Usi", "") Regex.Replace(html, "( \s* )", "") Regex.Replace(html, "% ]*>\s* %", "") Regex.Replace(html, " \s* ", "")
