How to optimize the allocation of product aquisition

The scenario is purchasing of a product or raw material from multiple suppliers on a regular basis, and the problem is how to best allocate order quantities among the suppliers. For example need 100 units of the product in a certain time period. Based on historical averages for example the allocation percents can be 50,25,15,10 among 4 suppliers. But sometimes suppliers are impacted by circumstance and resulting split is like 60,30,5,5. There is a re-allocation if one producer cannot meet the demand so requests get re-routed to the most productive suppliers in the time period. There are other variables in play such as how busy the suppliers are with other clients, or even seasonal adjustments. Some variables can be known, others are unknown. How to optimize this problem so that the initial allocation is most accurate and re-allocation is minimized? Side note: trying to understand if there is any tool or approach in Python Scikit-learn that generally can be used for this problem. Thanks in advance for any ideas!
