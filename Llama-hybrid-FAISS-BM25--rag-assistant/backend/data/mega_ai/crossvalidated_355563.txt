A guess: "scale" in PCA could arise form question "should we standardize variables before running PCA?". The answer is "Yes", because if we do not, a scale of variable affects results. If, for example, one of variables is in centimeters and we change it's scale to meters, we would get completely different results in PCA. Also if scale of one of the variables is from 0 to 1 and another from 0 do 1000, the later would have greater impact on PCA results. So, my guess is that scale here means "unit", "range", "extent" etc. Plus, R function that performs standardization is... scale :)
