The difference lies in the interpretation. If you encode the variable as numbers, then by default most of the packages will interpret that as numbers. In most of the cases, you have to signal that there is no ordering, either by factoring or something similar. Why it matters? Just because of the additional information which you might induce into the structure of the problem. If your encoding is treated as a number, then you tell also to the learner multiple implications of that. Suppose you have a variable for the country name, and you factor that as a number. Then a country encoded with 1 is considered similar to a country encoded with 2, and distant than a country encoded with 40. So you start with a randomly assigned the encoding, which is interpreted as information by a learner. On the other hand, if your encoding is not random, but with purpose, then you can make use of it. For example, you might encode temperature factors "low", "medium", "high" with increasing integer value. Pay attention, however, since you might need to establish if the difference between "low" and "medium" is the same as the difference between "medium" and "high".
