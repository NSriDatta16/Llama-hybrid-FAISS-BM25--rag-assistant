No, they don't. They form a mathematical structure that's much more closely analogous to an affine space. As a quick-and-dirty rule - not a formal definition - the way you can distinguish between the two concepts is that a word embedding has no natural zero vector (or, slightly more precisely, no word naturally maps to a hypothetical zero vector). Somewhat more rigorously: an affine space has two conceptually very different classes of vectors: "position" vectors and "displacement" vectors. Only the displacement vectors form a true vector space: you can form arbitrary linear combinations of them. The rules for adding and subtracting position and displacement vectors together are a little more complicated: The sum or difference of two displacement vectors is a displacement vector (since they form a true vector space). The difference between two position vectors is a displacement vector. Conversely, a position vector plus a displacement vector equals a position vector. You can't add two position vectors together. The affine space itself is the set of all the position vectors (plus the algebraic structure given by the rules for subtracting them). In a word embedding, the words themselves embed to position vectors. The relations between words correspond to displacement vectors. You can only take arbitrary linear combinations of the relations - i.e. the displacement vectors - and not the words themselves, which you can only subtract to get relations.
