Would it be possible to alter the index of inserted_history, systemId (systemId) to be systemId (systemId, inTime). Or add an additional index My logic being that this should help to speed up the selection of the inserted_history (a) rows which forms the basis of the join. The where clause "where a.inTime between '2010-08-10 00:00:00' and '2010-08-010 23:59:59' and a.systemId='ND_arber'" would all be selectable by index. At present, rows are selectable by systemId but then all those rows need to be scanned for the time. Just as a matter of interest, how many records would there be (on average) for each system id. Also as msgid is not unique on its own, how many records (on average) in the other tables will have teh same msgid.
