The stats you've read are based on actual screen sizes of visitors. If you're looking for stats on what size the average user's browser is at, you'll need to look elsewhere. Also I never browse full screen on windows or mac OS, and I consider a design that's wider than 960px or so to be very annoying. (it's 2^16+2^17+2^18+2^19) I'm feeling lucky for browser size . See the second chart.
