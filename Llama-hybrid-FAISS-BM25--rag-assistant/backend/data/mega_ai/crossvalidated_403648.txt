Is there a branch of machine learning that can deal with near infinite state spaces

So I have a game type problem defined as follows; Up to 10 players Each player has: 64 tiles 200 piece types Up to 20 pieces in play at any time There's a random component on what pieces a player can get (equivalent to a dice roll - plus a choice of one of 4 or don't take any). Everything else is deterministic, you have a limited Heath and you just duke it out 1 v 1 (if there's more than 2 then your opponent is chosen randomly) losing a battle costs you some amount of HP, when it's gone you're out - last one standing wins. I'm not great at working out the number of states (there's 64 tiles, but only a max 20 can be used at once) but in simple terms if each tile could contain any one of the 200 pieces then we have 64^200 right? That's a crazy big number, and from the perspective of training an AI, it's a large enough number that it might as well be infinity. So is there a branch of machine learning that can handle this type of problem, where the state space is so huge that there's no way to look at every possibility? I was hoping to use something like Q learning, an algorithm that's independent of the problem - am I correct that this wont be possible for the described game.
