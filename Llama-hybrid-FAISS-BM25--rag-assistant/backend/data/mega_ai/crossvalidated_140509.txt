Nagelkerke $R^2$ interpretation

I used logistic regression and found that my model fits well: Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.6434 -1.4623 0.8704 0.9013 1.0066 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 0.41595 0.02115 19.67 The chi-squared test is hightly statisticaly significant: p = 9.642755e-48 . I decided to check the Nagelkerke $R^2$ statistic, R2 but it was $R^2 = 0.001350927$. This is unbelievable, why is $R^2$ so small, if my model fits well?
