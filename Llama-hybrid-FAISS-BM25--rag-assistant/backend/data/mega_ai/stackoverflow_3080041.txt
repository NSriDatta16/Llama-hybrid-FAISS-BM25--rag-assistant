How to periodically push data to the user interface in php

i need to implement a simple project using PHP and MySql in which i need to push data to the user's UI when some one else is updating the database, and i need to periodically do this too, so when some one else accessing the same table and modify it, another person who uses the UI can see the updates, sorry if i'm being silly but up to now i'm only aware of saving data to a database and retrieving and showing it to the user(simplest form of data base connection). how can i achieve this in php, please some one help me on this matter, if the answer explains the things in detail it is good, because i'm very novice to this.thanks in advance. rangana.
