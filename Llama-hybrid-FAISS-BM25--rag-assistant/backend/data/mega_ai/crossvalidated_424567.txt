Variant of principal components analysis where only the variance of a single variable counts

Principal components analysis finds the axis(/es) along which the variance of some dataset is maximized. What if I'm in a situation where I have a single dependent variable $v$ that is dependent on $n$ independent variables $v = f(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n)$ and I would like to know "what principal components of $\mathbf x$ cause the most variance in $v$ ?" Is this an answered question already? I feel like it would be just a small modification of the PCA algorithm..
