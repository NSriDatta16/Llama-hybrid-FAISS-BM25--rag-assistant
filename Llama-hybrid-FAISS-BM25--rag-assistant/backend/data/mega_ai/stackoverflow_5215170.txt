As far as I know, you can't use MySQL's REGEXP for substring retrieval; it is designed for use in WHERE clauses and is limited to returning 0 or 1 to indicate failure or success at a match. Since your pattern is pretty well defined, you can probably retrieve the id with a query that uses SUBSTR and LOCATE. It will be a bit of a mess since SUBSTR wants the start index and the length of the substring (it would be easier if it took the end index). Perhaps you could use TRIM to chop off the unwanted trailing part.
