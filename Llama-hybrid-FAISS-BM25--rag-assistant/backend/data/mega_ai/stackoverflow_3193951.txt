Start with HTML, but use a validator. In HTML5, everyone seems to be focusing on the HTML, rather than the XHTML serialisation. As I explain in my answer here , the designers of XML wanted to enforce higher coding standards and making parsing easier, but that only works if almost everybody switches. Instead of relying on your browser to enforce code quality, rely on validation. Due to limited XHTML support in Internet Explorer compatibility guidelines . You could choose what format to serve based on user agent instead, but this is messy. Given the limited advantages, I strongly recommend HTML, especially if you are a beginner.
