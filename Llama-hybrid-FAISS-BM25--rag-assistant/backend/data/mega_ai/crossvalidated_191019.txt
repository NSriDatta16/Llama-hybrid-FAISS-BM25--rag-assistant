Multiple Regression modelling via OLS is useful for cross-sectional data but hardly ever for time series data ( your data ! ) due to potentially correlated observations over time. This fine point ( or not so fine ! ) is hardly ever openly discussed in basic courses as students would just walk out if they knew the limitations of multiple regression when applied to time series data. You might want to look at http://www.autobox.com/cms/index.php/afs-university/intro-to-forecasting/doc_download/24-regression-vs-box-jenkins otherwise entitled "Lies my mother never told me " . In addition to advanced/correct identification of the Transfer Function also known as an ADL OR PDL model one needs to be concerned with level shifts/time trends/seasonal and regular pulses while confirming/ensuring a constant error process and constant parameters over time. Avoid any advice that doesn't mention some of these issues as they are very important.
