help embedding some html in a webpage

I don't know much css or html, so I have a question about taking html that looks like this: html code paste and putting into another page. The problem is when I just copy and paste this into a webpage is completely messes up the background (turns it black) and overwrites other settings. How can I take that exported html and css so that I can paste the code I exported from emacs into a webpage and not kill other settings? Ideally it would appear just as it currently looks but in a little box inside the rest of the page. Thanks.
