I originally thought that Firefox 3 isn't honouring this part of the CSS specification : Several values of the 'display' property make an element block-level: 'block','list-item', and 'run-in' (part of the time; see run-in boxes), and 'table'. I say that because the spec says the following about collapsing margins ... Two or more adjoining vertical margins of block boxes in the normal flow collapse. ...and setting the table's style to display: block makes the margin collapse as you'd expect and setting it back to display: table undoes the collapsing again. But looking at it again, the spec also says this (emphasis mine): Block-level elements ( except for display 'table' elements , which are described in a later chapter) generate a principal block box... Principal block boxes participate in a block formatting context. And then, in the Block Formatting Context section: Vertical margins between adjacent block boxes in a block formatting context collapse. Reading that makes me think it's correct that margins between a table (which doesn't participate in a block formatting context) and a paragraph (which does) shouldn't collapse.
