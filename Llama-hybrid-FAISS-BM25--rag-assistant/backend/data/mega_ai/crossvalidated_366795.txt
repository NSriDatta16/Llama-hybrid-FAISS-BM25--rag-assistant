True or False? Not testing data is needed for CART if there is not future prediction

I am analysing a data set with a relatively a small sample size. For the nature of my data, it is considered already quite large, but for its statistical power it is just in the lower limit. I sampled a population and I am just interested in knowing what characteristics define the individuals. I am using CARTs and GLMEMs to analyse the data. I am quite new to machine learning techniques, but as far as I can understand I could use 100% of my data set for a "training" CART model if I do not have a future prediction to make from my data. I do not need to test with pseudo-R2, right?
