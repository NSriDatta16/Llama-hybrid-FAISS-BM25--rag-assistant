I can see what you mean by being un-elegant, it would be nice if it realised you had a hasOne relationship and therefore updated any existing record. However currently within the framework I think your best option would be to add echo $form->input('Gallery.id', array('type'=>'hidden', 'value'=>$showcase['Gallery']['id'])); to your view. As a side note. In the controller action that is currently defining $showcase if you instead assign it to $this->data then you won't need to always specify 'value' => ... in your form inputs.
