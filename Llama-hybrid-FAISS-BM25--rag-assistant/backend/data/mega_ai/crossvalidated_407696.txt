Do coefficients in moving average process add to 1?

I'm studying weakly stationary stochastic processes, and I'm confused by the title of the "moving average" representation of such a process. Suppose that $y_t$ is a weakly stationary stochastic process, so that it can be written in the following form: $$y_t=\epsilon_t+c_1\epsilon_{t-1}+c_2\epsilon_{t-2}+...$$ where the epsilons are following a white noise distribution. This is supposedly referred to as the MA( $\infty$ ) representation of a weakly stochastic process, but because it is referred to as a moving average , I am inclined to interpret the $c$ coefficients as being weights, in which case I believe they should add up to one. Is this correct?
