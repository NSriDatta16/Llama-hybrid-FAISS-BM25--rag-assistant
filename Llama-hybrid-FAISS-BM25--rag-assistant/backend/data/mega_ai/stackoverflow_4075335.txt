Getting the next specified element in lxml?

I'm struggling trying to parse this html. There are h2s acting as titles for paragraphs. Both are in separate divs, and separated by more divs. The paragraph isn't a child of the h2. I'd like to group them together, but I can't figure how out. I thought find would do it but it didn't work: html = doc.cssselect('h2.title') for para in html: content = para.find('div.content')
