The simplest model to tackle this problem is logistic regression. You can also try Random forests or Support Vector Machines, even Deep learning (although I would not recommend this directly). This is in ascending order of how difficult it is to understand the basic math behind them. All of them can potentially do very well on your problem and cross-validation should be done to figure out what works best in the end for your setup. Also, all of them can output "scores" (e.g. probabilities) instead of binary answers. In general, there are many more possible methods to be applied to such a problem and it's hard to make more definitive statements what works best in the end without trying on the data itself. I would always go for the simplest first (maybe this already fulfils your needs) and then apply more complicated methods later as a comparison to see if you can improve on that baseline.
