I did some searching on this, and I don't think you're going to find a great way to solve this. This post indicates that it may be possible if you "make a new input class, register those events in my games main thread, then start the thread to begin polling." The general consensus from these two threads (including the one you started on the XNA forums) indicates to me that trying to send keyboard input to a different thread probably isn't the best idea, and that, if possible, the main thread should just handle the keyboard input and the other thread can read the input from the main thread's shared storage. An alternative would be the main thread telling the secondary thread to do certain functions based on what input it received. Keyboard access from other thread Keyboard Input on Another Thread
