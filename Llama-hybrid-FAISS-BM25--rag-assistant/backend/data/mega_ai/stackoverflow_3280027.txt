Limit Java Applet to only one instance

I have been using Stackoverflow for a while to find solutions to my programming questions, but for the current question I haven't found a useful solution. So I joined up. What would be a good solution to limit a Java applet to only one instance. I'm using php to serve the applet to the end user, so that would be an option. But I'm much more interested if I can limit the execution of an Java Applet through the Applet itself. I'm pretty new to Java so I don't really know where to start looking for a construction like that. Any suggestions would be appreciated. As a side note, " javascript to launch only ONE window for a Java applet with a given URL " would be a solution. Although I'm embedding the applet into the application I'm building and I'm not really keen on a popup serving the applet. Sincerely, AltWouss Edit: To clarify the instance limit. I would like to have only one applet loaded per machine.
