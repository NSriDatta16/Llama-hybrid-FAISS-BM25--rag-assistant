I was just asked to make a clone of a youtube-like site..

I was asked to make a clone of this: http://www.bragster.com/ Ok, not a clone per se, but a site with similar functionality on a lower budget! How low might one ask? Under 10K, probably under 5K. My question: how do I explain to a non-tech savvy friend, that this is not possible, in the nicest terms, and convince them not to go to rentacoder.com and try to pay someone to not do it for them. Has something like this ever happened to you, and how did you deal with it?
