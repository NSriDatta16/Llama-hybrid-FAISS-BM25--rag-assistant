Boost random numbers - weird compilation error

In a simulation I'm writing I have a class that represents an Agent that must take some actions and I want this agent to have access to a random number generator. I heard boost rng's where good ones, so I wanted to learn how to use them. So, here's the problem. This code compiles and runs perfectly: //Random.cpp #include #include #include #include int main() { int N = 10; boost::lagged_fibonacci607 rng; rng.seed(static_cast (std::time(0))); boost::uniform_real<> uni(0.0,1.0); boost::variate_generator > uniRng(rng, uni); for (int i = 0; i So, I wanted my Agent class to have access to have a private object of type: boost::variate_generator > that can be called when the agent needs a random number. So what I tried to do is: //RandomAgent.cpp #include #include #include #include class Agent { private: boost::lagged_fibonacci607 rng; boost::uniform_real<> uni(0.0,1.0); boost::variate_generator > uniRng(rng, uni); public: Agent() { rng.seed(static_cast (std::time(0))); } void show() { std::cout And I got the following error messages: $ g++ RandomAgent.cpp Random.cpp:10: error: expected identifier before numeric constant Random.cpp:10: error: expected ‘,’ or ‘...’ before numeric constant Random.cpp:11: error: ‘rng’ is not a type Random.cpp:11: error: ‘uni’ is not a type Random.cpp: In member function ‘void Agent::show()’: Random.cpp:18: error: no matching function for call to ‘Agent::uniRng()’ Random.cpp:11: note: candidates are: boost::variate_generator > Agent::uniRng(int, int)
