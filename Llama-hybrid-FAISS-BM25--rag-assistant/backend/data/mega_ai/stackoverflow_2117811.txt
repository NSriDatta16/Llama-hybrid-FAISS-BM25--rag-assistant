Your DLL is not a C# DLL, it's a .NET DLL. Once compiled, all you have is IL - doesn't matter what language it came from. Should be no problem, unless you encounter one of the odd edge cases where the DLL's interface includes something that is not supported by Visual Basic. But this would be very much an edge case. The Common Language Specification, or CLS, defines the subset of .NET features that must be supported by a .NET language, and if your DLL is CLS compliant, then you can use it with no problems. If you are confused about the difference between the CLS, CTS, CLR etc, then I found the coverage of it in this book very helpful, though it is primarily a C# book.
