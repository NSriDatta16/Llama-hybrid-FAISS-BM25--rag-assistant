Personally, I consider PHP coders who aren't well versed in OOP incompetent and/or well behind the times - that shouldn't be your reason for sticking to procedural, at least unless the client will want to change little touches of it but is only atall confident with procedural code. The major advantage of OOP as I see it for PHP is that it encourages both fairly neat coding styles like MVC (or similar) and encourages coders to use & build libraries for common tasks - which means you tend to get a cleaner, easier to maintain solution in much less time and likely with fewer undiscovered bugs.
