mercurial: test whether a branch contains a changeset

I wonder whether there is a mercurial command/extension that just tests whether a given changeset is in a branch. The command would be something like: hg contains [-r branch] changeset_id and should check whether the given changeset is in the current/given branch, returning just "Yes" or "No". I know about the "debugancestor" command, but a "Yes/No" answer is way easier to read. And if there is, is it possible to check for transplanted changesets as well? EDIT: The scenario is located in a repo where named branches have multiple heads. Lets say a branch is named "dev-X", having more than 1 head and a longer history, too long at least to track it with various graph visualizations. I want to figure out whether a changeset X in branch "dev-X" was merged into another head of "dev-X". Therefore I cannot use branch names but only changeset numbers/hashes to specify a branch. And to top it all, I'm trying to find out whether changeset X was transplanted there, possibly taking more than 1 transplantation step. I know that the necessary info is stored in mercurial (I've seen it when tampering with the mercurial internals), it's just not accessible via the command line interface.
