Since you want to do regression with many possibly correlated variables, how about using ridge regression? I believe the R package bigRR can do ridge regression with separate batches of random effects. It's probably better to perform dimension reduction or shrinkage as part of the prediction algorithm, as in ridge regression, than to do it separately and hope your reduced dataset is appropriate for the DV you're trying to predict, as in doing pure PCA followed by regression.
