Show each date only once

All right, this must be an absolutely easy question, and I apologize for that. I also apologize if I simply failed in finding the right search terms to use to come to an answer on my own. I did try, but my lack of fluency in PHP kind of makes me suck at searching. I'm looking for a simple way to show each date only once within a foreach loop. I'm looping through data like so: "; foreach($rss_items as $i){ if($i->get_feed()->get_title() == 'Twitter (no @ replies)'){ echo " "; echo $i->get_date(); echo " get_link()."'>Twitter "; echo $i->get_title(); echo " "; } elseif($i->get_feed()->get_title() == 'Pinboard (jpcody)'){ echo " "; echo $i->get_date(); echo " get_link()."'>Pinboard "; echo $i->get_title(); echo " "; } elseif($i->get_feed()->get_title() == 'Entries at Church Marketing Sucks by Joshua Cody'){ echo " "; echo $i->get_date(); echo " get_link()."'>Church Marketing Sucks "; echo " get_link()."'>" . $i->get_title() . " "; echo $i->get_description(); echo " "; } elseif($i->get_feed()->get_title() == 'Flickr remove first paragraph'){ echo " "; echo $i->get_date(); echo " get_link()."'>Flickr "; echo " get_link()."'>" . $i->get_title() . " "; echo $i->get_description(); echo " "; } } echo " "; ?> And each item contains the date, so I'm getting the same date multiple times. I'd like to only have each date shown once, a la http://daringfireball.net . I'm using CodeIgniter and the SimplePie library, so all of the data is being pulled directly instead of being stored in a db. I imagine a way to do it could be including a second if statement to check if the date has already been used, but I don't know how to execute this. I'm pretty new to PHP, and I'm really looking to learn more than just have a solution given. Any help you could give would be great!
