For sampling (Q2), one approach would be to use a two-stage sampling procedure. Assuming that weekly average prices follows a $N(\mu_\omega, \sigma_\omega)$ it is straightforward to sample $N$ realizations using a random number generator For each realization $i=1,..,N$ , the daily average prices follows a $N(\omega_i,\sigma_d)$ . If you sample $N$ realizations for each $\omega_i$ you will get a scenario tree with $N^2$ leaves But since $W$ is a temporal aggregation of $D$ , you could work directly with the latter. You can sample daily average prices from a Normal Distribution and then estimate weekly averages.
