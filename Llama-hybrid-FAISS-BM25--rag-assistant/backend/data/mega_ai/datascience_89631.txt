The answer will depend on domain. However my guess will be if you are limited to an univariate method then RNN will beat XGBoost. As a data point I've had success with XGBoost in a multiple time series scenario with hundreds of variables. I'd suggest you run the two models head to head and see which one is the winner in your situation.
