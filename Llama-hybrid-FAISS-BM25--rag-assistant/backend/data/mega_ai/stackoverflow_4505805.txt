I don't really know expect, to be honest, but when I run that on my system it "works" fine. Nothing happens, but that's what I'd expect. I don't get any error message. According to the man page, #!/usr/bin/expect -f is the correct way to start your script. Expect then slurps up the script you are executing as the cmdfile. The way I got it to reproduce the problem was to actually put a ^M at the end of the line instead of a normal newline (saw Bert F's response and that prompted me to try it). I'm sure vim's :set list command will show any odd characters.
