Database table design optimise for high volume data

If i were to organise data on tourism and hotel for the continent of Australia and south America can you let me know a best way to do it. Like if i organise the tables thus: continents countries states zipcodes cities destinations hotels lnkhotelszipcodes (in case a hotel exists in multiple places) lnkhotelscities It will be search oriented with countries, states, zipcode, cities and then amenities or features of hotels and tourist destinations
