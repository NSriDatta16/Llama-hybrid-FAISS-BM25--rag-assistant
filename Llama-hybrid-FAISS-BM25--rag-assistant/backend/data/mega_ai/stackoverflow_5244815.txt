PDF page flip/turn software

I'm slowly dying inside with this request but I've been asked to look into PDF page flip's. Does anyone have any suggestions? I've trawled the web but they don't seem to match what I need: Be a piece of software rather than online to cut down on costs (ideally we'd be looking to spend around Â£250). Allow embedding of video, swf's etc. Ability to adjust the look of the viewer. Look semi decent (there's some terrible one's out there). Although not essential, it would be nice if it was iphone/ipad compatible. If anyone has come across any page flip software then I'd really appreciate your input.
