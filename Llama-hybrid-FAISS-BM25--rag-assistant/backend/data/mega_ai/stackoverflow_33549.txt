Personally, I wouldn't. Trackbacks became completely unusable years ago from all the spammers and even Akismet hasn't been enough to drag them back to usable (obviously IMO). The best way I've seen to handle trackbacks any more is to have a function that will turn an article's "referrer" (you are tracking those, right?) into a trackback (probably as a customized comment type). This leverages the meat-space processing that guarantees that no spam gets through and still allows you to easily recognize and enable further discussion.
