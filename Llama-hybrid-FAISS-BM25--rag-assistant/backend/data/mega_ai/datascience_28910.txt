Modeling social media post scheduling optimization

Problem: I want to maximize performance for social media posts by optimizing the time when they are published. Current model: X: publishing_datetime, post_attribute_1, ..., post_attribute_n y: performance Desired model: X: post_attribute_1, ..., post_attribute_n y: publishing_datetime The desired model should predict the optimal publishing_datetime for maximizing performance. Once the data can be modeled like this, the problem is solved with a regression neural network. What I've tried: Filtering the posts with above-average performance and using their attributes and publishing_datetime to form my desired model. This is not ideal as a lot of data is unused and posts with particularly great performance influence just as much as posts with barely above-average performance. Any suggestion on how to achieve this model transition? All ideas and alternative approaches are very welcome. Thanks in advance!
