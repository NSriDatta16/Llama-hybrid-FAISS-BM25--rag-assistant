Simulating from a normal with "unknown" variance

Suppose I want to performing sampling from a normal distribution with an unspecified variance, and I want a way to sample so that I am in some sense "averaging out the possible values of the variance." In other words, I want to use the simulation results elsewhere, and hear results are highly dependent on the variance, and so I want to avoid "favoring" one choice of variance over another. I was thinking maybe I could put a prior on the variance and derive the marginal posterior of the variance given the draws, find the MAP estimate of the posterior, say, $m$, and then simulate again from a $\mathcal{N}(0,m)$ distribution? If not, how else could I do this?
