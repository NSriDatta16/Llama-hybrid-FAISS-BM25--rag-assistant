You can take the predicted values from the incomplete principal components regression model, and predict those predicted values from the original variables. This is one case where stepwise regression can help. Unlike prediction of $Y$ causing much volatility in stepwise methods, predicting combinations of the $X$s from the $X$s is more mechanistic. You might also consider sparse principal components. Here's an example in R: require(pcaPP) # X below = data matrix s
