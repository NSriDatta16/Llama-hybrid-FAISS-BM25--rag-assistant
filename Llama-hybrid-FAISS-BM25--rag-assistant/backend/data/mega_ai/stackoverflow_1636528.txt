Clean CSS is one I tried before. However, for your example of merging rules I highly recommend doing it by hand, because there are situations where any automatic tool could mess something up or not catch an optimization. If you had, for example: border-top: 3px solid red; border-bottom: 3px solid red; border-right: 1px solid red; border-left: 1px solid red; The best way to optimize this is: border-width: 3px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: red; But an optimizer may not catch this. EDIT Tried the above example and Clean CSS didn't cut the mustard. However, FlumpCakes Optimizer is better. It catches your example, but not my advanced example.
