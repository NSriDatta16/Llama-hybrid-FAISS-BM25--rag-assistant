Textbook on reinforcement learning

I am looking for a textbook/lecture notes in reinforcement learning. I'm fond of the "Introduction to Statistical Learning" , but unfortunately they do not cover this topic. I know that a book by Sutton and Barto is a standard reference, and perhaps NDP is also good but they are dated 1997-98, and I was hoping to find a more modern exposition since this field is likely to have quite some development in recent time.
