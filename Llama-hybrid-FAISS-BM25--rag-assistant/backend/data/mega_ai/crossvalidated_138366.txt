You can use Optunity 's cross-validation facilities to generate the folds. Whether or not you want to stratify (i.e. distribute instances of each class equally over folds) depends on you (the software allows it). With unequal numbers of instances per class you can't expect to get a fully equalized coverage in each fold; you'll probably end up with some folds that have one extra instance for a given class compared to others..
