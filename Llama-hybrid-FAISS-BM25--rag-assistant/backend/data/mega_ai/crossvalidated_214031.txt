Are numerical variables must for random forest algorithm?

I am trying to find the variable importance on a credit scoring database. I have categorical inputs as well as numerical inputs. My question is does the random forest algorithm works the same way when I case (1) : give only categorical variables as inputs case (2): both categorical and numerical variables as inputs. By this what I am actually asking is only categorical variables are enough or numerical variables should be included along with categorical variables as inputs to the algorithm...??? Thanks in advance...
