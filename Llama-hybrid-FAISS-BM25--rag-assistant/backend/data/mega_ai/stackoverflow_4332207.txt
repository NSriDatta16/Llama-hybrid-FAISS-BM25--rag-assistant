Same problem here, but with special keys on a wireless keyboard. I feel your pain. Anyway, trying to get this to work, here's my method: sleep 10; killall cat then quickly in another terminal: cat /dev/usb/hiddevice0 > key1.usbdump and press/use the device. This will dump the hiddevice's binary output for that key. I quickly hacked together a Python script to read the hiddevice input and fire events. So far it works for the first time the key is hit. This is similar to what Adam suggested, but I think uinput is more difficult to program/use although perhaps more elegant, and Python is readily available. So this is a work in progress (only works for the first time pressed), but maybe something like this could work for you: sf1 = open("test.usbdump").read() # Read the earlier USB dump from hiddevice kb = open("/dev/usb/hiddev0") while 1: # Prints true if the specific key has been read. print (kb.read(len(sf1)) == sf1) # Basically all that has to be done is if ^ is true, then fire off the event you want. If anyone can help me out with my program or if I'm doing this wrong, please tell me. ;) I realise that there are some headers being included in the initial dump of the hiddevice. Using some bless hexadecimal editing and bit differencing, you could find which values are important and make a check for them in Python. (For example, the hexadecimal digit "B0" means a special function key has been pressed on my keyboard, and later on there is more information on which key was pressed, etc.) My end result is this: hiddevice0 seems to hang and stop giving data after a while, not sure why, but instead, I use /dev/input/event* (it might work for you too), and that seems to work better. Again, the same hexadecimal editing and low-level parsing leads to success. Along the way I found that sudo cat /dev/input/event3 | hexdump is extremely helpful in determining which bytes are important to you. So, if you have an SK-8812 IBM keyboard , and would like to use the special keys, you can talk to me to get the script I used.
