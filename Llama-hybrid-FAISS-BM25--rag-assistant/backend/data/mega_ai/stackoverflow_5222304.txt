You just need to delete the eclipse installation folder. Nothing is "installed" by Eclipse into your system apart from this folder. But I don't think you really need to delete it completely from your file system. Maybe you can give us a more detailed description of your issue for us to be able to point you to an efficient solution. Maybe you only have to restart from a clean workspace or revert the Eclipse installation to a previous state. Anyway if you really want to delete it, pay attention to backup your workspace in case you chose to store it in the Eclipse installation folder.
