I agree with @Franci's response. Collect data to answer questions that you need answers too, don't collect data to ask questions that you just so happen to be able to answer. In general, it is sometimes worth while to log the following: IP (for possible blocking, determining country demographics, tracking use patterns) Datetime (for tracking use patterns) User agent (for determining browser demographics) Page accessed (for tracking use patterns, content popularity, conversion) But! If you're going to do all that, you might as well use Google Analytics ;)
