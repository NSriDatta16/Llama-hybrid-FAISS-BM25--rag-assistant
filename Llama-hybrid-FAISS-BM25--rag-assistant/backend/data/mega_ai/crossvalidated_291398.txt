Is a confidence interval symmetric when constructed on an inverse prediction of a logistic regression?

I have a dataset with a continuous variable paired with a binomial response. We want a one-sided confidence bound to determine at what value of the continuous variable would we get a desired probability. Can we use software that only calculates 2 sided confidence intervals and assume they're symmetric? For example, for a 1 sided confidence bound at 95%, we'd ask the software to calculate a 2 sided interval at 90% and only use the lower bound. My understanding of the Central Limit Theorem would imply that we could, but a coworker says it's not symmetric. Neither of us are statisticians (we're engineers). Thanks!
