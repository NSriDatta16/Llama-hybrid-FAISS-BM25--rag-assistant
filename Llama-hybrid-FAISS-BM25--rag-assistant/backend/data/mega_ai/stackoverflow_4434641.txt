In VB.NET it's possible to set the "option compare" to text to work case-insensitively but I highly discourage it. My favorite is just to use the string.toLower() method when I need to compare insensitively and read the lower case version of the text. Why? Because how else would you compare when case sensitivity matters as it would in some applications?
