I'll also point out that you run the danger of encountering Simpson's paradox when taking the mean of means rather than the overall mean. In general, this paradox describes a situation where a trend is observed in individual groups, but disappears or even reverses when the groups are combined. Take, for example, the batting averages of two baseball players (A and B) over two baseball seasons (1 and 2). It's possible that player A has a higher batting average than player B in each season individually, but that if you look at the overall average over both seasons, player B has the higher batting average. This can occur because the mean of means doesn't properly weight the individual seasons' contributions by the number of at-bats, and instead treats them as equivalent.
