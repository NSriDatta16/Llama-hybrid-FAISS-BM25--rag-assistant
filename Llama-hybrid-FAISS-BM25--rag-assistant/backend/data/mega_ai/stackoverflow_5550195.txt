If you take a look at the documentation of jQuery : $(function () { // Everything here will be called AFTER the DOM is loaded // So it will be called after your widget is loaded // but it will wait that your whole page is loaded. }); But now, if you want the Javascript code to be executed just after the widget is ready and not waiting that the whole page is loaded, the only ( proper ) way I know is to create the widget via Javascript with some DOM manipulation. And doing so, you could use the code given by @Robbert. Then, if you don't mind having a bad code, you can do the javscript just after the HTML widget, but this is awfully wrong and I don't recommend you to do that. // your JS code Based on the three solution given, I would recommend you to generate the Widget directly from javascript. It's better, not intrusive and you don't have to wait that the whole page is loaded.
