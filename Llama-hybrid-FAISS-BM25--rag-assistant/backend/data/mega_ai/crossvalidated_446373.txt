An RNN (or any neural network for that matter) is basically just a big function of the inputs and parameters. There are supervised models which use RNNs, unsupervised models which use RNNs, and semi-supervised models which use RNNs. How something is supervised is generally independent of the architecture used. The most "classic" use of RNNs is in language modeling, where we model $p(x) = \prod_i p(x_{i} | x_{j , and each conditional factor is computed by the RNN. This is an unsupervised model.
