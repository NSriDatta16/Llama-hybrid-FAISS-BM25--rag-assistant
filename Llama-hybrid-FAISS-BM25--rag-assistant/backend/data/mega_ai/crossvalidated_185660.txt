Run-Time difference between linear and RBF kernels in SVM

I'm using kernlab package in R. I trained an SVM using linear kernel and RBF kernel with same data set (the number of instances is 3000). When I use a linear kernel, it takes much longer to train the model compared to when I use an RBF kernel (accuracies are similar). Why does this run-time difference exist?
