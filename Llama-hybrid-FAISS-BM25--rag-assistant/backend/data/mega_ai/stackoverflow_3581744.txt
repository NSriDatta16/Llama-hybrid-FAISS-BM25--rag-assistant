You can get very far with L2S (as StackOverflow has proven), but IMHO Linq2SQL is not well suited (nor intended, I think) for "enterprise level applications". Now that Entity Framework 4.0 has been released, you may want to consider going with EF instead. It supports POCO and will allow you do have a much nicer layered architecture. Check out: The ADO.NET Entity Framework ADO.NET C# POCO Entity Generator I recently ported a substantial code base from L2S to EF 4.0. Since EF now supports lazy-loading, you can have a very smooth transition from L2S to EF, leveraging the advanced features of EF only when you need them.
