Is it possible to use the a aov function in R even when there is no linear dependence between y and x?

In this website I found that the aov function in R answers to the question: We want to know if there is any significant difference between the average weights of plants in the 3 experimental conditions. Can we use it to check if the means of different groups are different even if the dependent variable y does not depend linearly con x? For example if I have a situation like the one in the figure: I made the analysis of variance with ao v function to know if there is any significant difference between the average quantity of mRNA produced in the different experimental conditions. But there is no linear relationship between the mRNA produced (y) and the experimental conditions (x). The p-value that I computed in this way is lower than the significant threshold that I set 0.05. Can I conclude that the there is a significant difference between the average quantities of the different groups ?
