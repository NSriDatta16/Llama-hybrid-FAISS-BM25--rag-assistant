You cannot get a perfect unique identity of a user really. Simply imagine a user that has two separate computers with separate browsers and separate internet connections. You will not be able to identify his two connections as being from the same user. Once you accept this you can go as fancy as you want to. Cookies are generally nice, as although they can be cleared many users don't clear them really. If you are worried about abusive users though, IPs serve you better. Additionally, you could include browsers' user-agent etc. The more different identification clues you include, the harder it gets to spoof the system. However, you should keep in mind, that you can spend a significant amount of effort for that, yet will never get a perfect solution anyways.
