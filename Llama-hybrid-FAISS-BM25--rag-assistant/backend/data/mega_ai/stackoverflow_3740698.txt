The advantages are that you can manage and organize your code more easily and you're able to load only those scripts on the page that are absolutely necessary. The disadvantage, one that I can think of, is that some website performance measuring tools such as PageSpeed and YSlow will warn you about the number of CSS and JavaScript files referenced by a page. Modern web development practices often encourage you to Combine CSS files and Combine JavaScript files to reduce the total number of files required to render a page and improve network performance. Generally speaking, serving one big, bloated file is better than serving 10 small lean-and-mean files because of the overhead associated with requesting a file from the server.
