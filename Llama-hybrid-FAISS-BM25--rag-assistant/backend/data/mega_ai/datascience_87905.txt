Is there a rule of thumb for a sufficient number of trials for hyperparameter search

I am implementing a quite complicated Bayesian hyperparameter search in hyperopt library on a CNN. Is there a rule of thumb for a "sufficient" number of trials? Perhaps based on the number of hyperparameters that constitute the search space?
