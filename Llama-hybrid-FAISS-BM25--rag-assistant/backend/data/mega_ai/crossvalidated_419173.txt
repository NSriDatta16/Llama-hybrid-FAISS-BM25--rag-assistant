I would suggest looking through the functional analysis literature for papers relating to statistics and machine learning. Books aren't where the cutting-edge results are found, and your background will allow you to understand the functional analysis papers. In a few minutes on the website for what appears to be a strong functional analysis journal, I found the following papers. Hangelbroek, Thomas, and Amos Ron. "Nonlinear approximation using Gaussian kernels." Journal of Functional Analysis 259.1 (2010): 203-219. Jenčová, Anna. "A construction of a nonparametric quantum information manifold." Journal of Functional Analysis 239.1 (2006): 1-20. Newton, Nigel J. "An infinite-dimensional statistical manifold modelled on Hilbert space." Journal of Functional Analysis 263.6 (2012): 1661-1681.
