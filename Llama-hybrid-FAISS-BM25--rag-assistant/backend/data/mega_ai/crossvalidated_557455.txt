Conditional independence of dependent variables (D-Separation)

I have given the following Bayesian network and need to evaluate whether q is independent of s given r . I know that the path over the node r is blocked because r is observed. But what about the other direct path? Probabilistically it states P(s|q) , therefore q is directly dependent on s . But does this also apply to conditional independence? I do not have any probabilities given and need to solve the task using D-Separation. The problem is when we want to check if two variables are d-separated, we need to check whether the path is blocked. In the case of the lower path that includes r it is, because r is observed and we have a head-to-tail connection. But what case do we have for the other path? Here we do not have any nodes in between.
