What is the hotkey to jump between split windows in Visual Studio 2008

I've split the code window for a long css file into two sections, top half for viewing one area of code, bottom area for viewing another area of the code. I did this by dragging the splitter on the top right of the code editor to the middle of the editing area. What is the keystroke command that makes the cursor jump from the lower window to the upper window and vice versa? I believe the hotkey is the same as sql server.
