Automating HTML font embedding PHP backend

I understand that css3.0 supports the Font-Face tag, correctly in the latest Opera, Safari, and Firefox browsers, but that Internet Explorer still requires the microsoft .eot format. Is there a reliable way to generate an eot file server side from a .ttf given that the hosting server may not be Windows? I need the entire process automated, to provide a bit of background it is a print product website, part of the process involves designers building templates and uploading fonts for printable products, some of these have editable regions which are rendered to a customer as HTML form elements, however without providing the font it is impossible to provide an accurate real-time preview of the edit. Flash and Javascript techniques wont work as the text is in a textarea or text input field and has to remain editable. So I need a Font-Face linking to the ttf file for compatible browsers, and something else for i.e The question is, how to automate that something else for i.e. Thanks
