The crash report is not symbolicated. I can tel because of the line : 4 MyApp 0x000042e8 0x1000 + 13032 In a symbolicated crash report, this line would show which of your methods the crash ocurred. When you create a release build, the debug symbols are stripped from the binary. You need to save the .dSYM file and Application bundle that were in the build folder after building. These are required to symbolicate crash reports. If you have these files saved, then you need to make sure they're in a location that spotlight can access. If the crash report was sent to you by the user, try dragging it into the Crash Report tab in Xcode's Organizer window. This should attempt to symbolicate the crash report (but will only succeed if you have the .dSYM and app bundle).
