Sometimes a well placed 'goto' is more elegant/readable than other techniques. Putting 'goto's around when they're not needed is certainly a bad practice. As always, each situation should be judged carefully. For example, 'goto's can be nice when your function needs to do cleanups in case it fails. You place a label at the end of the function, where you do your cleanup, then 'goto' it in case of a failure. Nevertheless, 'goto's have become less useful in C# than in C. For example, proper usage of exception handling can obviate the need of 'goto' in some scenarios.
