Simple gui design problem

I have a really simple problem, but I don't find a nice way how I should solve this: I have a TEdit field. When I enter this Edit-Field, I want to show an Panel. When I click on the panel, the panel should hide. When I leave the edit field, the panel also should hide, but I can't use the onExit event of the editField, because this would hide the panel before I can click it. I'm experimenting for a while to solve this, but can't find an elegant way... Any Ideas? thanks!
