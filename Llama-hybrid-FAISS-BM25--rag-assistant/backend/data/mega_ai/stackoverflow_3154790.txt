AlphaTest is only for discarding fragments - not for blending them. Check the spec By using it, you are telling OpenGL that you want it to throw away the pixels instead of drawing them, so you won't can any transparent blending. The most common blending function is glBlendFunc (GL_SRC_ALPHA, GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA); You can also check out the OpenGL Transparency FAQ .
