Binary logistic regression - do i have to perform tests like in multiple regression?

I am a beginner here. I would like to ask if i run binary logistic regression, do i have to do the tests below just like in multiple regression? (1) stationarity of data (2) multicollinearity (3) autocorrelation (4) heteroskedasticity Thank you so much for your help!
