I would recommend not paying, of course. I would also recommend changing the way that the results are reported. "There was insufficient evidence to conclude that an incentive of X was successful at reducing the average time participants got out of bed." Lastly, if the researcher wants to continue down this line of research, there are a couple of ways to change the experiment: Create an experimental design with varying incentive. All that was really proved is that the particular incentive wasn't successful. Trying larger incentives and analyzing the results with a regression might suggest the incentive necessary for a statistically significant result. Try a different type of incentive all together. e.g. cash instead of coupons. Try a different end point. If wake-up time is too variable, maybe try bed time. I don't recommend this, but some researchers will just try the experiment again with a larger sample size under the assumption that the difference really was there, but they didn't have enough sample. I think it is a much better path to success to vary the incentive than just to increase the sample size to find again that there was no significant effect.
