Global sessions are not possible without opening your site up for a gigantic security hole. Instead, let's look at what you want to do, which is grabbing data while avoiding a query every page. 1) Writing the value out to a file and then reading it every request is an option. Sessions are stored in a file on the server by default, so it would have the same speed as a session. 2) Store it in a cache such as APC, Memcache, Redis. Keep in mind these are cached values - you'll still have to update them regularly. You have to use either a cron job or have the client update them. But what do you do when the cache expires and tons of clients are trying to update the cache at once? This is called the dogpile effect and it's something to think about. Or you could just simply write a SQL query and execute it every page and keep it simple. Why don't you want to do this? Have you profiled the code and determined that it's an actual issue? Worrying about this before it's a known problem is a waste of time.
