You will need to create, download, and distribute a new .mobileprovision file, and reconfigure your project to use it: In the iPhone Developer Program portal, add the new devices . Edit your existing ad hoc distribution provisioning profile and check the boxes to add the new devices to the profile. Refresh the Distribution tab for a few seconds until the profile status changes from Pending to Active. Download the modified .mobileprovision file, and install it by dragging it onto the XCode or iTunes icon in your dock. In XCode, right click on your target, do Get Info -> Build, and change your Configuration to Distribution. Change the setting under Code Signing Identity -> Any iPhone OS Device to use your new provisioning profile. Pay close attention to the dates in the list and make sure you use the most recent copy. Distribute the new .mobileprovision file to your users with your next ad hoc build.
