In order to improve your classifier, you have few options. Ensembling - make a group of classifier and let them predict together. Stacking, blending, bagging, boosting. Choice is yours. Hyper parameter tunning - you did not mention your tool, but i suppose that in every solid one is option to search in parameter space to find the best combination Sampling - you can try undersample or create new samples (SMOTE) to give your classifier more data of class which you'd like to predict Feature engineering - get rig of noisy features and work only with those which have an effect on your prediction, consider PCA too Scaling - normalize your data can improve the performance, some classifiers require this Data quality - missing values, coding categorical variables or suspicious values can influence performance
