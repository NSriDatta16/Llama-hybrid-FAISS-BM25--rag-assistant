You need to make the primary key of branch_dim just branch_id and add an index on island_name. Also, are you branch_ids really numeric(18, 0)? If so I would make a surrogate primary key (something that can be auto incremented, int or bigint, identity). As it is, your primary key (and thus clustered index) is very wide. This will degrade performance and I'm guessing, in your scenario, fragment your clustered index (bad).
