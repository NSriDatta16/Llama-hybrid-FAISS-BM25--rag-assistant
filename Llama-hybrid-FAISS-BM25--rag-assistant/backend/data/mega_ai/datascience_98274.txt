Is reinforcement learning suitable for the Dial-a-Ride problem?

Is reinforcement learning suitable for this problem or will it perform poorly against classical algorithms? "The Dial-a-Ride Problem (DARP) consists of designing vehicle routes and schedules for n users who specify pickup and delivery requests between origins and destinations. The aim is to plan a set of m minimum cost vehicle routes capable of accommodating as many users as possible, under a set of constraints."
