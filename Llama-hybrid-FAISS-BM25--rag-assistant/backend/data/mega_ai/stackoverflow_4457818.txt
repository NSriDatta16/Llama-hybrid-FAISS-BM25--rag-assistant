From the log4net site: http://logging.apache.org/log4net/release/faq.html No. log4net is not reliable. It is a best-effort and fail-stop logging system. By fail-stop, we mean that log4net will not throw unexpected exceptions at run-time potentially causing your application to crash. If for any reason, log4net throws an uncaught exception (except for ArgumentException and ArgumentNullException which may be thrown), please send an email to the log4net-user@logging.apache.org mailing list. Uncaught exceptions are handled as serious bugs requiring immediate attention. I personally use it all the time and have never had an issue.
