I am working on one application in which i need to know Unicode of Characters to classify them like Chinese Characters, Japanese Characters(Kanji,Katakana,Hiragana) , Latin , Greek etc . The given string is in UTF-8 Format. If there is any way to know Unicode for UTF-8 Character? For example: Character '≠' has U+2260 Unicode value. Character '建' has U+5EFA Unicode value.
