Yes, that can be done, and is done occasionally. What you have is called "level means coding". For more on this, it may help you to read my answer here: How can logistic regression have a factorial predictor and no intercept? For an example of a case where I found it convenient to use level means coding, see: Why do the estimated values from a Best Linear Unbiased Predictor (BLUP) differ from a Best Linear Unbiased Estimator (BLUE)? There are a couple of things to be aware of when you use level means coding. First, you must suppress the intercept to avoid having perfect multicollinearity; see: Qualitative variable coding in regression leads to “singularities” ). Second, the meaning of the hypothesis tests is different: they are now tests of whether the means differ from $0$, not whether they differ from each other; see: Understanding dummy (manual or automated) variable creation in GLM .
