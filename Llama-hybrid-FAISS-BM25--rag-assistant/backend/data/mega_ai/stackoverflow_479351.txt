How to place smaller tables in Domain & DB along with .NET entities

I have an important Object which have loads of properties. Now few of the properties could have multiple values for example consider, A Channel Object having one or mulitple producers (Now our client think that there could be only few producers like mostly 1 or 2 ). The same issue exist with almost 7 properties. Now i have two solutions; Embed them as link objects in design and create seperate tables in the db hence implementing them as entity (considering each producer a unique). But this solution means this one table will be dependant upon 8 further tables to have this ability. Embed them as link/reference objects in domain but dont create the seperate tables for them instead store them as CSV format and let the DAL to do the access/retrieval logic. Hence saving the space and relations on DB side as well as DAL side. But also having OOP power. Although 2nd solution seems to be appear cheaky and working but it has design limitions and loose flexibility but again client is insisting that they just want free text properties for this nothing else. to further explain the issue the structure could be like that Channel Name, (free text) Vanue, (free Text) ....... Producer1, Producer2...... (each producer is just a name) OpeningDay1,OpeningDay2,..... (each entry is just time slot) etc
