Random Forest Classifiers (RFC) with 100% training accuracy are not necessarily problematic . Make sure you are optimizing your hyperparameters on a separate validation set, this is especially important with RFC because overfitting is more difficult to identify. In the end, you should have a training, validation and a testing set. Other than that, you may be in good shape.
