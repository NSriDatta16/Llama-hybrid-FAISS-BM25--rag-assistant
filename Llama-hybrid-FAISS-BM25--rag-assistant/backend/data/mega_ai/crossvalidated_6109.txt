Is there a SoftMax distribution with confidence parameters?

This is a softmax probability distribution: $$P(i| w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_n) = \frac{exp(w_i)}{\sum_{i=1}^n exp(w_i)}.$$ It known also as Boltzmann distribution. It is used in generalized Bradley-Terry model and in multinomial logistic regression. There are efficient minorization-maximization algorithms for infering $\vec{w}$ from data through Maximal Likelihood principle. I'm looking for similar distribution but extended with "variance" parameter vector. A parameter that would represent the confidence in $\vec{w}$. Then I would like to infer both $\vec{w}$ and its confidence. Does anybody of you happen to know such distribution or a research on the topic?
