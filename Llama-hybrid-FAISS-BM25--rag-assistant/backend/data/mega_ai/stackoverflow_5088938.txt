Convert 2 powershell script to vbscript

We have 2 powershell scripts. The first one is written for Copy the new Files from SAN to NAS storage and delete older files in destination, as follows: $a = Get-ChildItem h:\destination foreach($x in $a) { $y = ((Get-Date) - $x.CreationTime).Days if ($y -gt 6 -and $x.PsISContainer -ne $True) {$x.Delete()} } foreach ($i in Get-ChildItem k:\SourceFolder) { if ($i.CreationTime -gt ($(Get-Date).Adddays(-1))) { Copy-Item $i.FullName h:\destination\ } } and the Second one is for running Windows ntbackup.exe to backup system state and delete older backup files $date = ( get-date ).ToString('yyyyMMdd') ntbackup backup systemstate /J "Backup Job 1" /F "C:\test\$date-backup.bkf" $a = Get-ChildItem c:\test foreach($x in $a) { $y = ((Get-Date) - $x.CreationTime).Days if ($y -gt 6 -and $x.PsISContainer -ne $True) {$x.Delete()} } for security reason I want to use vbscript of these 2 codes for running on my servers. any suggestion we`ll be appreciated
