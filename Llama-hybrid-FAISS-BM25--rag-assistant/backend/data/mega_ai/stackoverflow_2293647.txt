How do I generate coverage xml report for a single package?

I'm using nose and coverage to generate coverage reports. I only have one package right now, ae , so I specify to only cover that: nosetests -w tests/unit --with-xunit --with-coverage --cover-package=ae And here are the results, which look good: Name Stmts Exec Cover Missing ---------------------------------------------- ae 1 1 100% ae.util 253 224 88% 39, 63-65, 284, 287, 362, 406 ---------------------------------------------- TOTAL 263 234 88% ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Ran 68 tests in 5.292s However when I run coverage xml , coverage pulls in more packages than necessary, including python email and logging packages which have nothing to do with my code. If I run coverage xml ae , I get this error: No source for code: '/home/wraith/dev/projects/trimurti/src/ae': [Errno 21] Is a directory: '/home/wraith/dev/projects/trimurti/src/ae' Is there a way to generate the XML for just the ae package?
