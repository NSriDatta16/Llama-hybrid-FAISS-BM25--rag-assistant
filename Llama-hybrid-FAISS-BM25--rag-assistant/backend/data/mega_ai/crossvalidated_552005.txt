Mistake about Covariance on Wikipedia Page for Leverage?

Wikipedia's page for leverage defines the design matrix $X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times p}$ where $n$ is the number of data and $p$ is the dimensionality of each datum, and then, under "Relation to Mahalanobis distance", defines $S := X^T X$ and states that $S$ is the "estimated covariance matrix." I thought that in order for $S$ to be a covariance matrix, we need to (1) de-mean $X$ and (2) divide by the number of data (or potentially the number of data - 1). Is that not the case? What am I misunderstanding?
