Expectation maximisation is an optimisation algorithm for finding the maximum likelihood estimate of certain variables (let's call them "parameters"), while integrating out other variables (let's call them "latent"). It returns one value of the parameters. Expectation propagation is an algorithm for approximating the posterior distribution of all random variables (parameter and latent) in a Bayesian network. Baum-Welch gives you a point estimate for the parameters of a Hidden Markov Model. EP can give you an approximate posterior over the parameters. EP is not a special case of EM. You could think of EM as a special case of EP, where you deliberately throw away uncertainty about the parameters at each step.
