Here's my hack-y workaround. I unpack the WSDL from the jar and write it to a file near the jar: File wsdl = new File("../lib/service.wsdl"); InputStream source = getClass().getResource("resources/service.wsdl").openStream(); FileOutputStream out = new FileOutputStream(wsdl); byte[] buffer = new byte[512]; int read; while((read = source.read(buffer)) >= 0) { out.write(buffer, 0, read); } Then point the service classes to file:../lib/service.wsdl . This works, but I'd appreciate if anyone can show me a more elegant solution.
