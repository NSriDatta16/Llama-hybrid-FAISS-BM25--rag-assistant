You have several issues. For one, these three coefficients are not significant, basically, indistinguishable from zeros at 95% confidence (see the t-stats). Second, two of your correlations are also not significant, i.e. indistinguishable from zeros. Third, your correlations are unconditional, i.e. they do not take into account what's going on with other variables. Imagine this, you have two variables: age and sex (1-male, 0- female). Your dependent is salary. So, you compute correlation of salary and sex, and it comes negative. It surprises you. So, you run a regression of salary ~ sex + age. The coefficient on sex comes positive as expected. What's the matter? It turns out in your sample male were younger in average. So, when you run a regression and controlled for age, the sex coefficient came out right.
