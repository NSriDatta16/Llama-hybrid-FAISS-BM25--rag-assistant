credentialcache.defaultcredentials returning wrong user credentials

I have a ASP.NET Website (.NET 2 IIS 5.1) running on machine A with Integrated Windows Authentication enabled. It has a user Automation. When I connect to it from machine B with user 'Ganesh', I am prompted to enter username & password (by IE itself). CASE 1: If I DONT save the credentials using remember my password option: I get connected to the website.However later internally I need to connect to a webservice to get some details (via code). To to that, the code first sets the credentials to default credentials. statusService.Credentials = CredentialCache.DefaultCredentials; Now here the logged in user 'Ganesh' credentials are passed for some reason. (I found that using logon audits logging at the server) Hence when I call the service: m_LicenseStatus = statusService.GetLicenseStatus(out m_dNoEvalDays); I get HTTP 401 Unauthorized exception. CASE 2: If I save the credentials using remember my password option: 'Automation' user credentials are passed & the call is successful. Hence my question is why do I need to save the credentials? It is a necessity or have I missed something?
