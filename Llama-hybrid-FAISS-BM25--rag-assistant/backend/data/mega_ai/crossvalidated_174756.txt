Neuron vs. unit in a neural network

In the context of machine learning, is there any difference between the terms unit and neuron ? I have read that some people prefer to use the term unit as neurons in an ANN have little in common with neurons in the human brain (see quote below). Is there any other difference? Quote from Michael A. Nielsen, "Neural Networks and Deep Learning", Determination Press, 2015 (Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported License.) The origins of convolutional neural networks go back to the 1970s. But the seminal paper establishing the modern subject of convolutional networks was a 1998 paper, "Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition", by Yann LeCun, LÃ©on Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. LeCun has since made an interesting remark on the terminology for convolutional nets: "The [biological] neural inspiration in models like convolutional nets is very tenuous. That's why I call them 'convolutional nets' not 'convolutional neural nets', and why we call the nodes 'units' and not 'neurons' ". Despite this remark, convolutional nets use many of the same ideas as the neural networks we've studied up to now: ideas such as backpropagation, gradient descent, regularization, non-linear activation functions, and so on. And so we will follow common practice, and consider them a type of neural network. I will use the terms "convolutional neural network" and "convolutional net(work)" interchangeably. I will also use the terms "[artificial] neuron" and "unit" interchangeably
