How to simplify array value initialization

Several times a day I run into a problem where I need to dynamically initialize variables in a multidimensional array to prevent PHP throwing a notice because of an uninitialized variable. Code fragments like this are very common: if(!isset($profile[$year][$month][$weekday][$hour])) { $profile[$year][$month][$weekday][$hour] = 0; } $profile[$year][$month][$weekday][$hour] += $load; Or: $profile[$year][$month][$weekday][$hour] = isset($profile[$year][$month][$weekday][$hour]) ? $profile[$year][$month][$weekday][$hour] + $load : $load; That looks awful and is a pain to write, also makes maintaining quite hard as these fragments are abundant. Does anyone have any ideas how I could simplify such a task? I thought of creating a reference $r to $profile[$year][$month][$weekday][$hour] to reduce redundancy, but it will also throw a notice if not initialized properly. Initializing the array beforehand isn't feasible as not all keys will be used and I'd like to avoid unnecessary keys. Any tips?
