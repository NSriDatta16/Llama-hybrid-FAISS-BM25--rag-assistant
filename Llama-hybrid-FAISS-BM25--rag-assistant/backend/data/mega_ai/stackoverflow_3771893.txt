Check out http://discuz-android.blogspot.com/2008/01/about-google-android-emulator.html The emulator is open source, you should be able to download the code and modify it any way you wish. The link to the source is http://android.googlecode.com/files/android-emulator-m3-rc37.tar.bz2 I would seriously discourage trying to create an emulator from scratch. It would be nearly impossible without a large team with a lot of Android knowledge.
