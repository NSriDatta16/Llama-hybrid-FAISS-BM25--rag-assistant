SQL databases are relational databases. Relational databases are currently the king of the hill with respect to data storage and retrieval (including program objects), except for the noSQL movement, which deals primarily with extremely large datasets. To assist in the translation process between objects and relational tables, most programmers use some sort of Object Relational Mapper like Linq to SQL or nHibernate. This greatly reduces the effort required. There are object oriented databases that can read and write object instances directly, but these have not caught on in the mainstream because of difficulties in reporting and retrieval of data across many objects.
