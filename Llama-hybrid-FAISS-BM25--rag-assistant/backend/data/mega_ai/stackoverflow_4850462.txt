How do I upload reviews in bulk to Magento via .CSV

I work for a company who recycle books on behalf of charities. We are attempting to create a book store using the Magento ecommerce system. We have managed to upload books and images with a .CSV file, but I can not figure out how to upload reviews in bulk. We will be utilising Nielsen Record Supply, and so will be downloading something in the region of 10,000 reviews, so I would presume .CSV would be the best way of going about this. Is it possible to store them in the installation folder somewhere perhaps? Thank you.
