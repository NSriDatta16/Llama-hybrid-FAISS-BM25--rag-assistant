Mobile Devices Architecture - iOS, Android, WP7 and Disconnected Instances

I am seeking some architecture advice within the mobile space. I am wondering what people are today within their applications, say for the iOS, Android, WP7 devices, in terms of web services and instances for caching data when disconnected? Many of our applications need to work offline due to having limited connectivity, so data storage/caching, synchronization, etc. is critical. Any and all advice will be greatly appreciated.
