What exactly does the word "align" mean in the attention model?

I'm reading the famous attention model paper Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate (Bahdanau, Cho, & Bengio, 2014) and I'm having trouble what the exact meaning of "align" is in this context. I've read this Quora answer which does a great job explaining the overall model, but doesn't address what this word means in this context. I'm asking because it seems to have a different meaning than the conventional definition of putting things in a straight line. Would anyone be kind enough to explain the meaning to me? Thank you.
