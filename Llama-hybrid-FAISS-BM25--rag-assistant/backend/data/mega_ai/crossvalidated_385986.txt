Fitting model on whole dataset, more or less epochs ? (w.r.t validation accuracy)

When tuning my neural networks hyperparameters I use 20% of the data set as validation data. With the holdout set I observe the validation accuracy and validation loss. In my case the model starts overfitting after 150/300 epochs, so with early stopping I dump the model state at 150 epochs. When fitting the final model where 100% of the data is used instead of 80%, should I assume the overfit might occur again at ~ 150 epochs, or could I continue training, or, stop earlier? (The other hyperparameters have been tuned seperatly)
