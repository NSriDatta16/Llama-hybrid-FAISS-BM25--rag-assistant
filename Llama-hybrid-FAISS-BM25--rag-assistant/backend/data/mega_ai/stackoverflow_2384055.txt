I ended up using a local development environment in conjunction with an integration environment. Synchronizing a local folder with a remote folder turned out to be too fragile and difficult. The development environment and integration environment require a fair amount of setup and co-ordination. Ultimately though, it is worth the effort to have a proper development, integration and production environment work flow set up.
