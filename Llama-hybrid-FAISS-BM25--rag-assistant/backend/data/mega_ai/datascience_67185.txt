How to approach a new data set with no dependent variable

Basically I am taking a small course in data science. And one of our first assignments are that we have gotten a pretty huge data set (hundred of thousands of samples, and roughly 150 independent variables). There is no response variable in this, but the assignment is pretty much: "Find something that are interesting". Which I obviously kind of broad. My questions is: How would/should you/I approach this ? Up until now I have just cleaned the data set as good as I can. Removed variables I don't think make much sense, made sure there are no NaN variables, and stuff like that. But what would be the next step in order to "find something useful" in a data set that may or may not contain anything interesting?
