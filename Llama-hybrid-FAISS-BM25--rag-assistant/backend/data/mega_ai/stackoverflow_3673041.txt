What testing frameworks are used for Rails?

What unit testing frameworks are used for Rails? I am reading the book (Pragmatic Programmers Agile Dev. with Rails) which shows how to do unit tests in Rails. The book showed me the default rails testing suite (a subclass of Test::Unit ). Is this the main testing framework that is used in the Rails community? I use RSpec when doing regular ruby, and I would like to be able to use it in Rails too (if it's not too much of a hassle)?
