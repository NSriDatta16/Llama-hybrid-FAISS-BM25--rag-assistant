I figured out it didn't have to do with the validation. It was when the date was being parsed back to the datetime. This may not be the most elegant way to do this, but it does work. If anyone knows a better way, please let me know. I have this code now. public static void FormatDate(MaskedTextBox c) { c.DataBindings[0].Format += new ConvertEventHandler(Date_Format); c.DataBindings[0].Parse += new ConvertEventHandler(Date_Parse); } private static void Date_Format(object sender, ConvertEventArgs e) { if (e.Value == null) e.Value = ""; else e.Value = ((DateTime)e.Value).ToString("MM/dd/yyyy"); } static void Date_Parse(object sender, ConvertEventArgs e) { if (e.Value.ToString() == " / /") e.Value = null; }
