using where clause in ObservableCollection

private ObservableCollection _Organizations = new ObservableCollection (); private ObservableCollection _OrganizationManagement; _OrganizationManagement = new ObservableCollection (_Organizations.Where(p => p.Type == "DealerGroup").ToList()); GridOrganizationManagement.ItemsSource = _OrganizationManagement; I have main list _Organizations I want that _OrganizationManagement contains filter list of "DealerGroup". But problem is using above _Organizations and _OrganizationManagement are not sync when after this code I add value in _Organizations it doesnot add in _OrganizationManagement what i have understand we are filtering it with new ObservableCollection so new instance is pass to _OrganizationManagement
