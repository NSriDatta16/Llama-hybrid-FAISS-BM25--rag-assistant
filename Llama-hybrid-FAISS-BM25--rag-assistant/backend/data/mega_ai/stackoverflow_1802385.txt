Extension methods are just a language feature. They work on object instances and are very nice tool. Consider them as a different way to extend class functionality. You can add new functionality to a class: By adding a partial class declaration. The class then instantly gets a bunch of new methods and properties. By including a namespace with your extension methods holder class. The class then gets a bunch of new methods again. Rather an organizational / language feature. Does not break object-oriented concept in any way. Just as header/source file division in C/C++ has nothing to do with object-orientation, just a language/framework feature.
