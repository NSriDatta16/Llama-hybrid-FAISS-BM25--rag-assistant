Creating dummy variables to match fitted model at inference

I have built a machine learning classifier using Sklearn and pandas as my main tools. Now, one of the input features to the model is country (to letter country code such as US). I have fit a model using the pd.get_dummies function. Now I want to run inference on the data but a few of the countries haven't appeared in my dataset over the past months, so the pd.get_dummies function is misaligned with the fitted model. How can this dealt with?
