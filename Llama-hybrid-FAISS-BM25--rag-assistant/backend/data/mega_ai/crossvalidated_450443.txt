ACF and PACF with daily data

I am modeling with daily time series and some forecasting models from forecast package.But at the beginning I have some problem with time series.Namely I want to try to explain ACF and PACF but I can't find rational explanation in order to explain how seasonality (single or complex) can be spotted (daily,weekly,monthly etc.). In my opinion I think this series have daily and weekly seasonality but I am not sure. So can anybody help me with this graphs ?
