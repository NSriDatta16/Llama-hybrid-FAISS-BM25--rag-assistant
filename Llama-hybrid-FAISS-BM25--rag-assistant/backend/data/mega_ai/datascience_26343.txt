I like the Machine Learning definition given by Tom Mitchell . A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. So, given this definition, I should say that a model is the acquired experience after doing some task T.
