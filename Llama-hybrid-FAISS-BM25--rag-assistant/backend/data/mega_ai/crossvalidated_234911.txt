What is the reason behind major difference in selection of mtry in RandomForest for Classification & regression?

The default /recommended value of mtry is P/3 for regression task while it is SquareRoot(P) for a classification task. ( where P is number of variables) As per my understanding the fundamental idea behind RF is using smaller subset of variables in Random Forest is to create weak & diverse classifiers and aggregating them into one stronger classifier. But I could not find any specific documentation on why a regression task has default of P/3 instead of SquareRoot(P) . Is it something specific to Random Forest?If so what is it? OR Is it more fundamental like difference between performance/construction of regression/classification trees which dictates RF. I'm not looking for a complete simplified answer, just point me to right literature links :) Thanks!
