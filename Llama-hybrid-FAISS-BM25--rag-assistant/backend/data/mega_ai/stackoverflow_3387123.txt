Drag and drop the database or formula field you want into the detail section of the report. (Remove any unwanted guidelines / column headings that this generates.) Right-click the inserted detail section item and select Insert > Summary... . Specify Sum, to be inserted in the same section as the datagrid is located. (Remove the detail section item, if you don't want it in the detail section.) The total field can be dragged and dropped into position under the data grid. If you specifically want it in a text field, then insert a blank text field into the report under the data grid and then drag and drop the total field into it.
