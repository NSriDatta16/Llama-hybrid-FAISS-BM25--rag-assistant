Managing DB Changes in a C# Project

I have a C# app (in VisualStudio 2010) that used SqlServer 2005 accessed through TableAdapters in C#. I haven't discovered a good way to manage DB changes. For example, in my next release I have a bunch of db schema changes. I made all of my DB changes in Sql Server Management Studio. But now I have to manually make these changes on the production servers in turn after I deploy the new application code (slow and buggy). Furthermore, if I decide to roll back my release to a previous version, I have to manually go through and undo all my db changes before I can deploy the old code (and now I am under time constraints because the app is down). Again, this is also very error prone. Oh, and lets hope that one of my errors doesn't cause massive destruction to the production DB, otherwise I now have to pull the most recent backup out of storage and try again (very time consuming). I have heard of things like Migrations from Rails (and ORMs like SubSonic). I think that the new ORM style (define your schema in c# code) helps alleviate a lot of this, but unfortunately, as I am using TableAdapters, I don't see how I could implement something like migrations. How do people deal with this?
