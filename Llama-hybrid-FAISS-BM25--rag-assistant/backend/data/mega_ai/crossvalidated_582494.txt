The condition of independent identical distributions (iid) refers to the $(x,y)$ data points. Independence means: $$ p((x_i, y_i), (x_k, y_k)) = p((x_i, y_i)) p((x_k, y_k)), $$ i.e. the sampling of $(x_i, y_i)$ doesn't give us any information about the sampling of $(x_k, y_k)$ , given the distribution. And the identical distribution part says, that $(x_i, y_i)$ and $(x_k, y_k)$ have been sampled from the same distribution. On the other hand, the stationarity requirement in time series, where the $x_i$ are just consecutive integers, is referring to the mean and autocovariance of the $y$ values, requiring those to be constant. In particular, $y_i$ and $y_k$ can still be dependent, as long as this dependence doesn't change. Thus, both non-stationary and stationary time series (usually) violate the iid requirement.
