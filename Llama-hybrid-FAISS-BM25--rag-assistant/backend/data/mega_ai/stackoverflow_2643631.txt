iPhone UIScrollView, Slow down the scrolling

How do I add some extra drag to the UIScrollView physics. It scrolls just a little too fast for what I am doing. (I don't want to disable altogether, I still like the rubber band effect when you get to the end or beginning of the view.) Is there any way to slow it down?
