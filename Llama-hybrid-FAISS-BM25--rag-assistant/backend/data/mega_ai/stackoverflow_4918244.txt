Find line number where a substring is found in a large string in Perl

What is the best way to search for the line number for a substring in perl string? For e.x.: Searching for "escape" in "How to Format ► put returns between paragraphs ► for linebreak add 2 spaces at end ► _italic_ or **bold** ► indent code by 4 spaces ► backtick escapes `like _so_` ► quote by placing > at start of line ► to make links [foo](http://foo.com)" should give 6 as the line number.
