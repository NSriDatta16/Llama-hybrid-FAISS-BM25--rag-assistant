This is somewhat unrelated to your question, but: One thing I would recommend is to be cautious with descendant-based or child selectors (e.g.: 'div.product > span.price'). Often, UI parts are being reorganized, moved around or wrapped with something else. When it happens, descendant-based selectors break. Another thing to keep in mind is that attribute-based selectors (e.g.: 'input[value="Login"]') are often fragile when dealing with localized content (if attribute values are localized).
