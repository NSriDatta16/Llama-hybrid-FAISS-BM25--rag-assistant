Pydev Undefined Variable "list"

Every now and then when I try to add a new library using easy_install, my PyDev acts incredibly strange. In fact, I am certain I dealt with this exact issue before, but am unsure how I did it. I have a PyDev project set up in aptana studio, and I reconfigured the python interpreter. Once I did this, I cleaned the project and code analysis just starts hanging on one file for a long time. It does eventually finish, but it marks almost all of the builtin types as errors, such as "dict" or "list", saying undefined variable. I have a fairly large codebase that I like to frequently refactor, so I need to be able to leverage PyDev's code analysis feature, but it's obviously not working. I think the solution has something to do with forced builtins, but I've found nothing really useful there yet. Any help?
