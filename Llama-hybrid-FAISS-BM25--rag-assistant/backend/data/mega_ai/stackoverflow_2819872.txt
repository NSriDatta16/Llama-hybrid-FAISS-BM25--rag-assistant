One interesting option I've seen is to use the English strings themselves as the keys: // General 'CMS - USA / English' => 'CMS - USA / English', 'Save' => 'Save', 'Choose category' => 'Choose category', ... Some points to note: This makes the application code more readable, and more transparent to the developer. The developer might not notice that cms.styles incorrectly appears as Stylists in the app. But 'Styles' => 'Stylists' stands out like a sore thumb, particularly to a one-line auditing script. It is more fragile, since changes to the English text affect all the other language files. It should fail quite noisily, however, so it's easy to spot. It is more robust, since the production system can trivially fall back to the English text if testing failed to spot an omission. You don't have to repeat terms like Category just because they appear in different places.
