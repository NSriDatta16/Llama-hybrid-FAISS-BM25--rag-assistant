Query regarding dsn string

Below is the code to fill a list box in a VBA application : Private Sub Form_Open(Cancel As Integer) ''#Populate list box control. Dim cnn As ADODB.Connection Dim strSQL As String Dim rst As ADODB.Recordset Dim strList As String On Error GoTo ErrHandler ''#Use DSN to Northwind. ''#Modify connection and connection string as needed. Set cnn = New ADODB.Connection cnn.Open "DSN=NorthwindExample" strSQL = "SELECT * FROM Shippers" Set rst = New ADODB.Recordset rst.Open strSQL, cnn strList = rst.GetString(adClipString, , ";", ",") Debug.Print strList Me.lstShippers.RowSource = strList rst.Close cnn.Close Set rst = Nothing Set cnn = Nothing Exit Sub ErrHandler: MsgBox Err.No & ": " & Err.Description, vbOKOnly, "Error" Set rst = Nothing Set cnn = Nothing End Sub I need to know what i need to put as DSN string? Where will I get the info? What is adClipString here in this code? Is there any option to populate list control without using DSN connection object since I am taking the values from the same access table?
