For clarification: mean,max,min,std are not "time series features", they are data features in general. Assuming that you want to do it in python, you should take a look at pandas.DataFrame class. Once you initialize a Dataframe object with your tabular data, you can call its methods DataFrame.min() , DataFrame.max() , DataFrame.mean() , DataFrame.std() for your purpose. You can insert all these calculated characteristics into a new DataFrame and thereafter call Dataframe.to_csv() to export them in a csv file.
