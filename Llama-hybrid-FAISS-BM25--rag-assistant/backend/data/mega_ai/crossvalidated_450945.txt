In this study See et al created a three level measure as follows: I thought you can use the low-level metrics(namely repetition by n-gram overlap, specificity by normalized inverse document frequency, the response-relatedness you mentioned and question asking by counting the ? symbol) to automatically measure the quality of the generated sentences. There are some other methods: the portion of the same generic answer, unsafe responses containing some keyword or patterns(for instance coarse language and etc), adversarial discriminator. You can also train a generic language model and use that to see the perplexity, and in this paper , the author states that perplexity correlates very well with human judgment.
