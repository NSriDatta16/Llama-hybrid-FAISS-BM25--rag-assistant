Some examples: image models from huggingface that can be used as image encoders, like clip-ViT from sentence-transformers in Pytorch/Tensorflow in Tensorflow/PyTorch you can manipulate CNN models by dropping some layers. In PyTorch models that are based on torch.nn.Sequential are easy to manipulate, like in this code .
