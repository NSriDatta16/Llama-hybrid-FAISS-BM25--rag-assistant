Sorry, You are going to need to do this on your own. I am not a PHP person, but in SQL: If you create a transaction and do several MySQL operations within the transaction, if you rollback the transaction everything will be rolled back. NOTE: You need to be using a transactional storage engine and autocommit must be set to off. If all you are concerned about is the transaction coordination traffic then you could create a stored procedure and simply call it. The reason the database does not automatically commit or rollback is because it does not know what you are trying to do, committing some data and rolling back other data might be acceptable in an app.
