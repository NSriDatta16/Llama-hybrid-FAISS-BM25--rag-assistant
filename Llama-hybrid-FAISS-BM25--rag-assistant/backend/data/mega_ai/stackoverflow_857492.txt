Layout of ComboBox items

I have ComboBox item style as follows (simplified): The result is as expected. An item in my list looks as follows: alt text http://robbertdam.nl/share/p1.png Howver, when I select that item. It looks like this: alt text http://robbertdam.nl/share/p2.png I want to have the stars right aligned. What am I missing?
