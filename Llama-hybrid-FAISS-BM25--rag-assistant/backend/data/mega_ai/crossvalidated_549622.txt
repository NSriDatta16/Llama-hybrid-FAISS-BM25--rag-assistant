There is a lot of literature on point forecast error measures for time series forecasting. Different error measures will be minimized by different forecasts! Thus, you should first decide which functional of the unknown future distribution you want to elicit, then use an appropriate error measure that does this. More info in Kolassa (2020, IJF ) , apologies for the self-promotion.
