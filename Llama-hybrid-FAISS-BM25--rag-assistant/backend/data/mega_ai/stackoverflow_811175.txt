I've extended MembershipUser and created my own version of the SqlMembershipProvider to map to my existing domain, and its working well, in production now. MembershipUser is essentially a view over my User table. My extended MembershipUser class includes profile/account-style properties instead of using the default SqlProfileProvider system, which is a bit fragile. I wasn't able to use the existing membership tables or sprocs, but wrote my own. For example, the SqlMembershipProvider uses a GUID as an opaque key, but the production system uses a plain old int. All of the dates are UTC, etc. too. All of the extra User functionality is accessed via the User domain not via Membership methods. HTH.
