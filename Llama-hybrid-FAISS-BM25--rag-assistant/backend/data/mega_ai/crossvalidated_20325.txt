As Jack Tanner said, please tell whether you're dealing with a regression or a classification problem. May I infer you're working with some data retrieval problem, and using an ANN with logistic output? If I'm correct, estimates above 0.5 are classified as pertaining to the class (=1) by the book. One way to get around the biased learning is to split your image set into equipropable classes. If you can't do that, then try to feed more training samples to your machine, eliminate both noisy and sparse features for starters. Good luck!
