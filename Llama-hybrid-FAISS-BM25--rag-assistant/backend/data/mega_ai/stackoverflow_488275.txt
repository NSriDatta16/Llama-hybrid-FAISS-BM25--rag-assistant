Which browsers support font embedding

I've been reading about the @font-face rule and trying to work out if it's worth using it in a project to render "franklin gothic medium" for title instead of something like sIfr. I figured that for browsers that don't support it I could make it fall back on Arial. The thing is that I'm having trouble getting a definitive answer about which browsers support embedding fonts in this way. So far I've worked out the IE does, but doesn't support .ttf files. Other browsers I'm not sure. If anyone could point me towards some kinf of compatibility chart that would be great. Jon
