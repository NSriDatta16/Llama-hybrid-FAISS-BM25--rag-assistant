Cronbach's alpha, When to use it

I am a bit confused about the use of Cronbach Alpha. I have a questionnaire I administered to 20 respondents. I have gotten the data back from the survey. I am told I need to do an Internal consistency analysis of the questionnaire which is basically a test of its reliability. This is where I get confused. 1) Am I using Cronbach Alpha to test for internal consistency of the questions in the questionnaire before the survey or am I testing the data I got from the survey in the completed questionnaire for internal consistency using Cronbach Alpha? 2) If I am testing the questions in the questionnaire without any data from respondents how do I do the cronbach alpha test?? 3) Do I really need to do a cronbach alpha test or is there another test for internal consistency?
