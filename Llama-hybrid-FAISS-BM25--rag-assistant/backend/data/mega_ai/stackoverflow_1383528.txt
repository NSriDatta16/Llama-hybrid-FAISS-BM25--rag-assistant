Capturing all multitouch trackpad input in Cocoa

Using touchesBeganWithEvent, touchesEndedWithEvent, etc you can get the touch data from the multitouch trackpad, but is there a way to block that touch data from moving the mouse/activating the system-wide gestures (similar to what is done in the chinese text input)?
