I can speak only to gotchas. While I'm pretty happy with git, I do confess that there can be a lot of unpleasant surprises, like trying to push to a repo with a checked-out working directory, or the fact that when you clone a repo you don't always get all the branches. Subversion is a more mature, organic, unitary design. I personally can't live without the distributed features that git provides, but there are definitely fewer gotchas with svn.
