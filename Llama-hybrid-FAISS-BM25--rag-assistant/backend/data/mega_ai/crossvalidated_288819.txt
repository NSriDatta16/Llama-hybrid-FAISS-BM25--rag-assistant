Using categorical variable in Conditional Logistic Regression

I have a set of data with lots of events and I want to try and predict the outcome of the event. I have built a basic conditional logistic regression model but I want to add categorical variables that describe the event. When I add them in either as binary [1,0]'s or factors they are removed, presumable this is because of the the 'conditional' part of the regression. Here is a very simple example: library(data.table) library(mclogit) dt In my example x2 is the categorical variable. How do I code up the categorical variables so I can use them?
