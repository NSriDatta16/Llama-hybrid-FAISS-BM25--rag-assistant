I implemented a solution now based on your previous answers around Maven 2. It is still not very easy to use but so far it goes OK. The implementation is as follows: 1. Modified my parent pom to generate cobertura instrumented classes when giving a specific profile.This generates the .ser files and the instrumented classes. 2. The instrumented classes are copied to the /target/classes folder by using the maven-resource-plugin, so the actual packaging uses the instrumented classes. 3. As there is no module wide .ser file i manually combine those .ser files from the EJB,WAR,JAR and ear file using the commandline solution given by Cobertura. coberture-merge.bat/.sh 4. Deploy the .ser file into my JBoss container and also deploy the instrumented EAR. 5. After testing i run a report on the merged .ser file and voila.. it seems to work.. I surely will look into Clover as the solution implemented is somewhat manual..
