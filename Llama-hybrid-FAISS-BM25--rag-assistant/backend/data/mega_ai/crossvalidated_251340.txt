It might be helpful to look at a plot of the %variance explained vs Component number. If PC1 explains a lot more of the variance than any other component, it may be necessary for clustering of your data. Also, PC1 may contain the important information that is differentiating your groups. PCA is looking at variance in general, so higher components are possibly capturing smaller deviations (such as those within a group).
