Have a look at document fragments. John Resig DOM DocumentFragments and MDC . I'm not sure if it is cross-browser...maybe someone can clarify for me? EDIT: don't know what I was thinking Have you tried: var canvas = document.createElement("canvas"); canvas.... containerElement.appendChild(canvas.cloneNode());
