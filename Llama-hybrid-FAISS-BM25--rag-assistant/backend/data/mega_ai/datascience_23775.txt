You should choose mean or average over median. Let me explain why, specifically in your case since you're checking for expected computational time. Mean or average could be one of the three cases. Equal to the median Greater than the median Lesser than the median Now if it is equal to the median there is no problem in choosing whichever value but in real time it's most likely to follow the other two cases. The reason the mean is greater or lesser than the median, in this case, is because it skews to either higher computational time or lower computational time. What this skew represents is you could say where the most likely frequency of computational times would be. This implies it gives a more normalized approach and it shows where you can expect the computational times of most of your execution runs expected to be. So choose mean over median.
