I suggest going back to basics and using a measure that is tailored to binary responses. If two binary responses $A, B$ are independent then $\Pr(A=a, B=b) = \Pr(A=a)\times \Pr(B=b)$ . You can use $\Pr(A=1,B=1) - \Pr(A=1)\times\Pr(B=1)$ as a measure of dependence of $A$ and $B$ . This is estimated by computing the average product of the binary responses minus the product of the averages. This is like the numerator of a Pearson correlation coefficient. This is implemented in the R Hmisc package varclus function - see similarity='bothpos' or 'ccbothpos , the latter being what I described above. You can print the similarity matrix and varclus uses it to cluster the variables.
