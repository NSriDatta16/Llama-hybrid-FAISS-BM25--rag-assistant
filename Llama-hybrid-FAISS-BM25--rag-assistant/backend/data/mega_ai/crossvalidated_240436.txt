I can only guess by your affirmations that your question is on a multivariate setting, it will always depend on your data and the problem you are looking to tackle. Domain experience it's the best way to accomplish this task but on very very large datasets it can be prohibitive.. if that's the case and you have plausible reason to acknowledge co-linearity then dimensionality reduction techniques can help (principal component analysis, factor analysis, manifold learning). If it can be applied please do try to apply a penalty to your objective function, namely a L1/Lasso penalty, a laplacian prior. Regarding your comment about the amplitude of the weights it does make sense but it's a naive way to judge the importance of each variable, two variables can have really high value when combined (interactions) and close to none if used alone.. if you are considering a non linear model or interactions take that into account.
