It seems that the API of CTP5 doesn't offer such possibility. What we succeed to do, is to let the ModelBuilder build its MetaDataWorkspace with the wrong key. Then, once it is built, in the objectContext, we searched in the SSPace , the storage of Physical entities (tables and columns), then, by reflection, changed the name of the metadataproperty of the 'wrong' column name. I know, this is far to be the right way, but it is the only one I found. We made an extension method to the ObjectBuilder, that replaces such column name, so the keys map to the correct column.
