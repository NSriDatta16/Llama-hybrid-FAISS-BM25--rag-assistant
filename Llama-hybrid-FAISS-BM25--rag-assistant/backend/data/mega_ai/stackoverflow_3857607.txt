GCov and GCC, *.da Files Not Created

I am using GCC version 3.3.6. When I instrument my object files with -fprofile-arcs and -ftest-coverage , the appropriate *.bb and *.bbg files are created. The object files are then linked together into a static library libfoo.a with: ar rcs libfoo.a foo1.o foo2.o . Finally, a series of static libraries are linked together to create my executable with: gcc -fprofile-arcs -o foo.o Now, when I run the image, the *.da files are not getting created. Is there a step that I am missing? Does anyone have any other suggestions? Thanks.
