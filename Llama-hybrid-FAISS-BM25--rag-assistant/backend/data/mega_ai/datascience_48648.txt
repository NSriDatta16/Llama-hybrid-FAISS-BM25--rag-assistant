1) Feels like most of the work is not related to data science at all. Is this accurate? In my opinion, Data Science cannot pull out from Data wrangling. But, as you said, the question would come on how much percentage of Data Wrangling is required to do by a Data Scientist. It depends on Organizations bandwidth and the person interest in doing such work. In my experience of 15 to 16 years as DS, I always, spent around 60% to 70% in data wrangling activity and spent to a max of 15% of time in real analysis. so take your call. 2) I know this is not a data-driven company with a high-level data engineering department, but it is my opinion that data science requires minimum levels of data accessibility. Am I wrong? Again it depends on organization's security policies. They cannot leave everything to you and they have their own security issues to reveal the data to a person who is temporary employee (sorry to use this words :-() 3) Is this type of setup common for a company with serious data science needs? I feel these kind of companies require most attention from Data Scientists to make feel that data driven modeling is the future to sustain their business. :-) I have given my inputs in thinking of businesses instead of technical stand points. :-) Hope I am clear in my choice of words.
