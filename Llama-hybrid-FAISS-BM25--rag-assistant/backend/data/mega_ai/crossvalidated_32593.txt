This depends on the shape of the distribution for the resistance. Without knowing the distribution, I can't even say the average resistance, although I think there are constraints. So, let's pick a distribution which is tractible: Let $s$ be the standard deviation of the resistance of one resistor. Let the resistance be $\mu \pm s$, with each sign occurring with with probability $1/2$. This gives us $2^6 = 64$ cases to consider, or $2 \times 3 \times 4=24$ if we combine some cases. Of course we'll assume the resistances are independent. If we choose $\mu = 100$ and $s=1$ then the mean is $54.543291$ (slightly lower than $100 \times \frac{6}{11}$), and the variance is $0.102864$. If we choose $\mu = 5$ and $s=1$, then the variance is $0.103693$. Here is a power series expansion for the ratios between the variances when the mean is $1$ and the variance is $x$: $\frac{1506}{14641} + \frac{36000}{1771561}x + \frac{218016}{19487171}x^2 + O(x^3)$. When $x$ is small, the dominant term is $\frac{1506}{14641} = 0.102862$. While the question you ask technically depends on the distribution, you are probably interested in situations where the standard deviation is small compared with the mean, and I think there is a well-defined limit which doesn't depend on the distribution. Linearize the dependence of the circuit's resistance as a function of the resistances of each piece: $$C = \frac {1}{1/R_1 + 1/(R_2+R_3) + 1/(R_4 + R_5 + R_6)}$$ $$ \approx \frac{6}{11} \mu + \sum_{i=1}^6 (R_i - \mu)\frac {\partial C}{\partial R_i}(\mu,\mu,\mu,\mu,\mu,\mu)$$ $$\therefore \text{Var}(C) \approx \sum_{i=1}^6 \text{Var}(R_i)\bigg(\frac {\partial C}{\partial R_i}(\mu,\mu,\mu,\mu,\mu,\mu)\bigg)^2 $$ With this specific circuit, the scaled partial derivatives are $\frac {36}{121}, \frac{9}{121} ,\frac{9}{121}, \frac{4}{121},\frac{4}{121},\frac{4}{121} $, and $$ \bigg(\frac{36}{121}\bigg)^2 + 2\bigg(\frac{9}{121}\bigg)^2 + 3\bigg(\frac{4}{121}\bigg)^2 = \frac{1506}{14641} = 0.102862$$
