Tree-based methods like Adaboost can produce a list of relative variable importances that you can then use to rank-order your variables. Variable importance is measured by how much error the variable reduced each time it was used in a tree's split/branch. In your case, you could feed the top n-ranked variables into your SVM. In practice, I've seen modelers narrow down a list of 2,000+ to 10-15 using this method. Here is a more thorough explanation of how the CART algorithm determines variable importances: https://www.salford-systems.com/blog/dan-steinberg/what-is-the-variable-importance-measure
