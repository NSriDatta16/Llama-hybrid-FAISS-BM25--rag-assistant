Mysql query, item contains all specified tags

I have a table of items, table of tags and a table which connects these two (many-to-many). Fields of each table: items: id_item INT tags: id_tag INT item_tag: id_item INT id_tag INT Now each item can have one or more tags. I want to perform a tag based search which will select only these items which contain the specified tags. So if I have item with tags FLASH (id=1), PHP(id=2), MYSQL(id=3), RAGE(id=4) I can find it when searching for: FLASH, [1] (This is an array of tag ID's) FLASH + PHP, [1,2] MYSQL + PHP + RAGE, [3,2,4] PHP + FLASH + MYSQL + RAGE [2,1,3,4] but it should be found when I am looking for, eg: ACTIONSCRIPT, [8] PHP + ACTIONSCRIPT, [2,8] I thought about using simple LEFT JOIN with IN(...) but then I realized it wouldn't work... Any hints? Can it be done just via Mysql query without manually parsing the data in PHP? UPDATE: Taking into consideration answer by Brad Christie, here is an example query with the question being asked: SELECT t1.some_field, GROUP_CONCAT(t2.id_tag ORDER BY t2.id_tag) AS tagList FROM items t1 LEFT JOIN item_tag t2 ON t1.id_item = t2.id_item WHERE HERE_LIES_THE_PROBLEM Now, where we have HERE_LIES_THE_PROBLEM should be a function which checks if all elements presented in X are in tagList . So if tagList is "1,2,3,4" and X is "1,2" it should work, but if X is (1,2,5) it shouldn't. How to do this part?
