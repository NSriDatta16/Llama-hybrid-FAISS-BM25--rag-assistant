Check the Fill Factor for that index when it is re-built. The fill factor may be too high. If this is the case, the index pages will be too full when the index is re-built and adding new rows will soon start to cause page splits (fragmentation). Reducing the fill factor on rebuild will allow more new records to be inserted into the index pages before page splitting starts to occur. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa933139%28SQL.80%29.aspx
