When POSTing via AJAX / jQuery, one big request or a lot of little ones?

Alright I'm going to create a fairly complex form to post via AJAX a lot of different types of information PHP page which will then parse the data and CURL the various datatypes into the correct tables in another database. Usually I just send a HUGE POST request and then parse the information in the PHP page, making multiple CURL requests along the way to post the various elements. The downside is the form isn't super responsive, it generally takes 5-10 seconds for the PHP page to give the a-ok. I'd like this new form to be more snappy for better data entry, allowing the user to move onto the next entry without a hitch. So just looking for some professional advice: Make 5 AJAX requests to 5 PHP pages or stick with the large load? In terms of scale, there generally wont be many users it at the same time (it's internal for an organization), I'm trying to optimize for a single person submitting many entries over and over again with the same form. Any and all advice is very welcome and appreciated.
