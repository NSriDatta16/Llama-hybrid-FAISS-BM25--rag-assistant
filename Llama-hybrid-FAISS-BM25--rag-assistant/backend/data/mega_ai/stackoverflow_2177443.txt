Problem with ScatterView - Components behind disabled

I'm working currently on a simple project which consist of a ScatterView with a lot of items and then a Navigation (Implemented as many buttons). The problem is that i will like to have the ScatterView on top of everything, so that users can interact on the whole window as they want. I tried different things: If I put the navigation on top of the ScatterView then as soon as someone draggs something into the navigation, then after releasing the item, it will fall down behind the navigation, and you are not able to pick it anymore. If I put the navigation behind the ScatterView, then I cannot click the navigation since the scatterView consumes all events. Do you have any idea how to solve this problem? Thanks
