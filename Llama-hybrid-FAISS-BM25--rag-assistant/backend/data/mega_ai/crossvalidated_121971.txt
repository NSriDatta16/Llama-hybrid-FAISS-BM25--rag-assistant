Confidence Interval for the average of a set of proportions

If I have a dataset of 500+ observations (people in this case) that has the % of allotted dollars that were spent for each person (so, I have each persons allotted dollars and their dollars spent), and I want to show the average % of dollars spent (in this case the average is 80%), how would I also calculate some measure of "confidence" for that average? Is it correct to just calculate a confidence interval using a Wilson Score? I'm having trouble finding the right method, given that the average isn't really the proportion from a set of binomial data, but rather the average of a set of proportions... Thanks!
