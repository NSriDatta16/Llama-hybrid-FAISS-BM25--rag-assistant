Accessing localhost (xampp) from another computer over LAN network - how to?

I have just set up a wi-fi network at home. I have all my files on my desktop computer (192.168.1.56) and want to access localhost over there from another computer (192.168.1.2). On my desktop I can access localhost through the normal http://localhost. Apache is running on port 80 as usual. What do I have to do to achieve this? There is documentation on the net but they either don't work or are too fragmented and confusing to understand. I think I have to make changes to my apache's httpd.conf file and the hosts file. Any ideas as to what changes to make?
