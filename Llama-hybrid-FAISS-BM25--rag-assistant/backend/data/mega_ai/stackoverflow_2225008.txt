One issue that I have run into with a long-term Trac instance is the 'version' field. There is no distinction between the list of versions that can be assigned to a ticket, and the list of versions that can be queried for in the custom query interface. So if the version list for that field starts getting cumbersomely long, you can't really trim it without limiting what you can search for. One of these days I'll get around to fixing that... Trac 0.11 is rather more of a resource hog than 0.10 was; in large part due to the switch to Genshi for the templating engine. You may want to keep an eye on resources on the server, memory in particular. I expect to see some increased attention paid to performance in 0.13 or so. Oh, and if you run into problems, #trac on freenode can be a nice resource. Disclosure: I'm one of the Trac developers
