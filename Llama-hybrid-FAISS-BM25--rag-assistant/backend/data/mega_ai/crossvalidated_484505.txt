It might be helpful to become clear on the very specific things that you do not like about your current job. Are you not challenge? Lacks creativity? The hours? Colleagues? Benefits? Helping a corporation earn more profits? From there, you can think about what specifically you want in a new job, and whether the degree in Stats will help you get there. This can also help you determine how much risk you are willing to take, e.g. leave your current job or not. If you know your future job will be far superior, and there are many openings, then you can take the risk of saying bye. Maybe you have already considered these things, but knowing where you want to go and why is helpful. I would agree that working fulltime and going to school fulltime will be tough. My graduate program was more than a fulltime job. I'd also say that you are examining some very complex, deep questions, and no person's situation is going to be the same. If your job offers health insurance, and it includes mental health coverage, I would recommend reaching out a therapist. What you are discussing is a life transition, and there are professionals who are better equipped to walk you through what will be best for YOU! It's your life, not ours, and you can only do what feels right for you.
