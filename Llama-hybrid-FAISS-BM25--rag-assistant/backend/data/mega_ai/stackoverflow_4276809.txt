It looks like all it is doing is embedding perl inside the PHP process. You should see a memory increase of a few megabytes plus any data you create in Perl. It should not slow down any code. It is just another library sitting in memory waiting for you to call it. There are two benefits of this solution: you don't have to waste time spawning another process and you don't have to parse the return values from text being printed. Another solution is to write a Perl daemon and talk to it over a domain socket, pipe, or some other method of IPC. You might also be interested in the Perl documentation covering embedding perl .
