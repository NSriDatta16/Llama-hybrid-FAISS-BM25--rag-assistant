Data structure for Objects

Which data structures I should store the real life 'objects' in? I am not looking for computer representation. I am looking for different data structures for different item in real life access/storage etc. Is there any study on this? Update: Based upon comments, I should remove the 'data' from data structures and simply looking for structures to store various objects in based upon usability rules.
