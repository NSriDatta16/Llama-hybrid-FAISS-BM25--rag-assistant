A different service for my Flex app using Zend_Amf

I have an iterator service that works fine already and returns a correctly structured values to my flex application through my Zend Amf server $contacts = array(); mysql_connect( 'localhost', 'root', 'test' ); mysql_select_db( 'test' ); $res = mysql_query( 'SELECT * FROM contact' ); while( $contact = mysql_fetch_assoc($res) ) { $contacts []= $contact; } return $contacts; However I would like to adjust this so that I can leverage my MVC structure and achieve the same results. I have placed an excerpt that can be brought to working condition $contacts = array(); $table = new Model_DbTable_Contact(); $result = $table->fetchAll(); //Return an array to be consumed by my flex application foreach ($result as $row) { /*do something*/ } return $contacts;
