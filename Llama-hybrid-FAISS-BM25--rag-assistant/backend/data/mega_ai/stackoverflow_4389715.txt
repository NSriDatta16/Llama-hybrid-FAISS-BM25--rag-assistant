How do I have a class communicate to it's view controller that something has happened

I have a viewController that's running my game view. The viewController spawns instances of a Dots, which are subclassed from UIView that are added as subviews to the viewController view. Within the dots class I have certain behavior if they are touched (touchesBegan) but I'd also like touching the dots to add to the score which is a property of the viewController, but I can't see any way to communicate that out without ridiculous workarounds. What am I missing here?
