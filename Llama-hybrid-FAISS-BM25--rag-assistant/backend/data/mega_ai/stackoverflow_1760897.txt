A few hints: The first parameter for the range() function is incorrect. It must be 1 not 2. The start index included, the ending one is excluded. This is btw a very good practice to avoid bugs. With the modulo operator you found a way of detecting every 5 values; you could use this to print a line when that happens. You then would be left with having to find a way to not output a line when you output one value at at time; look in the python documentation for way to make the print() function do this. (attention, things have changed in the area of print with Python 3.0, but you seem to be using a 2.x version given your example) An alternative approach is to use the 3rd argument of the range() function, to step though the sequence, in increments of 5). Such a range would give you 1, 6, 11, 16 etc. in sequence, and you can use this number as the first of each line, and simple addition for the following ones.
