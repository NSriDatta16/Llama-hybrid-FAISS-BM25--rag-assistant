"Number of Features" parameter holds for the amount of randomness in the Random Forest (the fewer features you choose the more random your forest is). If you have lots of "relevant" features, you can choose small feature set to build each tree. But if only a fraction of your features is relevant, you better choose more features for each tree. In this case you can also perform feature selection before using Random Forest.
