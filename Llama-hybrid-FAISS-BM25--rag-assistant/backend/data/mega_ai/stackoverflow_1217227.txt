Image presented as HTML table is just a technical speed bump. There's no difficulty in extraction of pixels from such document. IMHO CAPTCHA puts focus on a wrong thing – you're not interested whether there's a human on the other side. You wouldn't like human to spam you either. So take a step back and focus on spam: Analyze text (look for spammy keywords, use bayesian filtering) Analyze links (blacklist spammy domains – SURBL, LinkSleeve) Look at traffic patterns and block floods There's no single perfectly accurate method, but you can use few of them and weight the result to get pretty close. Have a look at source code of Sblam! (it's a completely transparent server-side comment spam filter).
