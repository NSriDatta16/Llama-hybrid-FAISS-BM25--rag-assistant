Formally there's no such thing as "storage specifier" in C. C has storage-class specifiers . There are five of them: typedef , extern , static , auto and register . Obviously, what typedef does is not exactly what is commonly understood under "storage class", but the concept of storage-class specifier in C has strong syntactic roots, which is why typedef was also included into that category.
