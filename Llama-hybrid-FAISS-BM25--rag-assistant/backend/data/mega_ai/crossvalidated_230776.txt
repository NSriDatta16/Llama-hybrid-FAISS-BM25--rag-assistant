vglm() function from package VGAM VS the multinom() function from package nnet

I'am trying to do a multinomial logistic regression to explain the political orientations in Tunisia but I'am really confused about using the vglm() function from package VGAM or the multinom() function from package nnet or the mlogit function... can someone tell me please the difference and wich one is the best?
