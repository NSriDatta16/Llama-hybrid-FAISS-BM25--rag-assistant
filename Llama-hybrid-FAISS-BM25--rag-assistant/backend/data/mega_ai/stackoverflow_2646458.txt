Unless you set innodb_file_per_table , ibdata1 holds all InnoDB tables plus undo. This file never shrinks. To shrink it, you should (at your own risk): Backup and drop all InnoDB tables in all databases Delete the file manually Reinitialize InnoDB storage (by restarting mysqld ) and Restore the tables from backup. If you set innodb_file_per_table , you'll still have to do this to reclaim the space, but in this case you'll be able to do this on per-table basis, without affecting the other tables. Note that the undo is still held in ibdata , even with innodb_file_per_table set.
