Bayesian Proportion Test ... with Cumulative Successes and Trials?

I am conducting a Bayesian Proportions Test (using R's BayesianFirstAid package) of consumer conversion rates at different ad impression frequencies. Conversions are considered successes and impressions are considered trials. This data might look like: > head(x, 10) Freq Conv Imp 1 1 270900 1691270667 2 2 185090 492294876 3 3 119744 329414751 4 4 90498 261627880 5 5 62878 206159185 6 6 51916 180760428 7 7 38659 146174847 8 8 32890 131011008 9 9 26047 114761484 10 10 22570 105066150 Where a call to bayes.prop.test yields the following insight: > (x_short Leaving aside a discussion of these results, my question pertains to whether or not it is appropriate to use a cumulative measure of these conversions and impressions, since the Frequency 2 bin also saw the first round of ads, which are binned into Frequency 1 and so on... This new data would look like... > head(x_cumul, 10) Freq Conv Imp Cumul_Conv Cumul_Imp 1 1 270900 1691270667 270900 1691270667 2 2 185090 492294876 455990 2183565543 3 3 119744 329414751 575734 2512980294 4 4 90498 261627880 666232 2774608174 5 5 62878 206159185 729110 2980767359 6 6 51916 180760428 781026 3161527787 7 7 38659 146174847 819685 3307702634 8 8 32890 131011008 852575 3438713642 9 9 26047 114761484 878622 3553475126 10 10 22570 105066150 901192 3658541276 And its associated bayes.prop.test yields instead these results, which show lower, relative probabilities of converting as you move up through frequency bins: > (x_cumul_short Is there a "right" answer or - if not - which one is "more appropriate"?
