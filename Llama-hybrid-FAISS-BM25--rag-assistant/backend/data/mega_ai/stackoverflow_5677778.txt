If the class has no virtual functions, they will probably* be placed in contiguous memory with something like new Element[20] or std::vector v(20) . As noted above, std::set and most other STL containers are not necessarily contiguous. *I say "probably" because depending on the size of the actual type, the compiler might insert some padding, which you can probably control with #pragmas as needed.
