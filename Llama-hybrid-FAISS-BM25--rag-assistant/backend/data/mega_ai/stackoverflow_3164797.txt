You must use ACLs (or an equivalent user permission mechanism such as literal database User and Permission tables) rather than groups if you need to control access to individual entities which vary dynamically . File systems attach ACL's to individual files since you don't want to create a separate group for each file. Database managers attach ACL's to databases, tables, views, stored procedures and whatnot for the same reason. Web servers deal with web applications in the same manner. In a business application dealing with business entities, you may want to partition access to entities such as e.g. different sales orders, customers, products or divisions within your company, where not everybody is allowed to create/update or even read the same entities. For instance, when sales staff are in direct competition for bonuses, they don't want everybody else to see all the information on their CRM-stored prospects. Usually, though, you want to keep your access mechanisms as coarse-grained as is humanly possible: groups are usually good enough. Fine-grained access control mechanisms have a tendency to grow complex, expensive, inaccurate and hard to use correctly. They may even decrease security, since administrative frustration encourages people to find clever workarounds...
