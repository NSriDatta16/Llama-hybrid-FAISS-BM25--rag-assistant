What you have is fine, with the minor detail that it will claim that the average of 3 and 3 is 2. I'm guessing that you don't want that; fortunately, there's an easy fix: unsigned int average = a/2 + b/2 + (a & b & 1); This just bumps the average back up in the case that both divisions were truncated.
