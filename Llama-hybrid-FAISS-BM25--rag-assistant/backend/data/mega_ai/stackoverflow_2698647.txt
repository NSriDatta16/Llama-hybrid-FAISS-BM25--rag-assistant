jQuery UI Sortable Question

I am trying to build a sortable navigation tree using jQuery UI Sortable. I have it working great in Firefox with no prblems. In IE it works pretty well, however, there seems to be some inconsistent issues when trying to move an item with a nested list down in its navigational tier. The list doesn't expand to create a drop point for the list in motion and it often fails, however, sometimes the sort works anyway. I have played with this for longer than I care to admit! Does anyone have any ideas? Here is a link to a demo with source . To duplicate the problem: In IE drag the row (Move Show Item 12) up a few rows then try to move it back down to where it started. (Note: to move items you must click and hold on move)
