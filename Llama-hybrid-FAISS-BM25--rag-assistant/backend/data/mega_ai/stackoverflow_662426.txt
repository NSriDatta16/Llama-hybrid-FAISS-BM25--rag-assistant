Managed to get everything working, with the help of an older SO question. We started with this post , which provided us with an example coverage setup using EMMA. However, it appeared that we'd need to force a dependency on EMMA on every plugin we wanted to get coverage data for. Some Google forensics got us to this book excerpt , which rather adequately covers the OSGi classloader hierarchy. By adding the osgi.parentClassloader=app line to the config.ini of the test running application, we could specify a classpath on the commandline. That classpath needed to include: Eclipse's startup.jar The Java SDK jars used by the application The jars for the coverage tool Of course, we were running the tests via the Ant task, which does silently ignores any classpath information you provide and uses just the jar. After we got Emma working, we switched to Cobertura, and our final Ant script (slightly abridged and anonymized) looks like: Hopefully this helps someone out who's in the same spot we were in.
