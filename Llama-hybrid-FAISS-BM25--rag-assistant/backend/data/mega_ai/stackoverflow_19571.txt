I'd suggest that modifying the underlying XML file is "considered harmful". Especially if you haven't checked to see if the document is open! I've had a quick look at the Scripting Dictionary for Pages, and it seems pretty comprehensive; here is part of one entry: document n [inh. document > item ; see also Standard Suite] : A Pages document. elements contains captured pages, character styles, charts, graphics, images, lines, list styles, pages, paragraph styles, sections, shapes, tables, text boxes . properties body text (text) : The main text flow of the document. bottom margin (real) : The bottom margin of the publication. facing pages (boolean) : Whether or not the view is set to facing pages. footer margin (real) : The footer margin of the publication. header margin (real) : The header margin of the publication. id (integer, r/o) : The unique identifier of the document. ... So, I guess I'd want to know what it is that you want to do that you can't do with AppleScript?
