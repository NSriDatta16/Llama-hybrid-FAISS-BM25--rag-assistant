How to relate a percentage to another percentage, ordering the result in a range between 0 and 1, and using weights

EDIT: I am referring to yearly return from trading is the first time series, the second one is an index the SPX I have some yearly measurements M1 : 2021 ->3%; 2020 ->14% ; 2019 ->-15% I could calculate a simple average and determine the mean 1% and then compare how every year the percentage differs by the average. But I have a really strong correlated series M2: 2021 -> 15%; 2020 ->10%; 2019 ->-4% I want to model M1 taking into account M2, so that for instance the M1 result 2019 -15% is "normalised" to the fact that that year 2019 was 4% Ideally would like to "normalise"/"model" every year with a scale between 0.00 and 1.00 so that can compare how significant is the M1 result compared to M2, as bonus would like to weight the result of M2 according to some parameters, for instance if -5% then weight with a coefficient of 1.3 if is less(for ex. -18% or -8%) 1.55 I do not expect that you spend time solving this, is just I am really really frustrated, that do not know which statistic/ math tool I should use to solve this kind of problems, so would like to know which key words or which subject should study to solve a problem like that(that in my case is a financial problem, I even posted in the quant forum, but thought that here could get more theoretic support to understand which topic should study because is a math data analysis problem first of all)
