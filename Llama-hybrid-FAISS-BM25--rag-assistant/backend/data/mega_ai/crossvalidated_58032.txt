Is it valid to divide data by a constant to make the estimated beta larger / more interpretable?

In analyzing my data, I find a similar problem to the one described in interpreting-this-regression-coefficient . I'm using regression analysis to build a human energy expenditure estimation model using a motion sensor. Depending on the intensity of the motion, the output of the sensor may be up to 1,000 to 2,000 counts per minute, and my data show an average of 900-1,100 counts per minute. I used these data to develop a model, with energy expenditure as the dependent variable and motion sensor output as the independent variable. The result was that the model was statistically significant ($p
