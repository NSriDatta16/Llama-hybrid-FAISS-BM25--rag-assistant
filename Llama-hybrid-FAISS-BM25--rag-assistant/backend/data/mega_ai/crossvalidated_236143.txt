Question 1 The additional assumption you need so that the covariances become equal is called `Exchangeability'. The definition of exchangeability is as follows: Let $π$ denote an arbitrary permutation on n elements (that is, a function that maps $\{1, . . . , n\}$ onto itself). The finite sequence $X_1, . . . , X_n$ is said to be exchangeable if the joint distribution of the permuted random vector $(X_{π(1)}, . . . , X_{π(n)})$ is the same no matter which π is chosen. The infinite sequence X1, X2, . . . is said to be exchangeable if any finite subsequence is exchangeable. Under exchangeability, the covariance between $X_i$ and $X_j$ is always the same, say $C$, when i $\neq$ j. Under the assumption of exchangeability, your computations are correct. Question 2 Under exchangeability, this is not true. You will need a completely different assumption to make the covariance equal to the variance. Check out this fragment of a book. They explain identically distributed by not identical with an example very similar to yours (instead of sum of random variables, they work with with the mean): http://sites.stat.psu.edu/~dhunter/asymp/lectures/p51to58.pdf
