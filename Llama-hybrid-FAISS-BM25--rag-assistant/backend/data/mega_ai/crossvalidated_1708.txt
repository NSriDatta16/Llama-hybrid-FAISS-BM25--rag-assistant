Variation in PCA weights

I have weights of SNP variation (output through Eigenstrat program) for each SNP for the three main PCs. I wish to reduce my list of SNPs to those that show maximum differentiation between the three PCs. Can anyone help me with which statistical method to use to do this. say, if each PC describes the magnitude of variation, how can I find mutually exclusive rows or rows that define the strongest differenciator of each PC. e.g: SNPNam PC1-wt PC 2-wt PC3-wt SNP_1 -1.489 -0.029 -0.507 SNP_2 -1.446 -0.816 0.661 SNP_3 -1.416 0.338 1.631 SNP_4 -1.392 -1.452 0.062 SNP_5 -1.278 0.362 -1.006 SNP_6 -1.21 0.514 0.144 SNP_7 -1.119 -0.633 0.163 SNP_8 -1.112 -0.193 -0.256 SNP_9 -1.054 1.081 -1.519 SNP_10 -0.936 -1.052 -0.419 SNP_11 -0.861 0.381 -0.207 SNP_12 -0.662 0.852 -0.211 SNP_13 -0.503 -1.602 0.585 SNP_14 -0.417 0.529 -1.003 SNP_15 0.101 -0.85 -0.258 SNP_16 0.198 -0.435 -1.599 SNP_17 0.588 -1.292 -1.257 SNP_18 1.167 0.891 1.106 SNP_19 1.35 0.036 0.729 SNP_20 1.532 1.599 0.499 Any help regarding which test to perform and how to (which package) is very much appreciated.
