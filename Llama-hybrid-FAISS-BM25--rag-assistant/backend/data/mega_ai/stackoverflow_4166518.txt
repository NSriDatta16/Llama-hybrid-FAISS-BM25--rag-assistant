One way by which you can avoid these kind of crashes is by setting the legacyUnhandledExceptionPolicy property in QTAgent32.exe.config (and/or QTAgent.exe.config depending upon the bitness of the machine/testrun) as mentioned here . Relevant text from this link is: - As a temporary compatibility measure, administrators can place a compatibility flag in the section of the application configuration file. This causes the common language runtime to revert to the behavior of versions 1.0 and 1.1. This will switch the "unhandled exception" handling behaviour to .net 1.1 and the process will not crash on such exceptions.
