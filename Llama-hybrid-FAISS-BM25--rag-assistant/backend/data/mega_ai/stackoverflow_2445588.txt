SQL: How do I return zeroes where there is nothing to aggregate across?

What I would like ask is best illustrated by an example, so bear with me. Suppose I have the following table: TypeID Gender Count 1 M 10 1 F 3 1 F 6 3 M 11 3 M 8 I would like to aggregate this for every possible combination of TypeID and Gender. Where TypeID can be 1,2 or 3 and Gender can be M or F. So what I want is the following: TypeID Gender SUM(Count) 1 M 10 1 F 9 2 M 0 2 F 0 3 M 19 3 F 0 I can think of a few ways to potentially do this, but none of them seem particularly elegant to me. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated! Karl
