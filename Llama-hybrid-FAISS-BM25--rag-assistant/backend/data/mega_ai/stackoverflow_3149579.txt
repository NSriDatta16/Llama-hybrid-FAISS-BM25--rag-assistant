How to recognize current location in python?

My client has two offices in Germany and USA and a python program should recognize the office location. What will be the most elegant way to implement this? It only have to recognize the country. Furthermore it also could happens that there will be no permanent internet connection. The program works on windows but the solution should be os independent. Any suggestions? Thanks
