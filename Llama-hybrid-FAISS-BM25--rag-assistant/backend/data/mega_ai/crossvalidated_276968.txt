What neural network can I use to predict data from stock exchange data set?

I am doing a school project based on a scientific paper that predict data from a stock exchange data set First the program use a genetic programing algorithm to get new data, then improves the data using Artificial fish swarm algorithm, then uses a neural network where the first data is the input variables and the latest processed data are the variables to predict Any suggestions?
