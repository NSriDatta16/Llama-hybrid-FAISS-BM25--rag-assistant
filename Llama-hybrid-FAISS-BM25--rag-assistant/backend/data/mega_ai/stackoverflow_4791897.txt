I am transforming an xml using an xsl.I get the xml from Oracle database.When i transform I am unable to see the data in the format it was actually stored.In a particular node, the line feeds used which are seen in the xml but when i transform I am unable t see the line feeds.All the content in the particluar node is displayed in a line. Can some one help me in how to include the line feeds which are already there in the xml??? Thanks Raghav
