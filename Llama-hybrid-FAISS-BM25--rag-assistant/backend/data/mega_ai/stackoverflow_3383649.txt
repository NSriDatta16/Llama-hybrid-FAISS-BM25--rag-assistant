Retrieve elements of XML page via PHP

I'm trying to wrap my head around PHP and XML. I'm trying to do something: There is an XML document that I'm retrieving via cURL (also tried various PHP XML library parameters such as XMLReader::open($url) etc. The method of retrieval doesn't matter; I can and have got this part working. The problem is parsing the XML on the retrieved page. Here is an example of the XML: http://z3950.loc.gov:7090/voyager?version=1.1&operation=searchRetrieve&query=9780471615156&maximumRecords=1&recordPacking=xml&recordSchema=marcxml What I need to get from that page is the call number; WM 173.6 R823m author; Ross, Colin A. and title information; Multiple personality disorder : diagnosis, clinical features, and treatment / Colin A. Ross. seems simple enough. However, for the life of me I can not seem to get any of the inbuilt PHP functions for working with XML to work (because I'm doing it wrong). Here is an example I've tried: //xml file retrieved via curl and saved to folder $file="9780471615156.xml"; $xml = simplexml_load_file($file); echo $xml->getName();//returns searchRetrieveResponse foreach($xml->searchRetrieveResponse[0]->attributes() as $a => $b){ echo $a,'="',$b,"\" ";//nothing } foreach ($xml->searchRetrieveResponse[0]->children() as $child){ echo "Child node: " . $child . " ";//nothing } it returns the name of the first node, but I can't get it to go any deeper. NB: I'm running PHP 5+
