How can I reproduce the Firefox faded image/text dragging effect in .NET?

Ok, I know this is probably a pretty newb question, but when it comes to graphics programming, I am a newb :) How does Firefox achieve the drag and drop effect while displaying the nice faded copy of the selected image or text? See below for an example with the SO logo. Also, how could I reproduce this effect in C#/VB.NET? (preferably WinForms as I don't really know WPF yet.) I also noticed that the origin of the "fade" is based on the cursor position within the image (go ahead, try it now, you'll see what I mean!) I suppose I could delve into the source over at MDC , but I thought someone here might already be familiar with this technique.
