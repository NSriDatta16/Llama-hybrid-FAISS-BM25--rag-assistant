A 'Pro' thought: In cases where you are passing quantifiable data or parameters from controller to a view. In some cases, although I would think limited or rare, to test internal logic within the controller that is not covered by your supporting code tests. Although it could be argued that those pieces of code should be moved. A 'Con' Thought: If your tests for the controllers are not adding any additional code coverage or are duplicating test coverage, it would just overhead and add development time for no benefit.
