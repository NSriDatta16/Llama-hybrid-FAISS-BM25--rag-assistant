I'm sure there are many opinions on this, but my take is that with HTML5, faster Javascript interpreters, client side persistent storage, etc. it makes it pretty compelling to put all the UI application login in the client (browser), and just use some form of RPC (with JSON serialization) to the server. Therefore templating engines, SSI, or any server side generated markup is no longer required for interactive applications. It's still fine for semi-static documents. For that I use sphinx document generator.
