android: how to resize dialog

I would like to create a dialog-style form which would fill the bigger screen area (left, right, top, bottom padding 10px). I defined the style "CupCakeDialog" the following way: @null and by running the activity: getWindow().requestFeature(Window.FEATURE_PROGRESS); getWindow().requestFeature(Window.FEATURE_NO_TITLE); setContentView(R.layout.ad_popup); The dialog is displayed the following way: alt text http://img199.imageshack.us/img199/1299/popupstackoverflow.png Does anyone know how to make the dialog bigger (extend height)? Thank you!
