Bayesian interpretation of a confidence interval as prediction

Classical and Bayesian approaches to parameter estimation are often compared. See, for example What's the difference between a confidence interval and a credible interval? What I cannot find is "the Bayesian version" of the following result. Consider a prediction interval for the next sample drawn from a normal distribution, and the probability of being wrong is alpha . No assumptions about the mean and the variance are needed. Here is a proof. After observing $z_1$ , ..., $z_n$ , the sample mean and the sample variance are $$m = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^{n} z_i, \quad s^2 = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{n = 1}^{n} (z_i - m)^2$$ . The random variable $$ \frac{z_{n + 1} - m}{s} \sqrt{\frac{n + 1}{n}} $$ has $t$ -distribution with $n - 1$ degrees of freedom and $z_{n + 1}$ will be in the interval $$m \pm t^{\alpha/2}_{n - 1} s\sqrt{\frac{n}{n + 1}}$$ . with probably $1 - \alpha$ , where $t^{\alpha/2}$ is the value of percent point function (inverse of cdf) for $t$ -distribution. And a demonstration in python #!/usr/bin/python3 import math import random import scipy.stats import statistics mu = 1.0 sigma = 1.0 alpha = 0.20 N = 1000 def rnd(): return random.gauss(mu, sigma) def interval(z): n = len(z) + 1 m = statistics.mean(z) s = statistics.stdev(z) t = scipy.stats.t.ppf(1 - alpha/2, n - 2) d = t * s * math.sqrt(n/(n - 1)) return m - d, m + d z = [rnd(), rnd()] wrong = 0 for i in range(N): x, y = interval(z) z0 = rnd() wrong += not x References Fisher, R.
