You can make each of your weights a pair: (# of transfers, time) . You can add these weights in the obvious way, and compare them in lexicographic order (compare # of transfers first, use time as the tiebreaker). Of course, as others have mentioned, using K * (# of transfers) + time for some large enough K produces the same effect as long as you know the maximum time apriori and you don't run out of bits in your weight storage.
