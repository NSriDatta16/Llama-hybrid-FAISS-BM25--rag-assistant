Since you are not getting a linearly separable decision boundary and at the same time you don't want complex decision boundaries based on SVM Kernels or neural networks what you can try is build features that tries to capture interaction such as X1*X2 and X1*X2**2 and likewise and include them in your classifier as features. Also you can try tree based classifiers since it captures interaction automatically. Hope this helps ..
