Back propagation is done with each batch in a convolutional net, but is it also done with the validation set?

It's my understanding that the weights are updated in a convolutional neural network with each evaluation of a batch. But when the training data has been processed and it comes to predicting validation set at the end of an epoch, are the weights updated again using the validation error? For example, is it something like this: Epoch 1: Batch 1 > Train > Evaluate > Update Weights Batch 2 > Train > Evaluate > Update Weights Batch N > Train > Evaluate > Update Weights Validation Set > Predict > Evaluate > Update Weights Epoch 2: Batch.. etc etc What I'm wondering is if the weights are also updated at the validation set stage above. Thanks folks
