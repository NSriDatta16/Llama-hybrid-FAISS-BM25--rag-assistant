(Speaking specifically on subset of NoSQL known as Document databases). Many document databases do not expose a "Query Language". In lieu, they often provide Query APIs and these APIs are specific to the implementation and controlled by the individual sponsors/owners of the implementations (10gen for MongoDB, for example). In the XML database space (a subset of Document databases), there is the W3C standard XQuery . It is a query and functional programming language designed for querying collections of XML data (says wikipedia). It is unclear yet if there is any need/desire for a standard query API (or language) for JSON data. JSONPath (analogous to XPath ) has been proposed, but it's received little attention other than it's use by Kynetx .
