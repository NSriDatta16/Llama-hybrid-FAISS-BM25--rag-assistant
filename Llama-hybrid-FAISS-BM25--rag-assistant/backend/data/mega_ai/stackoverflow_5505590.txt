Following up on BalusC's link , I can confirm that we could do the same thing when using Restlet. However, as per the code in the example to get the config instance you are passing in the ServletContext as an argument. Restlet is like 'another' framework that uses Servlets as an adapter to configure itself. So it'll be tricky to pass the ServletContext as an argument from somewhere else in the code (Restlet uses it's own Context object which is conceptually similar to ServletContext) For my case a static method returning the cached datasource seems to be 'clean enough' but there could be other design/organization approaches.
