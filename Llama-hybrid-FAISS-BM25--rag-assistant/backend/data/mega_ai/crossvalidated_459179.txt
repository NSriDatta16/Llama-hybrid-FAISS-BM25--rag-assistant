We can set up the model using a dataset Sonar: library(caret) library(mlbench) svmSBF With that settings, SBF filters the values using anovaScores if it is a classification or gamScores if it's continuous. The filter is based on p-value (see $score below): caretSBF$score function (x, y) { if (is.factor(y)) anovaScores(x, y) else gamScores(x, y) } caretSBF$filter function (score, x, y) score For what you need, you need to run SBF first to get the filtered variables over the train set and use that to retrain your model: sbf_fit We calculate the proportion of times each variable is kept: prop_included = rowMeans(sapply(sbf_fit $variables,function(i)sbf_fit$ coefnames %in% i)) selected = sbf_fit$coefnames[prop_included > 0.7] And you train your model: mdl
