Unless you are a member of the enterprise development programme and deploying to 'in-house' devices then to download an app to a device you either need to.. 1 - Submit it to App Store with a release profile and then download from there or (and this sounds like what you are trying to to) 2 - Create either a development profile or ad-hoc distribution profile for the client's device, and download that to their phone, then try to download the app. To create the profile for the client device you will of course need the UDID for the device which you will be able to find in the organizer or iTunes See this page in the developer portal for details on assigning devices for provisioning
