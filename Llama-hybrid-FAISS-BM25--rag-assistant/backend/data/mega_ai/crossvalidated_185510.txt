The technical term for this problem is linear dependence. As you've discovered, it results in a singular linear system which is not amenable to OLS. In the social sciences, this is commonly referred to as the "dummy variable trap." But it would appear that for this problem, you don't need to add the intercept column. The rank deficiency of your design matrix appears to be due to the inclusion of an intercept. Considering that your research interest appears to center on interest in players themselves, by omitting the intercept, you could focus your inquiry and inference directly on the question of player quality. This doesn't even cause any information loss -- it's two equivalent ways of representing the problem. Consider a simpler case of predicting height based on gender. One method would be to have an intercept, and a binary column indicating Male or Female (this example supposes gender is binary, but this is not a necessary assumption -- math doesn't care about gender politics). In this model, the intercept corresponds to the average height of the gender coded as 0. This is the "baseline" category. Then this baseline gender estimate is shifted up or down by the coefficient of the binary feature to give the estimate of the average effect for the gender coded as 1. An alternative model would omit the intercept, but have two binary columns, in which male is coded as 1 and one in which female is coded as 1. This predicts a different mean for each gender. Importantly, the two have equivalent results. In the first model, to get results for each gender, you have the mean and then the mean offset by your gender dummy. In the second model, you can just read off both gender values. Clearly, in a situation where you're immediately interested in all of the features, just go with the fully-dummy model. (Caveat: you can only do this once. Continuing the second height/gender example, you couldn't introduce two additional dummy variables Democrat/Republican because then both gender and political party columns sum to 1, meaning that those pairs of columns are linearly dependent.)
