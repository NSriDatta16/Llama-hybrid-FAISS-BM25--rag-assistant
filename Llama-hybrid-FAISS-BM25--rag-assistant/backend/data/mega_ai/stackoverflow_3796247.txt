I took a look at a stock Magento install of CE 1.4.1, and unmodified the _prepareLayout method is called six times when loading the URL http://magento.example.com/catalog/product/view/id/46 That's because the class is instantiated six times. So that's the correct behavior. As for the vanishing element, I can'y say for sure, but your override to _prepareLayout doesn't appear to either Do the same things as Mage_Catalog_Block_Product_View::_prepareLayout Call parent::_prepareLayout(); When you override a class in a Magento you're replacing an existing class with your own. If you change a method, you're responsible for that old code being run. It's not clear what you're trying to accomplish here. You should consider breaking your problem down into smaller problems, and then posting one (or more) "I tried X, expected Y, and got Z" type questions. As written no one's going to be able to answer your question.
