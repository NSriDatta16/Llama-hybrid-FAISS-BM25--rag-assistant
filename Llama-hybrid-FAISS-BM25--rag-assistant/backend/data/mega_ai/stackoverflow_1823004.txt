It's not quite clear to me what you are trying to do with the regex, but if you are just trying to match for a particular number-measurement combination, this might help: $count = preg_match_all('/\d+\s*(tbsp|tsp|tbs)/', $paragraph); This will return the number of times a number-measurement combination occurs in $paragraph . EDIT switched to use preg_match_all to count all occurrences. Example for counting the number of matched characters: $paragraph = "5tbsp and 10 tsp"; $charcnt = 0; $matches = array(); if (preg_match_all('/\d+\s*(tbsp|tsp|tbs)/', $paragraph, $matches) > 0) { foreach ($matches[0] as $match) { $charcnt += strlen($match); } } printf("total number of characters: %d\n", $charcnt); Output from executing the above: total number of characters: 11
