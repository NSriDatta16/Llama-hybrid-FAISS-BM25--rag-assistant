Can a dojo.dnd.Source object contains another dojo.dnd.Source object as one of the child nodes?

I have looked at the this link for a tutorial on dojo drag and drop feature. But one thing I have noticed is that in all cases of the examples, the items to be dragged around are always a simple item, just a string object... I need to create something like an item group where you can drag an item into the item group to append into the group and to drag the item group around as a whole. Hence my question, is it possible to drag and drop a dojo.dnd.Source item into another dojo.dnd.Source item?
