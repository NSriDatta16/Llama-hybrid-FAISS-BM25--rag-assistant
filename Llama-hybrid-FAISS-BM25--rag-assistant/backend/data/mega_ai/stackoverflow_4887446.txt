Flash, AS3 drag movieclip based on full size, not what's inside

First post here, I have tried searching but couldn't find what I'm looking for but most people seem to get the answers they're after! I'm working on some draggable/droppable functionality in flash as3, but the issue I have at the moment, is that I can only drag on what's inside the draggable movieclip, not the whole of the movieclip itself. For instance, say I have a stick man, I can only drag him if I select the lines, not the whole size of the movieclip i.e if the arms extend outwards by x amount I should be able to click upto x width, down by the legs on whitespace (within the confines of the movie clip bounding box) and still be able to drag. Is this possible? Many Thanks
