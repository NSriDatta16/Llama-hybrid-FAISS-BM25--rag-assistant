Prediction of mortality based on age before and after a certain event

I have data on about 320 people. I am trying to predict their mortality before and after a certain event. I tried to apply a logistic regression model using dead or alive as dependent variable and age-as independent. The problem is that there are several people in some age groups, and out of these groups some survived and some died. Not sure how to combine ages and ratio of alive/dead on the x-axis if i use a logistic regression.
