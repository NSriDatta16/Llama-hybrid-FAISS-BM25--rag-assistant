It seems you're already on the right track by considering McNemar's test, Chi-Square test, and Fisher’s Exact Test. Let me try to help refine this approach with a focus on the specific design of your study. First, you could start off by using McNemar’s test to analyze changes within each group (CG and IG) from Baseline to Follow-up. Then, use the Chi-Square or Fisher’s Exact Test to compare the groups at each time point separately. Alternatively, you could also use Moderated Regression Analysis (for this one you might need to make some adjustments to your data), or Generalized Estimating Equations, or Mixed-Effects Logistic Regression (i.e., Multilevel Modeling or Hierarchical LM). Lastly, if you can get a larger time period sample for your data (if empirical), this would enhance your temporal structure and possibly enable you to do a Vector Error Correction Model, this will allow you to examine the long-term trends between your variables of interest and will enable you to do cointegration testing. After you figure out the cointegration order you can do pairwise testing to figure out which variables are related in the long run and also Granger Causality testing, which uses the Chi-Square statistic. Here are some open-access sources you can check out for further information on these methods: https://usq.pressbooks.pub/statisticsforresearchstudents/chapter/moderation-assumptions/ https://www.statsmodels.org/stable//gee.html https://stats.oarc.ucla.edu/r/dae/mixed-effects-logistic-regression/ https://spureconomics.com/vecm-estimation-and-interpretation/
