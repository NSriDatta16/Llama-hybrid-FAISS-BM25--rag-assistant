Regular expressions cannot match balanced text to arbitrary levels of nesting. At least, not without non-regular extensions. But if the amount of nesting is limited, and you don't mind a fragile and obtuse solution to the problem, then you can make them work. /{([^{}]*{[^{}]*})*[^{}]*}/ will match against one level of nested braces, and it should be (relatively) straightforward to extend that to the number of levels of nesting you require.
