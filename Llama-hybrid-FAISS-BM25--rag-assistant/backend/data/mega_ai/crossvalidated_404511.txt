Let's first consider what an outlier does to the coefficients: If it has low leverage, nothing; If it has high leverage, it pulls the coefficient towards itself (either increasing or decreasing it). When you apply the LASSO penalty to OLS, you penalize the coefficients by summing their absolute values. An outlier with sufficient leverage increases/decreases a coefficient, also affecting the penalty linearly. This will somewhat increase/decrease the penalty to the the other coefficients, but not by much. When you apply the ridge penalty, the sum of squared coefficients shrinks the coefficient. This means that outlyingness will not only increase the OLS quadratically, but also the penalty. As such, all the other coefficients might be shrunk considerably more/less (depending on what kind of outlier you're dealing with). This sensitivity of the penalty to changes in the coefficients (and thus to outliers) means that ridge is less robust to outliers than LASSO.
