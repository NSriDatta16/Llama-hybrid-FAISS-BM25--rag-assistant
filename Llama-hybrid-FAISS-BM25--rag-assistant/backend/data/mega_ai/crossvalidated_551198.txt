Conflict between significance and importance. A paradox

When examining a set of proteins of healthy controls and patients I found significant differences using the Mann-Whitney test. However, when I used Random Forest, the most 'important' proteins for classification included some proteins that did not vary significantly with the Mann-Whitney test, and viceversa, many proteins that varied significantly with the Mann-Whitney test (with p Random Forest was run plain, with two groups of controls and patients only. I used both packages available in R (randomForest and randomForestSRC) obtaining the same results. In fact the classification generated by RF is the best ever obtained for that set of subjects. But I am very uncertain whether and how to interpret the importance of the variables for diagnostic purposes, given the strong contrast with Mann-Whitney tests.
