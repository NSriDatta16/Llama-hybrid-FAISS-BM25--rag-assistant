How to test my GAE site for performance

I am building a GAE site that uses AJAX/JSON for almost all its tasks including building the UI elements, all interactions and client-server requests. What is a good way to test it for highloads so that I could have some statistics about how much resources 1000 average users per some period of time would take. I think I can create some Python functions for this purpose. What can you advise? Thanks.
