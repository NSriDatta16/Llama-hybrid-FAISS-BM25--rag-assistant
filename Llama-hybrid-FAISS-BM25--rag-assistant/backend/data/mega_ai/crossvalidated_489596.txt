Your question is basically how can you detect complicated patterns using NN building blocks: linear transformations and non-linearities. Since you specifically talk about image data, have you looked at Edge detectors and in particular Sobel operators ? Sobel operators can detect edges and they are linear. When training a CNN, you learn the weights of these edge detectors (learn the coefficients of the filter kernels). So if the first hidden layer detects edges, you can then imagine how linear combinations of these detectors can detect more complicated objects. A circle should activate the edge detectors of all directions, but only by a small amount. I guess an eye is shaped like an ellipse with a smaller circle inside. Have you seen Chris Olah's vizs ?
