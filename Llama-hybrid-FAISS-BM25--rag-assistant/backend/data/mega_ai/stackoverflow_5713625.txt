How do I use regex to replace a sentence with paragraphs in Notepad++?

I'm a Notepad++ newbie and I have a report with multiple instances of this sentence All students with a C grade and below will not be allowed to join any outdoor trip. I'd like to change the sentence to Due to change in policy, students with a C grade and below will not be joining any trip. This is to motivate weaker students. (Please contact us if you feel this is harsh). I'm confused on the usage of () and \n in this instance.
