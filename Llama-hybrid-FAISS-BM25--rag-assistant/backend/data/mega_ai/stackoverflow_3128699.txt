How to make "textarea" in Form return paragraphs (PHP)

Beginner here. I have a form with a textarea to return comments. I got a PHP script from helpvid.net to send the form to. So, the form is being sent to a PHP file.The form then returns the information to me in an email. Problem is that the comments are sent as one large run-in paragraph. Even if the user hits Return in the field to make a new line, the text returned in the email is on one line. If the user hits Return twice to make a new paragraph, those paragraphs are returned as one long paragraph. I would like the text returned to have the line breaks that the user puts in. Here is the code form the PHP file that is returning the comments: $name = $_POST['name']; $company = $_POST['company']; $address = $_POST['address']; $city = $_POST['city']; $state = $_POST['state']; $zip = $_POST['zip']; $email = $_POST['email']; $optin = $_POST['optin']; $comments = $_POST['comments']; $body = Please send samples to: $name $company $address $city, $state $zip Email: $email Opt-In to occasional email list?: $optin Comments: $comments EOD; $headers = "From: $email\r\n"; $headers .= "Content-type: text/html\r\n"; $success = mail($webMaster, $emailSubject, $body, $headers); Is there a way to modify this code, or my HTML file to return the paragraph breaks?
