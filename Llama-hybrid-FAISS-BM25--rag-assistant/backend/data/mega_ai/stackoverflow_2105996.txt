Use a view: CREATE VIEW post_meta2 AS SELECT * FROM post_meta Then your query becomes: SELECT * FROM posts RIGHT OUTER JOIN post_meta ON posts.post_id = post_meta.post_id RIGHT OUTER JOIN post_meta2 ON posts.post_id = post_meta2.post_id WHERE post_meta.meta_key = "category" AND post_meta.meta_value = "technology" AND post_meta2.meta_key = "keyword" AND post_meta2.meta_value = "cloud" Yes, I know, it's crude. But effective nonetheless. If you want elegance then upgrade as has already been suggested, otherwise this should be sufficient for a temporary workaround.
