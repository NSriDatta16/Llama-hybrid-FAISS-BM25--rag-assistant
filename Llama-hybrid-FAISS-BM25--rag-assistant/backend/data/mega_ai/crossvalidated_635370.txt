I recommend you check this example from the Keras docs and see what you get at the output of the encoder. At the end of the page you can see a representation of the 2 dimensional latent space of the architecture that is defined previously in that article. Plus you can check this article about using VAEs for time series dimensionality reduction and feature extraction.
