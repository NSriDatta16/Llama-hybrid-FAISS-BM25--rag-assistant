Simplenote somehow does this on iOS 4. (There's a free/lite version in case you wanna try.) It acts a little bit different: When tapping on one of the highlighted parts, it still starts the editing, and won't follow the link. But when you tap-and-hold on a detected dataTpye, it shows yout the menu for calling, open the link or whatever. Also, when tapping inside the text the editing really starts at the place you tapped. So they somehow remove the dataDectectors, enable editing AND get the touches forwarded to the editable UITextview AFTER the tap is recognized. Any ideas how to do that? I thought about trying to use a Tap-Gesture-Recognizer with "delaysTouchesBegan = YES" and "cancelsTouchesInView = NO" So I can remove the dataConnectorTypes and set it editable on the action method of the recognizer, and hopefully the touches to the UITextview are delivered AFTER that. But haven't had time to test it so far.
