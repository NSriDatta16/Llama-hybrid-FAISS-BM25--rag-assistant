Targeting every object in an array syntax

Newb question of the day: I'm trying to select all the users with this condition, and then perform an action with each one : User.find(:all).select { |u| u.organizations.count > 0} do |user| Except, this isn't the right way to do this. Not entirely sure what the proper syntax is. Any fellow rubyist offer a newb a hand?
