Please specify the product's option(s) in Magento

Actually i am using Elias_configurablebundle plugin for the configurable product as associated of the Bundle Product and to display GRID * for the configurable associated products i am using magento mechanics grid. here i have merged both of the extensions it showing GRID on bundle view page but showing Please specify the product's option(s)* on click of the **Add To Cart . Although everything is fine, no required field left to fill out, i have applied any single custom options for any of the product. so here i want to remove this validation so then it will directly redirect to shopping cart page. Thanks
