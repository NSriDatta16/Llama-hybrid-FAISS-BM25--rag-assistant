This question is a little old, but maybe it is still relevant. As far as I understand your question, if you have $T$ data available, and are trying to predict observations in the future, surely you're "cheating" if you're using the whole data to "predict" $y_{t}$ with $t So, I don't think that that FFBS has an intrinsic "look-ahead bias". It just depends on how you use it. I think MCMC with Gibbs sampling should work well in estimating your model.
