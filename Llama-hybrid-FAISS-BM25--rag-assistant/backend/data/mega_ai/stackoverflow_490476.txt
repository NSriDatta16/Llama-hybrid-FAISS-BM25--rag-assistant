As for unit testing, you will need a fake HttpContext object (extend from HttpContextBase) and a fake session object (extend from SessionStateBase). Or you can do what we do, and use Phil Haacks HttpSimulator . Not a perfect solution, but there are so many tightly coupled objects that get wired together when you do anything with asp that you wont ever really find anything particularly elegant. We found we kept bumping into it so much that it was worth it to grab those classes and stick them in a helper library. Cookies work by domain, so there isn't really any problems around that. You can always configure session to be in-proc as well and cookieless. In general, be very sparse with what you keep in the session. But that goes for Webforms as well.
