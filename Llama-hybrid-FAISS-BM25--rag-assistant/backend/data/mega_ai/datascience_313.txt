Books about the "Science" in Data Science?

What are the books about the science and mathematics behind data science? It feels like so many "data science" books are programming tutorials and don't touch things like data generating processes and statistical inference. I can already code, what I am weak on is the math/stats/theory behind what I am doing. If I am ready to burn $1000 on books (so around 10 books... sigh), what could I buy? Examples: Agresti's Categorical Data Analysis , Linear Mixed Models for Longitudinal Data , etc... etc...
