onPause will always be called when your activity is no longer in the foreground, that's guaranteed. Maybe your _END_GAME is not false? Add a debug log output to your onPause method, you'll see that it always gets called. I should note though that displaying a dialog during onPause is extremely bad form - the user is trying to get rid of your app (could even be because of an incoming phone call). You DO NOT want a dialog then. That goes against the Android design. In fact, the Android OS will simply short-circuit your app if you try to do lengthy shenanigans in onDestroy or onPause. Basically, if those get called, you're supposed to disappear quietly. If you really want to intercept the back button, you can check for the button like Ted suggested, but keep in mind that your app can go to the background in many other ways - home button, selected notification, incoming phone call, etc.
