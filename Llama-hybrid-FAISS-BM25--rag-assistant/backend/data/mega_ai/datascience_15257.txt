Machine learning image training set data as whole object but finding part of object

If the images to test against are only part of the object, does it help to have training set data of the whole object, or is it better for all the training data to be parts of the object? For instance, if test pictures are the legs of a chair or the top of a chair, does it help to have training set image data of the entire chair? Or should I focus on only getting training set data of parts of the chair? I'm planning on using TensorFlow. I would be classifying the object as a chair, not part of a chair. But if it would give me a higher rate of recognizing chairs by having it recognize parts, it could recognize parts, and I could combine the information at the end. I only need to recognize at least one chair (or much more likely part of a chair) in the image.
