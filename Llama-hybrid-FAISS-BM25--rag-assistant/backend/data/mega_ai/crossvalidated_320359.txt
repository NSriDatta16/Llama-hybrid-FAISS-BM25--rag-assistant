Panel models are quite common in longitudinal SEM. It sounds like might be new to this approach to data analysis, so I would suggest Little (2013), which will give you good coverage of the basics of SEM, as well as an intro to panel models, specifically (and I'm sure many of the references throughout that chapter will be useful to you as more detail-oriented learning resources). In terms of software, unless I'm missing something, I'd expect most SEM software would be capable of addressing your needs. The lavaan() package (Rosseel, 2012)for R is about a user-friendly as it gets (syntax is very similar to Mplus, but unlike Mplus, it's free), and it can handle categorial endogenous variables (see categorical data analysis tutorial section for the package here ). If you're going to use lavaan(), Beaujean's (2014) book is also handy as an SEM primer that is lavaan()-specific. References Beaujean, A. A. (2014).
