Question about latent space for GANs

I am currently reading about GANs and I had a question about latent space. A site mentions: Latent space refers to an abstract multi-dimensional space containing feature values that we cannot interpret directly, but which encodes a meaningful internal representation of externally observed events. Furthermore, this answer mentions The latent space itself has no meaning. Typically it is a 100-dimensional hypersphere with each variable drawn from a Gaussian distribution From my understanding, certain points from the latent space are inputted through the generator model during training. If the latent space is just a Gaussian distribution, how does it encode "meaningful internal representation of externally observed events"?
