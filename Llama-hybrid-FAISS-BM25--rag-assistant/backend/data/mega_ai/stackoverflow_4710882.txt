I did it once with a 35MB SQLite database. What I did: 1.) I used a Windows Tool (I think it was TotalCommander) to split that *.db file into pieces of 1MB. 2.) I've put them in the assets folder. 3.) In my database helper class I moved these pieces together during first startup. It worked perfect and was fast enough. What you should think about: 1.) At one point you have 3* 50MB during startup on the internal storage so please consider using SD card for your database. 2.) At one point during update of your apps you have 4* 50MB on your device...
