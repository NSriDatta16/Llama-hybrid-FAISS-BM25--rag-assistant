Your best bet is to store the db on the external storage. If you use the built in (automagic) databases you won't be able to directly access the file. Once it's on the SDCard (or future storage options) you can just upload the file to the server using one of the standard HTTP libraries. One of the apps I've been working on does something similar, but in reverse. We're downloading a SQLite3 DB from a server then storing it to the external storage (SDCard).
