Custom user controls in WPF with vector graphics

I've created the graphics for the user control as a vector graphic and imported it into Expression Design. So far everything worked w/o problems. However I then exported it as XAML and opened it in VS. The XAML consists of a canvas and several Paths. I created a user control in XAML, now I want a mouse click event, which is triggered if the user clicks on any of these paths. I could attach the same event to every path, but it would be more elegant to group the paths, is there a way to do this? Also I was asking myself whether WPF can use a standard format for vector graphics like SVG. Below the XML code.
