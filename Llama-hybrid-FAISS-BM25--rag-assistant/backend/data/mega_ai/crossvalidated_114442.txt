Bayesian Spatial Prediction: What is f?

I'm working my way through Gelfand, A.E. & Li Zhu, B.P.C. (2001). On the change of support problem in spatio-temporal data. Biostatistics, 2:1, 31-45. I'm stuck at: This is absolutely the first mention of f anywhere in the paper. Can someone help me to identify it? Y = spatial process s = measured locations Beta, Theta = presumed coefficients for mean function and covariance function H = pairwise (?) covariance function
