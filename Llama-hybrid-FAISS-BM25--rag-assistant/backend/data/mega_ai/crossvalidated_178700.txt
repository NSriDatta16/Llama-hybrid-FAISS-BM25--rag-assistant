You're correct that understatements of imputation uncertainty is the reason that people use multiple imputation packages like MICE. I can't answer this question for the missForest example in particular, except to observe that by the same token that one might use multiple imputation in estimating a model, I see no reason to not use multiple missForest runs: the trees and bootstrap samples will be different (provided different random seeds), so you can quantify the uncertainty in your imputed data set this way. It sounds as though you have some strong notions of where and how the variables are related to each other, though, so perhaps a fully Bayesian approach is in order, wherein the modeling of missing data and the estimation of model parameters happens at the same time. One advantage to this approach is that uncertainty at all levels of the model -- parameter estimates and missing data imputation -- are all simultaneously accounted for, whereas in the standard imputation model, missing data is imputed and then models are estimated. The standard "two-stage" approach to imputation and modeling is what gives rise to the understatement of imputation uncertainty in the first place, so the Bayesian method avoids that entirely.
