Zend Soap Client error: Failed to enable crypto

Hey guys, I'm using the Zend Soap Client library to consume a webservice, like this: $wsdl = "path_to_wsdl_file"; $client = new Zend_Soap_Client($wsdl); $client->nfeRecepcaoLote(); And I'm receiving the following errors: Warning (2): SoapClient::__doRequest() [soapclient.--dorequest]: Failed to enable crypto [CORE/vendors/plugins/nfe/vendors/Zend/Soap/Client.php, line 987] Warning (2):SoapClient::__doRequest() [soapclient.--dorequest]: connect() failed: Unspecified error [CORE/vendors/plugins/nfe/vendors/Zend/Soap/Client.php, line 987 Does anyone know what it can possibly be? The host of the webservice is this: https://homologacao.nfe.ms.gov.br/homologacao/services/NfeRecepcao and I'm using PHP 5.2.6 and Ubuntu 9.10. Best regards, ZÃ©
