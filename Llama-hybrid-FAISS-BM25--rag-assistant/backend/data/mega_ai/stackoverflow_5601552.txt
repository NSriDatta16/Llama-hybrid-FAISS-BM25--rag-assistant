Trying to avoid multiple parent tables

A new requirement has come into an existing application. Current, we have an organization table, and it has a child table CalendarEvents. Now, the request is to allow either the User table, the Organization table, or the Division table own calendar events. I am thinking something needs to change because right now, this would leave me with creating the following table structure: Organization (organization_id) User (user_id, organization_id) Division (division_id), Calendar (calendar_id, organization_id, user_id, division_id), CalendarEvents (calendar_event_id, calendar_id) I am trying to avoid linking Calendar to multiple parents. Is there are better way to do this that I am missing? (An organization/user/division can have multiple calendars, but only one org/user/division can own a calendar) Thanks for any input.
