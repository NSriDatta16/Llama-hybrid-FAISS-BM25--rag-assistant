A partial workaround I've been using is to change the data directory so it is not so deeply buried (ie. D:\MySQL_Data). This makes it far easier to enter the path. Documentation: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/server-options.html#option_mysqld_datadir The downside is that all your data files will now need to live here also. I'm interested also to see if somebody has a more elegant solution.
