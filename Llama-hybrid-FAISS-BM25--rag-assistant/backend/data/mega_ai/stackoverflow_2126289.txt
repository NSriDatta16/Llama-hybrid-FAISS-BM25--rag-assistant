This is by no means a simple problem It is possible, but rarely done in practice because it's so much more complicated than a standard merge using N-scratch space. Huang and Langston's paper has been around since the late 80's, though practical implementations didn't really surface until later. Earlier, L. Trabb-Prado's paper in 1977 predates Huang and Langston significantly, but I'm challanged to find the exact text that paper; only references abound. An excellent later publication, Asymptotically efficient in-place merging (1995) by Geert, Katajainenb, and Pasanen is a good coverage of multiple algorithms, and references Trabb-Prado's contributions to the subject.
