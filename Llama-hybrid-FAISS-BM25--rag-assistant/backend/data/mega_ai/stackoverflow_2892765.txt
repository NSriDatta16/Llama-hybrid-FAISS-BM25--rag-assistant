When something urgently important happens in the programming world, where could I read it first? I doubt that there's a CNN for all of "programming". Maybe the reason that you haven't found it is that it doesn't really exist or your expectations need calibration. What are some good sites/communities around programming? I would say you're posting at one of the best.
