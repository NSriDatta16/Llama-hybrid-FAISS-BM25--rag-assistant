Aggregating time series data to one variable

I have got various time series data for different observations. I want to represent one time series observation by one aggregated variable . The easiest one is to take the mean of the time series, but mean does not capture the variations in the observation over time. I thought of computing the distance ( dist ) between an arbitrary reference and the time series data. I am curious to know if there is other technique that I could apply to fairly represent the time series observation by one aggregation variable ? Is there any R package that I can use? Thanks
