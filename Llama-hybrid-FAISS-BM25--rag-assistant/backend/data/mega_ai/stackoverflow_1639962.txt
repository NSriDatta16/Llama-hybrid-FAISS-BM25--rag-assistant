PATH_MAX is not always defined by including . If you want to use it, you probably need to fall back on the fragment: #include #ifndef PATH_MAX #define PATH_MAX _POSIX_PATH_MAX /* Or possibly _XOPEN_PATH_MAX */ #endif /* PATH_MAX */ Did you even include limits.h in your main program? If not, you need to do so.
