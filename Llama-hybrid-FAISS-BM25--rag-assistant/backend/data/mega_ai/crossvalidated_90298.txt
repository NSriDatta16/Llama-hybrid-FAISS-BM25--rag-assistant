How to do external validation of logistic regression models and perform model benchmarking

Quality assessment in trauma has for > 25 years been done with the US derived logistic regression model, the TRISS model. DV: survival/death and IVs: physiologic derangement (continuous), anatomic injury (continuous), age (dichotomous, >= 55, $$ Ps = \frac{\exp\big(b_0 + b_1{\rm (physiology)} + b_2{\rm (anatomy)} + b_3{\rm (age)}\big)}{1+\exp\big(b_0 + b_1{\rm (physiology)} + b_2{\rm (anatomy)} + b_3{\rm (age)}\big)} $$ Used worldwide with the US derived regression coefficients, updated in 2005 and in 2009, it has had huge impact in trauma research. Foreign institutions has been able to benchmark their performance towards the US standard by use of the W-statistic (with 95% CI), expressing excess (less) survivors per 100 patients in own institution vs. the US standard. (W = (actual number of survivors â€“ predicted number of survivors)/(number of patients/100). Some countries have used the same DV and IVs, however derived their own regression coefficients from their own population. Others have derived their own logistic regression model. We have recently derived our own logistic regression model with the same DV, but different IVs. We have also implemented the TRISS model in our registry with the national US IV, but with IV coefficients derived from our trauma population. Questions: I want to perform an external validation of the US model with national US IV regression coefficients. I want to compare the predictive ability/performance vs. our own model. How should we perform such a comparison? Compare ROC curves, deviance, or AIC? Is it a meaningful comparison? I want to perform an external validation of the US model, however with IV regression coefficients derived from our trauma population. I want to compare the predictive ability/performance vs. our own model. How should we perform such a comparison? Compare ROC curves, deviance, or AIC? Is this a more relevant comparison? How can we tell whether differences are significant or not? What about using Net Reclassification Improvement? I want to decide which model fits our data best. How? Can other institutions use our model for benchmarking?
