Python Lxml (objectify): Checking whether a tag exists

I need to check whether a certain tag exists in an xml file. For example, I want to see if the tag exists in this snippet: Hi ... Currently, I am using an ugly hack with error checking, like this: try: if root.elem1.tag: foo = elem1 except AttributeError: foo = "error finding elem1" I also want to customize the string if it is unable to find the node (i.e. "unable to find -tagname-"). I have to check a long list of variables, and I don't want to repeat the code 100 times. Any suggestions? Edit: Here is a snip of the actual xml file: Dvaered -1000.000000 0 Empire 100.000000 2 I want to check whether the tag exists, and, if so, to get the contents. Edit edit: Ok, I am going to combine two of the answers, but I can only vote for one. Sorry. Edit 3: Related question about XPath here: Python lxml (objectify): Xpath troubles
