Should I resize my test images when feeding to a CNN model?

I am new to deep learning, I have made my first CNN network which accepts an input of (32,32,3) while training. Now I want to test some random images on my trained model. Do I have to resize my test images to (32,32,3) . OR Can I leave the images as it is. OR Can I resize all of them to a higher resolution? Plz give reasons.
