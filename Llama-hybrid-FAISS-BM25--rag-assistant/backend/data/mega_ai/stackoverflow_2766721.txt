MDF and LDF Files size

I was wondering if there was any recommended max size for MDF and/or LDF Files for an SQL server instance. For example, if I want to create a 400 GBytes Database, is there a rule to help me decide how many mdf files I should create ? or should I just go ahead and create a single gigantic 400Gbytes mdf file? If so is this going to somehow affect the database performances ?
