JasperReports rendering issue

I have a very weird JasperReports rendering problem. I am using an old version of the free Java Reporting Tool JasperReports : 1.3.4. It's being heavily used on a Swing finance application. I use JasperViever class to show a preview of the report to print, and my weird problem is that the report shows perfectly fine on some computers while it erases some end-paragraph-lines in others. Paragraph is laid out on the title section and it's four or five lines length. It's being rendered from a string field value. All computers run the exact same version of the application, compiled report, operating system (Windows XP) and Java Virtual Machine (1.6.0). What is JasperReports' JasperViewer class using to render the report that is causing different outcomes with different computers? Different installed fonts on Windows? Different Video Cards? One more thing to it: if I export the report to a PDF or HTML, the problem disappears. The resulted file I generate on every computer shows every single line of the paragraph. So I know the info is there. It's just not being rendered on some computers when I user JasperViewer class. When I print it, I get exactly what JasperViewer class shows on preview. My reports are displaying loan contracts to print them and hand them to customers. So it's extremely important to have them complete! :-)
