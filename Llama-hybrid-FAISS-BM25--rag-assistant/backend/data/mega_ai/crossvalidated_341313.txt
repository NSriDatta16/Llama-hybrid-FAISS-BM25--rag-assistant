The AutoCorrelation Function and Partial AutoCorrelation Function pertain to the correlation of a time series with itself at different lags. They are used to detect non-independence & suggest p, d, q terms in the Box-Jenkins approach to ARIMA modeling. Typically, ACF and PACF are plotted and the plots are inspected visually, but numerical summaries are also used.
