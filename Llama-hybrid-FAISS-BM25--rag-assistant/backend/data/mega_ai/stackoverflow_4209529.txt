In your case I don't think you want "agent driven negotiation". In your case, your server should be able to select the redirect location from the accept-lang header. I think you can use the 303 redirect. Agent driven negotiation is only used when the server does not know what the representation the client wants. In those cases, the server would return a list of links with the different options available. The agent would then select representation it wants. You would use agent driven negotiation if you wanted some javascript code to process the 300 response and display a list of options to the user so that the user can select the desired language.
