Filesystem calls on Linux are encoding-agnostic, i.e. they do not (need to) know about the particular encoding. As far as they are concerned, the byte-string pointed to by the filename argument is passed down to the filesystem as-is. The filesystem expects that filenames are in the correct encoding (usually UTF-8, as mentioned by Matthew Talbert). This means that you often don't need to do anything (filenames are treated as opaque byte-strings), but it really depends on where you receive the filename from, and whether you need to manipulate the filename in any way.
