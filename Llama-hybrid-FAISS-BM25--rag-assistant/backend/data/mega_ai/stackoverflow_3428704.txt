Java Web Start applications ask repeatedly for un-existing files

All my application I make with NetBeans as a Java Web Start applications behave quite strangely. When I run them as a normal application, everything works. But when I compile them as java web start apps, they, after the java web start is done with loading, repeatedly ask server for libraries on the wrong place. It doesn't seem to matter in small projects, but it makes a huge time difference in large projects (see my first question). I put a simple NetBeans project here . It should paint a window with a button that does nothing at all. (if you try to put it somewhere, upload the dist folder somewhere and edit the .jnlp file) You can see from the logs (in logs.txt) that the libs are first downloaded fine from /awindow_dist/lib/ , but then there comes a lot of requests to the wrong place, /awindow_dist/ . What can be wrong? Everything seems to be configured fine. Is it a NetBeans bug? A WebStart bug? Or my fault somehow?
