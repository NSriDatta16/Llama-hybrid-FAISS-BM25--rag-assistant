Magento Bundled Product Restrictions

We need to represent computer systems on our Magento site. We're going to use bundled products to represent these systems. We'd like certain computer systems to have various options available (for example, mainboard, RAM, CPU, etc.). However, we want to prevent our customers from configuring the system with incompatible parts (i.e. using DDR2 RAM in a mainboard that only supports DDR). This doesn't seem to be possible in stock Magento. Is there an extension out there that allows you to configure compatibility between bundled product options? I'd like to know before I try tackling this on my own.
