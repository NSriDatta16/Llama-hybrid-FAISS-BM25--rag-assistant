Noninformative prior for Gaussian precision as the special case of Gamma distribution with both parameters being zero

The question is from page 120 of book "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" by Christopher M. Bishop. I excerpt it as follows: The definition of gamma distribution $\textrm{Gam}(\lambda|a_0,b_0)$ in Eq (2.146) is as follows: As the book says, the noninformative prior for precision $\lambda$ is $$p(\lambda)\propto1/\lambda.$$ By the book, this prior distribution is a special case of $\textrm{Gam}(\lambda|a_0,b_0)$ when $a_0=b_0=0$ . To make the exponential of $\lambda$ equal to -1, I understand that $a$ should be 0 in Eq (2.146). To remove the exponential factor in Eq (2.146), I understand that $b$ should be 0. But how about $\Gamma(a)$ in Eq (2.146)? We know $\Gamma(0)$ is infinity, so when $a_0=b_0=0$ , the right side of Eq (2.146) reduces to constant 0, not $1/\lambda$ . So, how to understand that noninformative prior $1/\lambda$ is the special case of $\textrm{Gam}(\lambda|a_0,b_0)$ when $a_0=b_0=0$ ? Thanks.
