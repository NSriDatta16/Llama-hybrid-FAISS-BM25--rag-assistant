How do you disable all styles on an element ? Any property to set all attributes of an element to none all in one go?

I am embedding telerik's radEditor in my page..its inheriting css properties from the master page..like H2 is in blue color..its got background color... what should I type in my custom css class (the one exclusively made for radEditor) so it over rides ALL the Master page's css properties and applies nothing to heading tags?? I wrote this:- h2{color:black;background-image:none;} still h2 tag doesn't appear smaller that H1 tag in the drop down list in my radEditor..it still is applying css from master page..do I need to search for ALL the attributes being applied in master page and set them to none one by one in my custom css file ?/
