For small objects, the Java serialised form is likely to be dominated by the description of the serialised classes. You may be able to write out serialised data for commonly used classes, and then use that as a common prefix for a series of serialised streams. Note that this is very fragile, and you'll probably want to recompute and check it for each class loader instance.
