ANN vs RNN for time-series prediction?

The basic argument against ANN for time-series is that there is no conception of time for the inputs. However, it is obvious that one can feed multiple time-steps into an ANN by using various lag lengths where the features are just various lagged series. And "long term" memory one could include the feature of a moving average. I understand RNN's have ability to work with variable length input. But given the case of an ANN with lookback lags and a fixed-window, what is the advantage of the RNN over the ANN?
