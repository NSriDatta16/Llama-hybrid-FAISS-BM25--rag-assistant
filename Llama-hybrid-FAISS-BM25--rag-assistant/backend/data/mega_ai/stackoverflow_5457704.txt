Unfortunately it isn't possible to inherit from the SPCalculatedField class, which is why you are receiving that error: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.sharepoint.spfieldcalculated.aspx Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 does not support inheriting from this class. In order to display an image based on another column's value in 2007 you're going to have to do some unpleasant CAML work in the fldtypes...xml (As @David A mentions). Here's a good place to start: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa544291.aspx I'm also going to innocently mention that there might be commercial alternatives with this functionality, one of which I might have helped create, and may have mentioned here: Sharepoint webpart for conditional formatting?
