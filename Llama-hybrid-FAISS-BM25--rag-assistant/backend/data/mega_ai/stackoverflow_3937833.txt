Social network visualization tools for PHP/JavaScript

I'm looking for a tool that will allow me to display visualizations of social networks dynamically online. There are a lot of great visualization examples out there already: http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/the_best_tools_for_visualization.php http://socialmediatrader.com/10-amazing-visualizations-of-social-networks/ I know lots of sites have specific widgets (such as last.fm), but what I want is a flexible tool that I can integrate with my own database of people and organizations. At the most basic level, I need something that will show lines/arcs/edges between people and/or organizations, and include the ability to manipulate width, color, length, etc, or lines. I'm aware of some tools such as XML/SWF Charts http://www.maani.us/xml_charts/index.php , but not sure that tool includes the ability to visualize social networks. I'm most proficient in PHP/JavaScript/CSS, but would also appreciate hearing any suggestions for Python.
