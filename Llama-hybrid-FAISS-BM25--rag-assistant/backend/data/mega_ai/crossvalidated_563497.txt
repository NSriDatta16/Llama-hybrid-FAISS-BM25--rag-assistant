Can I use the likelihood to estimate probability of draws

I need to estimate $P(data)$ for a Bayesian problem, supposing I have the distribution on which the data are being drawn, can I use the likelihood to estimate that? I'm asking because as far as I know, likelihood is not a probability, but for discrete rv it's like considering $$ P(X_1=x_1 \cap X_2=x_2 \cap ... \cap X_n=x_n) \; \;X_i \:iid $$ But we can't do this for abs. continuous rv right? So in addition to the previous one, how can we estimate $P(data)$ for abs. cont. rv? I'm referring to: $$ P(hyp|data) = \frac{P(data|hyp) * P(hyp)}{P(data)} $$
