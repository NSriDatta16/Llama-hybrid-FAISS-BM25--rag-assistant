With this structure of the data, I would build a discrete time hazard model. The literature on those is quite raw on the web, since I last searched about it. But it boils down to logistic regression where each row is a period (day, minute, etc...). In response variable,for each subject(machine in your case), you have a zero, indicating that the subject did not experience the event (the machine wasn't ready at that period) and in the last observation you have a 1 indicating the machine was ready in that period, and then no more rows for that observation. Here is a quick artificial dataset I built in R with this structure. library(reprex) library(tidyverse) set.seed(11) tibble(time=(1:6)) %>% crossing(machine = LETTERS[0:10]) %>% arrange(machine) %>% mutate(time_varying_covar = runif(n())) %>% group_by(machine) %>% mutate(finished_at = runif(1, 0, max(time))) %>% mutate(non_time_varying_covar = rnorm(1, 10, 3)) %>% mutate(not_finished = time % mutate(response = cumsum(!not_finished)) %>% filter(response % select(time, machine, response, finished_at, time_varying_covar, non_time_varying_covar) #> # A tibble: 29 x 6 #> # Groups: machine [10] #> time machine response finished_at time_varying_covar non_time_varying_covar #> #> 1 1 A 1 0.808 0.277 11.5 #> 2 1 B 0 4.51 0.0865 9.44 #> 3 2 B 0 4.51 0.290 9.44 #> 4 3 B 0 4.51 0.881 9.44 #> 5 4 B 0 4.51 0.123 9.44 #> 6 5 B 1 4.51 0.175 9.44 #> 7 1 C 0 1.04 0.907 14.6 #> 8 2 C 1 1.04 0.851 14.6 #> 9 1 D 0 3.48 0.158 8.17 #> 10 2 D 0 3.48 0.480 8.17 #> # â€¦ with 19 more rows Created on 2020-10-28 by the reprex package (v0.3.0) With this structure, you can model: the effect of time in how likely it is for a subject to experience the event at that period as well as the effect of time varying predictors and non time varying predictors model subject specific effects through mixed/hierarchical modeling You can learn more about those models in Part II of Applied Longitudinal Data Analysis by Singer and Willett .
