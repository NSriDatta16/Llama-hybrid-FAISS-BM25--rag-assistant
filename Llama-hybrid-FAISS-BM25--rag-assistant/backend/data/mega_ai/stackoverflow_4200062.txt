How to create an iPhone multi-branded App?

I'm going to develop an iPhone app, and want to make sure what I want to do is possible, and will be approved by Apple. I'm going to create an app that will be fully branded on per submission basis. I want to have one app per customer (our customers are companies) with their logo, skin, etc. This apps will be downloaded and installed by the employees of each one of our customers. In other words, we would use the same base code (logic doesn't change), but will brand it for each customer. Something similar to what Magento (http://www.magentocommerce.com/product/mobile) does, they created an Ecommerce mobile app, and they brand it to their customer, but the app logic remains the same. Would Apple consider this as duplicate apps? what is the best way to do it? Thanks in advance.
