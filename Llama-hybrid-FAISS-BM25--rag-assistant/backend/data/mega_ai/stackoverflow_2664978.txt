Edit: I've realized that you're not asking about drag and drop , but rather about moving your form around the screen. (Thanks to @Veer.) I've edited your question to help clarify this. Drag and drop is a completely different thing, since it is dragging information from one control to another. The same principle of my answer still applies though, since mouse events are also handled at the Control level - you might need to handle the mouse events from PanelB as well.
