Well obvious first, have you tried explicitly telling the file to flush? I also think there might be some ioctl you can use to do it, but I honestly haven't done much C/POSIX file programming. Seeing you're on a Linux kernel you should be able to tune and rebuild the kernel to something that suits your needs better, eg. much more frequent but then also smaller flushes to the permanent storage. A quick check in my man pages finds this: SYNC(2) Linux Programmerâ€™s Manual SYNC(2) NAME sync - commit buffer cache to disk SYNOPSIS #include void sync(void); Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)): sync(): _BSD_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 500 DESCRIPTION sync() first commits inodes to buffers, and then buffers to disk. ERRORS This function is always successful.
