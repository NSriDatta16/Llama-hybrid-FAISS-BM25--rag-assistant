How are you getting that 99% AUC on your training data? Be aware that there's a difference between predict(model) and predict(model, newdata=train) when getting predictions for the training dataset. The first option gets the out-of-bag predictions from the random forest. This is generally what you want, when comparing predicted values to actuals on the training data. The second treats your training data as if it was a new dataset, and runs the observations down each tree. This will result in an artificially close correlation between the predictions and the actuals, since the RF algorithm generally doesn't prune the individual trees, relying instead on the ensemble of trees to control overfitting. So don't do this if you want to get predictions on the training data.
