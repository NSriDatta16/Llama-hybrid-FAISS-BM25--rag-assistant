Before you consider which strategies are appropriate, you need to consider what constraints describe the motion of both obstacles and the vehicle, generally those constraints are combined into a set of differential equations. Without this information, it isn't possible to make any reasonable recommendation. Kalman filters are an optimal predictor for a linear system, or systems that can be approximated about one or more points with linear systems. EKFs or UKFs are more commonly used for non-linear systems. Neural Networks and Evolutionary algorithms are probably not worth considering - there are much better solutions for the obstacle tracking problem. Pure obstacle avoidance goes back to old school robotics with minimal computational resources. This includes Brook's Subsumption architecture and Khatib's Potential Fields. However, most of the effort of collision avoidance systems isn't actually related to avoiding obstacles, but rather on planning efficient paths between configurations (or states). The current state of the art for vehicular planning (as used for the DARPA urban challenge and some JPL rovers), appears to be a hybrid of offline kinodynamic trajectory generation and the D*-Lite algorithm.
