CharMatcher's precomputed() method ( source ) is a nice "hidden feature" I stumbled upon the other day. It's really just an optimization, that creates a lookup table (using a bit array), and then simply looks up characters to see if they "match". It's the kind of hidden optimization you can leverage when you use a library, that you might not have thought of yourself in your own code. Of course, if you create a complex CharMatcher, which you plan to use many times, you must remember to call the precomputed() method, like: CharMatcher complexMatcher = CharMatcher.anyOf("cat") .or(CharMatcher.DIGIT) .or(CharMatcher.WHITESPACE) .precomputed();
