ok, themes and mobile versions are two different beasts, lets start with themes lets say you have a ?theme=black and a ?theme=white theme and a default theme. google does not care about your themes, as different themes just offer the same content in blue (or black, or whatever). this is a typical case of douplicate content. so if you want to offer the users this option you should save it in the session. www.example.com/?theme=black -> sets theme in session -> redirect HTTP 301 to -> www.example.com/ the "link" the users clicks should best be an external javascript (so that google can't easily discover that redirect link) Black so basically you offer google just the default version of your site, hide the themes (as they do not offer different content for google). ok, about the mobile case. if the HTML of the mobile site is optimized for mobile devices you might want to offer it to googlebot mobile. so you could do user agent detection (is this a mobile site) and redirect your mobile users to a mobile site i.e.: m.example.com (if it's a site optimized like this http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=72462&from=40348&rd=1 and not only a smartphone optimized page) - then you should redirect googlebot mobile (not googlebot, just googlebot mobile) also to m.example.com (there is a whole chapter in googles seo guideline on how to do this http://www.google.com/webmasters/docs/search-engine-optimization-starter-guide.pdf )
