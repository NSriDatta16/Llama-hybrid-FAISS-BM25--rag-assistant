How to connect data-mining with machine learner process

I want to write a data-mining service in Google Go which collects data through scraping and APIs. However as Go lacks good ML support I would like to do the ML stuff in Python. Having a web background I would connect both services with something like RPC but as I believe that this is a common problem in data science I think that there is some better solution. For example most (web) protocols lack at: buffering between processes clustering over multiple instances So what (type of libraries) do data scientists use to connect different languages/processes? Bodo
