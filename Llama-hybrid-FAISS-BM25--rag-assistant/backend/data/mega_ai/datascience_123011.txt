eval_metric of XGBoost // ML model in general

Say I am using Xgboost on a binary classification task. eval_metric is one of the model parameter. How should I think about the impact of using different eval_metric(e.g rmse/mae/logloss) in general? Is there a guide on using each of them under different scenario?
