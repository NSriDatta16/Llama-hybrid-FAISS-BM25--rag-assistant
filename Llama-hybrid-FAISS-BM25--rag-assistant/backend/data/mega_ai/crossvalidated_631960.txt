Relative Risk or Odds ratio using machine learning

I am thinking of using machine learning type classification models to compare them with the traditional approach of logistic regression (dichotomous outcome) in a sample of patients with diabetic foot where the dependent variable (y) would be the level of severity of diabetic foot: low (reference) , high(1). Then, it would have many dependent variables such as age, sex, blood glucose, cholesterol, glycosylated hemoglobin, etc. My question is, apart from obtaining precision metrics in Machine Learning classification (ROC, sensitivity, accuracy etc), is it possible to obtain some odds ratio or relative risk with the top machine learning models in benchmarking?
