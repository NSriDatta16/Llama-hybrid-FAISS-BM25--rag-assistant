Silverlight RichTextBox: How to set custom font from resource/stream?

Does anybody know how to set the font within a RichTextBox from a Stream ? TextBlock and TextBox do have the option to set the FontSource , but classes like Run , Paragraph and the whole RichTextBox miss that. :( Any reason for that? Is there any known way to achieve that? I already tried to set the whole source URI within the FontFamily but that does not seem to work on external sources, just for internal URI addresses like /SilverlightFontTest;component/GRAFFITO_01.ttf#Graffito . I cannot find any further information what to try next or how to go on, please help me. Kind Regards, Bastian
