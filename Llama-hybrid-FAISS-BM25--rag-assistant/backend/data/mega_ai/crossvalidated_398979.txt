It may help to remember how the hazard function is defined: $ h(t) = \frac{f(t)}{S(t)}$ where $f(t)$ is either the probability density function for continuous random variables or probability mass function for a discrete random variables, and $S(t)$ is the survival function, i.e., 1 - CDF. One can see right away that the hazard function at $t = 0$ is just equal to $f(0)$ , as $S(0) = t$ for general survival analysis distributions. In other words, it sounds like you are not interested in the survival analysis part of the problem at all, you are just interested in the probability of immediate damage and don't really care about the probability of failure beyond the first unit of time. If that's the case, this isn't really a survival analysis problem and you probably just want to use tools designated for estimating probabilities, i.e., logistic regression.
