Threads exist to make the employment of multiple agents easier to program. If the agents are users, like if you have a thread-per-user, they make it easier to write the program. This is not a performance issue, it is an ease-of-writing issue. If the agents are I/O devices, they make it easy to write a program that does I/O in parallel. This may or may not be done for performance. If the agents are CPU cores, they make it easy to write programs that get multiple cores cranking in parallel. That is when threads correlate with performance. In other words, if you think threads==parallelism==performance, that's only hitting one of the uses of threads.
