Your model makes predictions by week. At the end of the week, you can compare the model's forecast to the actual sales and compute your loss function of choice on these data. 1a. Yes, continuing to use the same loss function is a good idea because then you know when your model starts to drift. Evaluating a model on a new criteria is a bad idea because you have no baseline. You could probably leverage some theory to say "my expected out of sample loss is between [x,y]. Once the model performance deviates from this interval, then I will retrain". The answer to this question perhaps deserves its own post. I'm sure someone has addressed model drift before on these forums, but I can't find a specific post. If the item is sold out, then the ground truth seems pretty apparent to me. If your model does not take account of inventory, that is a model limitation and not a problem to be addressed in model evaluation.
