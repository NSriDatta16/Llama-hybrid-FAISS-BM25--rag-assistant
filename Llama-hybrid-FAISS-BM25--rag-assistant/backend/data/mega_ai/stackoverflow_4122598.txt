This tends to catch people out. You would think it would take O(N^2) time since you reason adding takes O(N) time and you have O(N) elements. However, realise each element can only be added once and removed once. So in total it takes O(N) to slide over the whole array A . This yields an amortised efficiency of O(1) every time you move the sliding window on by one element. In other words, the average time it takes to move the sliding window by one element is O(1) .
