There is a post from Jesse Liberty dealing with this issue. In a few words, the idea is that you can't, because you would be forcing any content in the button to have a specific foreground colour, and that decision should be left to the content itself. Anyway, perhaps you may want to take a look at the concept of hijacking dependency properties, which is using another property of the same type for what you want. It isn't a nice practice, but will certainly work.
