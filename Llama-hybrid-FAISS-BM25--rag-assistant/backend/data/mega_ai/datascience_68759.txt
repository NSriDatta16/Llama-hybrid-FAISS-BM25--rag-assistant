Random Forest Target/prediction maximum minimum

I have a regression random forest that is targeting a continuous variable (sales amount). Is there any configuration for the classifier that allows me to set a maximum and a minimum for the target? Example: Predicted sales_amount should be between $10000$ and $20000$ .
