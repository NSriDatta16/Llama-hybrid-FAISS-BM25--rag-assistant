Variance of average of $n$ correlated random variables

Reading about deep leaning, I came across the following formula. $$ \mbox{var} \left( \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i \right) = \rho \sigma^2 + \frac{1-\rho}{n} \sigma^2 $$ where $X_1, \dots, X_n$ are identically distributed random variables with pairwise correlation $\rho > 0$ and variance $\mbox{var}(X_i) = \sigma^2$ . How to derive this? How does bootstrap aggregating alleviate the effect of overfitting, according to this formula? What is the relationsip?
