OpenGL game written in C with a Cocoa front-end I want to port to Windows

I'm wondering if someone could offer me some tips on how to go about this. I have a MacOS X OpenGL game that is written in very portable C with the exception of the non-game-play GUI. So in Cocoa I set up the window and OpenGL context, manage preferences, registration, listen for keystrokes etc. But all of the drawing and processing of input is handled in nice portable C. So I want to port to Windows. I figured the obvious way to go about was to use the Win32 api. Then I started to read a primer on Win32 and began to wonder if maybe life isn't too short. Can I do this in C# (without converting the backend to C#)? I'd rather devote the time to learning C# than Win32. Any suggestions would be most welcome. I really don't know a lick about Windows. The last version I regularly used was 3.1...
