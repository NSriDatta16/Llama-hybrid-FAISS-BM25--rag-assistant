The Bayesian framework is tightly coupled to general critical thinking skills. It's what you need in the following situations: You think about applying for a competitive job. What are your chances of getting in? What payoff do you expect from applying? A headline tells you mobile phones cause cancer in humans in the long term. How much evidence do they have for this? Which charity should you donate money to if you want it to have the greatest effect? Someone offers to flip a coin with a bet of \$0.90 from you and \$1.10 from them. Would you give them the money? Why, why not? You've lost your keys (or an atom bomb). Where do you start looking? Also, this is much more interesting than memorising the formula for a two sample t-test :p. Which increases the chance that students will stay interested long enough to bother with increasingly technical material.
