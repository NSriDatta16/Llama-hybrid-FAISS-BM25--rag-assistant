Entity Framework newbie question. I select a table from the wizard, but nothing shows up

I create a new .edmx and the wizard allows me to choose the tables I want to expose after I pick my connection. I pick one table, and nothing shows on the design surface. The model explorer opens but nothing seems to have happened. Any ideas what's going here? There is a message on the design surface that says use the toolbox. I can drag items on but I don't seem to be getting the experience I've had in the past with LinqToSql. Am I doing something wrong? In SSMS, I seem to have all the rights I need using Windows Auth. Any ideas what I can try to correct this? happy Friday and thanks for any tips. Cheers, ~ck in San Diego
