The Hodges-Lehmann statistic is the estimator associated with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Form the $n(n+1)/2$ pairwise averages $(x_i + x_j)/2$ for $i \leq j = 1, \dots, n$; take the median; and there you are. I strongly suspect there's a procedure in SPSS for it, although a quick search of the web didn't turn up anything, and in R there's the exactRankTests package with wilcox.test in it, which function has an option that will return both the point estimate and a confidence interval. Edit: I notice that although exactRankTests is still available, it's not being developed any more and the coin package is recommended instead. It, too, has wilcox.test , and the syntax looks the same.
