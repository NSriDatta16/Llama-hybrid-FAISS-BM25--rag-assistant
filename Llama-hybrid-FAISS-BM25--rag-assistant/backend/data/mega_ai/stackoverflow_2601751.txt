Initialization of objects in the background

I need to initialize few objects, it can take a while so I want to do it in some background thread. I also want to display progressBar showing what is the progress of initialization. What is the most elegant way to do it? I was thinking about an interface: interface ILoadable { int Progress { get; } event EventHandler Loaded; }
