The problem as you wisely pointed out is the "overfitting" caused by fixed list-based procedures. A smart way is to try and keep the equation simple when you have a negligible amount of data. I have found after many moons that if you simply use an AR(1) model and leave the rate of adaption ( the ar coefficient) to the data things can work out reasonably well. For example if the estimated ar coefficient is close to zero this means that the overall mean would be appropriate . if the coefficient is near +1.0 then this means that the last value (adjusted for a constant is more appropriate . If the coefficient is close to -1.0 then the negative of the last value (adjusted for a constant) would be the best forecast. If the coefficient is otherwise it means that a weighted average of the recent past is appropriate. This is precisely what AUTOBOX starts with and then discards anomalies as it fine tunes the estimated parameter when a "small # of observations" is encountered. This is an example of the "art of forecasting" when a pure data driven approach might be inapplicable. Following is an automatic model developed for the 12 data points without concern for anomalies. with Actual/Fit and Forecast here and residual plot here
