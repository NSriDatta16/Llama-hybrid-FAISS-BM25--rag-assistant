Alternative to ui:fragment in JSF

I'm searching a supported way to render a section of code in JSF, I usually use this approach: Since ui:fragment doesn't support rendered most of IDE (like netbeans mark it as error BUT it works because in JSF parameters are inherited. One way to solve this is to use another structure (for example if you use SEAM) you can use .... Another way is to set the rendered in all inner content like this: But I don't like this way because you have to add the rendered to each element. Another way would be to use BUT c:if remove the elements from the JSF tree and that not what you always want to do especially if you use AJAX. So you guys have another solutions?
