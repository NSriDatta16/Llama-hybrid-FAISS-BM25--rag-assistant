Organisational project management for Open Source work

As a small company we do work a lot on open source code. (http://Github.com/agiliq). I want a tool which we can use to do project management and task tracking for our open source code and work. Features Should integrate well with Github (See below) Commits to Github should update the project management tool. Logging a ticket in Github should start a task here. Should work for closing too. Public mode so tasks and discussion here should be visible on public site.
