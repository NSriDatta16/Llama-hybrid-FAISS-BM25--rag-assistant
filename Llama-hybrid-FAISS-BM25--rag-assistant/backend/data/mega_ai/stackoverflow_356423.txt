Infragistics UltraWebGrid - Footer Totals

I am currently using the UltraWebGrid control of Infragistics and I am displaying the sum of values of a column in the footer. The problem is that, since I am using paging, the total displayed in the footer is being calculated by the values of the current page only , but I want the sum of all the elements in the source, not just the current page Has anyone experienced this issue before ? Here is the code: myGrid.Columns.FromKey("NoOfSubs").Footer.Total = UltraWebGrid.SummaryInfo.Sum myGrid.Columns.FromKey("NoOfSubs").Footer.Formula = "SUM([NoOfSubs])" myGrid is the UltraWebGridControl
