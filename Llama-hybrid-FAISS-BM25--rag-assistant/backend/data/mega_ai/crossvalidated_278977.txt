CNN: ReTraining and Fine Tuning

I am getting into CNNs for several months already, and I am currently wondering myself if there is a difference between Retraining a DCNN and Fine Tuning it ? I am working on a project in which my own new dataset is relatively small and very different from the original one. Then I don't really understand new what I have to look for.
