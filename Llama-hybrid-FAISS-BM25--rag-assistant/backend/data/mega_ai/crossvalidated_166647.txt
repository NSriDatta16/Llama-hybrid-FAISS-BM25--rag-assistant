ARIMA-GARCH parameter estimation

I fitted an ARIMA model on a time series and then did an ARCH-LM Test which shows heteroscedasticity. So I want to get an ARIMA-GARCH model. My question: Do I need to reestimate the parameters of ARIMA (that I got initially without GARCH) together with the GARCH parameters, or do I keep the same ARIMA parameters and only estimate GARCH parameters?
