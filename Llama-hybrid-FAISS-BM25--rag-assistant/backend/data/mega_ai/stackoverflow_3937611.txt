Based on my experience, I'd avoid like the plague creating a class hierarchy where a 3D point IS-A 2D point. It makes it far too easy for 3D points to unintentionally and silently be treated as 2D points. Better to keep coordinates of different dimensionality distinct types (as per GMan's answer) and require explicit coercion between types. My current favourite implementation of this sort of thing is provided by Eigen . Even if it's license (LGPL) limits it's use to you, I'd suggest taking a look at it's elegantly templated vector and matrix types and learning from them.
