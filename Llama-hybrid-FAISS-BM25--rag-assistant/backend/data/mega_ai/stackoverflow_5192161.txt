Why can’t printf be formatted with an array of ints?

I want to format an output string with a series of variables. When I use an array of strings, this works as expected: String[] myArray = new String[3]; // fill array with strings System.out.printf("1: %s \n2: %s \n3: %s\n", myArray); I want to use this to print the results of simulated dice-throws, so I use an array of ints. However, this doesn’t work: int[] myArray = new int[3]; // fill array with numbers System.out.printf("1: %d \n2: %d \n3: %d\n", myArray); Exception in thread "main" java.util.IllegalFormatConversionException: d != [I Of course, I could use myArray[0] etc. for every element, but this doesn’t seem very elegant. Why is this so and how can I achieve the desired result?
