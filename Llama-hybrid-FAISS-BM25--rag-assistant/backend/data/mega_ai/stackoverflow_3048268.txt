Online job-searching is tedious. Help me automate it

Many job sites have broken searches that don't let you narrow down jobs by experience level. Even when they do, it's usually wrong. This requires you to wade through hundreds of postings that you can't apply for before finding a relevant one, quite tedious. Since I'd rather focus on writing cover letters etc., I want to write a program to look through a large number of postings, and save the URLs of just those jobs that don't require years of experience. I don't require help writing the scraper to get the html bodies of possibly relevant job posts. The issue is accurately detecting the level of experience required for the job. This should not be too difficult as job posts are usually very explicit about this ("must have 5 years experience in..."), but there may be some issues with overly simple solutions. In my case, I'm looking for entry-level positions. Often they don't say "entry-level", but inclusion of the words probably means the job should be saved. Next, I can safely exclude a job the says it requires "5 years" of experience in whatever, so a regex like /\d\syears/ seems reasonable to exclude jobs. But then, I realized some jobs say they'll take 0-2 years of experience, matches the exclusion regex but is clearly a job I want to take a look at. Hmmm, I can handle that with another regex. But some say "less than 2 years" or "fewer than 2 years". Can handle that too, but it makes me wonder what other patterns I'm not thinking of, and possibly excluding many jobs. That's what brings me here, to find a better way to do this than regexes, if there is one. I'd like to minimize the false negative rate and save all the jobs that seem like they might not require many years of experience. Does excluding anything that matches /[3-9]\syears|1\d\syears/ seem reasonable? Or is there a better way? Training a bayesian filter maybe? Edit: There's a similar, but harder problem, which would probably be more useful to solve. There are lots of jobs that just require an "engineering degree", as you just have to understand a few technical things. But searching for "engineering" gives you thousands of jobs, mostly irrelevant. How do I narrow this down to just those jobs that require any engineering degree, rather than particular degrees, without looking at each myself?
