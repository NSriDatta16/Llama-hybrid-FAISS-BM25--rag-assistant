You can use the standard difference in differences framework. Given that you treatment happens at the county level, the aggregate regression will estimate the same coefficient as the individual level regression. If $g = 1$ is a dummy for people who live in the treated county ($g=0$ are the control counties) and $t = 1$ is the post treatment period (with $t=0$ being the pre-treatment period), your difference in differences estimate is $$ E[y_i|g=1, t=1] - E[y_i|g=1, t=0] - (E[y_i|g=0, t=1] - E[y_i|g=0, t=0])$$ where $y_i$ is the outcome of interest and $E$ is the expectations operator. So you take the difference of the pre- and post-treatment period average of the outcome in the treatment group and subtract from that the difference of the pre- and post-treatment period average in the control group. Whether you do this at the individual level or county level will give the same point estimate but the standard errors will not be the same. As long as you cluster the standard errors at the county level this should not be a problem though.
