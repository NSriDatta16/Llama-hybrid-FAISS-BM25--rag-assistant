I just figured out what was happening. After the "move it to a new folder" suggestion I tried that and it worked. But it didn't make any sense as to why it worked because if there were type conflicts there should have still been the same conflicts in the new folder but I had none of the problems I was having before and I could rename things anything I wanted after moving to a new folder and there were no conflicts. Renaming things after dragging it over is a bad idea because if the database schema changes and you want to update your classes you have to drag the table back over and then make the changes manually again. ANYWAY, the problem is that before I made the "linq to sql classes" I made a "ADO.NET Entity Data Model". That's what was causing all the name conflicts. But the suggestion about moving it to a new folder was awesome and led me to the final solution!
