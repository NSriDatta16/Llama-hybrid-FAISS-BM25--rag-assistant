you're required to add the following to your AndroidManifest.xml note: android:required="false" only works with API 5 level and above so to support 1.5 and 1.6 devices you have to "fragment" and release a separate apk (unless someone can figure out how to load the shared lib from code and avoid using "uses-library" in the manifest for 2.0 and above)
