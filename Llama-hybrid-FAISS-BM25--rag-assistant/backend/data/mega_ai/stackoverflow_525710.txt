Following on from David's answer , a good tester is worth his or her weight in gold - and good contract testers can be very expensive. I worked with a superb tester some years ago. I was the tech lead at the time, and he was the bane of my life, but his worth was incalculable. He was highly organised, and extremely intelligent. He wrote his own test plans, based on limited documentation of requirements and functions. Mostly he ran the application, and from his understanding of the business, worked out what it should do, and where it fell short. His attention to detail was nothing short of awesome. Everything he reported was completely reproducible, documented, and came not just with error reports, but suggestions for alternate behaviour. This was hugely useful, of course, since not all bugs result in the application breaking. He was also flexible enough to recognise where things were high priorities, and (temporarily!) stop hassling us over the things we didn't have time to do. So we got UI feedback, bug reports, even suggestions for where the requirements had been misunderstood. He worked me hard with what he found, but we had a strong recognition of our common goal, namely a high quality system. If you're out there, Nicholas, I wish you well. To the OP, I'd suggest you look for someone with these skills.
