As steve said, the major language additions are a big plus. But there is an other thing. Delphi had been in stormy weather the last years. And that was reflected by the versions. 7 was the last good version, 2006 was reasonable, but still below average. But now with 2009 a new era has started. Delphi has found a new home. And the focus is back on being the best development tool there is. There is still some backlog that needs to be solved, but as far as I am concerned Delphi is back on the way up.
