Displaying random numbers in C#

I'm trying to design a code where one guess a number. I defined the range which number to display in my listbox. I started to write Random(1,10) but if I enter 11, it still writes in my listbox. How can I just write the number selected from my range, which is 1-10? Here is a part of my code: private void btnOk_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { string yourNumber; yourNumber = textBox1.Text.Trim(); int returnNumber = RandomNumber(1, 10); int.TryParse(textBox1.Text, out returnNumber); listBox1.Items.Add(returnNumber); } Additional question If I would like to display a range of number like for example 1-10, how could I do the following? The user will type 11 the program will not accept that. I made something like this: int returnNumber = RandomNumber(1, 10); string yourNumber; yourNumber = textBox1.Text.Trim(); if(Int32.TryParse(textBox1.Text>=1)) && (Int32.TryParse(textBox1.Text Something is wrong in the program. Update For Nathaniel, I tried this one: int returnNumber=RandomNumber(1,10); int counter=1; int yourNumber; Int32.TryParse(textBox1.Text.Trim(), out yourNumber); if (yourNumber >=1 && yourNumber What I would like to do is design a program for guessing a number. So this is the first part. Update Here is my final code, can it be improved? I think the next thing I'll do is to limit the times the user types the input. That means, they can only guess the right number 3 times or 5 times. Not sure where to implement it namespace Guessing_Game { public partial class Form1 : Form { private static int randomNumber; private const int rangeNumberMin = 1; private const int rangeNumberMax = 10; public Form1() { InitializeComponent(); randomNumber = GenerateNumber(rangeNumberMin, rangeNumberMax); } private int GenerateNumber(int min,int max) { Random random = new Random(); return random.Next(min, max); } private void btnOk_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { int yourNumber = 0; Int32.TryParse(textBox1.Text.Trim(), out yourNumber); if (yourNumber>= rangeNumberMin && yourNumber randomNumber) { listBox2.Items.Add("No the Magic Number is lower than your number"); } if (yourNumber
