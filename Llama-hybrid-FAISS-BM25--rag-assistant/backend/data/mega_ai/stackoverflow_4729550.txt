I would like to help moderate. With so many new (to SO) developers coming here more frequently, the questions they bring are often in need of moderation. Most of the time, this is due to unfamiliarity with the site and how it works. I feel like I have a good pulse on what should and shouldn't be on SO and thus, I feel that I would make a good moderator. Vote for me! PS. I will give out cupcakes in the quad.
