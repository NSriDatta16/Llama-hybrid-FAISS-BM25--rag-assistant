Regression with Logistic-Distribution errors (NOT Logistic Regression)

I was wondering if anyone ever tried to do a regression where the errors, instead of normal, would be assumed to be from the Logistic Distribution. I don't mean Logistic Regression, as I don't assume that the $y$ 's are coming from a Bernoulli distribution whose mean is dependent on some covariates, but rather that the $y$ 's come from a symmetric Logistic distribution, whose pdf is: $$f_Y(y;\mu) = \frac{e^{(y-\mu)}}{(1+e^{(y-\mu)})^2},\,\,-\infty\lt y\lt \infty $$ (Unless the models are some how equivalent and I missed that)
