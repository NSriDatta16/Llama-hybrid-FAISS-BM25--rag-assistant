JavaEE 5, WAS 6.0 Strange issue with JSP includes

We are currently in the process of migrating our application from our production environment to a brand new data center. Current Production Environment : Java 1.4, Java EE 3, WAS 5.1, JSF 2.1 New Data Center Environment: Java 1.5, Java EE 5, WAS 6.1, JSF 2.1 Our application is built on JSF 2.1 and contains the code below in one of the AJAX calls: request.getSession().getServletContext().getRequestDispatcher( "/results.faces").include(request, response); And this is where we run into issues. Case 1: EAR structure as per the standard specs . EAR -> WAR -> WEB-INF -> lib -> *.jar (all application specific jars are under WEB-INF/lib). This does not work and we kee on getting exceptions for class not found by the classloader. Also, the above AJAX call fails (not output generated) Case 2: EAR contains all the application JAR files on the root (MANIFEST.MF has the classpath specified manually). This approach works perfectly and all the JAR files are loaded without any issues. Moreover, the AJAX call also goes through fine. Any ideas why this could be happenning. - Ashish
