Neural network regression problem, integer output neuron constraint

The problem I'm solving is a regression problem using neural networks, and the "y" value covers a very large range (let's say y represents the number of people, ranging from 0 people to 10000 people), which makes it impossible to be interpreted as a classification problem. The only difference between the problem I'm solving right now and the ordinary regression problem is that the output neuron should produce a strict integer, not decimal. Is there any activation function that can handle this constraint? Or what's the appropriate way to approach to model this constraint?
