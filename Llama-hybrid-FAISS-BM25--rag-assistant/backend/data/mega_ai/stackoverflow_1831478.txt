Secure(r) storage of MySQL login information?

First off, I realize that there is no such thing as a perfectly secure solution (and even if there were, its usability would be crap). That said, how do you protect your MySQL database from being compromised by someone downloading your code and picking through it? Based on my experience with PHP, it seems obligatory to store it within the code at some point or another, which sends up flags for me. I can see where refactoring to obfuscate variable, constant, and (user-defined) function names could be beneficial, but in the end it'd still be possible to trace through it and find the file with the DB login information. Ideas?
