chaining queries together in Django

I have a query that gets me 32 avatar images from my avatar application: newUserAv = Avatar.objects.filter(valid=True)[:32] I'd like to combine this with a query to django's Auth user model, so I can get the last the last 32 people, who have avatar images, sorted by the date joined. What is the best way to chain these two together? The avatar application was a reusable app, and its model is: image = models.ImageField(upload_to="avatars/%Y/%b/%d", storage=storage) user = models.ForeignKey(User) date = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True) valid = models.BooleanField() Note that the date field, is the date the avatar is updated, so not suitable for my purporse
