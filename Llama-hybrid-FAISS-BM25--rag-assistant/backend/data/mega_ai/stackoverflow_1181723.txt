How do I get maximum offline storage from within a web site?

I'm trying to develop a cross platform application, where the most obvious route would be a web site with JavaScript, but then I lose the cosy comforts I'm used to using in my C# desktop apps, like file system access etc. How do I go about accessing similar services from within the browser? E.g. I don't need to access anything I don't create, so actual file system access is just a luxury. I can use whatever the browser offers for offline storage, but have no clue how to do this.
