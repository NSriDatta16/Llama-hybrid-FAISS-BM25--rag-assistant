What's the cleanest way to add a class attribute to an html element in a view in rails

I'm writing some Rails code for a partial view, and I want it to only show a comment field if somebody is already logged onto a site here. If the page is viewed by someone who isn't a member of the site yet, the shared/comment_not_logged_in fragment should be passed in. However, I'm totally stumped as to why I can't run the same check to decide if the page should add the class attribute "missing_your_voice" to the enclosing div element here: "> "profile_pic") %> f %> 'shared/comment_not_logged_in' %> The same idiom, "missing_your_voice" if not current_user returns the string in irb, and also in the console debugger. What am I doing wrong here?
