GLM is absolutely a statistical model , while more and more statistical methods have being applied in industrial production as machine learning tricks . Meta-analysis which I read the most during these days is a good example in statistical field . A perfect industrial application with GLM can explain why your friend told you that GLM was regarded as a machine learning technique . You can refer the source paper http://www.kdd.org/kdd2016/papers/files/adf0562-zhangA.pdf about that . I implemented a simplified one which was treated as the main framework for my recommendation system in production scenario few weeks ago . Much appreciated if you give me some tips , and you can check the source code : https://github.com/PayneJoe/algo-sensetime/blob/master/src/main/scala/GLMM.scala Hopes this will helps you , good day !
