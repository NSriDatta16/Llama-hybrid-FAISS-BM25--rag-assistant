Is Frequentist Inference Objective?

Bayesian statistics is criticized for being subjective, as it requires a prior distribution encapsulating the subjective befiefs of the observer. Frequentist statistics is commonly advertised as being objective (because it does not require choosing a prior, because its probabilities are defined in an objective way, or whatever reason I'm not really sure about), however Wald proved that most admissible decision rules in Frequentist statistics are each one equivalent to a Bayes rule using some prior (which may be improper among other things, but it exists). One could think of the frequentist rules as being uninformative, but the calculation of uninformative priors may yield results different to the frequentist ones (as in the case of the Bernoulli distribution, for example). My questions are the following: Is there an objective reason to choose the priors associated to frequentist decision rules over others? If not, does that mean that frequentist inference is subjective? If yes, what is the personal belief / knowledge that we are injecting when using frequentist inference? Thanks in advance!
