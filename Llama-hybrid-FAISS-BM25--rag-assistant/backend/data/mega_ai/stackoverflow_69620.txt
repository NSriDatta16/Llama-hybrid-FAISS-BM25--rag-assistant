Let's tackle this systematically, because there is a lot to learn and there is a lot of information out there. You may want to start with Microsoft's resources first, as they are highly reviewed, and all in one place, and we're working hard to create a lot of them to produce a smooth on-ramp. Then, when you are comfortable, you can certainly branch out to other resources as well. My advice would be to memorize this URL: http://silverlight.net Just about everything you'll need for some time is there. Here is how I'd go about getting started, but there are lots of alternative paths as well... Go to the [getting started page][1] but don't download everything you see. Focus on just the big green numbers 1 and 2, that is the links to download Visual Studio 2000, the tools for Beta 2 VS 200, and the Beta 1 pack as well as the Blend 2.5 June 2008 preview. Click on Learn on the menu (or click [here][2] ) and watch on lien or download the first video, the Silverlight install experience. Assuming you haven't worked in Silverlight or WPF before, I'd take a look at our [showcase][3] applications, just to get a sense of what can be done with Silverlight. Once you've done that, the order of videos Iâ€™ve recommended in the past is in [this blog entry.][4] (which you'll see is where i cribbed these notes from) Once the basics are under your belt, be sure to check out our expanding collection of [tutorials][5], [videos][6], [webcasts][7], and we have a lot more on the way, including forthcoming books, and a number of alternatives. Also, tomorrow I start a monthly blog cast with [Sparkling Client][8] which I hope will be fun and informative. Finally, when you have questions, you certainly can ask here (this looks like a tremendous resource!) but if they are Silverlight related you may also want to post them on our [forums][9] Hope that helps. -jesse liberty
