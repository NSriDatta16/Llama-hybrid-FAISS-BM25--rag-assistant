Madhu, I'm not sure why you recorded the script to lunch that app with sikuli. All of the commands yu use don't invoke any images and can all be written without the sikuli ide. I would make the following changes to your original sikuli/jython script App.open ("C:\\Program Files\\acd\\bin\\VPNClient.exe") sleep(1) //change to wait(path to image, FOREVER) //By changing to a wait there is an implicit find as defined by the path to the image type ("mganda1") //if there are issues verifying focus invoke type with the img option sleep(1) //use wait instead of sleep click( ) //click OK //What are you clicking on? Regarding Java, here's the link to Sikuli javadocs
