If I were to hazard a guess, I'd say those functions leverage low-level math functionality (perhaps in C) that does not use decimals internally, and so returning a decimal would require a cast from double to decimal anyway. Besides, the purpose of the decimal value type is to ensure accuracy; these functions do not and cannot return 100% accurate results without infinite precision (e.g., irrational numbers).
