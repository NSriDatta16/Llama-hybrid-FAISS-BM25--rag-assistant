Similar objects same labels

Example: red paprica and green paprica. The output I need is just paprica, should i label them the same or give them two labels "green paprica" and "red paprica" and leater on just treat them as one? Other example: 5 cent coin, "heads" and "tails". Output i need is just 5 cent coin. From machine learning point of course. Are there downsides and upsides of splitting labels or keeping them together in terms of accuracy?
