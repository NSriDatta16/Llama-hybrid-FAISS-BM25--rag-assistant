How to organize AJAX handlers in a large site?

Simple question...I am using an MVC structure to build my site (its fairly large, so it helps with maintenance. I am now starting to integrate a few fun AJAX functions to spruce things up for Javascript/AJAX friendly users. Since I am so anal about organization, I wanna store my ajax PHP handlers in a way that is logical, secure, and (hopefully) separate. How do you organize yours? Is there a best practice?
