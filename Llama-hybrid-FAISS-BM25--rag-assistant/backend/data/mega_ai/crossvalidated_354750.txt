You don't say so, but I assume your data are daily. And that you only have one year's worth of data. Your ACF/PACF plots show spikes at lag 7, 14 etc. This is weekly seasonality, which makes sense for emergency admissions. Thus, you should tell R that you have a seasonal time series with period 7, ts(..., frequency=7) . Then auto.arima() should pick up on your seasonality and give you a seasonal ARIMA model. This should be the benchmark you should evaluate more complex models against. An alternative simple benchmark would be a "seasonal naive" forecast: for next Sunday, forecast last Sunday's observation, and so on. Simple benchmarks can be very hard to beat. If you get more than a year's worth of data, you could try also including yearly seasonality using models that can deal with multiple-seasonalities , e.g., bats or tbats . In addition, think about any strong drivers . What makes people come to your emergency department? Is it weather? (This may be more important in some parts of the world than in others.) Is it special days, like people hurting themselves with fireworks in the US on July 4th or elsewhere on New Year's Eve (these might be covered by yearly seasonality)? Has there been a change in regulation that induced a step change somewhere? Use a regression approach to include such drivers, then model residuals using time series algorithms as a above. We have a number of questions on daily forecasting , so browsing through them might be helpful .
