I found this tutorial quite helpful: Complete guide to build your own Named Entity Recognizer with Python He uses the Groningen Meaning Bank (GMB) corpus to train his NER chunk. After that you can check this tutorial from the same person: Training a NER System Using a Large Dataset Where he uses scikit learn to improve the performance of his system. Finally some really useful tutorials can be found here: NLTK tutorial This guy has a youtube channel with a lot of tutorial in many subjects (ML,NLP, Python...) Hope it helps.
