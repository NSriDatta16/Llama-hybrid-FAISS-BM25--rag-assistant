How normalizing helps to increase the speed of the learning?

I am training my brain with machine learning concepts. I happen to read this post . I understood the concept of mean, standard deviation, but unable to related with the below statement "We normalize the input layer by adjusting and scaling the activations. For example, when we have features from 0 to 1 and some from 1 to 1000, we should normalize them to speed up learning" Could someone help me understand better?
