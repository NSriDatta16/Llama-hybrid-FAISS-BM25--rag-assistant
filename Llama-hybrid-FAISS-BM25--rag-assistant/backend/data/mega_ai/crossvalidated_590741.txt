About dummy variable trap

Conceptual Question: Suppose a banker wants to run regression on S&P 500 companies to see if they make more returns than the last year on average daily return basis. He runs on dummy variables for each company. Suppose the model is $R_i=\beta_0+\beta_1 k_{1i}+...+\beta_{500} k_{500i}$ where $R_i$ is returns on a daily basis and there are 500 companies.This is not a good regression because it falls into dummy variable trap, and how to fix it? Definition of dummy variable trap: a situation in which two or more independent variables are in perfect linear correlation. Suppose dummy variables are used for gender. If there are 2 categories in gender, only one dummy variable should be use otherwise using 2 dummy vairalbes for 2 categories will lead to dummy variable trap. So to fix this, drop one dummy variable, i.e. $R_i=\beta_0+\beta_1 k_{1i}+...+(\beta_{500}-\beta_{499}) k_{499i}$ ? Please let me know what information to add, this is all I can think about for now. Thanks in advance.
