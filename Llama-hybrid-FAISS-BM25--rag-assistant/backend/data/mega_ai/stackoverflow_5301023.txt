what you can do is load file1 completely into memory (since it is small) and check each line in file2 if it matches a line in file1. if it doesn't then write it to file three. Sort of like this: file1 = open('file1') file2 = open('file2') file3 = open('file3','w') lines_from_file1 = [] # Read in all lines from file1 for line in file1: lines_from_file1.append(line) file1.close() # Now iterate over lines of file2 for line2 in file2: keep_this_line = True for line1 in lines_from_file1: if line1 == line2: keep_this_line = False break # break out of inner for loop if keep_this_line: # line from file2 is not in file1 so save it into file3 file3.write(line2) file2.close() file3.close() Maybe not the most elegant solution, but if you don't have to do it ever 3 seconds, it should work. EDIT: By the way, the question in the text somewhat differs from the title. I tried to answer the question in the text.
