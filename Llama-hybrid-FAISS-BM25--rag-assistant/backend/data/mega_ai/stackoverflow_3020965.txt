Whats up with implicit return values in Ruby?

So I've started looking at ruby, and a lot of things look nice but I'm quite put off by implicit return statements. I understand making everything return self or nil by default but not the last value of a statement. To me it looks horribly fragile (especially) if you are working with a method that doesn't plan to return something (especially a function which changes state/destructive method !) , other people may end up relying on a return that is not important to the purpose of the method and has a decent chance of changing. What's the point of implicit return? Is there a way it makes some things way simpler? Is it considered good practice to always have a return to prevent implicit returns? Am I worrying to much about this? P.S. Do people often use implicit return when they mean to return a certain thing from a method, doesn't this make it easier for other people in your group to break each others code? Sure , document everything and give meaningful names you might say, but people don't always do that in real life.
