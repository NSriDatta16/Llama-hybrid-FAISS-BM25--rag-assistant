Handling the transaction yourself will probably get you all sorts of attention from the tax authorities - usually not a good idea, as it tends to generate tons of paperwork and liabilities (like warranty claims) for little gain. The usual way is to charge either buyer, seller, or both a fee. Which way is best totally depends on the market you're serving, and your position in that market. Credit card merchant accounts are a (often cheaper) alternative to PayPal, but most are very expensive. Other alternatives: Micropayment processing using Paypal or other payment processing service? Which should I implement first, PayPal or Google Checkout, on my eCommerce website How to pay your users? (alternatives to PayPal)
