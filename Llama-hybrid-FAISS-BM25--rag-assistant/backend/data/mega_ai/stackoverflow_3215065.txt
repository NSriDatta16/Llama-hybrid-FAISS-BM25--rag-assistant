You can watch the $(".selector").sortable({out: function(e, ui) {}); to set a variable whenever an object is dragged outside a list. If it is released then .sortable({stop: function(e, ui) {}); is triggered. You can tell if the object wasn't dropped on a list if .sortable({over: function(e, ui) {}); wasn't called after an out trigger.
