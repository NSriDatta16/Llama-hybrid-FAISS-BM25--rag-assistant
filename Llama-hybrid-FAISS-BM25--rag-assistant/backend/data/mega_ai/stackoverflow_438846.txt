This attribute is used by Team Foundation Server 's (TFS) code analysis functionality to exclude code fragments that would otherwise trigger warnings. You can safely remove them if you're not using TFS code analysis. The attributes can be added by hand or, more usually, are added automatically via the Visual Studio GUI when the "Suppress Message" option is selected in the error list.
