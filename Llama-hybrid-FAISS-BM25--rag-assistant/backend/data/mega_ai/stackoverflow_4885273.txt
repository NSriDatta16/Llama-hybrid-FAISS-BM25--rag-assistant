you should be using varchar(8000) as max for non-unicode character data. the number in varchar represents bytes. You can specify a maximum of 8000 which does not exceed your 200kb limit. The storage size is the actual length of data entered + 2 bytes. EDIT - Correction - From the comments below - The effective maximum length of a VARCHAR in MySQL 5.0.3 and later is subject to the maximum row size (65,535 bytes, which is shared among all columns) and the character set used." so depending on what else is in the row, it might be smaller than that
