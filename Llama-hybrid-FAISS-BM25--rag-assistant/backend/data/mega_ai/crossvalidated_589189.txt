The parameters of naive Bayes are the $p(W|C)$ and $p(C)$ probabilities. You estimate them using maximum likelihood and plug in into the Bayes theorem to calculate the $p(C|W)$ probabilities. The model is not Bayesian because it doesn't use subjective probabilities, you are not using it to update the prior. “Likelihood” is used here in two meanings: as likelihood in MLE and as the name of the component of the Bayes theorem, which made it confusing.
