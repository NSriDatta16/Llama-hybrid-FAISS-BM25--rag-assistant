What Notable Differences are there between Railo, Open Bluedragon, and Adobe Coldfusion?

An attempt to capture notable differences between implementations: Adobe ColdFusion Railo Open Bluedragon (I'm aware of Smith , but don't believe it's still active). Include CFML and platform differences - syntax, feature, and extensibility. Note, this is not something I've not seen anywhere else, but maybe I'm just not searching correctly. So links to that end would count too. Update Here's my definition of notable in this context: something that simplifies solving a difficult problem. For example, Railo offers the tag, which transcodes video - a non trivial task. Something I would suggest is not notable : the Railo function ListAvg ().
