It is perfectly fine to average the coefficients in some cases if what you want is a summary measure of the effect size of the treatment. In particular, if had fit a Bayesian logistic regression model, say with the bayesglm package in R, you could take many samples from the posterior distribution of the coefficients. Then for each sampled coefficient vector, you could compute the sex-specific treatment effect by summing the interaction coefficient and treatment effect. Then again for each sample, you could average the sex-specific treatment effects. You could then compute the expectation and credible intervals of this estimate to get a summary measure of the treatment effect and its posterior distribution. If you wanted to weight the average by the proportion of males versus females in a population of interest, you could do that, too. Edit On second thought, if you want an odds ratio that represents the average effect over the two sexes, you should just build another model without a sex predictor in it and present the treatment effect. Thanks to @FrankHarrell for noting that I had led myself and potentially other people astray.
