If the data set is large, you can always get naive $(1-\alpha)\cdot 100\%$ prediction intervals by adding to the point predictions $\hat Y$ the empirical $\alpha/2$ and $1-\alpha/2$ quantiles $\hat Q_{\alpha/2}$ and $\hat Q_{1-\alpha/2}$ of the residuals. They are naive because you ignore the variability in the point prediction (viewed as an estimator of a population average) and because the distribution of the residuals might differ depending on the input values. Both issues can usually be mended in the concrete case (e.g. calculate the quantiles separately per leaf of the tree to allow non-homogenous residual distributions) but there is no general solution. Here a quick illustration in R to compare such naive 50%-prediction interval with the "classic" one: fit In this example, the "classic" interval almost agrees with the naive one based on empirical quantiles.
