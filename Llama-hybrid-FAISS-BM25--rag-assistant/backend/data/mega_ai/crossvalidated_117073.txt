How can there be a linear correlation between two PCA components?

I perform principal component analysis (PCA) on a dataset, and then plot the first and the second principal components. I get the following phenomenon: one principal component appears to be a linear function of the other. I assume there is no guarantee this would not happen, but I am wondering if there are theorems or known results that may help me understand what causes this phenomenon in my data.
