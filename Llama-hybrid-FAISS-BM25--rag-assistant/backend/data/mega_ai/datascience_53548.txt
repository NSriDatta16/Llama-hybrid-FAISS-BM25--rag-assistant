Welcome to DS.SE, @shubham. Since the question is a bit general, I can just provide you some link to start with. Once you have more specific requirements, the community can help further. An easy-to-use tool that I knew for sentiment analysis was IBM Alchemy which seems retired now in favor of IBM Watson NLU . Despite IBM, other analytical platforms such also provide sentiment analysis APIs/tools. For example, see Google AI & Machine Learning Products and Deep AI . This article on Medium reviews some this tools in brief.
