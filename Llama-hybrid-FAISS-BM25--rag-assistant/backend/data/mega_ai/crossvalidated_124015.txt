I am just starting to work with Random Forest but I believe it is mainly the bagging that needs to be iid for each tree and the subset of features selection at each node. I am unaware of any formal constraints on the data itself. Why it works so well on your data I can not say until I have investigated your data. But the non-iid'ness of your features will not influence performance too much.
