Since a potential screen-scaping application can spoof the user agent and HTTP referrer (for images) in the header and use a time schedule that is similar to a human browser, it is not possible to completely stop professional scrapers. But you can check for these things nevertheless and prevent casual scraping. I personally find Captchas annoying for anything other than signing up on a site.
