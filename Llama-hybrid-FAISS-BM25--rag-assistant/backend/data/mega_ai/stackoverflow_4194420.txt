That would be the main method. It should be declared as public static void main(String[] args) It needs to be public , since the JVM should have access to call the method. It needs to be static , as no objects are instantiated when the program starts It takes an array of String s as argument (coming from the command-line) Some good links to have a look at: The main Method (from the official Getting started trail) What is the main method Entry point for Java applications: main(), init(), or run()? Some people may recommend you to write public static void main(String... args) this is equivalent to String[] args if you're using a compiler of version 1.5 or later. (I would discourage this unless you're extensively calling your main method internally with a varying number of arguments.) Others may suggest public static void main(String args[]) This is also equivalent, but discouraged by the Java Coding Convention .
