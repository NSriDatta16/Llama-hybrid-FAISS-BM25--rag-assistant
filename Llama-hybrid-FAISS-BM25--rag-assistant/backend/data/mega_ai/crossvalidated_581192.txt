I think your view is correct, indeed the probabilistic nature of VAEs stems from parametrizing the latent distribution and then sampling from it. I would argue that this procedure influences the whole network, making them more capable of generalization but also more prone to noisy reconstruction (often seen in GANs vs VAE comparisons). Of course, this doesn't make the rest of the network inherently probabilistic (that would be a Bayes-NET, I think), as you noticed.
