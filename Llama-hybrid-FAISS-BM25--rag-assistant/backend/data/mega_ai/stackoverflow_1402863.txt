I don't know what the cause is but a few things you might consider/try are they actually able to still visit pages generated by the server or are they just going back to locally cached versions? What happens when they cause a postback that has code to check if they are authenticated does that work or does it fail? I think the later meaning they are signed out but viewing cached versions of the logged in page in which case you want to instruct the client not to cache the pages using for instances: Response.Cache.SetExpires(DateTime.UtcNow.AddMinutes(-1)); Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.NoCache); Response.Cache.SetNoStore(); You can try manually setting the cookie to be expired but this is a hack FormsAuthentication.SignOut(); Context.Response.Cookies.Item(FormsAuthentication.FormsCookieName).Expires = Date.Now; Response.Redirect("~/Somewhere.aspx");
