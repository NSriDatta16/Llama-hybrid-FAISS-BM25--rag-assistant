You should have a look at Simplysim they have a demo of accurately simulating a UAV http://www.simplysim.net/index.php?p=gallery&id=2 It looks very impressive! "The SimplyCube can be used for advanced simulation projects, such as UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) simulations. In this UAV simulation, we have represented the DraganflyerX6 drone, which can be controlled either manually or automatically. A camera is mounted on the drone, as well as inclinometers, which permit to judge of the realism of that simulation which includes wind."
