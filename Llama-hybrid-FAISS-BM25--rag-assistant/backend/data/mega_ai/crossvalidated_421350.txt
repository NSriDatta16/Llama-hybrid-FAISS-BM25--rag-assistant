Time Series Forecasting, why try and predict randomness?

Maybe I have a gap in my understanding, but I've looked everywhere and haven't found a satisfying answer. When we are doing time series forecasting, we need the data to be stationary, if not we apply various techniques to make it stationary. Then we apply AR or ARMA model. Ok now comes my issue, I understand that there may be memory in this stationary data, but isn't it stochastic? Why are we trying to model the randomness? I feel like it's useless, why try to predict something random?
