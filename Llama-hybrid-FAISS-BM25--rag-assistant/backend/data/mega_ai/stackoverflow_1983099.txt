The iPhone handles audio as 16-bit integer. Most audio files are already normalized so that the peak sample values are the maximum that fit in a 16-bit signed integer. That means if you add two such samples together, you get overflow, or in this case, audio clipping. If you want to mix two audio sources together and ensure there's no clipping, you must average the samples: add them together and divide by two. Or you set the volume to half. If you're using decibels, that would be about a -6 dB change.
