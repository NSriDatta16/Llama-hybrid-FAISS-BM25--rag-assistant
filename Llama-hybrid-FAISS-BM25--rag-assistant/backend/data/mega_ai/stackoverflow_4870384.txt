Go to your Build menu and select Build and Archive. This will open up Organizer which will bring up a new screen from a section called Archived Applications. This keeps a track of all the bianary builds. From here you can Validate and Submit your App. You no longer have to zip the file and upload with Application Loader. It's interesting that it lets you validate without having to upload. I haven't played with this a lot so there might be other neat things about it.
