Tyler Ever's answer assumes that we are dealing with an M/M/1 , which may not be the case. Otherwise the equation $$L = \frac{\left( \frac{t}{N} \right)^2}{ 1 - \frac{t}{N}}$$ (which is a special case of Kingman's formula ) may not be valid. And from the phrasing it isn't; we actually have an M/G/1 queue model because the service times are not exponentially -distributed. That is if I take " an order takes $t$ units of time" then I'll take that mean they all do. The mean is different from the individuals: see Does The Average Person Exist? According to the link they shared, we should rather use the Pollaczekâ€“Khinchine formula $$L_q = \rho + \frac{\rho^2 + \lambda^2 \text{Var}[S]}{2(1-\rho)}$$ where $\rho := \frac{t}{N}$ is the utilization parameter, $\lambda = \frac{1}{N}$ is the arrival rate, and the random variable $S$ is the service time. Since we know that $S = t$ is constant, we also know that $\text{Var}[S] = 0$ . So the expression simplifies to: $$L_q = \frac{t \left(2 N - t\right)}{2 N \left(N - t\right)}$$ Although it is worth noting that the difference $$D(t,N) = \frac{\left( \frac{t}{N} \right)^2}{ 1 - \frac{t}{N}} - \frac{t \left(2 N - t\right)}{2 N \left(N - t\right)} = \frac{t \left(2 N - 3 t\right)}{2 N \left(t - N\right)}$$ depends on $t$ and $N$ .
