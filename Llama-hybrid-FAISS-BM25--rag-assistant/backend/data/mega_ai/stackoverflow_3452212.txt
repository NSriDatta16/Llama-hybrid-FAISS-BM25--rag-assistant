One major performance implication is that there will not be a lookup operator for indexes that works in this way. If you said WHERE contact_email=1 there might be an index on that column and the query would use it; if you said WHERE (contact_flags & 1)=1 then it wouldn't. ** One column stores one piece of information only - it's the database way. ** (Didnt see - Kragen's answer also states this point, way before mine)
