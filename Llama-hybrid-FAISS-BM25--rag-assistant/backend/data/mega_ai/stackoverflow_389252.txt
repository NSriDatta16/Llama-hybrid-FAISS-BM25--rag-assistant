I have definitely experience similar pains in the past... Here is how I overcame them. Split out the data that is code (that is any data in the database that is not customer data but is essential to the functioning of the app. Pull all those tables into a seperate database. Write SQL scripts that populate that data into the database. This will allow you to recreate the skeleton of your app without relying on production data or a backup. Take as much of the data that doesn't truly dynamically change, and put it in property files and configuration files. Flat file storage for this kind of data is ideal. Its faster to read, and doesn't have to be maintained with the database.
