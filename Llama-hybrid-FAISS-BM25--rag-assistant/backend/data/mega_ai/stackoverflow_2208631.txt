WPF: How should I organize my code amongst the source files?

I see a Window1.xaml and its associated .cs file, which are the main window. Then there's also app.xaml and app.xaml.cs. First, what is the point of App? It seems to be empty. I'm assuming I should put local variables to the Window on its cs file, and variables related to the whole program on App?
