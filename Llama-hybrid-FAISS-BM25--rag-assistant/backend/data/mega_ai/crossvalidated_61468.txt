Mathematical formulation of correspondence analysis?

From a website you can think that Correspondence Analysis is a categorical data version of PCA. But the main usage of Correspondence Analysis is different from that of PCA, and it is more like clustering or Factor Analysis. With Correspondence Analysis, we can analyze and visualize the relationships among your observed data, and see which parts of the data are associated with another part of the data. Wikipedia also says It is conceptually similar to principal component analysis, but applies to categorical rather than continuous data. In a similar manner to principal component analysis, it provides a means of displaying or summarising a set of data in two-dimensional graphical form. But I don't understand its details process , because I don't know what kind of problem Correspondence Analysis is trying to solve? Is there a clear mathematical formulation of the problem?
