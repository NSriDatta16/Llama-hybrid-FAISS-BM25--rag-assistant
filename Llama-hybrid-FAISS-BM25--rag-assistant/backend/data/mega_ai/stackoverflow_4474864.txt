How do i grab numbers from a Table on a website in my Cocoa App?

Ok this is a more specific version of my last question. So on a website there exists some data that is coded in HTML into a table. In my Cocoa app, I want to download the html code of the website and then read through the html and snag the data from it. I was hoping someone could point out some useful classes/methods for accomplishing the retrieval of the website and putting it into some format where I can read through the code in my program? Thanks in advance!
