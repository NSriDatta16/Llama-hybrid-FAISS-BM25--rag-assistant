I am having a similar problem. Running bin/mahout org.apache.mahout.classifier.Classify --path --classify --encoding UTF-8 --analyzer org.apache.mahout.vectorizer.DefaultAnalyzer --defaultCat unknown --gramSize 1 --classifierType bayes --dataSource hdfs will classify a text file based on the model. This might get you a bit further forward, but I'm guessing that, like me, you want to classify a whole load of documents and you want the output in a useful format. Might have to program a bit of java to do this. Someone has an example that looks like it will do what I want at https://bitbucket.org/jaganadhg/blog/src/tip/bck9/java/src/org/bc/kl/ClassifierDemo.java
