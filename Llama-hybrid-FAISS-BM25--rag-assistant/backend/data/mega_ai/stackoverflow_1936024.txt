I finally got it! After hours and hours of trying, this works. I moved the dialog open method from draggable:drag to draggable:start. Then i start getting errors saying this.helper on the draggable method is null or not an object on firefox tools->error console. I diabled firebug and now it works perfectly! Thanks for all your help! Praveen
