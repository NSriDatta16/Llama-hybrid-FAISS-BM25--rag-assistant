How to create a PCA-based index from two variables when their directions are opposite?

I wanted to use principal component analysis to create an index from two variables of ratio type. I am using the correlation matrix between them during the analysis. I want to use the first principal component scores as an index. Higher values of one of these variables mean better condition while higher values of the other one mean worse condition. That is the lower values are better for the second variable. What I want is to create an index which will indicate the overall condition. Is there anything I should do before running PCA to get the first principal component scores in this situation?
