Typoscript: How to create a popup-dialog that controls a browser-/useragent-switch

I have a question regarding Typocript, because I want to realize the follwoing in Typo3: A user visits a website (with his IPhone) that is based on Typo3 (Version 4.3) The user gets a popup dialog where he can choose whether to visit the 'standard'-website, or the website that is optimized for the IPhone view The user makes his selection and is redirected to the mobile or standard website This is what happens at the moment: When the user visits the website using the IPhone device, he is automatically redirected to the mobile-website When the user visits the website using any other Browser or device, he is redirected to the standard website I realized this using a Useragent-Switch: [useragent = *iPhone*] page > page = PAGE page.meta.REFRESH = 0;index.php?id=xx [end] If there is no possibility to realize it directly in Typoscript: Does anyone know how to realize this using an self created extension, that calls a popup dialog and redirects the user afterwards to a page-id? Thanks in advance, Cheeesi
