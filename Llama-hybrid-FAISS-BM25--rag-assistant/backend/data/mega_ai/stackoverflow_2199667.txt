NHibernate Projection using SqlQuery

I'm trying to reproduce the HqlQuery style 'select new ObjectToProjectOut' functionality. i.e. take a list of columns returned from a query and return as a list of ObjectToProjectOut types that are instantiated using a Constructor with as many parameters as the columns in the query. This is in effect what 'select new ObjectToProjectOut' achieves in Hql.... but clearly that's not available in SqlQuery. I think I need to set a result transform and use either PassThroughResultTransformer, DistinctRootEntityResultTransformer etc to get it to work. Anyone know what I should use ?
