Clustering without labels

I want to cluster the data points into 2 clusters. For that, I used a deep neural network but I have no labels to backpropagate. How can I backpropagate? which loss function I can use in this problem Is there any way to do it without using autoencoders or it is impossible? Any kind of reference is helpful
