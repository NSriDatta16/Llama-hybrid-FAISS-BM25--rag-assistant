How to predict next visit date based on this data

I have a dataset shown below. Here, status is if visit has been done or not and schedule is if next_action_scheduled . df = visit_date |status |scheduled_visit 2018-09-13|1|0000-00-00 2018-11-13|1|0000-00-00 2019-01-13|1|0000-00-00 2019-03-13|0|0000-00-00 2019-05-13|0|0000-00-00 So consider this case like user is visiting in every 2 month. I would like to find this pattern for all users based on the historical visits with the customer. I would like to find the next predicted visit for that customer and if we missed that visit, then I ask "Do you want to schedule a visit" Or "You missed a visit with this customer." I'm new in Ml. I tried to use RNN for time series forecasting but I'm getting a really high error rate. Prediciton is nowhere close. What model/algorithm I should use and learn about to make a model for this? I want to create a solution like if I feed in the user_id it will check all these values and send notification within app. Thank you
