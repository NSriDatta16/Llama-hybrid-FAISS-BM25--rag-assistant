The stack and the Queue are more advanced ways to handle a collection that the array itself, which doesn't establish any order in the way the elements behave inside the collection. The Stack ( LIFO - Last in first out) and a Queue (FIFO - First in First out ) establish and order in which your elements are inserted and removed from a collection. You can use an Array or a Linked List as the Storage structure to implement the Stack or the Queue pattern. Or even create with those basic structures more complex patterns like Binary Trees or priority queues, which might also bring not only an order in the insertion and removal of elements but also sorting them inside the collection.
