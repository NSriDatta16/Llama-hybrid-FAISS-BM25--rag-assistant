Use a PDF library for .NET. The best example is probably iText . The book iText in Action is also well worth the investment and will get you up and running with the iText .NET API quickly. Create a PDF version of your tag cloud in addition to your ASCX/HTML version, rather than trying to convert an HTML fragment to PDF.
