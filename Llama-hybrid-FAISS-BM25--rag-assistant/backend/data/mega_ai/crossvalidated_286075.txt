Yes there are uses of econometrics on internal company data(medium sized or otherwise). One that may be common is evaluation of impact of an intervention(eg advertising) by the company to affect certain metrics (eg sales). This might be more obvious in an electronic commerce setting. For instance: "How many additional clicks did we drive by implementing that new Adwords feature?‚Äù here the focus will be on the clicks response variable for a test and control group before and after the new feature. For such a case Bayesian structural time series analysis will be useful. This is implemented in the CausalInference R package . So long as a business has a relevant question it wants to answer and the data is available, econometrics/statistics may be used. More questions include: How can we estimate the impact of a new feature on app downloads? How do we compare the effectiveness of publicity across countries? If you want more interesting applications of econometrics in a business, you should frequently visit Google's research page, the economics section
