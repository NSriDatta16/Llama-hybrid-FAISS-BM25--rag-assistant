First: Doing principal components regression is mostly an alternative to lasso, random forest, and so on, not a preliminary step. Second, lasso is a method of adjusting OLS (or other regressions such as logistic) - it's a way of building a model and adjusting the parameter estimates to account for the model building. Having a list that has both "lasso" and "OLS" seems odd. Third, backward selection is a bad method, whether you start with principal components or raw variables. P values will be too low, standard errors too small, and parameter estimates biased away from 0. (Lasso is one attempt to correct these problems). Fourth, PC does not allow you to use the "important features". Each principal component uses all the variables. Admittedly, some will be weighted very lightly in some PCs, but those may be weighted heavily in other PCs. If you think you have latent variables then factor analysis is a better tool than PCA. If you want to use the components for regression, then partial least squares might be better. Fifth, 100 PCs is far too many to be sensibly interpretable and 100 regressors with 650 rows is too many and risks overfitting. I would take a step back and ask yourself why you have 312 columns, what they all mean, whether some are redundant, and so on. You could use some tools to help with this, starting with a correlation matrix, but it should also rely on substantive expertise.
