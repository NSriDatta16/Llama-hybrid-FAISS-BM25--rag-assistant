This is a c99 construct, called a compound literal . From the May 2005 committee draft section 6.5.2.5: A postfix expression that consists of a parenthesized type name followed by a brace- enclosed list of initializers is a compound literal. It provides an unnamed object whose value is given by the initializer list. ... EXAMPLE 1 The file scope definition int *p = (int []){2, 4}; initializes p to point to the first element of an array of two ints, the first having the value two and the second, four. The expressions in this compound literal are required to be constant. The unnamed object has static storage duration.
