Which parameters are updated in VAE with normalizing flow?

I've been reading this article about implementing a VAE with normalizing flows . What it's not clear to me, is which parameters are actually optimized using this approach. Should I only optimize the parameters of the flow part and not compute gradients of the loss function with respect to the weights of the encoder and decoder? If yes, why? How are the encoder and decoder used in this context?
