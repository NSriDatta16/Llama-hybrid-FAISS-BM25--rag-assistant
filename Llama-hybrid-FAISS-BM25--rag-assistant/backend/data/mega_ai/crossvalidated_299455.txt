Heavy-Tailed Data

I'm currently trying to perform a point-biserial correlation on my data, but can't seem to get the continuous data to follow a normal distribution. I've looked into other answers on this website and thus far I've tried Lambert, cube root, square root, asinh, etc. What further steps should I take to try and transform this data? Thanks in advance!!
