You will have to use (as @Cagdas Ozgenc also mentioned) a technique called co-integration . If the time series $y_{1t}$ and $y_{2t}$ are non-stationary, then they are said to be co-integrated if there exists a linear combination of the two series that is stationary. There are several references for it like e.g. Hamilton, J.D. (1994). Time Series Analysis, Princeton Unversity, Press, New Jersey or Johansen, S. (1995). Likelihood Based Inference in Cointegrated Vector Error Correction Models, Oxford University Press, Oxford. The idea is simple , for the linear reagression model $y=\beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \epsilon$ where the usual assumptions are fullfilled you see that $(y - \beta_0 - \beta_1 x) \sim N(0;\sigma)$ (because it is $\epsilon$), so with OLS you find a linear combination that is 'white noice' or 'stationary'. The idea behind co-integration is to find, for non-stationary time series, a linear combination that is stationary, so for $y_{1t},y_{2t}$ non-stationary, you will try to find a linear combination $\gamma_1 y_{1t} + \gamma_2 y_{2t} \sim I(0)$ and you see the similarity with the OLS equation. When you find the linear combination, then you have found that $y_{1t} = \frac{\gamma_2}{\gamma_1} y_{2t} + \delta$ where $\delta$ is $I(0)$, or (up to a term that is 'white noice') $y_{1t}$ and $y_{2t}$ 'move together'. Co-integration is about finding that linear combination. Obviously for co-integration OLS will not work.
