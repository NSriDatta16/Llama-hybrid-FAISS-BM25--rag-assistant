Can Android application install another application inside of it's own storage space?

Does anyone know if you can install an apk inside of another apk's storage space? My goal is to create an application which can "house" other applications inside of itself. Or possibly if one application can get the INSTALL_PACKAGES permission (which I believe is reserved by SYSTEM?) could it install applications in a specific location on the device or the SD card?
