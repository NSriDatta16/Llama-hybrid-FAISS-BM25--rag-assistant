The xml layout editor that ships with Eclipse is pretty woeful. Thankfully Google are putting effort into improving this so that we have a more seamless drag n drop experience. You can download and compile the latest works here http://tornorbye.blogspot.com/2010/11/building-android-ide-tools.html or just wait a week (or two) for Gingerbread to be released. A stable version is sure to be included in the Eclipse ADT update that is released then.
