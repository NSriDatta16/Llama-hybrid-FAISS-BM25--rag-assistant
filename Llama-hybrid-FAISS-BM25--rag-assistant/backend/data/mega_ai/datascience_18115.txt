Can I say this about your dataset? Say a well is a point on your map, so if each well has an x-axis and y-axis coordinates. So effectively I've converted your dataset into an 11-dimensional problem. Now let's talk prediction. First, perform PCA on your dataset with the number of components = 1.Remember the dataset which you have to perform PCA is on all the data but the X-axis and Y-axis values Then plot your data set in a 3D scatter plot with the other two dimensions being X-axis and Y-axis and the third being the new Dimensionally reduced values done by PCA. Look at the scatter plot if the following data follows any type of regression trend. Then use that type of regression to predict the values.
