Make a list in which each key is repeated a number of times equal to the length of its value. In your example: ['a', 'a', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'c'] . Then use random.choice() . Edit: or, less elegantly but more efficiently, try this: take the sum of the lengths of all values in the dictionary, S (you can cache and invalidate this value, or keep it up to date as you edit the dictionary, depending on the exact usage pattern you anticipate). Generate a random number from 0 to S, and do a linear search through the dictionary keys to find the range into which your random number falls. I think that's the best you can do without changing or adding to your data representation.
