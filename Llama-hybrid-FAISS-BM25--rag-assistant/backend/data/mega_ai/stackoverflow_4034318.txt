I found a solution: the problem was that I assigned the model to the tableview already in the constructor. So everytime I inserted the item in the model, tableview was informed and probably updated. Now I assign the model to the tableview only after I filled my model with data. This is not an elegant solution but it works. Is there maybe a way to temporarily disable the model from tableview or something that says to the tableview to not to care about changes in the model?
