Need explanation of a matrix multiplication

I'm reading the Deep Learning book by MIT. On the page 172, there's a part like this: $$ f^{(1)}(x)=h=W^Tx \tag{1} $$ $$ f^{(2)}(h)=h^Tw \tag{2} $$ Substitute (1) into (2), they got: $$ f(x)=w^TW^Tx $$ Since I'm not so familiar with linear algebra stuff, I infer that something like below is valid: $$ A^TB=B^TA \tag{3} $$ So what is the property of (3) is called?
