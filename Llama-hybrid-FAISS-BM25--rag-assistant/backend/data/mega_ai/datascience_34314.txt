I've taken Chris Brooks' course, " Introduction to Data Science in Python " on Coursera, too. As he said in the " Pandas Idioms " video you mentioned (and in its transcript quoted in other answers to this question), "pandorable" describes a style of coding with Pandas that uses features like method chaining, applymap (Pandas' version of Python's map ), lambda , and other techniques. My problem with calling those "pandorable" is that they are already elements of "Pythonic" style. It doesn't make any sense to call these techniques by another name just because Pandas is involved. That's " pandeplorable "! (â„¢ pending). Maybe there are elements of Pandas style I've not seen yet that merit the use of a new term, but so far it all looks Pythonic to me.
