Does my basic PHP Socket Server need optimization?

Like many people, I can do a lot of things with PHP. One problem I do face constantly is that other people can do it much cleaner, much more organized and much more structured. This also results in much faster execution times and much less bugs. I just finished writing a basic PHP Socket Server (the real core), and am asking you if you can tell me what I should do different before I start expanding the core. I'm not asking about improvements such as encrypted data, authentication or multi-threading. I'm more wondering about questions like "should I maybe do it in a more object oriented way (using PHP5)?", or "is the general structure of the way the script works good, or should some things be done different?". Basically, "is this how the core of a socket server should work?" In fact, I think that if I just show you the code here many of you will immediately see room for improvements. Please be so kind to tell me. Thanks! #!/usr/bin/php -q
