Thanks to everyone who tried to help me out but i figured the problem out it seems there is an addchild call going to the $menu[] of agent node which was causing the bug. So when it was false the if condition worked fine but due to the missing agent node the script just stopped loading. Since it was an ajax call i only figured it out now. Thanks all the same to everyone!
