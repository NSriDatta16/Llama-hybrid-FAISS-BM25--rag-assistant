If I understand your problem, it would be solved if you had designer support for WF in your class library so you could add the workflow definitions there? To get that you can edit the according class library project file (*.csproj for C#) and add the following lines: In the first PropertyGroup: {14822709-B5A1-4724-98CA-57A101D1B079};{FAE04EC0-301F-11D3-BF4B-00C04F79EFBC} At the bottom of the file: For VS2008: For VS2005: Once the project is reloaded in the IDE, you should get support for WF. But as gbanfill mentioned, you could also organize your assemblies differently.
