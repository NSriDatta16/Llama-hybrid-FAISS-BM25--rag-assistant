Implementing "Report this content" and detecting spammer or robot triggered event

I'm creating a forum for a website, and plan on implementing a "Report this content" function. In all honesty, I'm not sure how useful (lit. necessary) the feature will be, since a user account (created by admin) will be required for posting, but the solution interests me. So in short, this is the scenario: For all users, there will be read-only access to all (non-restricted) content on the forum. For unidentified users there will be a reply button and report this content button present. The former will proceed to require a login, while I had planned that the latter wouldn't, so that anyone would be able to flag suspicious or offensive content. The problem I'm thus facing is basically "robot clicks", or rather how to implement the system so it won't be fooled by "robot clicks". There are a few methods that come to mind: 1) User-agent 2) Requiring several flags (in a predefined timespan?) before reacting in any way 3) robots.txt 4) Requiring human input on a second form (captcha or "specify reason") What I think of them: 1) Unreliable (as sole solution) 2) This requires a mass of users which might lead to the event never being triggered 3) This is probably the "right" way to go, but will only work for those who respect it 4) Meh, I hate captcha and requiring a reason might raise the bar too high to keep the function useful What methods would the (highly enlightened) community have to share with me?
