Model that can make a prediction (classification) based on a sub set of features

Model that can make a prediction (classification) based on a sub set of features What is the recommended approach, best model or algorithm that handles use-case where we want to predict based on sub-set of feature ? Example Use-case * create a 10 feature model * make a prediction (predict a target class) based off 5 of the 10 features A linear classifier built on 10 features requires values for all those features when making a prediction. If we have feature 1-5 only we would need to build a 5 feature model. Or give real values for feature 1-5 and some dummy/median/average values for remaining features. Creating a separate model for each combination of features does not scale (think of case where we need to model 100 features). Is there a recommended way of achieving this goal ?
