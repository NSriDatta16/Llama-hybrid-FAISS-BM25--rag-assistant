How do I get product category information using collections in Magento

I am trying to output all the products from our Magento shop - the following code works, however I also need to grab the category id & the parent category name too. Can anyone suggest how I can do this? $product = Mage::getModel('catalog/product'); $productCollection = $product->getCollection() ->addAttributeToSelect('*'); foreach ( $productCollection as $_product ) { echo $_product->getName().' '; }
