Stephen - my bad - for some reason, the search using objectCategory doesn't work. Even though the objectCategory is displayed as CN=Organizational-Unit , for searching, you still need to use the same value as for the objectClass: So try to use the filter (objectCategory=organizationalUnit) - that definitely works for me! UPDATE: in order to get some properties in your search result (in order to display them in the combo box), you need to include those when you create the DirectorySearcher: DirectorySearcher ouSearch = new DirectorySearcher(rootDSE); ouSearch.Filter = "(objectCategory=Organizational-Unit)"; ouSearch.SearchScope = SearchScope.Subtree; ouSearch.PropertiesToLoad.Add("name"); // add more properties if you want to ... With this, you should definitely be able to grab the temp.Properties["name"][0] and stick it into the combobox's list of items. I don't really see what you need the line DirectoryEntry ou = temp.GetDirectoryEntry(); after grabbing the name property .....
