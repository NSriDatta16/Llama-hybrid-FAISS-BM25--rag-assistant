Can I use a Z-score with skewed and non-normal data?

I've been working with some process cycle time data and scaling using the standard z-score in order to compare between parts of the full cycle time. Should I use some other transformation since the data are heavily right-skewed/non-normal? ('outliers' can never take negative time and often take much longer than 'average') Using the z-score still seems to "work" ... ############### # R code ############### mydata
