As a user, I prefer applets. The average user has Windows XP. Obviously they are not concerned about speed, though load times over 30 seconds may be annoying. As a programmer, I prefer Java Web Start. It is faster and in my opinion better. I think if you are deciding which to use, it is mostly a matter of personal choice.
