You probably have some basic algorithm errors, creating large data structures, re-building data as other structures, too much large string manipulations, loading whole files into memory, re-fetching data from storage instead of re-using what was retrieved last time, that sort of thing. And many home-grown database handlers give you the whole dataset returned from your query instead of giving you a dataset resource. This is particularly pernicious with queries that can return way more data than originally envisaged. Once you profile your code, you can start looking for memory waste. For processing large logging datasets, structure your code to work with one line at a time, so it do (for example) while( $data = mysql_fetch_assoc() ) rather than foreach( $data_rows as $data ) . This also lets you use an unbuffered query which will also reduce memory consumption. The error log should be telling you the script that died. Maybe the Apache error log can help.
