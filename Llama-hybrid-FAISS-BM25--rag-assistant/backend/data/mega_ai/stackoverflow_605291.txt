Header message just like at Stack Overflow

This is the first time I visited stack overflow and I saw a beautiful header message which displays a text and a close button. The header bar is fixed one and is great to get the attention of the visitor. I was wondering if anyone of you guys know the code to get the same kind of header bar.
