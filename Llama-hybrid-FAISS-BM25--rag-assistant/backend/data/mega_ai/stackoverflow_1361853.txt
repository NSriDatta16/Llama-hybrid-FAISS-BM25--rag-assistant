Ok, I found the solution to this. The problem was that my WAR file contained some JSF libraries needed by my app, but when deploying, JBOSS was taking its own JSF libraries instead so there was this mismatching between them All you have to do is to add the following lines in the web.xml of your app, and be sure that your WAR file contains both jsf-api.jar and jsf-impl.jar org.jboss.jbossfaces.WAR_BUNDLES_JSF_IMPL true Click the following link for further information: http://www.jboss.org/community/wiki/RichFacesinstallingandconfiguration Hope it helps!!
