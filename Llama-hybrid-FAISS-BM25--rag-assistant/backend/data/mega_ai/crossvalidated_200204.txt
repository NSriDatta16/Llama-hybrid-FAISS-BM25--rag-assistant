First, it depends on the sample size. If you use regular AIC (not divided by the number of observations), its magnitude will vary with the sample size. For example, if the average probability density of your fitted distribution is 0.1, then the whole sample's likelihood will be $0.1^n$ where $n$ is the sample size; the larger the sample, the smaller the likelihood, the higher the AIC. Second (and more importantly), it depends on the application. Even when normalized by the sample size, AIC may not be assessed independently of the context. A similar question is, how high an $R^2$ is good enough. In modelling financial returns, a fair (not data-snooped) $R^2$ of 0.10 may be considered good, while in some other applications anything below 0.50 is perceived as rubbish. In conclusion, assessing the value of AIC on an absolute scale is tricky (while comparing a few values of AIC to each other is easier -- but that is another topic).
