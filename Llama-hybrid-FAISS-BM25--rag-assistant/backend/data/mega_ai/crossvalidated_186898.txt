handling spikes in ARIMA model residual components

I am trying to predict sales values using time series approach. Below graph is the sales for a store over a period of 942 days (sales will be 0 when the store is closed and are not plotted in first 2 graphs for sake for clarity in graph): Stacking yearly sales give us a graph like below: It looked like it may be worth investing in time series, so I tried drawing the acf and pacf graphs which are shown below: The strong auto correlation in the curve suggest the presence of time series. So I applied, auto.arima() function from r to just look at how it performs ( salesModel ). Below is the residuals plot from arima. I tested the prediction on Kaggle Leaderboard and the approach did not perform that well(competition is over now). Model Parameters: Series: saleDataSeries ARIMA(5,1,4) Coefficients: ar1 ar2 ar3 ar4 ar5 ma1 ma2 ma3 -0.0885 -0.1938 -0.5965 -0.3084 -0.3058 -0.8985 0.0040 0.7063 s.e. 0.1036 0.0634 0.0451 0.0329 0.0690 0.1202 0.0704 0.0909 ma4 -0.6996 s.e. 0.0296 sigma^2 estimated as 4621003: log likelihood=-8555.57 AIC=17115.2 AICc=17115.43 BIC=17163.67 Currently I am also looking at multiple seasonality using tbats , but I believe that there can be certain modifications that can be made to simple ARIMA model as the ACF/PACF graph still have some spikes in the residual component. I am unsure why this is happening and any insights would be helpful
