Agglomerative Clustering (average linkage) and Pearson Correlation

Does having a positive or negative correlation between features being clustered affect the agglomerative clustering result? I have three columns in my dataset, and I'm trying to figure out if I should cluster on all three features or use only a subset. The Pearson correlation coefficients are: X & Z --> -0.07, p=0.14 X & Y --> -0.08, p=0.08 Z & Y --> 0.68, p The Variance Inflation Factor is: variables VIF Y 2.816716 X 3.552227 Z 6.232414 Should I choose X and Y because p-value > 0.05: The correlation is not statistically significant? Just looking at the Variance Inflation Factor and Pearson Correlation analysis enough to determine which features should be chosen for clustering?
