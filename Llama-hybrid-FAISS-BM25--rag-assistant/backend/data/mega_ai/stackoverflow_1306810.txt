The problem is that the sizes of storage such as unsigned int can only hold so much. With 1 and -5 it does not matter, but with 1 and -500000000 you might end up with a confusing result. Also, unsigned storage will interpret anything stored in it as positive, so you cannot put a negative value in an unsigned variable. Two big things to watch out for: 1. Overflow in the operation itself: 1 + -500000000 2. Issues in casting: (unsigned int)(1 + -500)
