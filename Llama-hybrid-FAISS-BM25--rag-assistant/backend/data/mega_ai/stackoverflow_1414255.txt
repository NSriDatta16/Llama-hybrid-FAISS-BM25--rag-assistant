Allen Holub wrote a great article for JavaWorld in 2003 on this topic called Why extends is evil . His take on the "program to the interface" statement, as you can gather from his title, is that you should happily implement interfaces, but very rarely use the extends keyword to subclass. He points to, among other things, what is known as the fragile base-class problem. From Wikipedia: a fundamental architectural problem of object-oriented programming systems where base classes (superclasses) are considered "fragile" because seemingly safe modifications to a base class, when inherited by the derived classes, may cause the derived classes to malfunction. The programmer cannot determine whether a base class change is safe simply by examining in isolation the methods of the base class.
