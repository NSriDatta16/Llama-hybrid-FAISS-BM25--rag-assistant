With Core Animation (Layer based) you can do much advanced things, like 3d animation (embedding your view in 3d space). UiView animations are quite powerful though, and shouldn't be a performance bottleneck until you have plenty of them. I only see one example in your code, and its duration is extremely short. In fact, you are almost setting the frame property instantly (70 ms is 14 fps). You should think of UIView animation in terms of start, end, and the duration for the whole distance - which is typically 0.2 s to several seconds. It is not designed to to fire one micro animation after another.
