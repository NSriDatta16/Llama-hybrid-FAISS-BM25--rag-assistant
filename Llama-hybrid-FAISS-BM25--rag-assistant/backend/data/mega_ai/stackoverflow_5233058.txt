gitolite push error -> remote: ENV GL_RC not set

I am trying to push content from a workstation to a server. But it gives me an error. Please look at the following for command and error: Administrator@ganesh ~/testing $ git push origin master Counting objects: 3, done. Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 241 bytes, done. Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0) remote: ENV GL_RC not set remote: BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at hooks/update line 20. remote: error: hook declined to update refs/heads/master To git@ganesh:repositories/testing ! [remote rejected] master -> master (hook declined) error: failed to push some refs to 'git@ganesh:repositories/testing' It seems that I need to set the environment variable GL_RC . Is this so? Can anyone here tell me what the problem might be and how I can solve it? I am using gitolite on Windows Server 2003.
