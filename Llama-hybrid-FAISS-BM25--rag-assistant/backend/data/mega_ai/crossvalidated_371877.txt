Mathematical structure of SimpleRNN in keras

Two types of RNN can be used: Type1: The output is being used as state h(t) = g(W 1 .x(t) + W 2 .h(t-1) + b 1 ) Type2: There is a state in addition to the output a(t) = g(W 1 .x(t) + W 2 .a(t-1) + b 1 ) h(t) = g(W 3 .a(t) + b 2 ) Which of the above mathematical structure is implemented by SimpleRNN in keras? I tried looking at the documentation, but its unclear. Edit : The source of keras.layers.SimpleRNN suggests RNN of type 1. See the call method of SimpleRNNCell at https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/keras/layers/recurrent.py
