Web UI for inputting a function from the reals to the reals, such as a probability distribution

I would like a web interface for a user to describe a one-dimensional real-valued function. I'm imagining the user being presented with a blank pair of axes and they can click anywhere to create points that are thick and draggable. Double-clicking a point, let's say, makes it disappear. The actual function should be shown in real time as an interpolation of the user-supplied points. Here's what this looks like implemented in Mathematica (though of course I'm looking for something in javascript): (source: yootles.com )
