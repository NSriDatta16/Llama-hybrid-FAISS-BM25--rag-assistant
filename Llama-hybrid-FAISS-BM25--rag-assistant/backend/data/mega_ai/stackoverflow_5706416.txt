Yes and No Is there a language feature? No. Can it be done in a system-independent fashion? No. Is there an easy way? No. Can it be done in a system-specific way with some effort? Yes. In summary, there is no good way and no easy way, but if you really really want to it can be done. Broadly speaking, the program is compiled for debugging and you then open the image file at run-time and find out which variables exist and where they are stored. Most likely, the practical way to accomplish this would be to script a debugger like gdb and let it do the low-level work. If you system already has a run-time traceback feature then you may be able to leverage that. Another possibility: some operating systems support a library function that reads the symbol table. Historic Unix and Mac OS X have nlist(3). Some versions of Linux and Solaris have dlinfo(3). A CLI tool called nm(1) (you could popen(1) it) is commonly available.
