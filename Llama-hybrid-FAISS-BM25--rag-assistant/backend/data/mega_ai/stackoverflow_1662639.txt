@JaredPar. Fixed thanks to you, i would have never thought to look at the previous page in my client (that i was loading from) for the answer. I had a button with the code: Page newPage; if (App.ModeType == "Mode1"){ newPage = new MyClient.Pages.Mode1.Building(); } else if (App.ModeType == "Mode2") { newPage = new MyClient.Pages.Mode2.RiskQuestions(); } else { throw new NotImplementedException(); } ///Must be Mode3 Organisations thisOrg = (Organisations)lvOrganisations.SelectedItem; App.selectedOrganisation = thisOrg; NavigationService.Navigate(newPage); By moving App.selectedOrganisation to before i set the "newPage" everything was fixed. I guess that the constructor gets called at the point i was setting "newPage". For the sake of clarity, Final code which worked for me looks like this: Organisations thisOrg = (Organisations)lvOrganisations.SelectedItem; App.selectedOrganisation = thisOrg; Page newPage; if (App.ModeType == "Mode1"){ newPage = new MyClient.Pages.Mode1.Building(); } else if (App.ModeType == "Mode2") { newPage = new MyClient.Pages.Mode2.RiskQuestions(); } else { throw new NotImplementedException(); } ///Must be Mode3 NavigationService.Navigate(newPage);
