Yes! A neural network is an entire program, or at least a "system" or a "mechanism". A neural network uses data structures (e.g. arrays, hashmaps, linked lists...) to store its weights and connections, but most developers would draw a line between data structures as the underlying "plumbing" and advanced constructs like neural networks which sit on a higher abstraction layer. I'm trying to think of a good analogy for your question. At the moment, the best I can come up with is asking "can we consider an automobile a more advanced internal combustion engine?"
