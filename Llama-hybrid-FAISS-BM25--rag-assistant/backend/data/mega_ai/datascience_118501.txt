General methods to deal with time series data

Sorry I'm new to machine learning and statistics. For time series predictions, do you use RNN or something? For example, the past 2 years' sales of a product. TBH Im pretty much unfamiliar with how statisticians deal with time series data. I'm dealing with some time series problems and I'm not sure if I should put all my trust on RNN or some other DL models. What do you think of the RNN models? I mean if it works fine then I dont have to research on other models Sorry I'm unable to provide the specific data here, don't know if it will cause vagueness. But the sales data is definitely a topic of interest.
