There is no requirement, unless you want older iPhone's to not be able to run your software. If you use frameworks that do not exist in older iPhone framework's such as the iPod MediaPlayer access class. When that code is executed on a 2.2 device it will simply crash. You can test your app in the iPhone simulator, just set it to run on the older iPhone version. Yes you should be testing on the older iPhone OS unless you want those people to have problems running your software. I'm sure there are a lot of people out there that have no idea that their software can be upgraded, and i know there are lots of people who hardly ever connect their device to iTunes, so I would be sure to at least still test with version 2.2 and upwards. You can always revert your iPod touch software to an older version using the Organiser in Xcode. Choose (in Xcode): Window > Organiser You can then select an older version of the iPhone software which you can revert to and do testing from. Likewise in the iPhone simulator you can select: Hardware > Version and choose an older version to run the simulator from. Note you will need to have the older SDK installed to do that. It make be a little annoying juggling back and forth, but it can be done and in 6-12 months time I would estimate that you won't need to worry about 2.2 anymore.
