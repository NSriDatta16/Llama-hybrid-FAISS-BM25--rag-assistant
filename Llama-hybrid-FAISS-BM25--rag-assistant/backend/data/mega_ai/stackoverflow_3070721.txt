If it can be assumed that the fist sentence after the last '*' is separated by a period - then you can do the following: Replace the input by finding all * characters Find the last and then find the first . after it. Recombine the fragments, replacing * with * Here's some code to get you going: (it may not be perfect). I'm using string.Split() here rather than string.Replace() because I find it makes the logic easier to follow. The trick is that the last subRegion consists of two parts (the bullet and the sentence after the bullet). string inputText = "..."; string[] subRegions = inputText.Split( "*" ); // split final region into bullet and sentance based on first period... string[] lastRegions = subRegions[subRegion.Length-1].Split(new[]{'.'},2); // replace the final subregion with the combined parts (bullet/sentence) subRegions[subRegions.Length-1] = string.Join(". ",lastRegions); // combine all subregions together, replacing `*` with bulletized breaks. string finalText = string.Join( " *", subRegions );
