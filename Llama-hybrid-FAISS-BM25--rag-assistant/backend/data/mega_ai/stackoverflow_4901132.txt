Tool to verify the optimal packing of all structures in a C program

Is there any tool that could verify the alignment of all structures in a particular set of C files and let us know the improperly packed structures so that proper packing(padding) can be done manually ? Is there any tool that would also do the necessary modification(padding) of the strucutures as per the required alignment and give the resultant files ? The tool should ensure that the compiler does not leave holes in the structure, so that the structures are optimally packed (without resorting to #pragma pack or other such tricks), and would reorder items within the structure to minimize such holes. Please let me know if any such tool exists in either Windows or Linux?
