If your mostly-empty pages are because the following content starts on a new page (at the end of a chapter, for example), then the easiest way to fix it is probably to insert a vertical fill after your last paragraph. The vertical fill should expand to occupy the extra space, keeping the inter-paragraph fill small. You can change the vertical space applied to every paragraph by setting the value of \parskip .
