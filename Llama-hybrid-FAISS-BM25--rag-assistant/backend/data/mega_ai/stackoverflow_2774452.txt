Your description sounds accurate for the current state of the art. You shouldn't be using a single iteration of any hash function, though: At the very least, you should iterate many times (1000 iterations of the hash increases the attacker's work 1000-fold. It increases your work by the same amount, but you're doing a lot less password hashing than they are). Ideally, however, you should use an existing password storage primitive, such as those described here .
