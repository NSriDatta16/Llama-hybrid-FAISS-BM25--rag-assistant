GAM: Find a good distribution for the monthly data sums?

I am new in the GAM modelling. I would like to find a family, that will fit my response variables. I am using the sums of monthly counts of beetles, collected from the beetle traps in ~ two weeks interval (this can vary between traps and years) and from diverse locations across Germany. My datasets contains some zeros, but not too many. Also, as I have sum of counts, my data are always positives and integer. As I am moving from counts (discrete), are now my sums continuous ones? Shortly, my dataset contains some zeros (~10% of data), and also extreme values, where many traps have very low counts. Here is how my monthly sums looks like: I have found that Tweedie distribution can account for existing zeros and is often used in GAM models in similar studies. But when applied in my data, I almost find a perfect fit, but weird pattern exactly at low/zero values: I am not sure, how can I account for this data chunk in my family ? I have tried different combination of a, b, and theta parameters, and tested several families in mgcv package (as I will further use bam ). nb family has a good fit, but again have a weird pattern at low values. Maybe you have some suggestions how can I fit my data better? Thank you! Here is my code, using gam(y~1) to only fit the y distribution, without any predictors: m I wonder, if this can be done only by adjusting the parameters within family, or should I move to completely different family? Thank you for your thoughts. My study design is very similar to Irregular time series data including long-term trends, and spatially varying (e.g. share of the forests in each trap surrounding). Following @Gavin Simpson comment, I expect that the trap counts depends on location (XY) and time (variation betweeen months, between years). As suggested by @Gavin Simpson, I should move from using a single distribution to use different distribution for each trap? How can that be implemented?
