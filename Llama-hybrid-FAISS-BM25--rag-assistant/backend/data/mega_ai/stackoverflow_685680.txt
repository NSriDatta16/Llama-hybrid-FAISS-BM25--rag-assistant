The problem with non-English naming of classes and functions is, that you invariably going to end up with macaronic pidgin. Keywords are in English, naming conventions (like for example getters/setters) are also English, same for standard names for design patterns. You're going to end up with stuff like: OrganisatoriskEnhedFactory::getInstance()->getIndblikskode();
