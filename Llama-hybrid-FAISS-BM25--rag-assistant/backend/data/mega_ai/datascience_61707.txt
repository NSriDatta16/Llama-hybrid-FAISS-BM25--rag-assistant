Policy Gradient with continuous action space

How to apply reinforce/policy-gradient algorithms for continuous action space. I have learnt that one of the advantages of policy gradients is , it is applicable for continuous action space. One way I can think of is discretizing the action space same as the way we do it for dqn. Should we follow the same method for policy -gradient algorithms also ? Or is there any other way this is done? Thanks
