how big to make k for cross validation

Is there a limit to how big you should make K for k-fold cross validation? I understand as K gets bigger performing the CV will take longer, but aside from that, is there any reason not to make K = n? is there a point where your validation sets are so small that even if you average them, the result is garbage?
