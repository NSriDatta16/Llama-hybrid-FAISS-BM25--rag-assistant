Reading your comments above I would go pretty much the way you first figured: Create a single table with all the needed information. Your ideas seem fine and since the schema is small, it will be sufficient for the task. A cron job to archive the data after 30 days is a good idea. If you don't want to move it to another database (table) you can export it as CSV (or similar) and just store it somewhere. Some things you should keep in mind: Enough space on each of the database server and especially the storage Exporting the data in a different format than e.g. CSV may not be the best idea. If your application has another format that can be stored more easily, you might consider using the other one.
