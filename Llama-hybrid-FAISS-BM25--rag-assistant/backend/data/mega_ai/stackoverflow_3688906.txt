According to wikipedia : The current HTML5 draft specification does not specify which video formats browsers should support in the video tag. User agents are free to support any video formats they feel are appropriate. HTML5 is in draft format though and this may change. There is an ongoing debate about the suitability of various algorithms and it seems that currently not everyone involved is able to agree on an answer. The three major contenders are Ogg/Theora, H.264 and VP8/WebM. The present state of the various implementations varies between the browsers . The current HTML5 draft spec states: It would be helpful for interoperability if all browsers could support the same codecs. However, there are no known codecs that satisfy all the current players: we need a codec that is known to not require per-unit or per-distributor licensing, that is compatible with the open source development model, that is of sufficient quality as to be usable, and that is not an additional submarine patent risk for large companies. This is an ongoing issue and this section will be updated once more information is available.
