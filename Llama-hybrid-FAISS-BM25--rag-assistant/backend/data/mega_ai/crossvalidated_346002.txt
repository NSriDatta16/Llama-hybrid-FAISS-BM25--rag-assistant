How does Bayes' rule on two exponentials suggest a sigmoid?

In Platt's 1999 paper on turning support vector machine output into a probabilistic score, he says Bayes rule on two exponentials suggests using a parametric form of a sigmoid where he cites this paper . I'm still getting up to speed on Bayesian probability, so could someone help me do the math (or point me towards a reference that does) so I can see how the posterior of two exponentials suggests a sigmoid ? To get started, I've tried working through this thesis and looking at specific questions like this one , but I must be missing something fundamental because I can't even get started on the problem.
