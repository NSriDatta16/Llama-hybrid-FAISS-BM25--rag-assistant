How can principal components be correlated when averaged?

I am working with sequences that consist of 20 building blocks. Those 20 building blocks were characterized using different parameters and after linear PCA, the first 3 principal components were extracted. Now, what I am interested in is characterizing groups of sequences using these three PCs. For that, I first average the values for each PC over a sequence and next, I average those values over each group. Now, when I make a correlation matrix of the final averages, I find those 3 PCs to be highly correlated (r > 0.9). I am a bit confused on how this is possible starting from three PCs that are by definition orthogonal to each other?
