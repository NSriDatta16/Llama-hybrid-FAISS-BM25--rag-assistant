What are the performance implications of wildcard mapping all requests through IIS 6.0?

I am interested in using UrlRewriter.NET and noticed in the config page for IIS 6.0 on Win2k3, that they say to map all requests through the ASP.NET ISAPI. That's fine, but I am wondering if anyone has good or bad things to say about this performance wise? Is my web server going to be dragged down to its knees by doing this or will it be more of a small step up in server load? My server currently has room to breathe now, so some performance hit is expected and acceptable.
