Significance of comparing Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves

An ROC curve plots the true positive rate (sensitivity) as function of the false positive rate (100-specificity) for different cut-off points of a parameter. Each point on the ROC curve represents a sensitivity/specificity pair corresponding to a particular decision threshold. This would permit one to compare the goodness of the model when varying the given parameter (e.g. number of trees in a Random Forest) to help optimize that particular classifier's parameters. Although should one be using ROC curves when comparing different types of classifiers (e.g. Random Forest vs Neural Net vs Logistic Regression)? I came across an instance of such an example on the second last slide here and was trying to understand the significance of these curves. As far as I am aware, the graph displayed appears to not be a necessarily fair comparison when comparing the area under the curve while tuning different parameters in different types of classifiers.
