There is no way around that in the Amazon API. You need to filter your amazon request using the prefix as you are and then filter out the 'subfolders' on the client. The best solution actually, is not to try to navigate your S3 storage. Instead you should maintain an 'index' of your files in a proper database (MySql, SimpleDb etc) that you search and query against, and then just retrieve the file from S3 when needed.
