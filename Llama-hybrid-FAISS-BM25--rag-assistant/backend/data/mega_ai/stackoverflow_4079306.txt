Securing jquery ajax calls

Recently i started digging into jquery's ajax function. I've made a lot of improvements, but im insecure in one point. How to secure my ajax calls.. For example this code for deleting a link: // Delete link $('.delete_update').live("click",function() { var ID = $(this).attr("id"); var dataString = 'linkid='+ ID; if(confirm(' ')) { $.ajax({ type: "POST", url: "ajaxsave.php", data: dataString, cache: false, success: function(html){ $(".bar"+ID).fadeOut('slow', function() {$(this).remove();}); } }); } return false; }); As the example shows ajaxsave.php takes care of deleting the link with the matchin POST linkid. To my knowledge it is possible to submit a post form to an external url. Meaning that everybody would be able to look at my sourcecode and make their own post forms choosing their own linkid. That way they can delete all the links they want. How do i secure my code? - Http referrer in ajaxsave.php ? Curl scripts would could ruin that. - Using session or cookies on the page calling the ajax function? Saving the session in a database and checking for it in ajaxsave.php ? Can you help me? How do you do this in an elegant way. Or what is "normal" on all these modern ajax sites..
