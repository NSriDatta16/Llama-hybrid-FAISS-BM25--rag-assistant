What is the meaning of likelihood?

I am studying Bayes probability applied to machine learning, and I have encoutered the concept of likelihood, which I don't understand. I have seen that the Bayes rule is: $P(A|B)=\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}$ where $P(B|A)P(A)$ is the conditional probability, while $P(B|A)$ is the likelihood, but I don't understand what the likelihood is. Can somebody please help me?
