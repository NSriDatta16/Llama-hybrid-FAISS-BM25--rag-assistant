a colon required after def s: def getItemValue(item, key, defval): ... boolean operators: In python ! -> not ; && -> and and || -> or (see http://docs.python.org/release/2.5.2/lib/boolean.html for boolean operators). There's no ? : operator in python, there is a return (x) if (x) else (x) expression although I personally rarely use it in favour of plain if 's. booleans/ None : True , False and None have capitals before them. checking types of arguments: In python, you generally don't declare types of function parameters. You could go e.g. assert isinstance(item, dict), "dicts must be passed as the first parameter!" in the function although this kind of "strict checking" is often discouraged as it's not always necessary in python. python keywords: default isn't a reserved python keyword and is acceptable as arguments and variables (just for the reference.) style guidelines: PEP 8 (the python style guideline) states that module import s should generally only be one per line, though there are some exceptions (I have to admit I often don't follow the import sys and os on separate lines, though I usually follow it otherwise.) file open modes: rt isn't valid in python 2.x - it will work, though the t will be ignored. See also http://docs.python.org/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files . It is valid in python 3 though, so I don't think it it'd hurt if you want to force text mode, raising exceptions on binary characters (use rb if you want to read non-ASCII characters.) working with dictionaries: Python used to use dict.has_key(key) but you should use key in dict now (which has largely replaced it, see http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#mapping-types-dict .) split file extensions: code = infile[0:-4] could be replaced with code = os.path.splitext(infile)[0] (which returns e.g. ('root', '.ext') with the dot in the extension (see http://docs.python.org/library/os.path.html#os.path.splitext ). EDIT: removed multiple variable declarations on a single line stuff and added some formatting. Also corrected the rt isn't a valid mode in python when in python 3 it is.
