As you've discovered, you won't be able to use a WebBrowser control because the height and width reported are the height and width of the control itself, not the document inside the control. What you'd really need to do is write your own HTML parsing engine to calculate this out on your own. You would need to calculate out all of the lines, figure out the line height, etc. Is this really worth the effort? You would need to make so many assumptions that such a calculation would be pretty much worthless... Differences in rendering by different browsers, customers that have their text size set to something other than the default, and probably dozens of others. Even the screen resolution would matter because, as you can see in this paragraph, text tends to wrap. You need to calculate where the text will wrap in order to calculate how many lines of text will show up. You need to factor in font sizes... All of that said, in theory this should be doable, and the mechanics for calculating this all out would be the same concepts you would use for printing to a printer. Calculating the page height, and figuring out where you are on the page is all standard operating procedure when printing manually. Here's an article that explains the basics. It'll be up to you to see if it's worth the effort. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc188767.aspx
