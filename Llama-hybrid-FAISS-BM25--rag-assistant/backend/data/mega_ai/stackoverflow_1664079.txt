Google and Yahoo! have added flash crawling functionality to their engines recently. http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flashplayer/articles/swf_searchability.html From a SEO perspective you're fine on that front. Still..your page will need a DOC TYPE, Page Title, etc to remain SEO compliant. IF your target market is users browsing your site from a laptop or desktop you should be fine. You may want to include a flash-free option for users accessing your site on a mobile phone or with javascript/flash disabled. For example, You can run a browser sniffer to redirect any user agents accessing the page on Safari via an iPhone OS. Other than that Flash does offer some nice flair to a site. If you can give alternatives to users that don't like the application then I say do it.
