If you're building a high volume application that needs to service 100k clients then you should choose IIS. IIS has a lot of facilities built in to handle high loads along with enterprise features like authentication and SSL certificates. If you use a Windows Service you'll hvae to roll a lot of that yourself. You can use WCF with either so it's a decision about which application type suits you better and it definitely sounds like IIS.
