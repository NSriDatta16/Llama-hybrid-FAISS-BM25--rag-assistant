Safest LAMP encrypt method

what is PHP's safest encrypt/decrypt method, in use with MySQL - to store let's say passwords? Of course, not for portal purposes - hashing is the safest option there. I want to do little password (domain/mysql/ftp...) storage for our whole team online, so we could log in and check to passwords, but I don't want really to endanger our clients' bussinesses. Hash can't be used for obvious reasons - we need to get the passwords in readable form back, after logging in - (Doesn't really make sense to run rainbow tables every time :D). Any idea? Edit: so far, there was just mysql-level AES . Do you think anything would be better/safer or do you have any experience with 3rd party open source code?
