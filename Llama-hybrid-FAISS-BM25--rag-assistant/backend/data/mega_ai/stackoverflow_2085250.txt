I generally agree with ZhukovRA, but this doesn't seem to work completely. The problem is that unless you are a participant of a wave, you don't see anything. So linking directly to a wave only makes sense if the wave is public. The direct link generated looks like this: https://wave.google.com/wave/#restored:wave:googlewave.com!1234567890 - where 1234567890 is the wave's ID, from what I can gather. There's a Wordpress plugin for embedding waves, which is featured here: http://mashable.com/2009/09/08/google-wave-wordpress-plugin/
