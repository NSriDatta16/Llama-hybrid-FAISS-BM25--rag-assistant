Retrieval of Single Entity + Ria Services

I am reading and doing some RnD on RIA as a solution for a new Silverlight project. I have read alot of the documentation and decided to do a small mockup of a system using .Net RIA Services. I want to know how to get a Single Entity from the Domain Service? example: I want to get a person and populate a form: public Person GetSinglePerson() { return new Person { ID = 4, FirstName = "Cyanide", LastName = "Happiness", Status=3 }; } Say I use the the DomainDataSource: This only returns a EntityCollectionView? How do I bind for example in a form to properties that are in the Person Class? Like: Everything seems to come back as IEnumerable or as CollectionViews (like the DATA binding in the samples) which aren't useful for a single entity. I want a single persons entry, why do I want a CollectionView in which I cannot access properties directly. I have also use the: LoadOperation oLoadOperation = oDataContext.Load(oDataContext.GetSinglePersonQuery()); I am very close to giving up on this RIA idea and just going with a normal WCF service as it is more predictable and manageable at this stage.
