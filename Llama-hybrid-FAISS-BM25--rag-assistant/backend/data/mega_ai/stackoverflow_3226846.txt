I can only answer part of the question. You can "eject" USB devices using this API: CM_Request_Device_Eject (MSDN link) I'm using it to eject USB thumb drives after I copy stuff onto them in a backup application. I'm pretty sure there are ways of enumerating available USB devices using one of the many CM_XXX routines, but I was only interested in storage devices connected via USB, so I can't comment on WiFi devices. An other sugestion: Maybe you can solve your problem at an other layer, maybe you can detect the addition of a new network adapter and disable that. Not all USB devices can be ejected, it's probably a driver-related issue. But I guess, if you can eject it from the notification area icon, you can eject it from code.
