Symmetric AND Weight MAPE Calculation

I'm responsible to forecast a portfolio of consumer products on a monthly basis, and in calculating forecast accuracy, I'm lead to the MAPE (Mean Average Percent Error), which is useful, but has, among its faults, two that I need to address: It's non-symmetric, as the divisor of actuals results in infinity or extremely high numbers if an item is forecasted but not sold (or extremely low sales) in a given time period. It's not weighted, with items of low volume and/or low value having the same influence on the total error as high volume and/or high value items. The sMAPE (symmetric MAPE) addresses #1 by changing the divisor to the average of teh forecast and the actuals. The WMAPE (weighted MAPE) address #2 by either adding a weighting factor, or, if using volume as the weighting, sums the error before dividing by the sum of the actuals. (I'm leaving it to the reader to either already understand the formulas, or look them up on many available online references). My question is, I can only find one reference to a symmetric weighted MAPE...a sWMAPE, if you will, that addresses both of the issues. And that one reference simply proposes the formula saying that they couldn't find it documented in the literature. It seems obvious that this would be a natural evolution of using MAPE -- why isn't it mentioned? I'm using it -- it seems to work quite well!
