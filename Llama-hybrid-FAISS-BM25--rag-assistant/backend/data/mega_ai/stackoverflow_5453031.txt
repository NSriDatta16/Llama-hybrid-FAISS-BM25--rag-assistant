EDIT2 I realised after posting, that the OP had NSString in the title but put NSMutableString in the code. I have submitted an edit to change the NSMutableString to NSString. I will leave this as it still maybe helpful. Well I am surprised that does not give an error, because you are giving a NSMutableString a NSString. You need to read the Documentation on NSMutableStrings . to give you an idea //non mutable strings NSString *shortGreetingString = @"Hi"; NSString *longGreetingString = @"Hi Again"; /*mutable string - is created and given a character capacity The number of characters indicated by capacity is simply a hint to increase the efficiency of data storage. The value does not limit the length of the string */ NSMutableString *mutableString= [NSMutableString stringWithCapacity:15]; /*The mutableString, now uses an appendFormat to construct the string each %@ in the Parameters for the appendFormat is a place holder for values of NSStrings listed in the order you want after the comma. Any other charactars will be included in the construction, in this case the new lines. */ [mutableString appendFormat:@"%@\n\n%@",shortGreetingString,longGreetingString]; NSLog (@"mutableString = %@" ,mutableString); [pool drain];
