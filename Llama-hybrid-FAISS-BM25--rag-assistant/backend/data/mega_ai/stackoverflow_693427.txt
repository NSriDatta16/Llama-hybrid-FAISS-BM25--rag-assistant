Well, byte[] (or something wrapping a byte[] ) is fairly portable... most anything else is going to be implementation specific. Re database vs file... for the purposes of the client apps (Silverlight, WPF, etc) I would probably expose them via a web page rather than a WCF (etc) call - i.e. some ASP.NET handler (or ASP.NET MVC route) that returns the image via an http call. Then all you actually need in the client is the path to the image ( /people/images/12345 or whatever). For storage - either is usually fine... in SQL Server 2008 you can do both at once with the file-stream type. One of the problems with storing BLOBs in the database is increasing the size, but a few (small) images won't usually hurt (unless you are using SQL Express and have a capped db size). But using the database has the advantage that a single backup includes everything. Saying that, though: almost every implementation I've done like this has used files.
