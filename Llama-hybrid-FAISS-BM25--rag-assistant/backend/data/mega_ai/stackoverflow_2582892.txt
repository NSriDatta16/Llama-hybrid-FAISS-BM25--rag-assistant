Implement a server that receives and processes client request(cassandra as backend), Python or C++?

I am planning to build an inverted index searching system with cassandra as its storage backend. But I need some guidances to build a highly efficient searching daemon server. I know a web server written in Python called tornado, my questions are: Is Python a good choice for developing such kind of apps? Is Nginx(or Sphinx) a good example that I can look inside to learn its architecture to implement a highly efficient server? Anything else I should learn to do this? Thank you~
