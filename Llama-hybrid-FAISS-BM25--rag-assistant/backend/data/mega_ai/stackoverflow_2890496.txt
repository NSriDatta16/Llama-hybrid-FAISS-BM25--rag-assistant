I think it depends on whether you need high performance or saving storage. You can just save elements into an array of 100. I don't know a lot about extendible hashing, but my general understanding about hashing is that it will have some kinds of collision, and if you use a bigger array to store it, the number of collision can reduce and the performance in adding/deleting and querying will also be faster. I think you should use at least 128 (just to be 2^k, I am not an expert in hashing):)
