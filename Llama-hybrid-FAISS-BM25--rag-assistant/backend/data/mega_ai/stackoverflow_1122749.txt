Implementing drag and drop with QT 4.5 using QT Creator environment

We're about to commit to Qt and C++ (sigh) to do some cross-platform development. The latest version of Qt 4.5 seems very nice as does the QT Creator IDE, which although simple compared to other IDEs, is a good way to get started. I'm trying to understand how to do drag and drop into QT widgets from the "outside" world. As far as I can tell from the documentation, you're supposed to subclass a widget that you want to have respond to drop events and override some methods (the dragEnterEvent and dropEvent member functions) for that widget. But if I use the Qt Creator tool, I don't seem to have any access to the classes of the widgets that I have created using the GUI form builder and so I can't subclass them. WHat's the secret? Thanks in advance, D
