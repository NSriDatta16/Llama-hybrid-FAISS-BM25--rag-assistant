There are quiet a few papers which delve around that idea. Basically it consists of taking a max-margin classifier that divide the feature space recursively according to some criteria, until a desired accuracy/performance is achieved. It is a combinatorial problem, and different papers offer different heuristic to tackle complexity in an efficient way. One work is Margin Trees for High-dimensional Classification , which describes a basic classifier used to build up a binary tree. There are a number of approaches (which in spirit are quite similar to this one) using SVMs, like for example A Hierarchy of Support Vector Machines for Pattern Detection .
