Backpropagation with binary cross entropy loss formula

I will classify using a neural network algorithm. I use 2 output, Y1=1 (positive) and Y2=0 (negative). The architecture is as follows: loss that I use is binary cross entropy with the following formula: From the loss, the error gradient with respect to weight v is: based on the architecture that I demonstrated, is it correct to calculate the error gradient with respect to v11 like this?
