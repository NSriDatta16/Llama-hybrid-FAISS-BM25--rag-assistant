Docker for data science

I recently started to read articles about Docker. To me, in data science, Docker is useful because: 1) You have a totally different environment, which protect you against libraries and dependencies problems. 2) If your application modify, for example, the database of your company, you want first to make sure that the code works fine, and won't have bad consequences on the database. Thus, you use Docker to test your code first. my questions: Am I right if I say that only the second reason is about sand boxing? The first reason has nothing to do with sand boxing, right? Are there other reasons why Docker is useful in Data science?? I don't find a lot of interesting research papers about Docker for data science. Do you know some famous ones?
