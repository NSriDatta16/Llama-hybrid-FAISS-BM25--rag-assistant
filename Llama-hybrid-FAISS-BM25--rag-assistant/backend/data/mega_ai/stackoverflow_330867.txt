In C99, you can use a designated initializer to initialize a structure: MY_TYPE a = { .flag = true, .value = 123, .stuff = 0.456 }; Other members are initialized as zero: "Omitted field members are implicitly initialized the same as objects that have static storage duration." ( https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Designated-Inits.html )
