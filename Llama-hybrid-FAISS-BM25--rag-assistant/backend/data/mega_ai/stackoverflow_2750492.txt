WebLogic doesn't provide an embedded API so, even if it's a pure Java Server and if you can thus call weblogic.Server from Java code, you will have to handle everything yourself (starting the container, waiting until it's started, deploying things, waiting until they are deployed, etc). In other words, this will require some work. Maybe have a look at the sources of Cargo , although Cargo isn't really starting an embedded Weblogic (i.e. running weblogic.Server in the same JVM). This will give you an idea of what has to be done. Or, depending on your needs, use Cargo Java API . But if you need a full Java EE server and if this is an option, I would use GlassFish v3 in embedded mode instead of WebLogic, it will be much simpler. Check the following links and see yourself: Embedding Glassfish V3 in Unit Test - Two Jars, Three Lines Of Code And Five Seconds Start With Deployment Embedding EJB 3.1 Container Into Your Unit Tests - Boot Time: 5 Seconds Using the EJBContainer API with or without Maven (but with GlassFish v3) TOTD #128: EJBContainer.createEJBContainer: Embedded EJB using GlassFish v3
