As everything else, you can use it properly, or improperly. DataBinding can be very powerful at times, but like mentioned before, you must know how to use it correctly. Generally, there are two types of binding in .NET (and its tools): automatic and manual. Automatic binding is when VS creates everything for you, and you drag-and-drop. Don't do this. EVER. Only exception for this would be these new additions to Silverlight 4 in VS2010. It is the only automatic binding done properly. On the other hand, manual databinding using DataSets as Unit of Works, CurrencyManagers and other stuff, can be extremely useful (talking about .NET 2.0 WinForms here, right? ).
