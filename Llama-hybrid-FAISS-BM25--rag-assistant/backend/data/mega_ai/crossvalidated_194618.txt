how to remove outliers prior to multiple imputation

A colleague came to me with the following problem. She has a complex, multivariate data set, in which respondents completed a number of measures with anywhere from 6 to 30 Likert type items for each measure. She removed the cases with high non-response rates, leaving a data set with occasional missing items, but fairly high overall response. She is doing a regression analysis on the total scores of each measure, but decided to impute individually missing items. She is using multiple imputation in SPSS. She also wants to "handle" her "outliers", by shrinking down outlying scores in some way. The problem is that she would like to adjust for outliership before imputing, but outliership is evaluated on the basis of the total scores, which are computed after imputation. An additional wrinkle is that SPSS won't allow her to change anything in the imputed samples, wisely assuming the data have been cleaned prior to imputation. My answer was "No", but my colleague wanted better than that. My view was: It's hard to get outliers by averaging over Likert items. Any outlier would only be at the multivariate level, probably because the respondent was genuinely unusual or just being goofy (the study subjects are adolescents), so these people should be flagged, not "normalized". I don't like automatic outlier detection (as in everything beyond 3 SD's is an outlier) I don't like shrinking outliers down to something more normalesque. What's the best way to handle this situation?
