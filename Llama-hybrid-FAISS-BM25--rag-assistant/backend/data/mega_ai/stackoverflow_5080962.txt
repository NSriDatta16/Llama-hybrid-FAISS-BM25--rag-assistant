HTML5 video is an element introduced in the HTML5 draft specification for the purpose of creating a standards-compliant, plugin-free way for playing videos and movies, partially replacing the object element. Basic usage You can embed a video element into a HTML5 document by using the following code: Your browser does not support the video tag. Attributes The video element has the following specific attributes: src gives the address of the media resource to show crossorigin is a CORS settings attribute poster gives the address of an image file that the user agent can show while no video data is available preload sets the preload behavior, valid values being none , metadata and auto autoplay is a boolean attribute. When present, the user agent will automatically begin playback of the video as soon as it can do so without stopping mediagroup can be used to link multiple media elements together by implicitly creating a MediaController loop is a boolean attribute that, if specified, indicates that the media element is to seek back to the start of the media resource upon reaching the end muted is a boolean attribute that controls the default state of the audio output of the media resource, potentially overriding user preferences controls is a boolean attribute that, if present, indicates that the author has not provided a scripted controller and would like the user agent to provide its own set of controls width & height specify the dimensions of the element in pixels JavaScript API & Events The HTML5 video element can be easily controlled from JavaScript. For example you can easily pause and play a video by doing the following: document.getElementsByTagName('video')[0].play(); document.getElementsByTagName('video')[0].pause(); It also has properties: var time = document.getElementsByTagName('video')[0].currentTime; //will return the current position of the playhead And it also fires events: document.getElementsByTagName('video')[0].addEventListener('ended',function(){ alert('That\'s all folks!'); },false); For a wonderful overview refer to the demo page of the W3 . Media Encoding Browser vendors all support different codec and container formats, so you should encode your video more than once and serve several files simultaneously to ensure your visitor will be able to watch them. A common approach (at the time of writing, i.e. spring 2012) is to serve the following: Make one version that uses WebM (VP8 + Vorbis) Make another version that uses H.264 baseline video and AAC “low complexity” audio in an MP4 container Make another version that uses Theora video and Vorbis audio in an Ogg container Be aware that this is CONSTANTLY CHANGING, so before you set up your video do research on what is currently supported and what the future outlook does look like! Flash & Download Fallback Since video is still unsupported in many browsers used (IE 7+8 for example) it should be considered a good idea to serve Flash Video as a fallback. For browsers that cannot play any video at all you can also serve a link to a simple download. This can be done by adding the traditional object style Flash content into the fallback part of the video element: Your browser can’t play HTML5 video. Download it instead.

Can you display HTML5 as a full screen background? Available libraries There are many JavaScript libraries that offer tools to handle tasks (and fix cross-browser issues) that you will encounter when using the video -element. These are a few (if you know anything else feel free to add them): video.js MediaElement HTML5 Video & Media JavaScript Library by Kaltura Tools for encoding video VLC Player Miro Video Converter FFMPEG Handbrake Further reading Dive into HTML5: Video Video for Everybody Simple HTML5 video player with Flash fallback and custom controls at dev.opera Using HTML5 audio and video at MDN The video element at w3.org Attributions & Notes This tag-wiki was compiled with the help and contents of Dive into HTML 5 , dev.opera.com , w3.org and the MDN . In case anyone has vast experience regarding HTML5 video and mobile devices I think this would be a great addition to this wiki page!
