Applications of Data Mining in economics

I am looking for a thesis topic for my Applied Economics degree where I can use Data Mining/Machine Learning for some kind of prediction. Do you guys have any good ideas about what I could do? My first thought was credit scoring, but that seems a little boring considering the number of papers out there and the lack of available data. I don't want to write about stock market forecasting because that's what I did for my mathematician thesis. A good topic would be predicting some sort of an economical indicator but I don't really have any good ideas so far. Thank you!
