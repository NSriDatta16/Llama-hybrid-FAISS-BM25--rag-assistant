The reasons to prefer explicitly naming columns over SELECT * FROM our_table are Explicitly naming columns in the project expresses our intent more clearly and so contributes to self-documenting code. In the future somebody will add one or more columns to the table. If we use SELECT * these columns will be dragged in automatically, which may break our code or cause it to perform badly (especially if a LOB is involved).
