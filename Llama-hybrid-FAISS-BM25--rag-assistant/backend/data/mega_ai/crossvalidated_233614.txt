Time series group comparison

I am currently analyzing a time-series experiment and I have some difficulties to come with a nice comparison of my groups. I was hoping someone could help me. The design is the following: Three groups of 10 individuals are analyzed with the same technic at 15 timepoints. For each individuals at each timepoint we obtain a table of occurence such as: Genomic position Number of occurence chr1 100 chr2 50 chr20 10 Which merged for one individual gives: Genomic position Time1 Time2 Time3 Time4 ... chr1 100 0 0 0 chr2 50 10 25 50 chr20 10 20 30 100 Those positions should be mainly different between individuals even in the same group. I would like to know if there is a way to compare the evolution of these occurrences accross time between the groups? My final goal is to know if for example these observations are more maintained in one group or if they quickly disappear after the first observation in one group more than another. Could you please guide me to some statistical tests or readings that could help me to solve this issue?
