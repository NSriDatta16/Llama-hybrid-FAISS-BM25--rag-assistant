How to implement LSTM using Doc2Vec vectors to get representation?

Hi all. I'm a newbie in ML. I read and found a paper about A Multi-Level Plagiarism Detection System Based on Deep Learning Algorithms and want to implement this model . But I can't find more about step-by-step guide to build it. How LSTM can make representation with input is list vector of sentence trained by Doc2vec.
