PCA. Save the basis transform, e.g the SKLearn object. K-Means on reduced dimension For every new datapoint, run the pca transformation and then find the cluster with the closest distance. The issue with PCA transformation is that it is dependent on the data you present to it. So don't remake the PCA on the new data, because the embeddings will be different.
