To calculate the factorial of uint.MaxValue you'd need a lot of storage. For example, the Wikipedia article as 8.2639316883... Ã— 10^5,565,708. You're going to gain information like crazy. I strongly suspect you're not going find any way of calculating it on a sane computer in a sane amount of time. Why do you need this value? Would Stirling's approximation be close enough?
