You may want to try out Template Toolkit . Here's an excerpt from the Template Toolkit Intro, Manual page : The Template Toolkit is a collection of Perl modules which implement a fast, flexible, powerful and extensible template processing system. It is most often used for generating dynamic web content, although it can be used equally well for processing any kind of text documents. At the simplest level it provides an easy way to process template files, filling in embedded variable references with their equivalent values. Here's an example of a template. Dear [% name %], It has come to our attention that your account is in arrears to the sum of [% debt %]. Please settle your account before [% deadline %] or we will be forced to revoke your Licence to Thrill. The Management. By default, template directives are embedded within the character sequences [% ... %] but you can change these and various other options to configure how the Template Toolkit looks, feels and works. You can set the INTERPOLATE option, for example, if you prefer to embed your variables in Perl style: Dear $name, It has come to our attention that your account is in arrears to the sum of $debt.
