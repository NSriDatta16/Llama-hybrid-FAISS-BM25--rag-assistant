Neither one creates a file. A file on disk is identified by an "inode." Directories map filenames to inodes. A hard link means "create a new filename in this directory that points to the same inode as the file I name." A symbolic link means "create a new filename in this directory that points to whatever inode this other files points to." As mangoman points out in a comment, a symbolic link does create a file with the name of the link target, but you shouldn't pay attention to it. It's a special file that is None Of Your Business.
