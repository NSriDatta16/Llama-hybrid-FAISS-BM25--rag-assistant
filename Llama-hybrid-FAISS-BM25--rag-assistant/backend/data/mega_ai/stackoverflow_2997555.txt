As you are using C99 initialization, why not make the member a proper FAM, i.e. char data[]; The only way to create valid struct's with a FAM (or struct hack member) is by dynamically allocating the correct amount of excess storage for the last member so, as the warning suggests, your local initialization isn't valid.
