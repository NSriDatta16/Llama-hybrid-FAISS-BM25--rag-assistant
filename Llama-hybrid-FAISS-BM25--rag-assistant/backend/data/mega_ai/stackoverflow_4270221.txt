I would have said the design pattern of the application overall is completely unrelated to the process of image format recognition. Each image file format has binary information very early on which indicate the type of file it is, which is the 'header' of the file. GIF files, for example, begin with the letters GIF, and a code to indicate which version of the GIF specification, 87a or 89a. PNG files - as Robert Harvey indicates - have a special character, followed by PNG as the first four bytes of the file. Most of the Wikipedia entries for the major image formats do explain the header, and a bit more about the file itself - in addition to the links above which cover PNG and JPEG, there's also http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIF#File_format for GIFs.
