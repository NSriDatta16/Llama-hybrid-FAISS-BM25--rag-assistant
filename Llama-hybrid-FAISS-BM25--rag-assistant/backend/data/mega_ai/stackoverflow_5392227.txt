It's not exactly recommended, but in practice it should be easy enough to read this information from HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\TheServiceName ; in particular the DWORD Start contains the startup type. Note that changing this in the registry directly is unlikely to affect things at least until after a reboot, so it's still good to use the API to apply any changes. Alternately if you want to do things "right" you could declare the structures and functions necessary to get to Advapi32.QueryServiceConfig . This would support any version of Windows that changed the registry location or underlying storage (something I wouldn't expect, but it should be considered possible).
