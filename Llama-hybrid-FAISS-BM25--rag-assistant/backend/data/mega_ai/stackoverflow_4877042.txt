Android: Loading multiple images

I have recently started developing a game in android, never used it before and was wondering if there is a simple way of getting a set of images loaded into the application. As my current implementation involves basically Creating an int[] array, Storing the values of each drawable into this array, (now this has to be hand coded, so if I add any more images it has to be added programmitically) Then itterating through each item in the array and calling BitmapFactory to get the resource. (Unfortunately I don't have the code with me as it is at home and I am at work, but that is the jist) So 2 questions, is there a way of getting the drawables without having to put in each item manually to the int[] - ie looking for perhaps a file name prefix and then only loading the resource with the prefix? Which leads me to my second question because I more than just these images in my drawable resource directory, is there a way to add extra organisation (folders) to manage the files better. As currently I have loads of images within the drawable file and how would I reference these sub folders/images.
