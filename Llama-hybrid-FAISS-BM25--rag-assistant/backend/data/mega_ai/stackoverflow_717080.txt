Everyone loves to throw dirt on XML files, but in reality it works, I've seen large applications use them, and I know of an MMO that uses simple flatfiles for storage and it works fine( by the way the MMO is among the top 5 worldwide, so it's not just a toy). However my job right now is creating a better and more savy persistence layer based on SQL, and if your site will be big SQL is the best solution but XML is capable of Massive (MMO) scalability if done well. But a caveat is migration from XML to SQL is rough if the mapping isn't easy.
