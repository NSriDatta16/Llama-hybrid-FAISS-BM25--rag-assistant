What is the difference between Math and Array in Javascript?

Javascript seems to take a few liberties when it comes to its built-in types and objects. To get at the functions inside the Array type you can do this: > Array().slice function slice() { [native code] } So here Array looks like a standard function that is being used as a constructor. Except... slice is not a member function of the Array() function, it's a member function of the Array object. Another unusual thing about Array() is it seems to return an Array object whether you call it with new() or not: > var a = Array() undefined > a [] > a.length 0 > var b = new Array() undefined > b [] > b.length 0 Math on the other hand seems to be a built in singleton object that is always present (ie: no need to instantiate). So you would use Math.min.apply while with Array using Array().slice.apply. My question is what makes Array() so different than either a constructor you would write yourself and the other built-in objects of Javascript.
