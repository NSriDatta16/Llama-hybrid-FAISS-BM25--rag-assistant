Using default tab-controller created project... first view controller doesn't respond to addsubview

I created a project using the default tab-controller project. I am using interface builder to edit the .xib file and add images and buttons. I hook them up to the FirstViewController object in interface builder (that I created and set it's class to the same as the code file). I hooked everything up using IBoutlets and IBActions . Everything was working fine, but then I made some changes in interface builder (added a UILabel ) and now a method that is run when clicked (I ran through it with the debugger) has a line that adds a subview to the view controller, and it acts as if it wasn't executed. The method (and code is run through) is executed with no errors (per the debugger) but the view is simply not being added. This happened after I made some change via interface builder. Now, if I hook-up my button to "Selected First View Controller" by clicking on the appropriate tab and dragging the IBOutlet to the UILabel , that label now has multiple referencing outlets. Now, if I do the same thing for the button, the method (the IBAction ) is executed twice but the subview is actually added and displayed. But, I get a memory access error because my IBAction (button) method access a property that stores something. I am guessing this has to do with somehow creating the memory in the First View Controller but trying to access it in the Selected First View Controller? If that makes any sense? I have no idea why this is happening and why it just the button suddenly stopped working. I tried to explain this problem the best I could, it is sort of confusing. But if anyone has any tips or ideas I would love to hear what you guys think about this problem and how to solve it.
