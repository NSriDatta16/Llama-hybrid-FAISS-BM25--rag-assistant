How is the Fermiac machine (Monte Carlo trolley) working?

There is a cool website showing the Markov chain with a machine. But nobody is explaining how it's working or showing a video of it's functioning. This is explaining the Markov chain monte carlo in a visual fashion. Can someone explain the way a machine like on the image can reproduce a Markov chain? Was it really drawing pictures like this one?
