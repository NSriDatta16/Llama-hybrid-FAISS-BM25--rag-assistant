.NET document management system design - performance questions

I need to develop a basic .NET document management system with the following specifications: The data should be portable and self contained, so I will serialize the documents (typical formats include Word, PDF, Excel and Powerpoint) into binary data. I will then store said binary data in a SQL Server 2005 database. When a user needs to download a document, the system will deserialize the binary data and will present it in is original format. The average row size cannot be bigger than 200k. We expect a maximum of 500 documents will be uploaded monthly for a period of three years. We don't expect the size of the database to ever go over 6 GB We have maximum target of 20,000 people that potentially would access the system at the same time. My question is: How robust does the technology need to be in order to offer solid performance, prevent site downtime, etc? I am a novice developer and am not familiar with this kind of architecture and design.
