Ruby: What is the easiest method to update Hash values?

Say: h = { 1 => 10, 2 => 20, 5 => 70, 8 => 90, 4 => 34 } I would like to change each value v to foo(v ), such that h will be: h = { 1 => foo(10), 2 => foo(20), 5 => foo(70), 8 => foo(90), 4 => foo(34) } What is the most elegant way to achieve this ?
