Likelihood distribution for linear regression

I am reading Statistical Rethinking (Section 4.2) . When defining the components of a model description the author says: ... we define a likelihood distribution that defines the plausibility of individual observations. In linear regression, this distribution is always Gaussian. Why is the likelihood distribution always Gaussian for linear regression? Edit: After re-reading the chapter introduction, the author states: This chapter introduces linear regression as a Bayesian procedure. Under a probability interpretation, which is necessary for Bayesian work, linear regression uses a Gaussian (normal) distribution to describe our golemâ€™s uncertainty about some measurement of interest. This type of model is simple, flexible, and commonplace. which specifies the context for the use of the Gaussian distribution in this case.
