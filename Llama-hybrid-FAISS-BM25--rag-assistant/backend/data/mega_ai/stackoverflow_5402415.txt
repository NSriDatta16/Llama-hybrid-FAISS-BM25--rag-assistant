You can use history.pushState() but support is not great as of writing. The more compatible way is to use the hash, window.location.hash . On a callback for each image, you could do... function() { window.location.hash = index; } ...where index is the index of the current image. Update Fancybox doesn't appear to have a callback for next or prev buttons, but you could hack them on. You could attach a click handler to the buttons $('#fancybox-right') and $('#fancybox-left') respectively. Then on page load, because you already have it set up with a GET param, you could do... var fragment = window.location.hash.substring(1); if (fragment) { window.location = 'details.php?id=' + fragment; } That way, if someone gives someone else the link http://example.com/gallery.php#4 , their browser (provided they have JavaScript enabled) will take them to http://example.com/details.php?id=4 .
