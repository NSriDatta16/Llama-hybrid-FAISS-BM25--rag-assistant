Saving files on filesystem but inside a DB Saving files into DB makes it a single backup point for all your application data and makes a smaller security surface for your app because you don't need a write permission folder for storing files. SQL Server 2008 FILESTREAM storage to the rescue With SQL Server 2008 Microsoft introduced a new data storage mechanism called FILESTREAM that stores data in folders as regular files. But you can access them (and store their metadata) via tables. You can store files as varbinary(max) and they get stored on the filesystem as configured. These files will also get picked up by DB Backup procedure. This way you get the best of both worlds in a single solution. Read about it here . Post-festum note I have to point out that authors of the question did mention they may use SQL Server 2008 as well when there are any benefits. That's the only reason this answer is related to version 2008, because this really is the optimal solution for their problem.
