Intuition on why Fixed-effects models depend on there being variation within the unit of analysis

I am new to econometrics and tried to find the answer on google, but couldn't find any. I've learned that Fixed-effects models depend on there being variation within each higher-level unit of analysis. For example, if there is no variation within a company's observations, it can't be used in the model. This is probably only for the main predictor variable right? All other control variables wouldn't matter? For example, if company size is the main predictor and I use size fixed effects, if there is no variation in size then STATA will automatically drop those variables? Is this also relevant for continuous variables? In a fixed-effects logistic regression model, you cannot use observations that have no variation on y. Why is it the y variable here not x? These might be very simple questions for most of you.. but would appreciate if anyone can help!
