Two-way unsupervised learning

I have two data sets, A and B. Both have a large number of continuous variables. I believe that A is related to B. But there are no defined classes in either A or B. I could do a bunch of correlation tests to see if any of the variables in A are strongly correlated with B. But many variables in A are likely dependent on each other, and the same is true for B. I could perform unsupervised learning on both A and B and try to associate the clusters from each. But because the clusters for A are derived without knowledge of B, the A clusters may not be as relevant to B as they could be. Here's my question. Is there an area of machine learning and/or statistics that is focused on this type of problem? If so, where can I look?
