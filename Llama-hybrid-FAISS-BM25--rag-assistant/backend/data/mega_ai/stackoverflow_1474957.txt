Video thumbnail

I am working on a site that people can submit the video's link. Then I just embed it. However, I want to get the thumbnail of the videos without saving the videos in my server. So that when I list the vidoes, I can use the thumbnails instead of embedding all videos. My serve uses PHP. Assume the video is in SWF format. is there anything in the or tag that I can 'grap' the thumbnail? or in PHP, is there anything that I can remotely get the thumbnail (or a frame ) of the remote video? any idea?
