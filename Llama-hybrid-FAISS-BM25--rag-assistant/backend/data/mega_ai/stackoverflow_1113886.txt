CouchDB is a document store. You put documents (JSON objects) in it and define views (indexes) over them. The objects can be arbitrarily complex with potentially deep structure. Further, they are not constrained to following some consistent schema. Cassandra is a ragged-table key-value store. It just stores rows, each of which has a set of named columns grouped in to families with values. It sounds quite close to BigTable; BigTable doesn't require each row to have the same structure (unlike an SQL database). The values may have some structure, but this kind of store doesn't know anything about that -- they're just strings/byte sequences. Yes, they are both non-relational databases, and there is probably a fair amount of overlap in their applicability, but they do have distinctly different data organization models. Each can probably be forced into emulating the other, but each model will map best to a different set of problems.
