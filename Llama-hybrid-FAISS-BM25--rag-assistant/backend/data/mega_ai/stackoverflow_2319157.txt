How can we set authorization for a whole area in ASP.NET MVC?

I've an Admin area and I want only Admins to enter the area. I considered adding the Authorized attribute to every controller in the Admin area. Isn't there an elegant solution or is this feature not there in the framework itself? EDIT: I'm sorry, I should to have mentioned this before. I'm using a custom AuthorizedAttribute derived from AuthorizeAttribute.
