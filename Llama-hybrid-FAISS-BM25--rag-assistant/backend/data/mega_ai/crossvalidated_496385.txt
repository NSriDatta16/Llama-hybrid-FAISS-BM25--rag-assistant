Residual plot transformation question

I need some help figuring out what kind of transformation to do on a residual plot. Essentially, I have to make a residual plot of a player's salary in the NBA compared with their points scored. Here is the distribution code and plot: plot(salary ~ pts, xlab = "Points", ylab = "Salary", pch = 20, bty = "n") abline(pts.b0, pts.b1, col="red") For the residual, I wrote this: linreg = lm(salary ~ pts) resids = linreg$resid plot(pts, resids, xlab = "Points", ylab = "Residual", pch = 20, bty = "n") abline(h=0,col="red") And I got this graph: Now I don't think this is a very good residual plot because of its heteroskedastic? so I tried to perform a log transformation linreg_log = lm(salary ~ logpts) resids_log = linreg_log$resid plot(logpts, resids_log, xlab = "Logarithm of Points", ylab = "Residuals", pch = 20, bty = "n") abline(h=0,col="red") And I got this graph: and this plot wasn't really better than the first. Then I tried sqrt of points and still no go: sqrtpts = sqrt(pts) linreg_sqrt = lm(salary ~ sqrtpts) resids_log = linreg_sqrt$resid plot(logpts, resids_log, xlab = "Square Root of Points", ylab = "Residuals", pch = 20, bty = "n") abline(h=0,col="red" Here is the log of salary: And salary^(1/2): Does anyone have any ideas on what transformation I should perform? Unfortunately after searching I didn't really much helpful information that is R related to this.
