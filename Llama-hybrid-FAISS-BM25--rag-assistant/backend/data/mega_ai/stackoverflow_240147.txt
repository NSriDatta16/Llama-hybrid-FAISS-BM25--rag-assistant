I don't use the brackets, which are only necessary if you use keywords as schemas or table names, which you shouldn't. But I would recommend against dropping the dbo at the front. The reason is that eventually you might want to start organizing your code into schemas, and then you will need the prefix. If you get in the habit of using the schema.table format, it will be a lot easier to search your code for places where the tables are used. Let's say you have a table called dbo.user, and you decide to move it to another schema. If you have to search through a bunch of stored procedures or dynamic sql for "user", you will likely get a ton of false positives. You can't be totally sure that you made all the changes you needed to. Searching for "dbo.user" is a lot more concise.
