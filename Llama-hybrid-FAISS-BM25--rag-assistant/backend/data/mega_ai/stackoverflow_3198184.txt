ASP.NET and Javascript DOM manipulation

I have an aspx page with a set of controls. A small JS script written on top of jQuery allows the user to drag "li" elements from one list to another. What I would like now is for my C# code to be able to figure out which items the user has placed in which list after the page is posted back to the server. Does anyone know how I can do this? Thanks.
