In the last case, the compiler treats pi as a variable rather than a literal constant. It may be possible for the compiler to optimise that out with different compiler options. [edit]Note the entire fragment as written can be optimised out since a is assigned but not used; declare a as a volatile to prevent that occurring. The semantics of const in C++ differ from that in C in subtle ways, I suspect you'd get a different result with C++ compilation.
