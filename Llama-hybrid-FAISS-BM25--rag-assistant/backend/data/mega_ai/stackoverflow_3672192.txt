It turns out that this is a limitation that Rackspace can't fix. To solve the problem, I had to use a different subdomain to host the images (images.site.com). The subdomain was just an alias of the main site, but the hostname kept the Session from resetting on www.site.com. I added some rewriting to point to my script handling the image retrieval to the Web.Config to keep the images returning from that subdomain, and to redirect back if the user browsed that subdomain directly. Also, I suspect that Rafe's answer below would have solved the problem as well. If you run into this issue, that's the solution you should pursue!
