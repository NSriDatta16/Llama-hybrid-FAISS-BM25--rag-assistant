I initially thought that this is an encoding problem on your end, but if I copy + paste those characters locally from the soundcloud source page: ᴰᴶ Bagi and try to iconv them, I get the same result as you do. That means that the data is UTF-8, but iconv does not recognize ᴰ as a "child" of D . Unable to convert the character, it complains (a bit misleadingly IMO) about an illegal character. Edit: This seems indeed true. Superscript D is not in the Unicode Superscripts and Subscripts range , but it's a phonetic character . That's probably why they can't be mapped back to their "parent" letter. Here is more info on ᴰ As far as I can see, your only choice is to replace the characters manually. The most primitive example of a replace is str_replace("ᴰ", "D", $string); (note that your source file needs to be stored as UTF-8 for this to work) For an elegant solution, you could build an array out of the source and replacement characters, and pass that to the str_replace call. Or call DJ Bagi and tell him to get the damn letters straight. You will notice that Soundcloud's URL builder encountered exactly the same problem. soundcloud.com/bagi
