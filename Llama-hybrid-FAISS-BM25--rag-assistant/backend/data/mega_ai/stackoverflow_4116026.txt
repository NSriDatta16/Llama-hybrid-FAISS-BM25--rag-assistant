button on modal dialog not working

I've put an asp.net button on a modal dialog box that will appear once a certain option is clicked. I want to call a .net subroutine once the button is clicked as normal but because I'm guessing it's in modal in won't foolw through to the subroutine or the click has no affect. Is there a way around this? Thanks, var dlg = jQuery("#dialog2").dialog({ bgiframe: true, autoOpen: false, height: 410, width: 800, modal: true, show: 'Transfer', hide: 'Transfer', draggable: true, resizable: true }); The button is a standard which doesn't click add go through the appropriate code behind the button.
