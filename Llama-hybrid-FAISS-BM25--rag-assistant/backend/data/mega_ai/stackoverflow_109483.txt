@GarryShutler I actually unittest email by using a fake smtp server (Wiser). Makes sure you application code is correct: http://maas-frensch.com/peter/2007/08/29/unittesting-e-mail-sending-using-spring/ Something like that could probably be done for other servers. Otherwise you should be able to mock the API... BTW: 100% coverage is only the beginning... just means that all code has actually bean executed once .... nothing about edge cases etc.
