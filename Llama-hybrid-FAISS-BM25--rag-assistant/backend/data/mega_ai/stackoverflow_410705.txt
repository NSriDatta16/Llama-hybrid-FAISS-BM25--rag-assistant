Best way to determine if two path reference to same file in C#

In the upcoming Java7, there is a new API to check if two file object are same file reference. Are there similar API provided in the .NET framework? I've search it over MSDN but nothing enlighten me. I want it simple but I don't want to compare by filename which will cause problems with hard/symbolic links and different style of path. (e.g. \\?\C:\ , C:\ ). What I going to do is just prevent duplicated file being drag and dropped to my linklist.
