Classification algorithms for datasets connected to Sports

I have a data set with 89.5k observations, 12 attributes (related to a sport) and 1 class variable. What I want to do is classify each observation into one of the two available classes, in this particular case: H or A . Since I prefer to put all columns in the same range of values, I've decided to scale the data from 0 to 1. The issue I'm facing is that every machine learning algorithm I've tried (SVM, ANN, RF, Naive Bayes) only get 55% of the predictions correct. What can I do to make it more accurate?
