You're iterative solution is perfectly understandable. I know when you say "I'm hoping that I can learn something" this is not what you intended, but what I hope you learn is: 1) There is no benefit to finding an "elegant" functional solution to a problem you have solved iteratively in a fine way 2) Functional programming in C++ is tedious, even more so than C++ is already tedious.
