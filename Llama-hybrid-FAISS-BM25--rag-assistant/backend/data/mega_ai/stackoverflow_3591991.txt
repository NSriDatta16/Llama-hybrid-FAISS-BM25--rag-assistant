Dynamically added video object to page, how to get plugin player to recognize it?

I've used javascript to dynamically add an object element of type video/mpeg to a web page, but the plugin that is to play the video doesn't handle the new object. Other possibly relevant details: The web browser in use is Opera for Linux Devices, I can connect to Opera Dragonfly and see the new object being added to the DOM as a new child of the tag. If I create a web page that contains the object and load that page, it plays properly, it's only when I add it to the DOM after loading that it's not playing. Any ideas what I can do to make the handler plugin see the object? function pickContentResults() { if (request.readyState == 4) { if (request.status == 200) { /* Get the response from the server */ var results = request.responseXML; if(results != "") { //alert(results); document.body.appendChild(results); } else { /* you might want to redirect to the guide again if it failed... */ } } else { alert("Error! Request status is " + request.status); } } }
