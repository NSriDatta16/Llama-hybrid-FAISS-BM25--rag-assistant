Getting Aptana setup with Nokia WRT plugin

I've just installed Aptana and gone through the process of creating the default RSS Reader following the wizard. I changed the name and the url but nothing else. It works fine in the preview in Aptana. Two problems: i). When I try to setup the device to deploy to, pressing the Search button in Window->preferences->Web Runtime->Deployment exits quickly without finding my device. So, I dragged the widget onto my N82 (SW version 20.0.062) using a wired connection, it installed ok. However: ii). When the widget attempts to connect it displays 'Updating feed' briefly but then exits back to the applications menu really quickly. Any ideas for either of the issues? Particularly #2 and how best can I debug the issue if it happens in future?
