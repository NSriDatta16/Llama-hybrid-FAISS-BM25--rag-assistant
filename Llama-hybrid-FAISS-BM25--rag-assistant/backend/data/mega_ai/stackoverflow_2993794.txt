In principle , a LONGTEXT field can hold 4GB data however other smaller restrictions probably apply: e.g. from the MySQL documentation , "The largest possible packet that can be transmitted to or from a MySQL 5.1 server or client is 1GB.". I think this effectively means you'll get up to about about 1GB in a LONGTEXT (and even then, you'll have to reconfigure the maximum packet size from its default I think). Irrespectively of this limit, HTML generally compresses well, so if your frameworks allow this I would suggest you actually consider a LONGBLOB and run the data through a Deflater before storage (and through an Inflator on retrieval).
