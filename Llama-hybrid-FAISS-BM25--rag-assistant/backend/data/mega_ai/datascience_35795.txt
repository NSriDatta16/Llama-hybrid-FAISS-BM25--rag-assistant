Sure not. Graph is a combinatorial object. There is no algebraic origin/coordinate. If you change names of nodes (labels) you get a new adjacency matrix. Its called Permutation. If you can use geometric embedding of your graph you can define positions (e.g. their coordinate after spectral embedding or any other embedding method). But a pretty interesting approach which is natively graph theoretic is to use some Landmarks . Read this paper and it gives you a pretty nice idea how to do it.
