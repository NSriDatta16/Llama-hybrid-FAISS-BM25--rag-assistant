Wordpress admin showing 0 posts

My wordpress admin is showing 0 posts, pages, categories, & tags. However, everything is appearing on the frontend just fine. I'm running wordpress 3.0 and as far as I know no settings have been changed, plugins upgraded, etc since this began happening. Also, when searching for plugins I get the error "An Unexpected HTTP Error occurred during the API request." I'm assuming this is related to the first problem, but it may not be. Thanks in advance for any help.
