What you are looking for is a count based on a grouping. Try something like this: $sql = "SELECT type, count(*) as cnt FROM users GROUP BY type"; $result = mysql_query($sql); $counts = array(); while ($row = mysql_fetch_assoc($result)) { $counts[$row['type']] = $row['cnt']; } This will give you an array like Array ( 'individual' => 500, 'organization' => 210 ) For counting the countries, use the first statement as posted by Hammerite . EDIT : added a verbose example for counting the countries $sql = "SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT country) AS NumCountries FROM users"; $result = mysql_query($sql); $number_of_countries = 0; if ($row = mysql_fetch_assoc($result)) { $number_of_countries = $row['NumCountries']; } This altogether you can then print out: printf(' So far, %d individuals and %d '. 'organisations from %d countries have registered '. 'their support. ', $counts['individual'], $counts['organization'], $number_of_countries);
