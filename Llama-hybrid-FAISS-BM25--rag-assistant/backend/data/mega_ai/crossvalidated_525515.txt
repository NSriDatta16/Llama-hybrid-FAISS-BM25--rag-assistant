The first one is incorrect unless you know the true conditional expectation of the random variable being forecast, $\mathbb{E}(y_t|I_{t-1})=\mu+\theta\varepsilon_{t-1}$ , and use it as a forecast. This is unlikely in practice as you do not know $\mu,\theta,\varepsilon_{t-1}$ , you may only have imperfect estimates of each of them. The second one is incorrect . You can easily check that by expressing $y_t$ and $y_{t-1}$ in terms of $\varepsilon$ s: \begin{aligned} y_t-y_{t-1} &= (\mu+\varepsilon_t+\theta\varepsilon_{t-1})-(\mu+\varepsilon_{t-1}+\theta\varepsilon_{t-2}) \\ &=\varepsilon_t-(1-\theta)\varepsilon_{t-1}-\theta\varepsilon_{t-2} \\ &\not\equiv\varepsilon_t. \end{aligned} The third one is possibly correct if we replace variation with value . E.g. suppose you are producing some good, stockpiling some of it and selling the rest. Your production in time period $t$ is $x_t=m+\varepsilon_t$ with $\mathbb{E}(\varepsilon_t)=0$ and your stock is $y_t$ . The sequence of $\varepsilon$ s is i.i.d. A $1-\theta$ fraction of the period's production is sold during the next period, and the remaining $\theta$ during the one after that. Then your stockpile is \begin{aligned} y_t&=x_t+\theta_1x_{t-1} \\ &=\mu+\varepsilon_t+\theta_1\varepsilon_{t-1}, \end{aligned} where $\mu=(1+\theta_1)m$ . Thus, $y_t$ follows and MA(1) process. For real-life examples of moving-average processes , see e.g. this , this and this as well as other answers in that thread. (The example to illustrate the third one above is borrowed from the latter answer.)
