Unsatisfied dependency expressed through object property

So I am building publisher and following is my config ;initial catalog=NServiceBus;Integrated Security=SSPI"/> and here is my endpoint class EndpointConfig : IConfigureThisEndpoint, AsA_Publisher, IWantCustomInitialization { public void Init() { NServiceBus.Configure.With() .Log4Net() .DefaultBuilder() .XmlSerializer() .UnicastBus() .ImpersonateSender(false) .MsmqTransport() .IsTransactional(true) .DBSubcriptionStorage(); } } } I get following exception Exception when starting endpoint, error has been logged. Reason: Error creating object with name 'NServiceBus.Unicast.UnicastBus' : Unsatisfied dependency expressed through object property 'SubscriptionStorage': There are 2 objects of Type [NServiceBus.Unicast.Subscriptions.ISubscriptionStorage] for autowire by type, when there should have been just 1 to be able to autowire property 'SubscriptionStorage' of object 'NServiceBus.Unicast.UnicastBus'. Any help is appreciated
