Intercept of logistic regression with contrast coding

Say I have a binary dependent variable ( Choice ) being either 0 or 1, and people answer this DV multiple times. I also evenly split people in two groups ( Group , group A vs group B). I simulate data so that I know that there's an overall 50% probability to choose 1 in group A, but only an overall 5% probability to choose 1 in group B. The average sample probability to choose 1 (both groups combined) is around 27.5%. I then run a generic generalized linear mixed model with a binomial distribution : Choice ~ Group + (1 | participant). If I rely on dummy coding, the estimates for the intercept makes sense to me. That is, if I put A = 0 and B = 1, thus choosing A as reference group, the intercept can be transformed into the overall probability to choose a 1 in group A. This checks out, as I obtain ~50%. Same goes when I code A = 1 and B = 0, thus choosing B as reference group : I get a 5% probability to choose a 1 in group B. However, when I rely on contrast coding, I'm getting lost. If I code A = -1/2 and B = 1/2, I'm expecting to observe the average probability (as 0 is the value between the two groups), thus around 27.5%. But when I transform the intercept of this contrast-coded model into probability, I'm obtaining 18%. Why is that ?
