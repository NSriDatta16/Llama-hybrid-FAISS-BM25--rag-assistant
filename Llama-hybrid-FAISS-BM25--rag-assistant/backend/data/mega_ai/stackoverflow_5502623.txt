You can achieve the panning effect with some events and a little math. Lets assume you have content on the page that is wider and higher than the window. The browser will show scrollbars so the user can see all of the content by moving the scrollbars. What you can do to make the panning effect is to hide the scrollbars and attach some events so that when the user drags anywhere over the document, you actually programatically move the scrollbars. Here is a jsfiddle example (obviously needs improvements): http://jsfiddle.net/jFQEW/4/ You can hide the scrollbars by putting an overflow: hidden on your content element, and you can move the scrollbars with .scrollLeft and .scrollTop
