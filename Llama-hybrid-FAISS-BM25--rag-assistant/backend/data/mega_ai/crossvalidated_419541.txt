When the prior distribution $\pi$ , of the parameter $\theta$ to be estimated is the Uniform distribution, i.e. $\pi(\theta)\sim U(a,b)$ , we refer to prior $\pi$ as a uniform or uninformative prior. I'm not sure what's not to understand here except the basics of Bayesian inference and the Uniform distribution. The best way to understand the uniform distribution is via a Monte Carlo sample of fair die rolls. The probability of every outcome $P(X=x_i),~ i=1,...,6$ is equal to $1/6$ and the histogram of the empirical distribution should be approximating a horizontal line (i.e. is uniform).
