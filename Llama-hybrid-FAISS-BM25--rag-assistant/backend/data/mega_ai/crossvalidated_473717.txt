Any time you find yourself having to 'inject noise' into your data, something has probably went wrong in the modelling process (most likely you are making an assumption that the distribution is continuous when its actually discrete). If there are ties in your data then at least part of the generating distribution is discrete, and so a goodness-of-fit statistic which incorporates this should be chosen instead (eg a chi-square test), otherwise you can compute the p-value of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistic yourself using a permutation test rather than relying on the default approximations which assume continuous data. By the way, Kolmogorov-Smirnov isnt a great test since it only looks at a single point of the empirical distribution (its maximum). A better test which is usually more powerful is Cramer-von-Mises which instead looks at the average value. The Lepage test is also often a sensible choice. See https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02664760220136212 As above, you should use a permutation test to get p-values for all of these statistics (assuming that you are doing a two-sample test), since the built-in p-values in R assume continuous data .
