I'll hazard a guess at a solution, though I'm not convinced I understand your problem in its entirety. Based on what you're saying, it seems like you're confused that sometimes request.getParameter("abc") returns a value, and sometimes it does not. This method looks up the parameters from the incoming request - so it will return a value only if there was one specified on the query string (or POST data) of the incoming request. It sounds like you might have thought that this looks up something from the session, based on your fifth paragraph. But the existence of a session is completely unrelated to what parameters are available on an incoming request . If you want to look up something from the session, you should call session.getAttribute("abc") instead.
