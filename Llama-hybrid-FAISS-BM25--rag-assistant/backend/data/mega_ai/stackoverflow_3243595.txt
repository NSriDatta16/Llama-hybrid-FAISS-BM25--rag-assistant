Can do procedural PHP, want to do JavaScript, need to do OOP PHP first?

Here's a bit of a twist on the old which do I learn first question you've read a million times before... I began learning PHP last fall and feel I have become fairly competent in procedural PHP programming. As my site - the driving reason for these studies - has developed I've reached a point where learning OOP PHP would make for cleaner code and tighter organization on the admin side, but would not allow me to add significant functionality to the user side. (This has more to do with the site design and goals than with any particulars of OOP PHP.) BUT, beginning to learn Javascript would open up a whole slew of optional improvements I could make (in time) to the site from the user's perspective. Before recommending that I learn both together , please understand that I'm an expat struggling through a lower management position and at best can spare 4 hours a week to this endeavor. Programming is a passionate hobby, but good blocks of time are hard to find. So: Proc PHP -> OOP PHP -> JavaScript ? or Proc PHP -> JavaScript -> (maybe later) OOP PHP ?
