Check out this site: http://www.user-agents.org/ They also have an XML version of the database that you can download and incorporate. They classify known "User-Agent" header identities by whether they are a Browser, Link/Server-Checker, Downloading tool, Proxy Server, Robot/Spider/Search Engine, or Spam/bad-bot. NOTE I have experienced a couple User-Agent strings that represent the Java runtime someone hacked together to scrape a site. It turned out that someone was doing their own search engine scraper in that case, but it could just as well be a spider to download all your content for offsite/disconnected use.
