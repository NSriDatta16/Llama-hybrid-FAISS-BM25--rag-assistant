To calculate standard deviation you can use this code. Taken directly from Calculate Standard Deviation of Double Variables in C# by Victor Chen. private double getStandardDeviation(List doubleList) { double average = doubleList.Average(); double sumOfDerivation = 0; foreach (double value in doubleList) { sumOfDerivation += (value) * (value); } double sumOfDerivationAverage = sumOfDerivation / (doubleList.Count - 1); return Math.Sqrt(sumOfDerivationAverage - (average*average)); } This link to Victor's site no longer works, but is still included to help maintain attribution.
