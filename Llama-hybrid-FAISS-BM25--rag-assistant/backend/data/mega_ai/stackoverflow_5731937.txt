You asked very broad question. there are two ways to look at it. 1) If you have a need to persist application level configuration, your best bet is to use Application Settings . One can serialize program settings the user has done using your app, and restore them after the program has restarted. This works with WinForms and WPF: 2) If you need user level persistence, you need user settings . Also, you can create custom class that implements that stores all of the configuration properties that you need. Implement ISerializable and mark it [Serializable]. You could just mark it [Serializable], but if you add new properties in the future, you'll run into deserialization problems. Add a Version property. Add two static methods: Load and Save. These methods use IsolatedStorage to deserialize/serialize your configuration class to disk. You can use any kind of serialization you want - I use binary. Why not XML? Because binary is faster and users never need to get into these files. I used to do this for .net 2.0.
