As usual you've got an excellent answer from Albert Kallal. If you want to consider upsizing to SQL Server there is a tool from the SQL Server group. SQL Server Migration Assistant for Access (SSMA Access) http://www.microsoft.com/sql/solutions/migration/access/default.mspx that is better than the Access Upsizing Wizard. Also see my Random Thoughts on SQL Server Upsizing from Microsoft Access Tips page at http://www.granite.ab.ca/access/sqlserverupsizing.htm As you can see from the comments to your posting the term change control as your organization uses is non traditional and rather interesting. Although I can see how someone years ago trying to figure out a solution to remote offices changing data would come up with this solution. I can also see though how it would be stifling.
