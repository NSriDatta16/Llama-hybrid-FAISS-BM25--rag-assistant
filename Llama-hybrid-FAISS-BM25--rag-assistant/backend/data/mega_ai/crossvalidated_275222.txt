If you write the problem as having subject $i$ represented by its histogram values $x_i=(x_{i1},...,x_{ik})$, with $k$ being the number of bins, and by its group $g_i\in\{0,1\}$, you may be able to apply logistic regression using the bins $X$ as predictor variables and $G$ as the dependent variable. (Maybe you need to use only $k-1$ bins since they are not independent.)
