Is every Compound Poisson distribution a Mixture model?

We have two models: Let $N \sim \hbox Poisson (\lambda)$ and let $(X_k ; k =1,2,3,...)$ be a a sequence of independent and identically distributed random objects (random variables, vectors or stochastic process) and independent of $N$ . Consider the following Compound Poisson object \begin{equation}\label{abc}\tag{I} Y = \sum_{j=0}^N X_{j} = \sum_{j=0}^\infty \mathbf \chi_{[N>j]} X_j \end{equation} ( $\chi$ is the haracteristic function of a measurable set) The second class of models is the Mixture Model . The most basic version of this model is $$Y \sim \sum_{g=1}^G \eta_g f(. | \theta_g)$$ where $G$ is the number of components (sometimes unknown), $f$ is the component density and is fixed and known; the component-specific parameters are $Î¸_g$ (often vector-valued) and $\eta_g$ are the weights, non-negative and summing to $1$ . There are some generalizations from these models, for example, where different components are allowed different parametric forms: $$Y \sim \sum_{g=1}^G \eta_g f_g(. | \theta_g)$$ I am interested in making inferences on the models given by (\ref{abc}) in the case that $X_1, X_2,...$ are time series and I would like to know if I can use techniques that are used in mixtures models. So, I would like to know to experts if it is possible to express (\ref{abc}) as a mixture model?
