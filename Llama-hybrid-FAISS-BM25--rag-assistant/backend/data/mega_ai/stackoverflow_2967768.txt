Clarification required re: Use of .NET Assemblies in GAC - Set Up to use Globally?

I've done much reading and experimentation today regarding sigining of assemblies, and their installation into the GAC via various methods (mscorcfg.msc / drag and drop). What I thought, was that once a file was in the GAC, you did not need to make references from projects in Visual studio. I know that you CAN make references via the usual Add Reference, Browse etc, but I thought it was automatic. Testing proves this not to be the case. I came across a forum post looking to achieve the same outcome that suggested adding to the machine.config file under system.web as below. This did not work, it in fact broke visual studio until I removed it. What I want to know, is am I right in my assumed use of assemblies in the GAC, and is there a way of making them globally available?
