The distinction is between the standard deviation of a random variable and the standard deviation of the sample average of that random variable. Note that the sample average is itself a random variable, it varies based on sampling variation. For reference, the standard deviation of a sample statistic (such as an average) is often called its standard error. In other words imagine you have a random variable $X$, maybe it is the height of a randomly selected individual. Now you take a sample of size $N$ and compute the sample's average height. If you repeat this sampling process a million times, each repetition using a sample of size $N$ to compute a sample average height, then you will have a million sample averages. These averages are a random variable with a probability distribution (side note: the Central Limit Theorem tells us it will be essentially Normal no matter what distribution $X$ is drawn from). The standard deviation of the distribution of sample averages is called its standard error and given by the formula you cite.
