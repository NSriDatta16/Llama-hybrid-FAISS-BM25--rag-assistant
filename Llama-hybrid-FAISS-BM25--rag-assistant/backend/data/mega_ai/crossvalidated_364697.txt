Optimum Weight update in CNN training

I have two networks. D->C1,R1->P1->C2,R2->loss and D->C1,R1,C2,R2->P1->C3,R3->loss. D is data, C for Conv, R for Relu and P for Pool. I trained first network from scratch and since two networks have only C2,R2 layers are different, I used all weights from first network and train only C2. C1 and C3 are set with lr_mult=0.So their weights are not updated. My query is how can I know C2 has optimum weight to stop training. Say network 1 has mAP=0.85 after 5 epochs. When I train network 2, it has mAP=0.86 just after 1 epoch. When should I stop training in such case?
