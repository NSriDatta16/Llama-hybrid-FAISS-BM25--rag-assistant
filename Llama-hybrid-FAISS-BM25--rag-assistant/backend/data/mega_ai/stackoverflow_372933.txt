Can I be vulnerable to SQL injection by appending input with no whitespace to my query?

I am taking in a string from user input, and splitting it on whitespace (using \w) into an array of strings. I then loop through the array, and append a part of the where clause like this: query += " AND ( " + "field1 LIKE '%" + searchStrings[i] +"%' " + " OR field2 LIKE '%" + searchStrings[i] +"%' " + " OR field3 LIKE '%" + searchStrings[i] +"%' " + ") "; I feel like this is dangerous, since I am appending user input to my query. However, I know that there isn't any whitespace in any of the search strings, since I split the initial input on whitespace. Is it possible to attack this via a SQL injection? Giving Robert');DROP TABLE students;-- wouldn't actually drop anything, since there needs to be whitespace in there. In that example, it would not behave properly, but no damage would be done. Can anyone with more experience fighting SQL injections help me either fix this, or put my mind at ease? Thanks! EDIT: Wow, that is a lot of great input. Thank you everyone who responded. I will investigate full-text search and, at a minimum, parameterize my query. Just so I can better understand the problem, would it be possible to inject if all whitespace AND single quotes were escaped?
