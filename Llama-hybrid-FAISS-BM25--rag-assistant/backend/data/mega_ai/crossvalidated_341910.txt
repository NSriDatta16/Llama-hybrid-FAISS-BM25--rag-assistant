Problem with insignificant variables

I am currently doing a binary logistic regression and am having an issue with variables becoming insignificant. I'd be very happy if someone has some help to offer. I recently removed a smaller part of my sample (40/790) as these individuals were significantly different from the rest of the sample and basically made up their own population. As I removed them, two of my variables go insignificant. I have three independent variables that I wish to predict my dependent variable with. These independent variables are not present in the removed data, so there really should be no reason for them to change now. I have checked for multicollinearity and these values are not worrisome (1.5 ish for all of them). Any ideas as to how I should proceed? If you run the regression without the variable that remains significant the other two are significant, if that's of any importance.
