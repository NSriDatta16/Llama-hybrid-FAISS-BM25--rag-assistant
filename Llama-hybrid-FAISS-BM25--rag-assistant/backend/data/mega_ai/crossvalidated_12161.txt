Measuring predictive accuracy for multiple dependent variables

In machine learning and in statistics there exist plenty of measures which estimate the performance of a predictive model. For example, classification accuracy, area under ROC curve ... for classification or $R^2$ for regression models. Is there any generalisation of such measures for multiple dependent variables in order to evaluate predictive accuracy of Multivariate Multiple Regression, Partial Least Squares Regression or even more complex predictive models where the dependent variables can be of mixed type?
