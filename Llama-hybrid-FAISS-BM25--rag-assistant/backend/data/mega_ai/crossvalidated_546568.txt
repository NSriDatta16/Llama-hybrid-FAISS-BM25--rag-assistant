Hunting "Sweetspots" In Predictive Models

I have three separate predictive models that each accept a set of inputs about an upcoming event and produce a probability of that event being true. I have domain knowledge that leads me to suspect that some models have a sweet spot relationship with the true probability of the event. For example, Model A seems to be a good all around predictor, it's the closest approximate to true probability that I have. I suspect that when Model A predicts a very low probability, Model B is actually slightly better. Likewise, I suspect that when the true probability of an event is very high that model C is slightly better. How could I go about testing and quantifying this? Here's the approach I'm thinking of, and I have no doubt that's it crude. I have a database of about 3000 historic events with predictions from all three models. I'm thinking about putting the predictions into buckets of 2% and counting the number of events and correct predictions in each bucket. For example (in theory) if there are 50 events in the 40-42% probability bucket then there should be around 21 correct predictions. If there are significantly more or less then that would likely indicate a range that the model does poorly over. I would of course need to smooth the line formed by such a bucketing a approach, I'm sure there will be outliers, but it sounds like it would give a good idea of the general trend. I could probably throw some errors bars on there too to get a feel for the confidence associated with any given range. Here's a quick and dirty sketch of what my idea looks like. The diagonal line indicates an imaginary perfect model, where if the model forecasts a 50% correct probability, then over many many events the actual correct rate is 50%. Anywhere our buckets are close to or touching this line is a sweetspot. This is one admittedly rough idea. Are there any common approaches to figuring out if a predictive model has a sweetspot? I have some hazy ideas about how logistic regressions could be used here but this question is long enough without any more half formed thoughts.
