you say you added it as a subview, but I hope you mean you pushed it with - (void)pushViewController:(UIViewController *)viewController animated:(BOOL)animated Your view controller can respond to events because it is a UIResponder. UIView and therefore most visual controls like UIButton, UISlider etc. inherit from UIResponder also - but they implement specific actions based on user interaction. If you really want to intercept events in a UIViewController you will need to handle touchesBegan/Moved/Ended events. More likely you have at least a UIWebView or UIImageView in the view controller if it is displaying something you want to click on. If UIWebView you'll need a UIWebViewDelegate implementing - (BOOL)webView:(UIWebView *)webView shouldStartLoadWithRequest:(NSURLRequest *)request navigationType:(UIWebViewNavigationType)navigationType will let you know what links are being opened. If a UIImageView you will also need to set the property userInteractionEnabled before you see any touch events. If you're dealing with iAd's AdBannerView class, that inherits from UIView also, so comments for UIImageView apply. HOWEVER ADBannerViewDelegate is a requirement for built-in interaction support - just like UIWebViewDelegate, you must implement a permission/notification function, - (BOOL)bannerViewActionShouldBegin:(ADBannerView *)banner willLeaveApplication:(BOOL)willLeave
