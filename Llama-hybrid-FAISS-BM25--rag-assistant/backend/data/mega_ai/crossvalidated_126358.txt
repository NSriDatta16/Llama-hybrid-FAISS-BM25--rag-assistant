What is the "standard reference" for cascade forward neural network?

What is the "standard reference" that firstly describes or surveys in details the cascade forward neural network? This kind of net is available in matlab toolbox for long cascadeforwardnet (as early as 1990's), but I can't find the original reference. Please note that it seems NOT the cascade-correlation network.
