Probability that the average is within range

I'm currently preparing for an exam, and I just can't seem to grasp how to go about the question given the following information: Information: A brick factory produce bricks whose length $X_i$ can be assumed normally distributed with mean length of $228 mm$ and standard deviation $4 mm$ .. Question: At the brick factory a random sample of $50$ bricks is taken and the average of the lengths calculated by $$\bar X=\frac{1}{50}\sum^n_{i=1}X_i$$ What is the probability that the average of the observed lengths $\bar X$, is within the range of $[227;229]$. My thoughts: In the question before this, I was asked to calculate the 0.95 CI and found it to be in the range: $220 mm I hope someone can point me in the right direction.
