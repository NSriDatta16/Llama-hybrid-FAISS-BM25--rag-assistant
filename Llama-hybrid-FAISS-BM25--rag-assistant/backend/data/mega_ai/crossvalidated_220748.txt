Compute a Quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) in R assuming not normal data and missing information

In this course , the professor is saying that we can compute a QDA with missing data points and non-normal data (even if this assumption can be violated). But the problem is that I don't know any function in R that can accommodate both the missing data points and the non-normal data. A QDA, from what I know is only interesting if you have heteroscedasticity. But it still need non-missing data points and normal data. In the library MASS , they are saying: na.action A function to specify the action to be taken if NAs are found. The default action is for the procedure to fail. An alternative is na.omit, which leads to rejection of cases with missing values on any required variable. (NOTE: If given, this argument must be named.) But actually, it means that we are just going to remove all the NAs. Right? Do you know a way to compute a QDA that can use non-normal data and missing data points (NAs)? For the NAs, I guess I just have to add na.action = "na.exclude" . Is that correct? If I want to predict the class of a data point but missing one information for a dimension, how can I predict the class? Is the QDA in R a Bayesian approximation as said here or it uses the frequentist approach?
