RJS or Javascript?

I've used RJS in the past for RoR projects and felt terribly constrained by what it could do. However, using Javascript alone felt/feels ugly and hack-y. This is particularly true when writing Javascript that manipulates Rails automagically generated from variable names. I haven't seen much talk about RJS in the blogosphere recently. Is RJS being used in new RoR projects or have people decided that it's not effective? Is it still being actively developed and its function-coverage expanded? I'd appreciate some insight into the current state of affairs. So, who's using RJS (and how is it working out for you) and who's using javascript?
