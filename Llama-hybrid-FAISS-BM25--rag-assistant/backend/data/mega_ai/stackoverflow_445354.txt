You're right in that the 'CaptureMouse()' call is going to prevent other mouse events from happening. If you then hook into the MouseMove event of object1, you can use the event arguments passed into that event handler to determine where the mouse currently is, and thereby determine where it is relative to the other object's coordinates that you're concerned with.
