Yes, this can be done with XSLT 2.0 From http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt20/#unparsed-text The unparsed-text function reads an external resource (for example, a file) and returns its contents as a string. The $href argument must be a string in the form of a URI. The URI must contain no fragment identifier, and must identify a resource that can be read as text. If the URI is a relative URI, then it is resolved relative to the base URI from the static context.
