How to model a banking-like account in OOP?

I'm building a cash management software using WPF for learning purposes, and I'm having some troubles to properly model a cash account so that I can see the balance, after each transaction. Here's a summarized version of what I have now: An account class: public class Account { public long Id { get; set; } public string Name { get; set; } public decimal StartingBalance { get; set; } } A category class: public class Category { public long Id { get; set; } public string Name { get; set; } } A transaction class: public class Transaction { public long Id { get; set; } public DateTime Date { get; set; } public Account Account { get; set; } public Category Category { get; set; } public string Description { get; set; } public decimal TransactionValue { get; set; } } What I want to achive is, using only the WPF binding capabilities, populate a datagrid and view the following data for a given date interval and account: Date Account Category Description Value Balance 02/02/10 A1 C1 D1 22.30 230.00 02/03/10 A1 C1 D2 -30.00 200.00 And I would like to be able to select an option "All Accounts" and see in the balance column the sum of the balance of all accounts. The code is working fine until now, but I don't have the Balance field in the datagrid neither can see an elegant way to model this, I need your help guyz! Thanks a lot for the help.
