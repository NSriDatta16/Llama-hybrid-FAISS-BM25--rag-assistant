Why do I need pre-trained weights in transfer learning?

I am using a Mask-RCNN. I first chose the resnet50 backbone then downloaded COCO pre-trained weights. Why do I need pre-trained weights for transfer learning? The transfer learning approach is to train a base network and then copy its first layers of the target. My base network is resnet50 and I copied the first layers to Mask RCNN. So, why do I need pre-trained weights, for example, coco pre-trained weights? I understand that I copy layers and pre-trained weights from resnet. Thanks in advance.
