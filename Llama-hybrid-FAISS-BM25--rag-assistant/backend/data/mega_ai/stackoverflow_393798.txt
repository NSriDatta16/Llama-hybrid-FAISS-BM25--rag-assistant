Maybe the question to ask is, "Why do generics make your head hurt?" How are you using them that causes such pain? I'll agree that there are flaws with generics in Java, and there are situations (e.g., extends) that do cause problems, but what exactly is your issue? Using another language that compiles to byte code might help you in the short run, but if you're working in a team that delivers systems that others will have to maintain you might have problems introducing a technology like Nice, no matter how elegant it is.
