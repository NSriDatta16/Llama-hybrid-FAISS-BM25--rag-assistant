When you call use foo::bar , what actually happens is essentially: BEGIN { require foo::bar; foo::bar->import; } (see perldoc -f use ) So import is never getting called on foo::wizzy . If you want to import those symbols as well, you can call BEGIN { foo::wizzy->import } yourself (after use foo::bar ). Or, as you said, just split these two packages into separate files, which would be much more human-readable. (By the way, it's not advisable to use lower-cased package names, as those are generally reserved for perl pragmata.)
