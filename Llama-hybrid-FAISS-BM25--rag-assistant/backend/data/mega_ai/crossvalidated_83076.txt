This is a great question! I think that in scale construction, there's a delicate balance between interpretability and psychometric considerations. Specifically, a scale sum or average is much easier to grasp than a sum or average taken of standardized or otherwise re-scaled items. However, there can be a somewhat subtle psychometric reason for re-scaling items prior to creating your scale composite (i.e., taking a sum or average). If your items have radically different standard deviations, the reliability of your composite scale will be decreased simply because of these differing standard deviations . One way to understand this intuitively is to realize that, as you point out, items with widely varying standard deviations are assigned different weights in the composite. So, measurement error in the item with the greater standard deviation will tend to dominate the scale composite. In effect, having widely varying standard deviations reduces the very benefit that you're trying to accrue by averaging together multiple items (i.e., normally, averaging together multiple items reduces the impact of measurement error from any one of the component items). I have created a demonstration of the effects of a single dominant item in some simulated data below. Here I create five correlated items and find the reliability (measured with Cronbach's alpha) of the resultant scale. require(psych) # Create data set.seed(13105) item1 And here I change the standard deviation of item2 by multiplying the item by $5$. Note the dramatic drop in Cronbach's alpha due to this procedure. Also note that multiplying an item by a positive constant does not affect the correlation matrix constructed with these five items in the slightest. The only thing that I have done by multiplying item2 by $5$ is that I have changed the scale on which item2 is measured, and yet changing this scale greatly impacts the reliability of the composite. # Re-scale item 2 to have a much larger standard deviation than the other items d$item2
