Why PCA is invariant under rotation

Lets say that we have a matrix of variables (the columns are variables and rows are the observations) called X whenre X = [x1, x2, ...., xp] where x1, x2, ...xp are variables. If I rotate the X , the X' (the rotated version of X) will have a different Covariance Matrix because x1', x2', ...., xp' are different than the original variables. If the covariance matrix is different, the principal components will also be different. So, why we say that PCA is invariant under rotation? I am not expert in PCA but I do have good knowledge about PCA. Yet I can not comprehend what does it mean when we say that PCA is invariant under rotation and why this is the case. I have already seen this post ( Is PCA invariant to orthogonal transformations? ) but it is not still clear.
