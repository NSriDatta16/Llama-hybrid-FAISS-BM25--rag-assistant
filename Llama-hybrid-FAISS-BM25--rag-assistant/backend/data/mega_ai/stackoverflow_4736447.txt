There are several ways to approach this. Using Taxonomy Access or the TAC Lite module Where each category is it's own taxonomy term and separations are created by those vocabularies Using Organic Groups You can have a group for each category. Then you can use og_user_roles to create group roles within that group. Each group role can have specific abilities. Custom module If you are using Drupal 6, you can use hook_access to create those delineations. I would use taxonomy to create the categories. You will need to create an interface to assign roles to different taxonomies - basically what TAC Lite does.
