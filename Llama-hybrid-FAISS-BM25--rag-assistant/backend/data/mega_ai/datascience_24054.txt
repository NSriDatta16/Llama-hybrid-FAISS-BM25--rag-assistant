how to combine count and rate features in clustering

In a hotel booking scenario, when we are using a clustering model to cluster people's booking behaviors. We have two out of 15 features: Feature1: booking_counts_yearly, which indicates how many times bookings has specific customer made. e.g. customerA booked 25 times while customerB booked 2 times in 2017. CustomerA's booking_counts_yearly=25 while customerB's booking_counts_yearly=2 . Feature2: booking_5_stars_rate, which indicates the portion of 5 star hotel bookings has been made by specific customers. e.g. customerA booked 25 times in total, 5 out of 25 bookings are 5 star hotels, then customerA's booking_5_stars_rate is 5/25=0.25 . CustomerB booked 2 times in total, none of the bookings is 5 star hotel, then customerB's booking_5_stars_rate is 0/2=0 . Let's discuss this case: Customer1 with booking_counts_yearly=1 , booking_5_stars_rate=100%(1) Customer2 with booking_counts_yearly=1 , booking_5_stars_rate=100%(1) Customer3 with booking_counts_yearly=1 , booking_5_stars_rate=100%(1) Customer4 with booking_counts_yearly=15 , booking_5_stars_rate=100%(1) Customer5 with booking_counts_yearly=100 , booking_5_stars_rate=70%(0.7) In my case, customer 4 and customer 5 should be one cluster, it looks like they are like type of person: "made some bookings through the whole year and majority of times, they booked high-class hotels" while customer 1, 2, 3 are more like: "lived once a year, it happens to be 5 star". What I should do in feature engineering to make sure these two type of persons are well separated. Currently the cluster my clustering model gives me, I have a lot of customer 1, 2, 3 (considered as noises) mixed with customer 4 in one single cluster. Is there any way I can combine these two features so that my model would take the counts and rates both into consideration?
