The correlation between the distance matrix and the cophenetic distance is one metric to help assess which clustering linkage to select. From ?cophenetic : It can be argued that a dendrogram is an appropriate summary of some data if the correlation between the original distances and the cophenetic distances is high. This use of cor(dist,cophenetic(hclust(dist))) as a linkage selection metric is referenced in pg 38 of this vegan vignette . See example code below: # Data d0=dist(USArrests) # Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering h1=hclust(d0,method='average') h2=hclust(d0,method='complete') h3=hclust(d0,method='ward.D') h4=hclust(d0,method='single') # Cophenetic Distances, for each linkage c1=cophenetic(h1) c2=cophenetic(h2) c3=cophenetic(h3) c4=cophenetic(h4) # Correlations cor(d0,c1) # 0.7658983 cor(d0,c2) # 0.7636926 cor(d0,c3) # 0.7553367 cor(d0,c4) # 0.5702505 # Dendograms par(mfrow=c(2,2)) plot(h1,main='Average Linkage') plot(h2,main='Complete Linkage') plot(h3,main='Ward Linkage') plot(h4,main='Single Linkage') par(mfrow=c(1,1)) We see that the correlations for average and complete are extremely similar, and their dendograms appear very similar. The correlation for ward is similar to average and complete but the dendogram looks fairly different. single linkage is doing its own thing. Best professional judgement from a subject matter expert, or precedence toward a certain link in the field of interest should probably override numeric output from cor() .
