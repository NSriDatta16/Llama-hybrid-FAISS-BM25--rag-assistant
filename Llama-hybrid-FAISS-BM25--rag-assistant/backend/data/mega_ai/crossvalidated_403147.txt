An R package for GLMM estimation with two random effects?

I am looking for an R package to make an estimate on a general linear model with two random effects. I was used to lme4 (function glmer ), but from what I understood, adaptive Gaussian quadrature is only available for one random effects model. Do you have another suggestion for me? Thanks ! PS: I looked on the page https://rpubs.com/kaz_yos/glmm1 which contains many suggestions, but this page is almost 3 years old and I was wondering if something new and not based on Bayesian (time calculation too important) is available.
