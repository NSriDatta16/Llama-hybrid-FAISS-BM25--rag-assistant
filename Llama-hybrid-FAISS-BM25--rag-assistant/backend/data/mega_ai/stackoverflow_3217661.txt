Get X unique numbers from a set

What is the most elegant way to grab unique random numbers I ponder? At the moment I need random unique numbers, I check to see if it's not unique by using a while loop to see if I've used the random number before. So It looks like: int n = getRandomNumber % [Array Size]; for each ( Previously used n in list) Check if I've used n before, if I have...try again. There are many ways to solve this linear O(n/2) problem, I just wonder if there is a elegant way to solve it. Trying to think back to MATH115 Discrete mathematics and remember if the old lecturer covered anything to do with a seemingly trivial problem. I can't think at the moment, so maybe once I have some caffeine my brain will suss it with the heightened IQ induced from the Coffee.
