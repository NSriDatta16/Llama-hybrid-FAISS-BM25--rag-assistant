color helper: http://www.pangloss.com/seidel/ClrHlpr/color.html As for the x,y coordinates. It can get pretty complicated. I recommend doing some eyeballing like the others suggested. However, if you need something more precise, you will need to get your hands dirty. I wrote a level editor for a game design course you can find here: tstechonline.com/edward/tiles/EdwardLevelEditor.html The basic idea is that the drag and drop interface is converted to a text file which represents the screen as a grid. Each tile is 40x40 pixels and is represented by a letter in the output file. You will need some sort of gui -> text converter tool like this to help you if you need something more precise than eyeballing. Hope this helps.
