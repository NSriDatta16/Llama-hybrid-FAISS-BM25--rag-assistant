What are the performance measures in the neural networks field?

I constructed a neural networks in R using neuralnet package. I want to test that using cross-validation, that is a technique based on using 4/5 of the dataset to train the network and the fifth one as the test set. I wonder about what measures I should use to measure the neural networks performance in terms of predictability. Could you suggest what measures are commonly used in the field and explain me why? Any hint and ideas about that will be appreciated.
