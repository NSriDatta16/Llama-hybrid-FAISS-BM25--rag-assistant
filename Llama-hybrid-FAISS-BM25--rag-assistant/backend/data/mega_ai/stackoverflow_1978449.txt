Generally, yes, serialize and unserialize are the way to go. If your data is something simple, though, saving as a comma-delimited string would probably be better for storage space. If you know that your array will just be a list of numbers, for example, then you should use implode/explode. It's the difference between 1,2,3 and a:3:{i:0;i:1;i:1;i:2;i:2;i:3;} . If not, then serialize and unserialize work for all cases.
