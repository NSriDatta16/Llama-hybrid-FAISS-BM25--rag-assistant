How can I get the icon for a storage device in Mac OS X?

I've found my devices using IOServiceGetMatchingServices and got the property dictionary like this: kernResult = IORegistryEntryCreateCFProperties(nextMedia, (CFMutableDictionaryRef *)&props, kCFAllocatorDefault, 0); From that dictionary I can extract the informations for the icons: NSString *bId = [props valueForKeyPath:@"IOMediaIcon.CFBundleIdentifier"]; NSString *rFile = [props valueForKeyPath:@"IOMediaIcon.IOBundleResourceFile"]; Those two give me this (as an example): com.apple.iokit.IOStorageFamily (Bundle identifier) Internal.icns (Resource File) I tried to extract the icon using this method: NSBundle *bundleWithIcon = [NSBundle bundleWithIdentifier:bId]; NSString *iconPath = [bundleWithIcon pathForResource:rFile ofType:nil]; But bundleWithIcon is nil . Is this even the correct method to get the icon? I think I have to somehow load the bundle to be able to load it with bundleWithIdentifier , how can I do this? PS: There's another question which (I think) tries to ask the same thing, but only asks for bundles, not if this is the correct way.
