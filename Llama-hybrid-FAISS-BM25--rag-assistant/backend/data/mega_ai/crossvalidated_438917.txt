nnet::multinom confidence intervals extremely narrow, when mean of independent variable >> variance

I am using the package nnet to fit multinomial regression models using multinom() . When fitting the model using an independent variable with much greater mean than variance, the confidence intervals get narrower and the p-value gets smaller. This is unexpected behavior for me. As a simple univariate example I modified the given example on the multinom() help page . I will ilustrate it using the confint.multinom() function from the same package, since p-values are not natively supported by nnet . library(MASS) example(birthwt) ######## Base Line glm logistic Regression ############# glm_model At first the confidence intervals of multinom are a bit more conservative compared to glm . But when adding 200 to the independent variable, the confidence intervals are getting extremely narrow and even the coefficient for age changes (-0.05119 -> -0.05128). The coefficient for age of the normal logistic regression is, as expected, unaffected by this intercept change. This example also holds for real multinomial models with a 3 level dependent variable and models with multiple independent variables. Am I violating model assumptions? Or am I misunderstanding how the multinomial regression works?
