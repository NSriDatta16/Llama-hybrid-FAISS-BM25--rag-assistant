Your initial function works fine as long as the mouse pointer isn't dragged out over a second (or third) "mover" div. When that happens, you may get several animations queued up like this: mover1.hover-over() mover2.hover-over() By default, calling stop only terminates the current animation - the animation initiated for the first mover, not the animation queued for the second mover. You can prevent the additional animations from running by clearing the animation queue when you call stop , which accepts an optional parameter clearQueue : $(document).ready(function(){ $("div.mover").hover(function () { $("div.hide1").fadeTo("slow", 0.33).fadeTo("slow", 1); }, function(){ // Added stop parameters and added an additional fadeTo, // to make sure we get back to 100% opacity. $("div.hide1").stop(true).fadeTo("slow", 1); }); });
