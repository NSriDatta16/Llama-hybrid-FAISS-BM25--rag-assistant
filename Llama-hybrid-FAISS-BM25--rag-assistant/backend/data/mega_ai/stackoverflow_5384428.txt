It sounds like you want something like References->Workspace (Control+Shift+G) rather than the call hierarchy? Have you used this option before? It uses FindReferencesAction, take a look at this class and you can see it building up a search query based on the currently selected IJavaElement. Could you use this as a basic for a search query on multiple IJavaElements? Or do you want your own specific view?
