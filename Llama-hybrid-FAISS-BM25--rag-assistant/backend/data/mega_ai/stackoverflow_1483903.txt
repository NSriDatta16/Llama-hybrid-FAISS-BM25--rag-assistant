Fragment shader rendering to off-screen frame buffer

In a Qt based application I want to execute a fragment shader on two textures (both 1000x1000 pixels). I draw a rectangle and the fragment shader works fine. But, now I want to renderer the output into GL_AUX0 frame buffer to let the result read back and save to a file . Unfortunately if the window size is less than 1000x1000 pixels the output is not correct. Just the window size area is rendered onto the frame buffer. How can I execute the frame buffer for the whole texture?
