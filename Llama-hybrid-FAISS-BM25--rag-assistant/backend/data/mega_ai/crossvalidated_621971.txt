Simple unbiased mean estimator for censored data

Suppose I have an i.i.d. random sample of size $n$ s.t. $X_i \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)$ for all $i$ . But suppose my observed sample is left censored, such that any $x_i$ observation is replaced with some constant value $U$ for all $x_i \leq U$ . So $X_i$ is left-censored at $U$ . I am interesting in estimating $\bar{x}$ , the sample mean of the $x_i$ . I followed the Stan user manual to estimate the mean of a sample like this by treating the observed values as data, and the censored values as parameters to be estimated. The Stan code that I wrote was able to correctly estimate the mean with a reasonable amount of precision. But unfortunately this kind of Bayesian estimator with Stan is kind of cumbersome to use and implement. Is there a frequentist/MLE way to estimate the mean? I would want such an estimator to be unbiased and consistent. I'm specifically talking about the left-censored case, but I guess an MLE estimator for the right- or interval-censored case would be similar.
