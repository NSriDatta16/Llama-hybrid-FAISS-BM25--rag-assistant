That's not C++, it's C. malloc(sizeof(char)) will allocate storage of one char, I expect you wanted more than that. Also there is no need to allocate dynamically here. Try: #include #include int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { char name[256]; char *p = name; printf("Enter string: "); scanf("%s", name); while (*p != '\0') { printf("%c", *p); p++; } return 0; }
