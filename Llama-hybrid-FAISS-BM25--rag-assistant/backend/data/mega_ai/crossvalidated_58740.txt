Chapter 2 of Alan Panratz's Forecasting with Dynamic Regression Models contains a short discussion about the extended autocorrelation function. The book provides two references for the reader interested in more detail. You may like to track them down and give them a read. Wei, W. W. S. (1990). Time Series Analysis , Redwood City, CA; Addison-Wesley. Tsay, R. S. and G. C. Tiao (1984). "Consistent Estimates of Autoregressive Parameters and Extended Sample Autocorrelation Function for Stationary and Non-stationary ARMA models," Journal of the American Statistical Association , 79, 84-96. By the way, the EACF is basically another tool, like the ACF and PACF, for identifying the order of an ARIMA model.
