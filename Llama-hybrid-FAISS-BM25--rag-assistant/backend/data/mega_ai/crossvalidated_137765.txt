This is called sequence classifiation problem. The simplest ANN to do that is probably time-delay neural network (TDNN) that takes vector of current values together with N vectors of data values at previous time steps and predict current tag (one of 9 possible conditions in your case). So typical setup to try first can consist of input vectors array, one hidden layer and one output softmax layer. You sequence will need to be hand-labeled to obtain training data of course. This kind of NN is easy to implement and there are ready to use .NET libraries so you can avoid interfacing things with Mathematica if you want. More advanced methods use recurrent neural networks (RNN) including long short-term memory and various hybrid architectures also exist together with a lot of tricks to make things work when they don't.
