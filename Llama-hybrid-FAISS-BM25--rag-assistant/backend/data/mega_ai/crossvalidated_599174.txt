Interpreting Interaction Effects Using Main Effects Between Models

Traditionally, to investigate the interaction effects between 2 variables one would simply add the interaction term to their model. C ~ A + B + A:B. I feel fairly confident with how to interpret these results and understand some of the intuitions behind how interaction effects might manifest in a graph of this model's fit. I ran 3 separate controlled studies, and each participant participated in all 3 of the controlled studies. For each study, they were randomly assigned to one of 2 groups (outlined in the next paragraph). Each study has different conditions but we can model the main effects of each study using some formulation of A and B. Study 1: A=0:1, Study 2: A=0,B=0:1, Study 3: A=1,B=0,1. I don't believe I can directly compare data from study 1 -> 2 or 3 because some individual data points from those studies because they are not independent. My question: Can I use the coefficients from the main effect models from these 3 studies or interpret those model's graphic representation to reason about the interaction effects of A*B? For instance, the following graph looks like there would be an interaction effect. If it makes sense to reason this way, how can I determine if the effect is significant? Potentially relevant notes: I'm using a zero inflated beta regression model. A/B are unordered categorical variables. Studies 1, 2, and 3 are not independent but the order that participants completed them is randomized. Regenerating/recollecting the data to ensure independence is not suitable in my situation
