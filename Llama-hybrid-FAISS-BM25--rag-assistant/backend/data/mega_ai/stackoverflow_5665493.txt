Matlab - Use trained net for testing other images

I have trained ancient coin images using feed forward neural network. Now, I want to use that trained network to use for testing images. I did as follows; load net.mat; load Features.mat; %this is the test image's features file testInputs = features_set'; out = sim(net,testInputs); [dummy, I]=max(out); if (I == 1) h = msgbox('type 1','Description','none'); elseif (I == 2) h = msgbox('type 2','Description','none'); else h = msgbox('unclassified','Description','none'); end; Problem is, even when I input another image, say a face of a person, it says either type 1 or type 2. It doesn't display unclassified. Always, gives either type 1 or type 2 for any image, not only for coin images. Can someone please help me?
