Random Forest importance metrics as implemented in the randomForest package in R have quirks in that correlated predictors get low importance values. http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2010/04/12/bioinformatics.btq134.full.pdf I have a modified implementation of random forests out on CRAN which implements their approach of estimating empirical p values and false discovery rates, here http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pRF/index.html
