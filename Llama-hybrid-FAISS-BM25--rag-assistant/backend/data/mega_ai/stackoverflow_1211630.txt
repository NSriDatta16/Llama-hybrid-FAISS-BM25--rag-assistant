Logback (log4j's successor) will allow you to enable logging for any event via TurboFilters . For example, assuming the same event occurs N or more times in a given timeframe, you could force the event to be accepted (regardless of its level). See also DuplicateMessageFilter which does the inverse (denying re-occurring events). However, even logback will not allow the level of the logging event to be incremented. Log4j will not either. Neither framework is designed for this and I would discourage you from attempting to increment the level on the fly and within the same thread. On the other hand, incrementing the level during post processing is a different matter altogether. Signaling another thread to generate a new logging event with a higher level is an additional possibility. (Have your turbo-filter signal another thread to generate a new logging event with a higher level.) It was not clear from your question why you wished the level to be incremented. Was the increment of the level a reason in itself or was it a means to a goal, that is having the event logged regardless of its level. If the latter, then logback's TurboFilters are the way to go. HTH,
