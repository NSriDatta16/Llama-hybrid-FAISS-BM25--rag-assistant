Does it make sense that datetime encodes one-hot-vector like one-hot-encoding or something else like

I'm new to machine learning and deep learning. I've wanted to solve time series problem, which has data every single second. Plus, I've been doing research on word2vector and time series data lately. And one day, I've come up with an idea transforming sequence data like date time into one-hot-encoding? time 2017-11-01 00:00:01 2017-11-01 00:00:02 2017-11-01 00:00:03 2017-11-01 00:00:04 . . . My idea has some limitations like below, too high dimensions for learning (1day = 60* 60 * 24 = 86400(s)) unlimited time - time will be generated every moment even right now as well difference between seconds is too small to learn I want you to determine what I'm saying above about limitations. Plus, I'd like you to give me some idea to develop time series data into one-hot-vector for machine learning and deep learning? + what do you think about this idea?
