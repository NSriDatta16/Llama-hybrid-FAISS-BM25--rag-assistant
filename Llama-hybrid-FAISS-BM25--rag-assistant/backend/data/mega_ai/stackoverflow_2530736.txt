Try with diffrent markers in your 9-patch. Ex. like they use in this example: http://developer.android.com/intl/de/guide/developing/tools/draw9patch.html I have experienced this myself, than the problem was related with my largeScreen support in the manifest file. And I had not provided correct images in the drawable-hdpi folder etc. Resulting the device scaling the drawable-mdpi drawables. How many drawable folders do you have? Do you have this in your manifest ? : Make sure you have correct drawables for correct density
