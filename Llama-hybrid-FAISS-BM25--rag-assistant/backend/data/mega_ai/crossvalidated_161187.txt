How does linear SVMs function in multi dimensional feature space?

How does linear SVMs function in multi dimensional feature space? I'm not able to picture how a linear SVM can perform classification in more than 2 dimensions. Also, when to chose linear SVMs and kernel based SVMs? For example, my dataset has over 5000 instances with 4000 features.
