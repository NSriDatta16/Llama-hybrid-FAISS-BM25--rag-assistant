The average performance is a good summary of the performance, but you should also mention the variations across time. For example you could calculate the standard deviation across the snapshots. I think it would be confusing to say that it's the same model, normally the same model would mean single training. Instead you should explain that the exact same method (including same hyper-parameters) is used to train every snapshot model. Red flag here: if the production environment doesn't make it possible to use the same ML design, then this design is pointless. Either the production environment can be changed, or you need a completely different strategy.
