Cross validation on bootstrap data

I am performing a dirichlet model for different species using a small sample size (between 8 to 20 samples per each). Since my dataset is small, I bootstrap my data with 1000 iterations, averaging 3 random selected individuals with replacement each time, creating a new dataset per species with 1000 "samples" (where each line corresponds to an averaged pseudo-animal). Now I want to validate each species model. I want to perform either a simple cross validation or a LOOV, however I am unsure if it is ok to perform it using the bootstrap data. Also, regarding the metrics to evaluate model performance, should I use the RMSE? I would appreciate some input regarding these two doubts. Thank you in advance!
