Text and Image on SWT Button

Is there a way to have a SWT buuton with both image and text in a view? I have tried embedding Swings in SWT and the view looks exactly as I want, but when there is an operation going on, this view doesnot load till it gets over. This makes my perspective look unstable. Please help.
