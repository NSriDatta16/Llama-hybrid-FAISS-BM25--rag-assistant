Can we use SVM and Random forest for classification of one-dimensional data?

I am working on flood inundation mapping using remote sensing data. I am using a single band, a simple threshold value can be used to separate land and water. I am interested in knowing, can we use SVM and Random forest for classification on one-dimensional data?
