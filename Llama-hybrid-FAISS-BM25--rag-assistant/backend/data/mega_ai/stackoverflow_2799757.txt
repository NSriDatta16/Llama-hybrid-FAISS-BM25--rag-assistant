You could get jQuery to send that data to your server, and garner the rest on receipt of that request from HTTP headers. Create a checksum, bish-bash-bosh done. warning as much of that information is JS provided (this also applies to the user agent) it is very easily manipulated. If you have a single hash, I only have to change one small value (like browser version) to get a new vote. Sounds dangerous ... why not just use logins like everyone else , it's easy with OpenID nowadays.
