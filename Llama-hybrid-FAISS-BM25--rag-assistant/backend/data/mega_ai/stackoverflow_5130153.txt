Totally doable thing. Many folks have done the roll your own. A couple of useful links.. there is an online service, www.loggly.com that does this. They are actually based on Solr as the core storage engine! Obviously they have built a proprietary interface. Another option is http://www.graylog2.org/ . It is opensource. Not backed by Solr, but still very cool!
