Automated variable selection with unique variables

I have a dataset which contains areas covered by different landuse variables such as agriculture, forest, grassland etc for different spatial scales. The spatial scales that I have used are 30 m riparian scale = P 15 km riparian scale = Q 30 km riparian scale = R 30 km ring scale = S Whole watershed = T The landuse variables are : Ag, For, Urb, Grs and Oth which refers to agriculture, forest, urban, grassland and others respectively. PAR, Temp and Elevation are other variables affecting productivity. I want to know what kind of landuse classification is the best to understand factors affecting productivity in rivers which landuse variable affects productivity in which spatial scale The actual dataset has 102 observations with 30 variables. I am currently using "glmulti" package in R for automated variable selection. The program is still running because I have 2^n i.e. 2^30 models to run. Currently the best model is something like this: GPPC ~ 1 + Temp + PFor + QAg + QFor + QUrb + RAg + RFor + RGrs + RUrb + ROth But, rather than this, I would like the variable selection to include each of the landuse variable only once , for example, GPPC ~ 1 + Temp + PAg + RFor + RUrb + SGrs + SOth Arranging my data like this Is there any way to perform automated analysis and get results like this? I thought of arranging my data like this. But then I couldn't incorporate the "Class" i.e. spatial scale in the model. Note: I have already used MuMin package and used dredge function but it took a very long time to process it. I could also select few variables using PCA but due to the nature of my analysis, I would like to use all the variables in a single model.
