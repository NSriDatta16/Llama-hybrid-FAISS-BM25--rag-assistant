xxx.ToString() calls a method on that object to convert it into a string object. (string)xxx assumes that the type of the object is already a string and simply performs a cast on the existing object. So in the first case a conversion happens, in the second it's just identifying the type explicitly. To put it more succinctly, if in your example RagStatusCID is an integer and you attempted to call (string)dr["RagStatusCID"] you would get an exception because the type is not a string, it's an int. Calling .ToString() performs a conversion and the output is a string.
