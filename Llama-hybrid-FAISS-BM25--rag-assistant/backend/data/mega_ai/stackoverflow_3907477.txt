Possible to execute jQuery on C# string object?

I am retrieving the HTML source code from a remote URL via C#. I am storing the html in a string. I would like to parse through it, but do not want to use RegEx. Instead of want to leverage the jQuery engine to parse through it. Is this possible somehow? This is how I getting the html from the remote url: HttpWebRequest wr = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create(url); string html = (new StreamReader(wr.GetResponse().GetResponseStream())).ReadToEnd(); I found the Fizzler library (http://code.google.com/p/fizzler/), but it does not use the jQuery engine so there is a lot of things missing from it. Any suggestions on how to do this properly?
