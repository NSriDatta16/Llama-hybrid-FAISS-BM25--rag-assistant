Binding using the BindingSource works well in my experience. The only design problem you have is that the LINQ to SQL datacontext is build for "short term" usage. I've done it: used a LINQ to SQL datacontext for hours in a Windows Forms application across multiple forms. It works, but you know (and even sort of feel) that it is not the intentional use (for example, don't use Using or Dispose() statements on the datacontext). This means that you should use the object for a single unit of work. For example, get information or send (multiple) updates to the database. That was the moment I got very interessted in this article on MSDN, Data Retrieval and CUD Operations in N-Tier Applications (LINQ to SQL) .
