Yes you can approximate split points and potentially save some time. Some implementations already do it one way or another. As you found already, ExtraTrees chooses split points randomly saving a lot of time (at least on this part), xgboost uses 10 quantiles and evaluates splits at those points only. If you were to change this, you should keep in mind that the graph of the score/Gini/importance won't necessarily look as nice as it does in your image, but it could have any shape, so your proposed method should be somewhat robust.
