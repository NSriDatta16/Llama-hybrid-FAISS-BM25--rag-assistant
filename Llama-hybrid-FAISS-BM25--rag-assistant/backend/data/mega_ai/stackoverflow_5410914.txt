As OneWhoisUnnamed already said, Rcpp and RInside may be of help if you want to take advantage of C++ rather than C. Another nice example, completed after the post mentioned in the other answer, is this simple example of embedding R inside a simple Qt application: Qt does the widgets, R does the plotting---see this question for more, including a screenshot. This is now in the RInside SVN sources but not yet on CRAN.
