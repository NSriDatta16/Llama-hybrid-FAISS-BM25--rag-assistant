IvoDankolov does mention that flipping the coefficients changes the side of the clipping, but... Each additional clip plane clips more geometry, it never will allow you to limit the extent of a previous clip plane. So in short, you can't use clip-planes to do what you're after (unless you start drawing your geometry 6 times, and use 1 clip-plane at a time, and deal with overdraw. That's darn expensive). You can however, compute whether each fragment is inside or outside your cube directly in the fragment shader, and discard the inside fragments accordingly. That essentially means implementing the clipping in the fragment shader.
