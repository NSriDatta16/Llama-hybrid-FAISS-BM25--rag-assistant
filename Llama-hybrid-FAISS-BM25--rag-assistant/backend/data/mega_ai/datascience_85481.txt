Depends if you are going to do online learning. Lets say you will do online learning/incremental learning than test set Distribution will make difference. For example because of catastrophic forgetting of neural Networks. If you are making Batch predictions than it makes no difference whats the test set Distribution. Model knows no difference since it does not Change ist state.
