The interactions plot takes the whole scope of interactions' sumGain [min sumGain,max sumGain] and it divides into four equal intervals - very low, low, medium, high. Regarding the second issue: Model xgboost creates new tree sequentially node by node and it creates a new node using a variable which has the highest Gain in given moment. Interactions occur when Gain of child is higher than the Gain of parent and as interaction Gain is taken Gain of child variable. Hence, total_gain_both should be equal total_gain. The difference between total_gain_both and total_gain is caused by approximations of values sumGain for a given variable or interaction (the signif function is used there).
