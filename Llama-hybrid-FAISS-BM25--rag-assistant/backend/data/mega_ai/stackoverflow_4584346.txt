How do I generate site with mvn site:site?

I want to generate a site with mvn, but I cannot configure it to generate index.html . I can ran different reports like: $ mvn javadoc:javadoc # generates target/site/apidocs $ mvn cobertura:cobertura # generates target/site/cobertura but $ mvn site:site doesn't generate anything. What I want is for mvn site:site to automatically generate reports and site in target/site . I don't need to deploy it yet. For reference this is my pom.xml. I also added src/site/site.xml , but the results were similar.
