You need to obtain the population counts in each neighborhood that were used as denominators in computing these poverty rates, for two reasons: If population counts and poverty rates are very different across neighborhoods, then taking an average of rates can produce very different results than computing one rate for the entire city. For example, if one neighborhood has 500 people with 10 living in poverty, while another has 100 people with 20 living in poverty, the average rate will be (2% + 20%)/2 = 11%, but a combined rate will be (10+20)/(500+100) = 5%. Parametric statistical tests (t-tests, chi-square tests, etc.) require sample size for deriving a test statistic and computing a p-value. Or in the case of exact tests of goodness-of-fit, when there is no test statistic, counts are still needed for calculating the probability of obtaining the observed data under the null hypothesis. If you are able to get those counts, you might possibly be able to use the Binomial Test , which answers the question "if the true proportion is X%, what is the chance in Y number of trials that you'll observe a higher or lower number of events?" I say "possibly" because this test is built on the assumption that observations are independent (in your case, that one person's outcome is independent of another person's outcome in the same neighborhood), which may or may not be valid with poverty (persons living in the same household would not be independent). In your case, each person living in the neighborhood you are interested in would be considered one "trial", and each person living in poverty would be considered an "event". The expected number of events would be the number of people living in poverty in this neighborhood if the rate matched the rest of the city, the "true" proportion ("X" above) would be the combined poverty rate for all other neighborhoods, and the observed number of events ("Y" above) would be the actual number of people living in poverty in your neighborhood of interest. Binomial Test may not work in practice when there are large counts, because it requires calculating factorials of large values. Instead, you can rely on the Likelihood Ratio test or Chi-Square Goodness-of-Fit test.
