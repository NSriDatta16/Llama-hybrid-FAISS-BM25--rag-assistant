I would describe the quantity you are looking for as the marginal or unconditional variance (not conditioning on the mean of each of the subgroups). As opposed to the conditional or average residual variance (conditioning on the mean of each subgroup). You can derive this theoretically using the law of total variance: $$ \begin{align*} Var(X) & = E(Var(X|group)) + Var(E(X|group)) \\ & = \sum_{g \in group} \left( P(G) Var(X_g) \right) + 1/N_{groups} \sum_{g \in group} \left(E(X_g) - E(X)\right)^2, \end{align*} $$ where $E(X) = \sum_{g \in group} E(X_g) P(G)$ is the marginal mean and $P(G)$ is the probability of belonging to group $G$ (which you might estimate using the observed counts of each group).
