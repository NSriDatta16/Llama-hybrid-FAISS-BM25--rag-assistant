How can I predict movie rating based on actors/directors in it?

Okay so my goal is to create a program to predict average rating of a movie, based on release date, director and actors playing in it. Some movies have one/two directors, some movies have one/two/three actors. I created a dataset like this: Avengers: Infinite War 8.5 2018 Joe Russo Mark Ruffalo Avengers: Infinite War 8.5 2018 Joe Russo Robert Downey Jr Avengers: Infinite War 8.5 2018 Anthony Russo Mark Ruffalo Avengers: Infinite War 8.5 2018 Anthony Russo Robert Downey Jr As you can see, its a combination of directors and actors for every title. First question: Is that a good dataset? It's my best idea for handling multiple actors/directors for one title. Can it be done better? To make this more numeric, I deleted title and replaced actors/directors names with their id's. Thats how it looks now: averagerating startyear director star 6.2 2013 615592 182666 6.3 2003 609236 518085 7.4 2007 318 136 6 2014 1024 182666 6.6 2004 462895 136 Second question: what now? Can you guys give me some advice on what approach/algorithm should I use to achieve my goal?
