Safe to include high missing percentage variables

I'm in the process of building a logistic regression model. Some variables having more than 50% missing values. After missing imputation with zero value, they are helping to improve accuracy significantly. Should i include these variable? For example, development data set consists of 1 million records of retail customers. The objective of the model is whether bank should offer Certificate of Deposit (Fixed Deposit) product. We are considering historical data. A very few customers own this product so the variables for this product are having very few values populated and 80% missing. I used to remove all the variables having % missing greater than 50. Am i doing wrong from a statistical point of view?
