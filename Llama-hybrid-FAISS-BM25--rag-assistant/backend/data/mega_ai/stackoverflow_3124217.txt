Can SQLite handle large amount of data

I will be making a mobile application in Android. My application is like Google Map's Get Direction feature, but a lot more complex, so I need to store data about points in the map. So I'm worried that SQLite may not be able to handle these large amount of data(or considering the limited storage of the phone). I have no background in SQLite so please bear with me.
