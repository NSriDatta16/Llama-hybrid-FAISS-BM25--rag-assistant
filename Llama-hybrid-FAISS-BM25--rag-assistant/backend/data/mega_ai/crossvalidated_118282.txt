If what one writes is (socio)economic history, and wants to accompany the narration and analysis with summary quantitative, descriptive measures, "breaking the time series in subdivisions in order to be studied", appears helpful and sound -because here, the model used to extract these measures from the data is not the prime explanatory force, or focus, of the research endeavor. But if one tries to compact the analysis and the arguments inside an economic/econometric model, then this "breaking" inescapably denies that, alongside things that change, there are other things that remain the same, as an economy evolves. This is why there are numerous econometric techniques that have been developed in order to capture phenomena like the one you describe: from the inclusion of dummy variables in the specification to "take on" the effect of the special temporary phenomenon, to "structural breaks" models (with maybe multiple breaks), to "regime-switching" models, all try to study in a comprehensive and unified way this strange beast that an economy is -partly governed by laws that appear thousands of years old, partly changing and shifting constantly.
