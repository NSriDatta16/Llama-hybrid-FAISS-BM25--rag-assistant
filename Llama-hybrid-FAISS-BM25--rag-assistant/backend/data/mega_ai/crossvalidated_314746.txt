Does the estimation process in a regression effect multicollinearity tests

Does the applicability of VIF vary based on the parameter estimation process? For example, can I use VIF to check for multicollinearity if the parameters in my logistic regression are estimated using the Maximum Likelihood method or non-linear least squares for example? When I look at the VIF formula it appears to me that it should be applicable for any regression, linear or non-linear given that the dependent variable itself isn't in the actual equation. However, surely the parameter estimation process plays a part in whether is multicollinearity or not?
