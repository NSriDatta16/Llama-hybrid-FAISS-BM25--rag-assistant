Significance testing on two groups (distributions) of many binomial distributions

Basically I have two (or more) different success probability generating distributions. In other words, there are two (or more) different (non-normal) distributions, which realize success probabilities for two groups of binomial distributions. Empirically I have the number of successes and attempts for each binomial distribution, and also which binomial distributions belongs to which group. Of course, if I know the true success probabilities for all binomial distributions, I can simply run K-W test or something similar, and have a significance testing on the two distributions. However, since the data I have is the realization of the binomial distributions, I can only estimate the success probabilities for each. Is there any elegant way to have a significance testing on these two non-normal distributions?
