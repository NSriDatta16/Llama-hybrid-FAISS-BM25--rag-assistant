Is there any free multi purpose development server?

There are so many tools out there. You can do so much things around developing that it is a full time job on its own. So why not integrating features / tools to an powerful server application. Is there a server which integrates (some of) these features: static code analysis automated builds (e.g. through maven) continuious integreation automated tests project website (source code, team collaboration, documentation, java doc) bug tracking version control (e.g. through SVN) statistics download section code coverage any other metrics and quality supporting features I am sure there are more useful features which do not come to my mind right now. There are tools out there supporting one or the other feature. Is there any software that supports some more of those features? It would be perfect if that software would be free, but at least it should be non commercial. I am mostly using Java. Thanks in advance.
