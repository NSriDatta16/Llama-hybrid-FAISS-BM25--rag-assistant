jQuery: How to reset multiple dropdowns after they have been cloned?

At the moment my code clones 3 dropdowns everytime you click the add button. I managed to get it to copy the row exactly because before, the first dropdown would reset by itself but the other two would not so I was just wondering how to reset all 3 dropdowns? It is easiest to see in this JSFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/jydqK/7/ So, if you change the first dropdown to agent and then click the + you will see the second row appears duplicated whereas I would like it to reset to tags , operands and values . Any help greatly appreciated.
