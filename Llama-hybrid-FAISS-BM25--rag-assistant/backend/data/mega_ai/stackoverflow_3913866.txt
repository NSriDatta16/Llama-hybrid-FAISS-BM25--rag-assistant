You are correct, the join is excluding all authors with zero posts, what you need is an outer join. I don't know rails 3 syntax, but in rails 2, you can specify the joins statement with an SQL fragment instead of simply using the relation name. User.all(:joins => 'outer join posts on users.id = posts.user_id') Rails 3 must have an equivalent notation, but I never used it so I don't know the exact syntax. This should be the general idea though.
