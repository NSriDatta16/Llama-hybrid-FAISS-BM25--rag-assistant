The trick is to use a lookbehind that's non greedy and then add a lookahead for the ending of the anchor element. I find using tools like Expresso makes it much easier to create this kind of regular expressions. var text = "Final report of the commercial starship Nostromo, third officer reporting. The other members of the crew, Kane, Lambert, Parker, Brett, Ash and Captain Dallas, are dead. Cargo and ship destroyed. I should reach the frontier in about six weeks. With a little luck, the network will pick me up. This is Ripley, last survivor of the Nostromo, signing off."; var phrases = new List > { new KeyValuePair ("Nostromo", "http://www.imdb.com/media/rm3374159872/tt0078748"), new KeyValuePair ("starship Nostromo", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_%28film%29#Spaceships_and_planets")}; foreach (var phrase in phrases.OrderByDescending(kv => kv.Key.Length)) { text = new Regex("(? )"). Replace(text, " " + phrase.Key + " "); } Result: Final report of the commercial starship Nostromo , third officer reporting. The other members of the crew, Kane, Lambert, Parker, Brett, Ash and Captain Dallas, are dead. Cargo and ship destroyed. I should reach the frontier in about six weeks. With a little luck, the network will pick me up. This is Ripley, last survivor of the Nostromo , signing off.
