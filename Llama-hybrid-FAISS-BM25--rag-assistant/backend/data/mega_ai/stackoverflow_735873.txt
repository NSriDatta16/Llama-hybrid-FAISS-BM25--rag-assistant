How can I work around C#'s limitation on calling static functions on a Generic type

I have the following extension method, and would like to make it more generic so I don't have to implement it for every class in our domain. public static IList ToList(this DataTable table) { IList users = new List (); foreach (DataRow row in table.Rows) users.Add(User.FromDataRow(row)); return users; } Is there any way to work around this frustrating limitation? edit: the below paragraph is bollocks, but I'm keeping it so one of the answers makes sense to future readers: User, as well as my other classes, implements IDataModel . IDataModel only requires 1 method, FromDataRow(DataRow row) . Putting a where into the function prototype obviously doesn't help.
