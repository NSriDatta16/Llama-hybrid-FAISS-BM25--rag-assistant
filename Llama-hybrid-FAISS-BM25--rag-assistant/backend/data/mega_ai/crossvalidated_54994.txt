In reply to the second part of your question " I guess secondly too, is there any good source for explanation of the difference between model fit statistics that SAS spews out..." let me suggest Hosmer and Lemeshow's book "Applied Logistic Regression." In the 2000 edition, pp. 14 -16 discuss pros and cons of the likelihood ratio, Wald statistic, and Score test. I hope this helps!
