Generally, no. You want your DB fields to be independant of the medium they'll be used in (because there may be many: HTML, Plain Text, etc) What you should do is reformat your fields to whatever context they are being displayed. This implies that if you need the data in a 'richer' format, you typically use a markup scheme ( markdown , perhaps) so you can process it and render it in whatever fashion you like. You may, however, cache this formatting in another field, to speed up the retrieval process.
