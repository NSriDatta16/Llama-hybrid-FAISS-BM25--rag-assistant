vHosts won't get you where you want to go, if I can clarify the question you want to show folder contents from both folders from different drives in one 'web folder'? You could get around this by just adding the 2nd folder as an alias , and having 100+ in one folder and a link to the other 100+. However, I would question WHY you want 100+ folders in one 'folder', this is getting messy, and I would assume hard to find thing, unless this is a user structure or some form of organization: folders a-z, etc;
