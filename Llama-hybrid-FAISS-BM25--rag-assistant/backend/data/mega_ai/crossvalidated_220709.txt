Studying fluctuations in time series

I have some time series to analyze. Given the domain the data is coming from - Time series is supposed to have some fluctuations. A regular periodicity might not be present at all in some cases. There might be some irregular periods of droughts (no fluctuations happening at all) These fluctuations may be a part of an overall down/up trend. I am trying to avoid modeling techniques like ARIMA etc. since I am only interested in knowing the following features for each one of them: Average amplitude of fluctuations. Average time period of fluctuations (how long it takes for values to rise and fall back to almost same level?). Average frequency of fluctuations. After what period do these fluctuations occur? Following is what some of the data looks like: The approach I am taking is to - First build some sort of annotation on the time-axis (e.g. flat, increasing, decreasing) Then based on these tags study further the patterns to answer the above questions. In case there is an overall up/down trend in the series I am de-trending it by removing mean/linear-fit, etc. I was wondering if there is any other approach or technique to answer the above mentioned questions for my data.
