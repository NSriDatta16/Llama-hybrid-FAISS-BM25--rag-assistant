Can PCA be performed on ordinal and numeric variables separately and combined for further analysis?

I have a mixed dataset containing 3 ordinal and 6 numeric type variables. The numeric variables are clearly correlated and the ordinal variables also have some sort of correlation between them. My objective is to project the dataset onto uncorrelated low dimensional space(dimension Now, I see 3 possibilites here: Perform Categorical PCA(CATPCA) Nonlinear principal components analysis: Introduction and application on ordinal variables; use the resulting scores alongside the scores of conventional PCA on numeric variables as explanatory variables in regression. As CATPCA can't accept numeric variables, convert the numeric variables to ordinal and then perform CATPCA. Then use the resulting scores in regression. Use the Polychoric(for ordinal) and Pearson(for numeric) correlations between the variables in conventional PCA. Then use the resulting scores in regression. Now my problem is that, I can't figure out if there will arise any difference between the three approaches. If there might exist any differences, how can it be mathematically justified? Thanks!
