So I've found a way to do this, but it's not very pretty... Since I can't really do what I want within the framework itself, I utilized a concept used within the AzureTableQuery project. I pretty much just have a large C# code string that gets compiled on the fly with the exact object I need. If you look at the code of the AzureTableQuery project, you'll see that a separate library is compiled on the fly for whatever table we have, that goes through and builds all the properties and stuff we need as we query the table. Not the most elegant or lightweight solution, but it works, nevertheless. Seriously wish there was a better way to do this, but unfortunately it's not as easy as I had hoped. Hopefully someone will be able to learn from this experience and possibly find a better solution, but I have what I need already so I'm done working on it (for now).
