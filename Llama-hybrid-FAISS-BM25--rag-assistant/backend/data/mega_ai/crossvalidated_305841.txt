Bayesian inference on the correlation parameter of a bivariate normal

Suppose that the data $y_i$'s are from the following bivariate normal $$y_i\sim \mathcal{N}\bigg(\mu,\left[ {\begin{array}{cc} \sigma_{11} & \sqrt{\sigma_{11}\sigma_{22}}\rho \\ \sqrt{\sigma_{11}\sigma_{22}}\rho & \sigma_{22} \\ \end{array} } \right]\bigg).$$ Suppose that $\mu$, $\sigma_{11}$ and $\sigma_{22}$ are all known and one wants to learn the posterior distribution of $\rho$ under some prior distribution, for instance, $$\dfrac{\rho+1}{2}\sim beta(2,2).$$ My question is, can the posterior be directly sampled from? Is there any conjugate prior that can result in some tractable posterior? I worked through the tedious math and have the following $$L(y_1,\ldots,y_n|\rho)\propto(1-\rho^2)^{-\frac{n}{2}}\exp\bigg\{-\dfrac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}\tilde{y}_{i1}^2 - 2\rho\tilde{y}_{i1}\tilde{y}_{i2}+\tilde{y}_{i2}^2}{2(1-\rho^2)}\bigg \},$$ where $\tilde{y}_{i1} = (y_{i1}-\mu_1)/\sqrt{\sigma_{11}}$ and $\tilde{y}_{i2} = (y_{i2}-\mu_2)/\sqrt{\sigma_{22}}$. However this does not remind me of any possible conjugate prior. Or, if there is no conjugate prior available, could any one suggest a good rejection sampler strategy? What could an efficient rejection proposal distribution? Any suggestions?
