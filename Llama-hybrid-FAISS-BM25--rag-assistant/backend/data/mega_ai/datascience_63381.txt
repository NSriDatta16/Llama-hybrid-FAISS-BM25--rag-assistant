Yes and no, it sounds ok, but depends on the complexity of the wizard very much. It is possible that a simple rule-based algorithm will be super useful and easier to implement. If you really want to try it (for example for learning purposes), the bottleneck could be the data which needs to be available for initially training the model. You should have enough user queries (or at least simulated queries) even before your ML wizard exists so that the model can learn. If it is something you need for work, I would consider consulting somebody with ML/Data Science experience with the specific details of what you need. Hope, this helps at least a bit.
