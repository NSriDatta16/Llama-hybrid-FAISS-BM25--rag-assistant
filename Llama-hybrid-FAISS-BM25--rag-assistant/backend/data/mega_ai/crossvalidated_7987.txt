This is just a couple of comments not an answer (don't have enough rep. point). (1). There is an explicit formula for the bias of the simple estimator $\min(\bar{x},\bar{y})$ here: Clark, C. E. 1961, Mar-Apr. The greatest of a ﬁnite set of random variables. Operations Research 9 (2): 145–162. Not sure how this helps though (2). This is just intuition, but I think such an estimator doesn't exist. If there is such an estimator, it should also be unbiased when $\mu_x=\mu_y=\mu$ . Thus any 'downgrading' which makes the estimator less than say the weighted average of the two sample means make the estimator biased for this case.
