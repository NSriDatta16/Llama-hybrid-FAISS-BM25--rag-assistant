C# Implementing Auto-Scroll in a ListView while Drag & Dropping

How do I implement Auto-Scrolling (e.g. the ListView scrolls when you near the top or bottom) in a Winforms ListView? I've hunted around on google with little luck. I can't believe this doesn't work out of the box! Thanks in advance Dave
