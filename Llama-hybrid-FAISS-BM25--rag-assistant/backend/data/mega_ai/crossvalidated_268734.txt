How to use blasso function in R package "monomvn"?

I am a freshman with Bayesian lasso. I searched online and found that the only package I can use is monomvn. There's only one example about diabetes data in its R document. However, the parameters set in that example is quietly simply. Just "blasso(x,y)". I tried to follow this but when it comes to my data, all coefficients were shrunk to zeros. Should I give initial values to beta? Appreciate it if anyone could provide examples describing how to set parameters for this function? Thanks a lot.
