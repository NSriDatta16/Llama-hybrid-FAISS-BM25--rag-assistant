More elegant way to initialize list of duplicated items in Python

If I want a list initialized to 5 zeroes, that's very nice and easy: [0] * 5 However if I change my code to put a more complicated data structure, like a list of zeroes: [[0]] * 5 will not work as intended, since it'll be 10 copies of the same list. I have to do: [[0] for i in xrange(5)] that feels bulky and uses a variable so sometimes I even do: [[0] for _ in " "] But then if i want a list of lists of zeros it gets uglier: [[[0] for _ in " "] for _ in " "] all this instead of what I want to do: [[[0]]*5]*5 Has anyone found an elegant way to deal with this "problem"?
