One possible approach is to assume that, conditional on a device's features, each cookie appears independently. In that case, you can fit a SVM or decision tree or some other classifier (I don't recommend logistic regression for classification), with the appearance of each cookie being a binary outcome. This means you have one model for each cookie. Yes, this means you are training 100,000 separate classifiers, each on who-knows-how-many data points. But the theoretical framework is straightforward and the computational challenge is not insurmountable
