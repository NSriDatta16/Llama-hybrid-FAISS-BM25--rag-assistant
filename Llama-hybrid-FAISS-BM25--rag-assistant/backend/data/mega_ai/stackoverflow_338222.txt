It is used to serialize viewstate (along with its cousin Triplet). I would guess that the reason they are not part of the base library (even though there is nothing ASP.NET-specific about them) is that they are not very useful since they are untyped. To include untyped pair and triplet in the base library, might be seen as encouraging "typeless" programming. A typed tuple might be useful, though (and I think F# has them). I think anonymous types covers most of the use cases for heterogenous tuples though.
