The number of valid Sudoku solution grids for the standard 9Ã—9 grid was calculated by Bertram Felgenhauer and Frazer Jarvis in 2005 to be 6,670,903,752,021,072,936,960. Mathematics of Sudoku | source I think problem with your solution is that deleting 9 cells each time from available cells does not necessarily create a valid grid. What I mean is just deleting 9 cells won't suffice. That is why 81! / (9!)^9 is much bigger number than actual valid solutions. EDIT: Permutations with repeated elements Your solutions is almost correct if you want all the tables not just valid sudoku tables. There is a formula: (a+b+c+...)! / [a! b! c! ....] Suppose there are 5 boys and 3 girls and we have 8 seats then number of different ways in which they can seat is (5+3)! / (5! 3!) Your problem is analogous to this one. There are 9 1s , 9 2s ... 9 9s. and 81 places so answer should be (9+9+...)! / (9!)^9 Now if you multiply again by 9! then this will add duplicate arrangements to the number by shuffling them.
