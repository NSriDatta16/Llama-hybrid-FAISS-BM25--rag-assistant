Java: upcasting Collection to Collection

I have a Collection . I have a class TManager implementing an interface UManager which has a method getCollection() that needs to return a Collection where U is an interface, and T is a class that implements U. Aside from just casting it, e.g. return (Collection )Tcoll; , is there a more correct way to handle this? I control all 4 classes/interfaces here. Am I wrong in declaring UManager.getCollection as public Collection getCollection(); Should it be public Collection getCollection() ?
