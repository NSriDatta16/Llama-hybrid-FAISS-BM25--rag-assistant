Data transposition from 'clustered rows' into columns

I am facing a difficult challenge, given my very low skills at text miningâ€¦ Basically, I have a list of approx. 200 individuals described in a plain text file following a simple structure: N: (name) Y: (year of birth) S: (sibling) N: (name) Y: (year of birth) S: (sibling) [etc.] Here's the catch: each individual can have missing data, in which case the line is omitted ; multiple siblings, in which case his/her entry has more than one S: line. The only real constants in the text file are: each individual is separated by a blank file from each other; all lines feature the appropriate N: , Y: or S: prefix descriptor. Is there a method, using pretty much anything from Excel (!) to Stata to R or even Google Refine or Wrangler , to turn that organised chaos into a standard dataset, by which I mean, one column per descriptor, with S1, S2... Sn columns for siblings? If that is the wrong forum, please redirect me. I just figured that the stats crew would be the most acquainted with text mining.
