PLS with a "hardening"-threshold to convert the output into hard class decisions is known as PLS-DA, and yes that is frequently done. If you go for PLS-DA, you typically want to adjust the threshold for unequal numbers of training cases in the classes. However, there are more advanced and possibly also more appropriate possibilities: you can use the PLS as regularization for "proper" classification models such as LDA (PLS-LDA) or logistic regression (PLS-LR; this is a type II nonlinear PLS model according to Rosipal's description).
