How to estimate multivariate Bernoulli with missing labels

I want to estimate a multivariate Bernoulli distribution with missing labels, without assuming independence. The dataset is from https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/shape/attributes-poselets-iccv11.pdf , and consists of images and eight binary attribute labels such as "has long hair." I am interested in estimating the joint distribution of these labels, which I denote as $y \in \{0, 1\}^8$ . The labels were obtained from five Amazon mechanical turk workers, and a label is considered missing if there is less than a 3/5 worker consensus on the label. I am asking about how to estimate $p(y)$ . I have already successfully estimated $p(y \mid x)$ by parameterizing it with a neural network, and marginalizing over the missing labels to maximize the observed data log-likelihood. However, I'm not sure what to do when there is no $x$ , and we are just estimating $p(y)$ . In this case, there is no input to feed into the forward pass of the neural network.
