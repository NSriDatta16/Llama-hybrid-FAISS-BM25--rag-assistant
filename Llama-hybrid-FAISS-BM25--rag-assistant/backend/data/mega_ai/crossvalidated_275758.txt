Adding to other comments and nice answer by Greenparker , normalizing constant is something that is needed so that probability density function integrates to unity and is a proper distribution. We do not always need the probability densities to be normalized, e.g. when we are using maximum likelihood estimation , or Bayesian MCMC estimation we only need to know the relative relations between the values. For example, if you want to estimate parameter $p$ of binomial distribution by maximizing it's likelihood , then the only the only thing you need is the binomial density known up to a normalizing constant, i.e. $ p^k(1-p)^{n-k} $. The constant is $ \binom n k$ and since it does not change anything about finding maximum of likelihood function $L(p)$, it is not needed. You can ask: So what? If we can use it or not, then why not use it always? The problem is that while for the commonly used distributions we know the normalizing constants, then they do not have to be obvious for other distributions. Imagine for example a Bayesian model $f(\theta|x) = c^{-1} \,f(x|\theta) \,f(\theta)$, where $c$ is the normalizing constant and $\theta$ is the parameter of interest. It is easy to multiply the prior by likelihood, but to obtain the normalizing constant you need to integrate $c = \int f(x|\theta) \,f(\theta) \,d\theta$ and this is more complicated (even for discrete distribution, with countably finite support, there are cases where you need to sum huge number of elements and it is computationally intensive problem). If you are dealing with complicated, multivariate distributions then solving the integral may be a problem by itself. Hopefully, we have computational tools like MCMC to deal with Bayesian models in form $f(\theta|x) \propto f(x|\theta) \,f(\theta)$, that enable us to draw samples from such distribution and conduct the estimation without knowing the constant . So there are cases where the distribution is known up to a constant while the constant itself may not be obvious. Moreover, we are able to do many mathematical operations with the distributions without knowing the constant.
