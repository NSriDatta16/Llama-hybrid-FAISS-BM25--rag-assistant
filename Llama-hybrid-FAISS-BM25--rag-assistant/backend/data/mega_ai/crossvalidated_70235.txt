Large errors for logistic regression, what does it mean?

I run the following scripts in r for mixed effect logistic regression. textbook.usage.glm And I got the following results. Generalized linear mixed model fit by the Laplace approximation Formula: textbook.usageSession ~ session.week * condition.player + (1 | group.name) Data: dfDSP AIC BIC logLik deviance 37.27 45.19 -13.64 27.27 Random effects: Groups Name Variance Std.Dev. group.name (Intercept) 0 0 Number of obs: 36, groups: group.name, 2 Fixed effects: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -68.00 14338.57 -0.005 0.996 session.week 17.31 3584.64 0.005 0.996 condition.playerDEFAULT 75.63 14338.57 0.005 0.996 session.week:condition.playerDEFAULT -20.09 3584.64 -0.006 0.996 Correlation of Fixed Effects: (Intr) sssn.w c.DEFA session.wek -1.000 cnd.DEFAULT -1.000 1.000 s.:.DEFAULT 1.000 -1.000 -1.000 The results look pretty suspicious. The errors are very large, and all the p values are of the same. If the data itself does not have problems, what might be the reason?
