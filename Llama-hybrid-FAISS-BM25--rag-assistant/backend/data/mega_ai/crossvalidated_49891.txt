Stat analysis of seasons duration

Firstly, how we can define seasons - Winter, Spring, Summer and Autumn? There are many possibilities, let's choose average twenty-four hours temperature $\bar t$. Next we set $t_1$ and $t_2$ (usually $0^\circ C$ and $6^\circ C$). Some meteorologists define the winter as period when $\bar{t} steadily (stably) . So the summer is period, when $\bar{t} > t_2$ stably. Between $t_1$ and $t_2$ are placed transitional time (for my purposes no matter spring or fall). There is hypothesis that in Central Europe (and in most of Russia) transitional seasons will be shorter and shorter in the future. Well meteorology is a weird science for me so let's use analytical statistics! With Wolfram Mathematica it's possible to get a lot of weather data. Here is example of the analysis: for Moscow 1994-95 (and zoomed period Feb-Jun'94) And here is the question: how to find duration of transitional seasons correctly enough? Days with $t_1 So I am trying to find an algorithmic definition of transitional seasons duration.
