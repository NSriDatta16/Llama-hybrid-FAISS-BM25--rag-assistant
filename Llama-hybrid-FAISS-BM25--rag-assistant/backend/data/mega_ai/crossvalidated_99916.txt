Interpretation of the area under the PR curve

I'm currently comparing three methods and I have the Accuracy, auROC and auPR as metrics. And I have the following results : Method A - acc: 0.75, auROC: 0.75, auPR: 0.45 Method B - acc: 0.65, auROC: 0.55, auPR: 0.40 Method C - acc: 0.55, auROC: 0.70, auPR: 0.65 I have a good understanding of accuracy and auROC (to remember well i often try to come up with a sentence like "auROC = characterize the ability to predict the positive class well", while not exactly correct it helps me remember). I have never had auPR data before and while I understand how it is built I can't get the "feeling" behind it. In fact I fail to understand why the method C has an incredibly high score for auPR while being bad/average for the accuracy and auPR. If someone could help me understand it a little better with a simple explanation that would be really great. Thank you.
