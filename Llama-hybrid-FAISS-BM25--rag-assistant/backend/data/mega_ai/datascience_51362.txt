It can be a logistic regression, with Graduation as a binary dependent variable (1 for Yes and 0 for No) and Race as independent. You would encode Race as five separate dummy (1/0) variables, with each subject in your dataset having a 1 in one of those variables and 0 in the other four. Then you would run the regression with one of those five dummies omitted from the regression as the reference category. You would use the output to draw conclusions, such as odds of graduating for students of race A are X% higher than the odds for students of Race B.
