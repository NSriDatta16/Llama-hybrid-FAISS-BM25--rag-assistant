First question Expected value is a linear function. Let X be the random variable representing the score for test 1 and Y for exam 2. E[z] = E[x - y] = E[x] - E[y]. In your case, this gives 73-70 = 3 Second question A. is correct. Since the averages from exam 1 and 2 will not change, the average of Z will not change. As for the standard deviation we can look at the Variance: Var[X,Y] = Var[X] + Var[Y] - 2Cov[X,Y]. Since Cov[X,Y] > 0.5, it reduces the variance and thus reduces the standard deviation.
