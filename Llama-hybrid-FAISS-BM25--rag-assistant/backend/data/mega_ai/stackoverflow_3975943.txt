Build Servers, build agents, com registration and Windows 7 permissions

I am trying to build a continuous integration server on a Windows 7 machine. I can run the msbuild script cleanly on that machine but when I attempt to run it via a build agent the registration of certain COM (.NET and c++) components fail seemingly to do with write permissions to the registry. I have turned off UAC but it makes no difference. Normally if I build the msbuild script locally I have to run the command prompt with elevated permissions, but on a build server I am not sure what to do. I have seen posts suggesting that the way is to remove the automatic registration from the project setup, and rely on the install to do this. This seems to make it this option rather limited and the solution incompatible with running from an IDE. Has anyone found a way through this? We are using vs2010 as the client on the build server, and the TFS server is vs2008
