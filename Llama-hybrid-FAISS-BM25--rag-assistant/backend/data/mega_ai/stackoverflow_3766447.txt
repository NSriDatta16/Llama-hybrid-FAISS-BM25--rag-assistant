Scheduled jobs in Sql Agent

I have created SSIS packages to move data from AS400 to SQL Server which are scheduled daily.some of the packages in sql agent are taking longer duration more than 9 hours to complete.IF I run same package in Business intelligence studio manually, it is completing in less than 4 hours.Due to this problem my schedule packages are not competing on time.please help me to sort out this issue. I am unable to understand why there is a difference in task completion duration between manual interaction and schedule jobs. My environment is windows server 2003 with sql server 2005 with SP3.please help me to sort out this issue.
