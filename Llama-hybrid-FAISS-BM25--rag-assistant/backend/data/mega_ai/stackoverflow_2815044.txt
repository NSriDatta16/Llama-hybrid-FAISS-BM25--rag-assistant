Based on your comments to Dimitre, I think what you're going to want to do is use the document() function to access your "master list" XML file. What you are actually running the stylesheet on is the individual fragments (dano.xml, mike.xml, steve.xml), right? I'll use "mike.xml" for an example. I don't know what the fragments look like so I had to make one up. You will need to be able to identify the correct in the master list based on something in the fragment. In my example, the fragment has a element with the same value as the element in the corresponding company in the master list XML. Here is what the "master list" XML, "dano/mike/steve" XML, the stylesheet, and the resulting HTML look like: master_list.xml: Dano Industries dano.xml Mike and Co. mike.xml Steve Inc. steve.xml dano.xml Dano Industries Some info about Dano Industries mike.xml: Mike and Co. Some info about Mike and Co. steve.xml Steve Inc. Some info about Steve Inc. stylesheet: Back &#xA0;|&#xA0; Next HTML for Dano (dano.htm:) Dano Industries Some info about Dano Industries Next HTML for Mike (mike.htm:) Mike and Co. Some info about Mike and Co. Back &nbsp;|&nbsp; Next HTML for Steve (steve.htm:) Steve Inc. Some info about Steve Inc. Back
