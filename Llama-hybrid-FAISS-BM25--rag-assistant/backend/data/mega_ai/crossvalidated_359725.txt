Regression equation in tree algorithms

Is there any possibility to obtain regression equation (y=...) by using tree algorithms (e.g.random forest, gradient boost or xgboost) ? As I understand, the target that we attempt to use these algorthims is only to learn which predictors are important or not. If that is the case, the only way to achieve a regression model is to use a OLS or PLSR methods by utilizing the most influential predictors coming from tree algortihms. Am I correct? What is your advice on using tree algorithms for those who wants to get a response model like me?
