How do I design a random forest split with a "not sure" category?

Let's say I have data with two target labels, A and B . I want to design a random forest that has three outputs: A , B and Not sure . Items in the Not sure category would be a mix of A and B that would be about evenly distributed. I don't mind writing the RF from scratch. Two questions: What should my split criterion be? Can this problem be reposed in a standard RF framework?
