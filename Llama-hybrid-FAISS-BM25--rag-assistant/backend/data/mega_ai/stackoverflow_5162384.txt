I think that the best thing to do is storing a list of productId within the cookie. You are in charge to find the name, URL and image from the ID when you display the basket. Not the cookie. (Imagine you change the image directory?) Also one cookie should be enough. Do not make one by product! You don't have to use login screens with cookie, it's basically just a storage. Did you looked at MSDN on HttpCookies for C# ? The drawback of cookies are: The client may not accept the cookie The client may clear the cookie But I think this is not problematic for basket management.
