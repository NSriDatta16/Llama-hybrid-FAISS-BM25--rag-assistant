How to quantify the ridgeline of an ordinal confusion matrix?

We are trying to provide guidance for some folks who want to bring in machine learning tools with multiple classes. They are required to validate the machine's performance, and we are required to provide them the criteria the validation must meet. My simpleton thought would be to count the diagonal as index 0, the next diagonal on each slope as index 1, and so forth. There would then be 3 slopes: the diagonal slope, the south slope, and the north slope. You can walk north or east down the north slope, or west or south down the south slope. I know that these are typically presented in papers sort of "without comment" because the stats aren't great. But surely there is some way to say "steep slope good. Shallow slopes and daughter ridges bad." I'm obviously not a statistician. Any recommendations would be most welcome.
