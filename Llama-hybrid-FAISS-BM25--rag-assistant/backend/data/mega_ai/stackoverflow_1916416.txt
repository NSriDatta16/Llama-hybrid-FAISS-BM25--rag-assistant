This is probably not the most concise solution (depends if you already have a library for this), but one elegant method is to use a trie. I use tries for implementing tab completion in my Scheme interpreter: http://github.com/jcoglan/heist/blob/master/lib/trie.rb For example: tree = Trie.new %w[interspecies interstelar interstate].each { |s| tree[s] = true } tree.longest_prefix('') #=> "inters" I also use them for matching channel names with wildcards for the Bayeux protocol; see these: http://github.com/jcoglan/faye/blob/master/client/channel.js http://github.com/jcoglan/faye/blob/master/lib/faye/channel.rb
