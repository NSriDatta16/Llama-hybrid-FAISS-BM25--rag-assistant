Forecasting macroeconomic variables with a small sample can be handled using vector autoregression (VAR) which generalizes the autoregressive model to vectors. The advantage is that it will take into considerations the linear interdependencies between the six time-series that you have at hands. Denote $Y_t$ the 6x1 vector containing your macroeconomic variables. You can estimate the model $Y_t = \rho Y_{t-1} + e_t$ using statsmodels in Python , and then predict the future values of the vector. I will advise you to read a bit on the limitations of VAR for forecasting before engaging in this exciting adventure. You can find extensive information in Vector Autoregressive Models for Multivariate Time Series for instance. Also, consider first-differencing the vector series since it is probably not stationary. Good luck!
