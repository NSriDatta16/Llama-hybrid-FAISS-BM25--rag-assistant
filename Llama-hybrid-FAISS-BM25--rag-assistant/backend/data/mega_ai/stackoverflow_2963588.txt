The lang attribute is not very well known but very useful. The attribute is used to identify the language of the content in either the whole document or in a single element. Langage codes are given in ISO 2-letter Language code (i.e. 'en' for English, 'fr' for French). It's useful for browsers who can adjust their display of quotation marks, etc. Screen readers also benefit from the lang attribute as well as search engines. Sitepoint has some nice explanation of the lang attribute. Examples Specify the language to be English for the whole document, unless overridden by another lang attribute on a lower level in the DOM. Specify the language in the following paragraph to be Swedish. Ät din morgongröt och bli stor och stark!
