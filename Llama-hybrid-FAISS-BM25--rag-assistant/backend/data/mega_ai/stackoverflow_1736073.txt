Probably the best place to start is: /app/design/adminhtml/default/default/tempalte/sales/order/invoice/view/ Everything within the /app/design/adminhtml/ is where you'll want to go to edit any available templates for the backend. Remember that Magento is full of magic methods. So, often times if you want to output a particular attribute, simply call something like: echo $_item->getManufacturer(); Hope that helps.
