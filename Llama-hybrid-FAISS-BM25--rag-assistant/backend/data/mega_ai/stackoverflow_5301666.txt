What is the rationale for not having static constructor in C++?

What is the rationale for not having static constructor in C++? If it were allowed, we would be initializing all the static members in it, at one place in a very organized way, as: //illegal C++ class sample { public: static int some_integer; static std::vector strings; //illegal constructor! static sample() { some_integer = 100; strings.push_back("stack"); strings.push_back("overflow"); } }; In the absense of static constructor, it's very difficult to have static vector, and populate it with values, as shown above. static constructor elegantly solves this problem. We could initialize static members in a very organized way. So why doesn't' C++ have static constructor? After all, other languages (for example, C#) has static constructor!
