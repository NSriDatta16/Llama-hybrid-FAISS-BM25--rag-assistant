Silverlight: How to consume a REST API?

I'm building a Silverlight app that I want to be hosted in Azure and use Azure table storage. I have a class that represents the main data entity, ExpenseInfo . It has many data annotations for RIA validation, such as [Required] . I am following this tutorial to set up the REST service for access from SL. It wants there to be a class in my web role for data serialization. This class would contain all the same data as ExpenseInfo . So, where do I want ExpenseInfo to be? Do I want separate classes in each project? Put it in one project, and instantiate it in both? Is it weird to have a class with all those data annotations in the server side web role? Thanks, I'm new to SL and Azure.
