Are there any security implications when embedding a username/password in an rss feed URL?

I noticed that when I added the FogBugz RSS Feed to my iGoogle page I had to embed my username and password in the feed URL. So are there any security risks associated with doing this? EDIT: Yes, my question should have specifically stated https and whether or not the query string portion of the url is encrypted.
