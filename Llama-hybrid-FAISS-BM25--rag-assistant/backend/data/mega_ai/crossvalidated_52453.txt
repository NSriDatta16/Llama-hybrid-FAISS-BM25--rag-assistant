How does Logistic regression classifier modelize the dataset?

I'm working on a system that be able to detect the hand contour. So I have 270 instance in my dataset: 7 class of hand contour, 8 feature vectors of each instance. Firstly, I used Weka to determine which is the best classifier for my dataset. And I found out Logistic regression classifier. But, the problem is I don't know 'How does the Logistic regression classifier work?' or 'WHAT IS THE MAIN PONIT (IDEA) OF LOGISTIC REGRESSION CLASSIFIER?'. I've been searching on google for a long time but I still can't find the answer. Here's what I've found that should be useful: 1 1992-JSTOR-Cessie-Logistic_Regression [2] [Chapter 4 Logistic Regression as a ClassiÔ¨Åer]1 Thanks in advance!
