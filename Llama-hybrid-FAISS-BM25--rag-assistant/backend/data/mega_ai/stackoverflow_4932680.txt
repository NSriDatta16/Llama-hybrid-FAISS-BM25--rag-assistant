You seem to be on the right track with everything. There are lot of opinions called "best practices" about how to exactly attach event handlers, how to reload the data on the page and how to organize your application, etc, but I personally would rather build more software instead of worrying about details like that. The details will come to you eventually. I personally find that updating whole chunks of server-side-rendered HTML on the page is more robust solution, but I have seen people getting excellent results with templates.
