Is OpenNLP unable to identify dates of the format "January 10th, 2009"?

OpenNLP(in Java) is unable to identify dates of the format "January 10th, 2010" or "January 10, 2010". I replaced all ','s in the text with an empty string "" before using OpenNLP tokenizer and it works fine for dates of the form "January 10, 2010". So, I tried to replace "th," with ",", but it did not work. How can we make sure that the dates of the above forms are identified with OpenNLP? Thanks in advance
