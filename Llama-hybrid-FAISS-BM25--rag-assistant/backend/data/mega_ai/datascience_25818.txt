Layman's comparison of RMSE

I don't have a maths / stats / data science background and need to evaluate which of the two evaluations below (numerical regression on Amazon Machine Learning) predict more accuracy. Both models use the same data set but it's looking at different time frames both on the independent and dependent variables. How can I evaluate which one of the two models is more accurate? And is there a way to tell how accurate these two models are in general (e.g. 75%)? Model 1 Model 2
