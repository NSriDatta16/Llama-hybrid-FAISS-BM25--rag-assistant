Data preparation (preprocessing and data cleaning) before or after train-test split with scikit learn?

I have been practicing Data Science/Machine Learning, and I am confused about when to complete the following tasks when using train-test split in scikit learn: EDA Filling in missing data Removing data that isn't needed Working with categorical data Feature Engineering Feature Selection I know that scaling should be done after train-test split. However, I have seen both approaches (train-test split before and after) when working with the above tasks. I'm confused about which is the correct way for these tasks. Can someone provide some clarification? Thank you!
