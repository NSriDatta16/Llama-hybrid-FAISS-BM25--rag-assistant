Accurate solution for completely unbalanced design (18 observations vs 500 observations)_need some advice

I have a data set including one continuous dependent variable, one categorical independent with 4 levels and one continuous independent variable. We are going to compare the average of the dependent variable among the levels of the categorical variable by adjusting the covariate. The problem is there is a huge gap between the number of the observations in each category of the categorical independent. n1=17, n2=19, n3=400, n4=25. Now my question is the accuracy of applying linear regression/ancova when we have this kind of design.? Any advice? Can you recommend a method to do this kind of analysis?
