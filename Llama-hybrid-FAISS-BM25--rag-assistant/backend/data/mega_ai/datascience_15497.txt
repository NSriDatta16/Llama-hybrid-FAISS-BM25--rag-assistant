The Google Research Blog should be helpful in the context of TensorFlow . In the above article, there is a reference to the Annotated English Gigaword dataset which is routinely used for text summarization. The 2014 paper by Sutskever et al titled Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks could be a meaningful start on your journey as it turns out that for shorter texts, summarization can be learned end-to-end with a deep learning technique. Lastly, here is a great Github repository demonstrating text summarization while making use of TensorFlow.
