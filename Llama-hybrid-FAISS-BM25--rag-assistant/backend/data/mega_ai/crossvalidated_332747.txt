Steps for estimating linear regression

After reading ISL and several questions here, below I summarize a step-by-step guide for estimating linear regression. I would appreciate your comments on steps which might be incorrect or which might appear good in theory but are not used in practice: Notation: $[x_{1}, x_{2}, .., x_{n}]^{T}$ where $x_{i}$ refers to independent variables and $y$ refers to dependent variable. There are $m$ training examples. Data Pre-processing a. If there are interaction terms ($x_{1}*x_{2}$) or higher order terms ($x_{1}^2$) then perform centering ($x_{1} - \bar{x}$) as it would reduce correlation. b. Build correlation matrix to identify columns that are correlated. Either drop one of the correlated columns or take a combination of correlated columns. c. If you suspect, multicolinearity then looking at Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) would help identify correlated columns. d. Identify High Leverage Points . High leverage points are values of $\textbf{x}$ that are far from the other values of $\textbf{X}$. Just examine these points to ensure that there is no data entry issue (ex: used $-x$ instead of $x$). If possible remove them. Estimate Regression Look at F-Statistics: $$ F_{statistics} = \frac{(TSS - RSS)/n}{RSS/(m-n-1)}$$ where, $$ TSS = (y_{i} - \bar{y})^{2} \quad and \quad RSS = (y_{i} - \hat{y_{i}})^{2} $$ If $F_{statistics}$ > 1, then there is a relationship between independent variables $\textbf{x}$ and dependent variable $y$ Look at $R^{2}$ where $R^{2} = Cor(Y, \hat{Y})^{2}$. $R^{2}$ corresponds to the fraction of variance explained and varies $0 \leq R^{2} \leq 1$. A higher value of $R^{2}$ implies that the model is able to explain the variance in $Y$. Visualize Residual Plot: $(y - \hat{y})$ vs $y$: a. If there is no discernible pattern, you are all set b. If the residuals have a funnel shape, replace $y$ by $\sqrt{y}$ or $log y$ c. If residuals have a quadratic or polynomial pattern, use a higher order term of $x$ ie $x^{2}$ or $x^{3}$. (Note: not sure how to identify which of $x_{i}$ needs to be used for a polynomial term) d. Identify outliers by performing studentized residuals $\gt 3$. These points might correspond to incorrect data entry for $y$. Remove them if possible. e. Go to step 2. Repeat till the residual plot does not contain any discernible patterns.
