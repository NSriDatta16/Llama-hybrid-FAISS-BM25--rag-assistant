It is not clear from your question whether this is time series data or not. If it is then you would use a time series model. A plot of the data would be nice. Otherwise for non-time series data, playing around with polynomials (or exponentials) is a bad idea. A much more better approach would be to use (natural) splines. This should be available in most software and is much more flexible. With a spline you would define the number of "knots" (or anchor points if you will).
