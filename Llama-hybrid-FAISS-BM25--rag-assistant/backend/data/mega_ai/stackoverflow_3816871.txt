If you're comfortable mucking around with the Object Browser in VS, I'd advise looking at Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Input.Keyboard/Keyboardstate. These entries will show you what you have available to you in terms of ready-made functions. Alternatively, you could look on MSDN or follow a tutorial on Creator's Club. I'll post a quick snippet that checks for a specific keystroke. currentState = Keyboard.GetState(); if(currentState.IsKeyDown(theKey) && previousState.IsKeyUp(theKey)) { //Do something here } previousState = currentState; theKey is a parameter that is defined outside of the scope of this snippet. You could set theKey to a specific value that you would want to trigger some specific program behavior on pressing (at the commented location in the fragment above). theKey is defined as: Keys theKey previousState and currentState are defined as: private static KeyboardState currentState; private static KeyboardState previousState; While perhaps not the prettiest way of doing that, it works and is a fairly straightforward example to build from. Hope that helps.
