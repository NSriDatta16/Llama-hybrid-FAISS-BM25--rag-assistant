It's kinda hard to understand what you're trying to achieve. Do you want to scroll through the button or not? So start dragging inside the button will effect the button, not the scroll view. It's not clear if that's the behavior you want or the behavior you're trying to change. If it's the former Eiko's answer is correct and if it's the later you should add the button as a subview of the scroll view and update its frame whenever scrollViewDidScroll: is called. I've never tried this, but it works in theory.
