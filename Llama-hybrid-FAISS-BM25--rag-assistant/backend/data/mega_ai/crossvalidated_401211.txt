I think there are some issues with using LASSO/random forest for feature selection. My main problems are if you are using one of these methods for feature selection and then using those features on an entirely different algorithm afterward you could run into some issues. Random forest feature importance tells you which features were important for that random forest, it doesn't necessarily tell you which features are important for say a nearest neighbor algorithm. Similarly for LASSO.
