python click event scope issue in pygame

I've created a GameObject class, using the python pygame library, which draws a rectangle on the screen. I would like to integrate an event handler which would allow me to draw the rectangle around, however the click events for the GameObject are not registering. Here are a couple snippets of code from the class: def on_event(self, event): if event.type == pygame.MOUSEBUTTONDOWN: print "I'm a mousedown event!" self.down = True self.prev_x=pygame.mouse.get_pos(0) self.prev_y=pygame.mouse.get_pos(1) elif event.type == pygame.MOUSEBUTTONUP and event.button == 1: self.down = False def on_draw(self, surface): #paints the rectangle the particular color of the square pygame.draw.rect(surface, pygame.Color(self.red, self.green, self.blue), self.geom)` Do I need to make the rect into an image for the mouse events to register, or is there some other way I can drag this box around?
