This is probably something that you could use websockets for, have each window send its info back to the app and then have them updated, but those are not supported across all browsers and in fact I believe are currently removed from most builds due to security issues with the spec. For offline apps if they were on the same domain, which I'm assuming they would be locally, you could use local storage or even cookies and then have the apps poll for changes to the storage api? I have been doing some experiments with offline local storage myself recently and I'm able to maintain state between windows with Chrome locally, in firefox this does not work, but I believe it is fixed in the FF4 RC Edit 2: Slapped together a quick and dirty proof of concept in two files: Index 1: x var i = 0; function update(){ setTimeout(function(){ localStorage.setItem("bar", i); document.getElementById('result').innerHTML = "localstorage set to " + localStorage.getItem("bar"); i++; console.log(i); update(); }, 2000); } update(); Index 2: s function update(){ setTimeout(function(){ document.getElementById('result').innerHTML = localStorage.getItem("bar"); update(); }, 1000); } update(); Opening them both up in different windows in Chrome locally, the second one will display the state that is set by the loop in the first window. Still not working in FireFox 4 I found (a Mozilla Dev swore to me yesterday that offline local storage works now, oh well). You can probably getting it working in IE via http://www.modernizr.com/ but I have yet to test that.
