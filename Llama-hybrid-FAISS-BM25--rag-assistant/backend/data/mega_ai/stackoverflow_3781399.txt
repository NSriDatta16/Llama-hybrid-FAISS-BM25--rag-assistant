I bet you are violating the same origin policy. For XHRs, you must have the same protocol, domain, port, etc. So if you are running an app on localhost:8080/app, you CANNOT ajax to www.cnn.com. Different browsers handle this differently; I have seen FF do what you describe, which is the request appears to return normally but there is no data...
