Best language tooling

I was listening to a podcast recently (may have been SO - can't remember) when the interviewee said that one of the reasons Java was so successful and popular was the tooling. Having use of great FOSS editors such as Eclipse, NetBeans. Metrics tools such as Cobertura, Find Bugs, Build tools such as Maven and ANT.. I'd have to agree I've done a fair bit of .NET and the tools are OKish. The problem seems to be that there isn't the depth in tooling that there is in Java. The FOSS stuff seems pretty limited. My question: Are there any modern languages with a better community and tooling for getting the job done?
