Is there any way to use subtitles with mp3s?

I have some .mp3 files of conversations with really bad audio quality that I am displaying on a web page using JavaScript. I was wondering if there was an elegant solution to display these mp3s with subtitles. I came across this jQuery plugin , which does something similar but using the element.
