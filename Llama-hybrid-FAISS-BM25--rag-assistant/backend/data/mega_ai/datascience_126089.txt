I asked my instance of ChatGPT 3.5 today (2023.12.18, state of training: January 2022) about encoder/decoder etc. and got this answer: The GPT-3.5 architecture is a sophisticated model with 96 transformer layers, each containing 3072 nodes, resulting in a massive neural network. It follows an autoregressive transformer model, deviating from the traditional Encoder-Decoder structure and relying on a decoder-only setup. With a vast number of transformer blocks, GPT-3.5 has an impressive scale, boasting 175 billion parameters. These parameters empower the model to comprehend and generate text across a diverse range of contexts, showcasing its versatility and depth of knowledge. Trained on extensive datasets covering various topics, languages, and communication styles, the model can generate contextually relevant responses in numerous scenarios, from answering factual questions to engaging in creative and imaginative conversations. Answering a further "layman" question it explained: 'In the context of transformer architectures, a "transformer layer" typically refers to a single self-attention mechanism layer, while a "transformer block" consists of multiple layers stacked together, often including not only self-attention layers but also feedforward layers and normalization layers.' A further question about self-attention layers got me an example explained (abbrev.): 'how attention weights might be assigned to different parts of the input sequence "why is snow white?" 1. Initialization : each word ("why," "is," "snow," "white") is associated with a query, key, and value vector. 2. Self-Attention Calculation [..] The attention scores are determined by the compatibility (dot product) between the query vector of the current word and the key vectors of all other words. 3. Weight Calculation [After using the softmax function to normalize] high attention weights indicate that the current word should focus more on certain words in the sequence. 4. The final representation of each word is obtained by taking a weighted sum of the value vectors, where the weights are the attention weights. [..] If the model is focusing on "snow," it might assign higher attention weights to "white" to capture the relationship between the two. The attention weights for each word are dynamically determined based on the context and the model's learned patterns during training.' Next I actually asked "Why is snow white?" and got: 'Snow appears white because it reflects and scatters all the colors of light in the visible spectrum, creating the perception of a white color.' Asking slightly different "Who is snow white?" I got: 'Snow White is a fictional character and the protagonist of a German fairy tale, famously known from Disney's adaptation.'
