Leveraging JQuery find or inArray method to find an item in an array

I was wondering if anyone knows of a way to use the JQuery find method or inArray method to find an item in an array. I can't seem to find anything in the docs. for example: var items = [{id:1, name:'bob'}, {id:2, name:'joe'}, {id:3, name:'ben'}]; var found = $(items).find("[name='ben']"); or var items = [{id:1, name:'bob'}, {id:2, name:'joe'}, {id:3, name:'ben'}]; var found = $.inArray("[name='ben']", items);
