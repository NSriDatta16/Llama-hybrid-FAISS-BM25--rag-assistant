"Is it possible to hide projects from a build and yet still have them build?" You can make separate solution for test cases. Then you can set up post build step of your main projects. This post-build should build tests-projects via separate solution and run them. Building test-projects should be done via command line (see e.g. here for details). If you need to link your unit tests with some lib-s from main projects, you can use #pragma comment(lib, "libname") See this MSDN page for details.
