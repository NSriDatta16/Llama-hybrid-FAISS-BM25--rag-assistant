Can Denoising Diffusions only learn white noise, and/or no drift?

I understand that it works best for image generation to add white noise and no drift because is simpler. My question is, theoretically speaking, can the noise follow a certain distribution and the drift can be any function of state and time (signal), and the neural networks can learn to distinguish it from noise? A lot of diffusion papers do not get into this discussion but I have a tendency to slim though
