Best way to track onchange as-you-type in input type="text"?

In my experience, input type="text" onchange event usually occurs only after you leave ( blur ) the control. Is there a way to force browser to trigger onchange every time textfield content changes? If not, what is the most elegant way to track this “manually”? Using onkey* events is not reliable, since you can right-click the field and choose Paste, and this will change the field without any keyboard input. Is setTimeout the only way?.. Ugly :-)
