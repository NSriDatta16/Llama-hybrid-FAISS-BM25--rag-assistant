Repeated measures ANOVA: what is the normality assumption?

I am confused about the normality assumption in repeated measures ANOVA. Specifically, I am wondering what kind of normality exactly should be satisfied. In reading the literature and the answers on CV, I came across three distinct wordings of this assumption. Dependent variable within each (repeated) condition should be distributed normally. It is often stated that rANOVA has the same assumptions as ANOVA, plus the sphericity. That is the claim in Field's Discovering statistics as well as in Wikipedia's article on the subject and Lowry's text . The residuals (differences between all possible pairs?) should be distributed normally. I found this statement in multiple answers on CV ( 1 , 2 ). By analogy of rANOVA to the paired t-test , this might also seem intuitive. Multivariate normality should be satisfied. Wikipedia and this source mention this. Also, I know that rANOVA can be swapped with MANOVA, which might merit this claim. Are these equivalent somehow? I know that multivariate normality means that any linear combination of the DVs is normally distributed, so 3. would naturally include 2. if I understand the latter correctly. If these are not the same, which is the "true" assumption of the rANOVA? Can you provide a reference? It seems to me there is most support for the first claim. This is not in line, however, with the answers usually provided here. Linear mixed models Due to @utobi's hint, I now understand how rANOVA can be restated as a linear mixed model. Specifically, to model how blood pressure changes with time, I would model the expected value as: $$ \mathrm{E}\left[y_{ij}\right]=a_{i}+b_i t_{ij}, $$ where $y_{ij}$ are measurements of blood pressure, $a_{i}$ the average blood pressure of the $i$-th subject, and $t_{ij}$ as the $j$-th time the $i$-th subject was measured, $b_i$ denoting that the change in blood pressure is different across subject, too. Both effects are considered random, since the sample of subjects is only a random subset of the population, which is of primary interest. Finally, I tried to think about what this means for normality, but to little success. To paraphrase McCulloch and Searle (2001, p. 35. Eq. (2.14)): \begin{align} \mathrm{E}\left[y_{ij}|a_i\right] &= a_i \\[5pt] y_{ij}|a_i &\sim \mathrm{indep.}\ \mathcal{N}(a_i,\sigma^2) \\[5pt] a_i &\sim \mathrm{i.i.d.}\ \mathcal{N}(a,\sigma_a^2) \end{align} I understand this to mean that 4. each individual's data needs to be normally distributed, but this is unreasonable to test with few time points. I take the third expression to mean that 5. averages of individual subjects are normally distributed. Note that these are another two distinct possibilities on top of the three mentioned above.
