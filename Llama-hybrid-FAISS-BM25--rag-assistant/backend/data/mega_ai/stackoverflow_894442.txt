For future reference, you'll want to avoid using the following: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM OrderDetail GROUP BY OrderHeaderID It seems simple and elegant enough at first glance, but note that you'll miss any order from the OrderHeader table that has no orders. If it is important that they be represented (with a 0 for their count), see Tomalak or Autocracy 's answers here and here . Thanks to KM for pointing this out! (see comments below)
