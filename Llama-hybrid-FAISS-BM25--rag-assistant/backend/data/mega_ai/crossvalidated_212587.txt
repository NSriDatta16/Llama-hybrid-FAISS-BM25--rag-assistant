How to indicate whether the improvement of a ranking is statistically significant over another one in R?

I have two ranked lists of documents (List1, List2). After comparing each of them against the ground truth, I calculate precision at 5 (P@5) metric to measure how good are each of the ranked lists. List1 outperforms List2. Now, I would like to test and see if the improvement of List1 over List2 is statistically significant. Here are List1 and List2: List1 = Doc10, Doc21, Doc2, Doc3, ... List2 = Doc2, Doc10, Doc3, Doc21, ... I have looked into the literature, and usually they do t-test for this matter, but I couldn't find any tutorials which explains how to do it in a tool such as R. I will appreciate if anyone can help me. EDIT: In order to give you an example of a scientific paper in my area which has done it, please check this paper: http://romaindeveaud.github.io/publis/cikm15-deveaud.pdf If you check the caption for Table 2, it says: We use a two-sided pairwise t-test (with p Note that each method returns a ranked list for each given query (or given user). Then, for each query in each system P@5 is calculated and each system's overall performance is the average of all P@5 values for each query. As an example: System 1 System 2 Query 1 P@5=0.5 P@5=0.6 Query 2 P@5=0.6 P@5=0.7 Query 3 P@5=0.7 P@5=0.8 --------------------------------------- Overall P@5=0.6 P@5=0.7
