std::queue is an adapter to another container (that implements front, back, push_back, and pop_front), unless you specify which container to adapt, it the will use std::deque. Deque does some block allocation magic in the background that should provide resizing similar to vector but performs better since it manages multiple non contiguous blocks and doesn't have to copy everything each time it resizes. Anyway, it's a guess, but I'd say thats the cause. The byte array structure is seeing the hits more frequently due to making room for all those arrays, I'd bet over a longer scale the string struct would also generate spikes, it's just smaller now since string likely maintains references to the underling character storage until something changes it. Nows your chance to get familiar with your profiler of choice and find out for sure! Fire valgrind (--callgrind) or whatever profiler your platform supports and see exactly which calls are using the time and where.
