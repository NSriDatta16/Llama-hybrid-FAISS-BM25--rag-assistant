I'm not sure text-indent is what your're looking for. Just to clarify: text-indent will indent the first row of the paragraph. Indentation is always on the left side, as long as (text-) direction is ltr , otherwise of course on the right side. All following rows will start at the boundaries of the paragraph block. If you want to "indent" the whole block, you're looking for either margin or padding . Also, you're not giving the floated paragraphs a width, so they will adapt to their contents, which might be the cause of you not seeing any indentation happening. Edit: An example. Take a look at this in a browser. Then remove the text-indent to see what happens. As you will notice, it does work as it should, but not as you expect it to. (Or, that is, if I have understood what you're going after.) .col { border: 1px solid red; display: inline; float: left; text-indent: 5px; } .col-left { } .col-right { float: right; } Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
