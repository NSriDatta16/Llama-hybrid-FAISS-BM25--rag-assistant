Your question is somewhat self-contradictory -- "to test if on average" vs "come from the same distribution" ... are you interested in whether the averages are the same or the distributions are the same? I suspect you don't really believe that the GA could have exactly the same expected value as the exact approach. Any failure to reject the null will be due to insufficient runs, not because they're the same. To be more specific, I really don't think that a hypothesis test answers an interesting question in this case. Surely interest would focus on how close it was to the exact values, or whether it was 'close enough' in some sense - that is, I think you really have a measurement issue, not a testing one.
