There is an implied statement in your question that I want to clarify before giving an answer. You stated : I have also tested with freq=1 (but it is obviously a mistake because they are not yearly values) This implies that either data frequency is only governed by frequency per year or that all and or only yearly data have a frequency of 1. Both of these statements are false. Solar cycles have a frequency of about 11 years, so yearly solar cycle data would have a frequency of about 11. On the other hand, something like server copy errors per copy attempt may be sampled more than once per second, but still have a frequency of 1 since copy errors are a mostly random process. When determining the frequency of the series, you need to think about what is causing the seasonality and not just rely on the sample rate (though that can be a good starting point). The answer below assumes you have correctly identifies the seasonal period as 1 year. As to your original question, there are a few ways you can deal with your data. The simplest would be to set your seasonality to the mean value of your number of samples per year. Time series do not need to have an integer seasonality, so you can make a time series in R as below: ts(rnorm(100), frequency = 14.73) Another option would be to add back in the missing days to the time series and use a frequency of 365 (or even better 365.24). If you have the time points for each observation, you can use the zoo package in R to make an irregular time series and then fill in the missing values. You can make the series using: x.Date The missing values can be filled using many methods, but one to consider is zoo::na.approx . From there the series can be decomposed as normal. decompose(na.approx(y)) A few final notes and options: 1) decompose is a useful method, but you may also want to consider the stl decomposition for your data as even the decompose docs say that " stl provides a much more sophisticated decomposition." 2) You will always get an error if you try to use decompose or stl on a series with a frequency of 1. Both functions seek to separate the seasonal and trend components of the data, so if there is no seasonal component (ie frequency = 1), there is a problem. If instead you just want to separate trend from noise, you might consider using a moving average .
