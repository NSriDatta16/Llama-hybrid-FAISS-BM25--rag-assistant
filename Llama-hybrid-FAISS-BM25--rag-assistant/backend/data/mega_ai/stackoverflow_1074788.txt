I regularly run JUnit tests that use JMockit (with and without the "-javaagent" JVM argument) in debug mode, and never had any issues. Are you sure the classpath for the "Debug as Junit Test" configuration is identical to the one for "Run As Junit Test"? Since you got an UnsatisfiedLinkError, it may be that there is some jar file missing. If that is not the cause of the error, then maybe it is something specific to RAD 7.5.2...
