Alright, I think I found the answer to my question. The reason my approximation is rarely/never used is that it is generally a very poor approximation of the integrals. To see why, consider what happens when the likelihood function spikes somewhere in the tails of the prior (as will often be the case). The $\theta$'s surrounding the spike will rarely be sampled, resulting in a poor approximation of the likelihood function. See pages 25 and 26 of the document linked below for more information: https://engineering.purdue.edu/kak/Tutorials/MonteCarloInBayesian.pdf Edit: The first paragraph of section 3.2 in the following document also discusses this but in the context of computing Bayes factors: https://www.insper.edu.br/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014_wpe341.pdf
