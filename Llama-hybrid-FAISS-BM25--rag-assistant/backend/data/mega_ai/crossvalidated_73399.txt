The best approach to achieving what you're trying to describe is probably to directly optimize the logistic regression parameters with an AUC loss function. The textbook "Statistical Methods in Diagnostic Medicine" by Zhou describes this method. The AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve-- or ROC) is roughly interpreted as the probability that a randomly sampled "case" has a higher marker value than a "control". This is a measure of model discrimination, or its ability to correctly classify the outcome. The ROC is a curve in the unit plane which shows the sensitivity versus 1 - specificity for all possible marker values (fitted outcomes) in a regression model. By using the traditional formulation of the logistic regression model, $$ \mbox{logit Pr}(Y = 1 | X) = \alpha + \beta X$$ with log odds ratios for model parameters, you can roughly define an AUC based loss function to obtain optimal parameters. Unlike likelihood based logistic regression, AUC regression is not regular and can converge to local maxima in the parameter space.
