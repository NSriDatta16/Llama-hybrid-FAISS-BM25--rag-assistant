Link images/layers in Flash CS4 - making them move together

I have two copies of an image (one called blurPic_mc & one called sharpPic_mc) and I want to be able to move both of them around the screen together. I need them to stay exactly on top of each other for some other functions I am running but right now the only one that moves is the top one (sharpPic_mc). Any Ideas? I included my code below. sharpPic_mc.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_DOWN,Click); sharpPic_mc.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_UP,Release); function Click(event:MouseEvent):void{ event.currentTarget.startDrag(); blurPic_mc.startDrag(); } function Release(event:MouseEvent):void{ event.currentTarget.stopDrag(); blurPic_mc.startDrag(); }
