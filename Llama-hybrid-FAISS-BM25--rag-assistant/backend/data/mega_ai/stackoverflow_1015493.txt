How long are the subsection names? Will they fit in the space for tabs? You’re likely to get better user performance if you put the section links on the side bar menu and the subsection links in the tabs, rather than the other way around. See http://www.usability.gov/pubs/040106news.html . The other alternative is to put everything on the side bar menu. Subsection links can appear indented under their section links. You can also consider putting the subsection links in a column of their own to the right of the section column. This makes the section menu stable, but takes a lot of horizontal space that’s perhaps better used for content. In either case, proper attention to visual design will show the current section, subsection, and the link between them. There shouldn’t be a problem with accessibility as long as you’re using links to navigate to each section/subsection (perhaps generated programmatically for each page based on a database relating links to pages).
