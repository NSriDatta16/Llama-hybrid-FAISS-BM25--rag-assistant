Display 3 Gantt Charts of a Prj Task

I am a newbie of sharepoint 2007. And I am just a site admin. Suppose I have a prj site, which I have to define 3 group of dates to Prj Task like the following - Original Start/End Date - Current Start/End Date - Actual Start/End Date However, with the default Gantt View setting, I can only to set one date group to have displayed in Gantt. Is there any method to have it done? Thanks
