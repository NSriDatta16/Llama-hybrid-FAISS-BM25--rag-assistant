You don't have to do anything for this. The control automatically passes the value for you. In your php script just use this: $_GET["term"] They pass a querystring variable by the name of term. It's in the docs but a little obscure to find. EDIT: I knew this because I was having the same problem last week trying to find this. Here is the URL to the docs: http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Autocomplete Also here is the paragraph from the page that explains what to do: When a String is used, the Autocomplete plugin expects that string to point to a URL resource that will return JSON data. It can be on the same host or on a different one (must provide JSONP). The request parameter "term" gets added to that URL. The data itself can be in the same format as the local data described above.
