Decision Trees vs Boosting, Random Forests

I read the statement, listened to a coursera lecture that Ensemble techniques like ADA Boost and Random Forest are better and used more often than pure Decision Trees. I am right to assume for Classification that therefore ID3, CART et al approaches no longer prevail? And that we learn these as part of courses only and in practice a pure decision tree like CART is no longer applied?
