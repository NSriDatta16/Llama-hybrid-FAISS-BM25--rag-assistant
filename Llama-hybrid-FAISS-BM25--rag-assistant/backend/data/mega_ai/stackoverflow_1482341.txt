Where to store things like user pictures using Azure? Blob Storage?

I have just migrated a project of mine for test cases to Microsoft's azure. But for functionalities similar to an avatar upload I need write access to the files on the harddrive. But this is a cloud, so this is not possible. How can I build such functionalities instead? Should I use the Blob Storage or is there a better solution? Does it make sense to store all website images (f.e. layout images) in the Blob Storage? So I would have a Cookie-free Domain for my static content?
