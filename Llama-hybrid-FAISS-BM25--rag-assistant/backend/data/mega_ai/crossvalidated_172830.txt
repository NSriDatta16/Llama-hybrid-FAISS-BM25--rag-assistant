At this point, I think I can answer your final question in the affirmative. Yes, a hierarchical Bayesian model would be highly efficient at sharing whatever information exists in these heavily interval-censored data. (It is through the latent variables in these models that this sharing would be accomplished.) A Bayesian approach would be especially fruitful if your priors embody a substantial amount of additional information about the disease process, or even about the vagaries of the data collection process. It's altogether possible that such a modeling exercise will demonstrate that, even with your best efforts to provide strongly informative priors, your data are too heavily censored to tell you much. That would be a very useful finding, however, as it would allow you to abandon other, less efficient modeling methods in favor of devoting resources to searching for new data of higher quality--or perhaps recovering some of the underlying detail lost in your current data by going back to the pathologists' original notes. I find it hard to believe a pathologist would ever set eyes on an excised tumor sample without producing (somewhere!) an exquisite description of it. (The same holds for radiologists, if your data come from MRI or CT imaging.)
