Counting number of words in a file

I'm having a problem counting the number of words in a file. The approach that I am taking is when I see a space or a newLine then I know to count a word. The problem is that if I have multiple lines between paragraphs then I ended up counting them as words also. If you look at the readFile() method you can see what I am doing. Could you help me out and guide me in the right direction on how to fix this? Example input file (including a blank line): word word word word word word word word
