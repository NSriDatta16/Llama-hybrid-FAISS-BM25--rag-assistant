Robust variance estimators require large samples to be valid. In small samples, they are biased downward, and the normal-distribution-based confidence intervals may have coverage way below nominal coverage rates. Using a $t_{n-k}$-distribution approximations to be conservative is one possible solution: you hope that this fattens up the tails adequately before you offer up your tests to the journal referee gods. Other ideas are multiplying the squared residuals by $\frac{n}{n-k}$ (or something similar) to inflate them (which Stata also does), or higher order asymptotic expansions, or resampling methods like bootstrapping. Here $n$ is the number of observations and $k$ the number of parameters. A nice survey of this literature is Imbens and Kolesar (2012) . They give a great example where the $t$ approximation goes wrong in a setting where you have a binary treatment with very few treated observations. Using $n=n_T+n_C$ is far too generous. If your sample size is large, using the $t$ versus the normal won't matter at all.
