Finding research papers for a dataset

I found a breast cancer dataset on Kaggle. Here is the link - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/reihanenamdari/breast-cancer I would like to how could I find out which research papers use this dataset for binary classification. So far I got only one paper "Breast Cancer Survival Prediction from Imbalanced Dataset with Machine Learning Algorithms" that use this dataset after searching on google scholar. If there is any technique to find out research papers for a particular dataset, Please let me know. Thank you.
