Using a variable as a regular regressor vs. as an offset is mainly a question of estimating its coefficient vs. knowing (or fixing) it to be 1. As a pragmatic solution I would look at the estimation results of WholeModel . If the coefficient of TotalWords is close to 1 you might also treat it as an offset. More importantly, it might make sense to use log(TotalWords) rather than TotalWords (possibly similarly for AvgFrequency ) so that if you use it as an offset you could really interpret it as modeling the ratio NumWordsFound/TotalWords . Again, you could also decide whether or not to do this based on the model fit.
