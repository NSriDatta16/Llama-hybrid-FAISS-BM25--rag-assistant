Another case that I just encountered on the tutor@python.org mailing list - A blind programmer who is working in Python uses a reader program - apparently the reader program isn't terribly fond of multiple spaces, so it's easier on him to use a single space. There's really no good or technical reason to require exactly 4 spaces, and I think the best argument against requirement is that programmers hate to be restricted, especially by stupid and somewhat arbitrary rules. Sure we all agree that 4 spaces is best and most of us have editors automagically set our indentation, but on the occasions you don't want to use 4 spaces - one off script code, etc. - you have now alienated a programmer who feels the crushing hand of an arbitrary (style) requirement. The importance of whitespace isn't a problem for most people for a few reasons. First, I can't think of a single (good) programmer who would argue that proper code formatting is a bad thing. Second, logic requires us to separate our code into blocks. Many languages use {} delimiters. In assembly it's usually labels. Python's choice of whitespace is actually fairly natural, at least for the English language. When you read a book, or a newspaper, or a blog post, when someone makes a quote it's usually indented. Paragraphs are separated by a blank line or two. Chapters are usually separated by blank space at the end of a page and blank space at the beginning of the next. So whitespace is a good thing, but forcing programmers to adhere to your particular standard will get programmers to go do something else with their time.
