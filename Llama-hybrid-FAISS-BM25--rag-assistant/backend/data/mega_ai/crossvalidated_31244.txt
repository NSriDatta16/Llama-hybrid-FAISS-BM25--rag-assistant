This looks like a nonstationary time series. In general if there are no known interventions I would try to model this as a single series. However if interventions are expected to exist that cause the behavior of the time series to change there are models of the Box-Jenkins ARIMA variety that have change points in the time series at specific intervention time points. The software product autobox produced by Dave Reilly's company will take a time series like this and automatically select the number and the locations for the interventions and fit an ARIMA models with changes at the intervention points. Typically interventions are assumed to change the level of the series without changing other characteristics but they can be more complicated as may be the case for your particular series.
