Display milliseconds in Excel

I am trying to display milliseconds in an Excel macro. I have a column of integers which are timestamps in milliseconds (e.g. 28095200 is 7:48:15.200 am), and I want to make a new column next to it which keeps a running average and displays the time in a hh:mm:ss.000 format. Dim Cel As Range Set Cel = Range("B1") temp = Application.Average(Range("A1:A2")) / 1000 ms = Round(temp - Int(temp), 2) * 1000 Cel.Value = Strings.Format((temp / 60 / 60 / 24), "hh:mm:ss") _ & "." & Strings.Format(ms, "#000") This only displays "mm:ss.0" in the cell. Yet when I click on the cell, it shows "hh:mm:ss" in the formula bar. Why are the hours missing? How can I show the hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds?
