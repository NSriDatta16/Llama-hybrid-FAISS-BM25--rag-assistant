First, I wouldn't use stacked bar charts; William Cleveland, for one, has shown that these are poor representations of data. I think a dot plot could be a lot better. The help for dotplot, offers this example dotchart(t(VADeaths), xlim = c(0,100), main = "Death Rates in Virginia - 1940") You can just substitute proportions for rates, the Likert scale for question of whether they are urban, rural, male, female and the region for the age range. Next, to answer your question: Your dependent variable is ordinal (how much like me) and your independent variable is nominal (state). So, I suggest ordinal logistic regression. Here you do have a DV and an IV: You are supposing that state influences values, not the other way around.
