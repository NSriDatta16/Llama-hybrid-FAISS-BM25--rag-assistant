How to highlight the potential drop areas in sortable before drop?

I'm using JQuery's Sortable (not Draggable or Droppable) and I was wondering how I could highlight the potential drop areas (using CSS) that a user has when the user has begun sorting. Something like http://www.shopdev.co.uk/blog/sortables.html but with highlighting the area in which the item can be dropped.
