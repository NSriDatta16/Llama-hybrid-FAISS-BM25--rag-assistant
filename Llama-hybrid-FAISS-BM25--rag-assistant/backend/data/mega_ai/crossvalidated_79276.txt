What if a log transformation wipes out significance in regression?

I'm doing an OLS regression of donations made by individuals to a not-for-profit organisation. The donation amount is the dependent variable and dummy (treatment) variables are the only independent variables. The non-transformed treatment variable is significant (5% level), but when I take a log of the donation amount (not treatment), the treatment variables become highly insignificant. Does this show an outlier problem and should not be used for interpretation of the data?
