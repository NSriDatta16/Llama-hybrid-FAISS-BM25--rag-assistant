First of all I'd suggest that you learn to format your code properly, as it makes it much easier to see whats going on. Secondly, the code you've posted has syntax errors on lines 64 and 80 which cause it to fail compilation. The issue is that Java doesn't allow you to have multi line string literals within the source code, so you have to concatenate the two string together. For example: darn.namePrompt.setText("Congradulations, Your mind is Awesome!!!"); should be: darn.namePrompt.setText("Congradulations," + " Your mind is Awesome!!!"); Now, unfortunately your question doesn't make it particularly clear as to what the intended behavior of the program should be. My interpretation of it, is that you want to provide the user with the text box asking them to enter the first color, and then display a dialog saying either congratulations or sorry depending on whether they got the answer correct. If they get the answer correct, then you want to display the input box for the second color, check the answer, etc. My first suggestion is to create all of the controls when you instantiate the JFrame, but simply hide the other ones until the user has entered the correct value. Next, I'd suggest that you plan what the action listener is going to do before you go in and write the code. In this case, the program needs to store the array index of the input field that the user is currently working on. The listener then needs to check this variable, and validate the corresponding field in the inputFields array. The listener needs to display a dialog to the user saying whether they got the answer correct, and if the user did, enable the next input field. Putting it all together you get this: import javax.swing.*; import java.awt.*; import java.awt.event.*; public class AlbertCardonaProg7 extends JFrame { private static final int WIDTH = 350; private static final int HEIGHT = 250; private static final String[] colorValues = { "red", "white", "yellow", "green", "blue" }; private final JLabel[] inputLabels = new JLabel[colorValues.length]; private final JTextField[] inputFields = new JTextField[colorValues.length]; private int index = 0; public AlbertCardonaProg7() { //Create the UI controls for (int i = 0; i Edit: based on your comment below, I've modified the program to meet the expected behavior. The main changes are the constructor no longer hides the other controls, and the listener now has to loop over each input field to check they are all correct: import javax.swing.*; import java.awt.*; import java.awt.event.*; public class AlbertCardonaProg7 extends JFrame { private static final int WIDTH = 350; private static final int HEIGHT = 250; private static final String[] colorValues = { "red", "white", "yellow", "green", "blue" }; private final JLabel[] inputLabels = new JLabel[colorValues.length]; private final JTextField[] inputFields = new JTextField[colorValues.length]; public AlbertCardonaProg7() { //Create the UI controls for (int i = 0; i
