Centralized DB connection management in Java

For compliance reasons, my organization is looking to take our database connection settings out of properties/XML config files and into a central registry - ideally federated over multiple physical machines, to avoid a single point of failure. I have been looking at the possibility of using JNDI to achieve this, but haven't really got much experience in using it myself. Has anyone got experience attempting to do anything similar? Or any better ideas of how this might be achieved? I should add that our apps are standalone and do not run within any J2EE container, therefore any container specific connection management techniques may not be particularly useful.
