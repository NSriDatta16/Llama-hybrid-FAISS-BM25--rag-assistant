Get LINQ to preload a complete table

I need LINQ to grab a whole table, but this seems not to be working... everytime i select on the values via the pkey, a select is fired again.. So, actually this code: DataContext dc = new DataContext(); dc.Stores.ToList(); Store st = dc.Stores.SingleOrDefault(p => p.Id == 124671); is making a select * from store at the "ToList()" method and an ADDITIONAL select * from store where id = 124671 at the selection part below it... Of course, i want to prevent it to make the second select.. How would i do it? (I DON'T want to store the ToList() result in an additional property like List ) UPDATE: Regarding your answers that would mean, that: Store st = stores.SingleOrDefault(p => p.Id == 124671); Store st = stores.SingleOrDefault(p => p.Id == 124671); would trigger 2 selects to the DB, which would make the LINQ-idea useless?! Or what am i getting wrong here? I thought LINQ would basically save all the data i grabbed in the selects and ONLY performs another request when the data was not found in the "cache".. So, i thought of it like some kind of "magical" storagelayer between my application and the database.. UPDATE #2 Just that you get the idea.. i want to lose the performance at the beginning ( when grabbing all data ) and win it back alter when i select from the "cached" data...
