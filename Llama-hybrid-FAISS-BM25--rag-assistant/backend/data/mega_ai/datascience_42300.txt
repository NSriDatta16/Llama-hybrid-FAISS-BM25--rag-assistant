Thanks Sandeep for your detailed answer. I would like to correct that cover is calculated across all splits and not only the leaf nodes. Let's go through a simple example with the data provided by the xgboost library. library('xgboost') data(agaricus.train, package='xgboost') data(agaricus.test, package='xgboost') train Output - Let's try to calculate the cover of odor=none in the importance matrix (0.495768965) from the tree dump. Cover of each split where odor=none is used is 1628.2500 at Node ID 0-0 and 765.9390 at Node ID 1-1. Total cover of all splits (summing across cover column in the tree dump) = 1628.2500*2 + 786.3720*2 Cover of odor=none in the importance matrix = (1628.2500+765.9390)/(1628.2500*2+786.3720*2) Hence we are sure that cover is calculated across all splits!
