Ok, so you're going to need to follow these steps to get this to work properly - your syntax, concatenation, and everything else looks great - just a little tweaking of the process and you'll be good to go. Drag an HTML item into a list report. Select it - under the properties pane, change "Source Type" to "Report Expression" (defaults to Text, which is of no use to us right now) Double click the HTML item and create the mailto anchor You can use your code sample, but make sure it is validating correctly before closing. it should, at its simplest, look something like: ' ' - important; do not close the anchor tag at this point. Unlock the report (padlock on the top) Add another HTML item to the cell (it will look like there's two HTML items in the same column) and set it to "Report Expression" Double click the HTML item and add static text/close the tag. For example: Email Me Run the report and you should have links that you can click (tested as working on 8.4.1)
