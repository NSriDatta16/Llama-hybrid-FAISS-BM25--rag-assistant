In test time, firstly, forward the transcription network, then we have the acoustic hidden vectors, denote the length is T . To decode, we need to input first blank vector into the prediction network, that means we have the first prediction distribution, denote as g0 , then we combine g0 with f1 to generate the joint probability, then we can apply argmax to get the predicted label, if its non-blank, then update the prediction using this label as input, otherwise move to the next transcription output f_(t+1) . For more details, please look at the paper: Exploring Architectures, Data and Units For Streaming End-to-End Speech Recognition with RNN-Transducer
