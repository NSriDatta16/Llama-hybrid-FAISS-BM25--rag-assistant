You might use a Windows Azure table. It's fast and reliable and partially supports LINQ. Here are query operators available for LINQ on Azure. Also if you need localization then you might use the same table and the culture as PartitionKey. Also you won't have problems when scaling up or down, because the storage will be common to all nodes. An option to the Windows Azure table might be a dedicated container with an XML file accessed via LINQ-to-XML. But I would prefer the first variant.
