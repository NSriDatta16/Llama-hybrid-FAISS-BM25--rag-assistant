Here's how a complete Schema element actually looks (your snippet seems to be trimmed); Note the xmlns part. So it's actually in a namespace, despite the lack of prefix. Now, in XPath, the lack of prefix always means "not in any namespace". So you'll need to bind some prefix specifically for your XPath, and use that in the query: ... nsm.AddNamespace("ssdl", "http://schemas.microsoft.com/ado/2009/02/edm/ssdl"); var x = edmx.SelectSingleNode( "//edmx:Edmx/edmx:Runtime/edmx:StorageModels/ssdl:Schema", nsm)
