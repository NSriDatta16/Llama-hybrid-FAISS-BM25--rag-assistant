Why generative models in Machine Learning are Boltzmann distribution-backed?

I learned from this review paper that MaxEnt models naturally display a Boltzmann distribution for the data samples, it comes from the Principle of Maximum Entropy. But I could not understand why this distribution is extended to other generative models used in unsupervised learning, e.g. Restricted Boltzmann Machines. MaxEnt are generative models, but a generative model is not necessarily PME-backed, is it?
