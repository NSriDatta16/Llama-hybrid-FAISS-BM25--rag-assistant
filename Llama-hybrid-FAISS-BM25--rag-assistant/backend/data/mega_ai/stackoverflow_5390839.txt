CA2225: Operator overloads have named alternates

Good morning, afternoon or night, Have you ever wrote anything in which Code Analysis popped up this kind of warnings? If so, did you pay attention to them and implement the friendly alternates? If so, using code repetition to avoid performance breakdowns or using operator calls? Thank you very much.
