Loop through HTML checkboxes using jQuery

I am trying to write with jQuery something that does the following. When you click, let's say, on a paragraph, it checks to see if the checkbok is selected (checked), if it waits x amount amount of time and selects the next check box and so on. The closest I got (not much, sorry) you can see it here . In this example you have to click once for each check, I dont want this. I need that when you click the it: Checks, Changes, Checks, Changes(and so on) If it is possible to loop through this, even better. Thanks a lot in advance, I hope it is clear enough, if not, please ask! EDIT: as @James said basically what I want is want is to continuously loop through the checkboxes checking and unchecking them
