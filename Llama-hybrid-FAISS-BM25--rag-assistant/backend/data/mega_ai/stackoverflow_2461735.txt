XML cached in local testing

My question is about XML loading. I need to avoid xml caching. On a web server, the technique is adding a random param to reload each time the XML file. But on local testing (in Flash CS4 IDE, CTRL + Enter), the following lines are not possible : var my_date : Date; path = "toto.xml?time="+my_date.getSeconds()+my_date.getMilliseconds(); Is there any trick to bypass this issue ? I've read on different forum about the "delete" method, we delete the xml object and then recreate one new. In my case, I put : myXML = null; myXML = new XML ( loadedData ); But it doesn't work at all. I found something interesting but for Air 1.0 unfortunately with the cacheResponse . In AS3 I found : var loader : URLLoader = new URLLoader(); var urlRequest : URLRequest = new URLRequest( xmlUrl ); var header : URLRequestHeader = new URLRequestHeader ( "pragma", "no-cache" ); urlRequest.requestHeaders.push(header); But it doesn't work. I spent many hours on that problem, if anyone has a good solution... Thank you.
