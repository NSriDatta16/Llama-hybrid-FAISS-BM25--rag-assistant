Change of variables in MCMC posterior

I have a question similar to this previously asked stackexchange question . However, instead of the expectation value after a change of variables, I am looking for the posterior probability density function after a change of variables. I have a MCMC where I am estimating two parameters: $$ (\log\alpha, \log\beta) $$ I have run the sampler and have the resulting chain representing the joint posterior of these two parameters. I would like to do a change of variables to determine the probability density functions for $\alpha$ and $\beta$ . In the previous answer they were just looking for the expectation value of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ . This value is commonly given in summaries of MCMC methods as: $$ E[f(\theta)]\approx\frac{1}{M}\sum_{t=0}^{M-1}f(\theta^{(t)}), $$ where $\theta$ is the parameter, $f$ is the transformation function, $t$ is the element in the chain of total length $M$ . Thus, to find the expectation values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ you can just do $e^{\log\alpha}$ and $e^{\log\beta}$ on the chain. Now in terms of the pdf of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ , I believe I need to bring in the Jacobian: $$ J=\begin{vmatrix} e^{\log\alpha} & 0 \\ 0 & e^{\log\beta} \end{vmatrix}=\alpha\beta $$ where I find that if $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are independent then the joint pdf after a change of variables is: $$ f(\alpha,\beta)= \frac{f(\log\alpha,\log\beta)}{J}=\frac{f(\log\alpha,\log\beta)}{\alpha\beta}. $$ The marginal pdfs would be: $$ f(\alpha) = \frac{1}{\alpha}\int\frac{f(\log\alpha,\log\beta)}{\beta}d\beta,\\ f(\beta) = \frac{1}{\beta}\int\frac{f(\log\alpha,\log\beta)}{\alpha}d\alpha. $$ Is this correct? Normally to get a marginal pdf from a MCMC chain you take the histogram across one parameter. In terms of taking my chain of $\log\alpha$ and $\log\beta$ values to get a pdf for $\alpha$ and $\beta$ do I just take the weighted histogram of the chain values with a weight $\frac{1}{\alpha\beta}$ . Thanks I am a new user and am grateful for any help! (I also apologize for the notation)
