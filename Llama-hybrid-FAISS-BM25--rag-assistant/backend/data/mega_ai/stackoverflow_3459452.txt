Unit testing - can't move from theory to practice

It seems like every unit test example I've encountered is incredibly obvious and canned. Things like assert that x + 3 == 8, and whatnot. I just have a hard time seeing how I'd unit test real world things, like SQL queries, or if a regEx used for form validation is actually working properly. Case in point: I'm working on two ASP.NET MVC 2 sites that are DB driven. I have a test unit solution for each of them, but have no idea what kind of tests would be useful. Most of the work the site will do is writing data to, or retrieving and organizing data from the DB. Would I simply test that the various queries successfully accessed the DB? How would I test for correctness (e.g., data being written to the proper fields, or correct data being retrieved)? I'm just having a hard time transforming my own informal manner of testing and debugging into the more formalized, assert(x) kind of testing.
