Compare Machine Score and Human Score using R

This is a part of my research work. I have collected three human raters scores for an essay question(N=54). I am building Automated Scoring Algorithm. So I need to compare my machine score with the Human rater score. All are using 0-10 rating scale. For example; | H1 | H2 | H3 | Adj | Diff | Sys_Score | 2 5 4 4.5 -1 5 3 7 9 8 2 9 8 7 4 7.5 -3 6 H1,H2,H3 = are human raters' scores Adj = I calculated correlation(R) between H1~H2, H1~H3 and H2~H3, and found that H2~H3 is highly correlated compared to others. So I calculate Adj = Average(H2,H3); except If the difference between these two variables (H2,H3) is higher than > 1, then I consider other variable(H1). Diff = the difference between H2 and H3(correlated pair) SysScore = System Output My question are, How to compare the Human Score and Machine score using R ? Is it the best way? How to derive the True score from the Human Rater's score?
