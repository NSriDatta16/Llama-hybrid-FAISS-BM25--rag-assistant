Perl Threads faster than Sequentially processing?

Just wanted to ask whether it's true that parallel processing is faster than sequentially processing. I've always thought that parallel processing is faster, so therefore, I did an experiment. I benchmarked my scripts and found out that after doing a bunch of sub add{ for ($x=0; $x threading seems to be slower by about 0.5 CPU secs on average. Is this normal or is it really true that sequentially processing is faster?
