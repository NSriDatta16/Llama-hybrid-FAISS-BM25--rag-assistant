It's pretty simple, and not limited to statistics. A parameter is a basic feature of the universe. Like 100 is the parameter for the temperature that water boils at sea level. Or $c$ for the speed of light in $E=Mc^2$. In the particular case of statistics, you have parameters of estimators, which you hope correspond to some parameter of the universe which is of interest. So, the fact that 2 is the mean of 1 and 3 is a basic feature of the universe, which contains 1 and 3 and the procedure for taking averages. Similarly, the universe often contains vectors of x and y, it contains OLS, and therefore any given set of x and y have associated OLS parameters. They are unchanging features of existence. Again, whether these OLS parameters correspond the the parameters of the universe is another question.
