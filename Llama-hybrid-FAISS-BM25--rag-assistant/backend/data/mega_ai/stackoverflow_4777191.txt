If you are worried that some team members will avoid documenting or you just want a working minimal sets of documentation, you can enable these in your doxygen configuration. WARNINGS = YES WARN_IF_UNDOCUMENTED = YES WARN_IF_DOC_ERROR = YES As part of your doxygen build process save the warnings to a file and try to get and keep the warning count as low as possible (0 if that is reasonable). If you do this, every public and protected class member will need at least an @brief, @param for each function argument and an @return. This is good enough to describe most APIs and not too much to encumber other living codebases. You should, of course, encourage people to document as much as they feel is required on a case by case basis, as long as they meet the minimum project standards. Don't set the minimum too high though, then you may not get useful documentation in the end. For example, in our project, everything another coder is likely to touch should be documented. Enabling the warnings let see how close that goal we are. We also try to use @internal to describe what/why we do what we do with some of our private members.
