Your question is not really Java but WAS related. Basically if you want to use the security facilities of WAS for Web Security all your users must be found from the LDAP the WAS is configured against. If that is not possible for you please have changes made to the application so that it implements its own custom made security (authentication & authorization) mechanisms. It sounds like someone enabled the JavaEE security role for the servlets used by your application and probably also the SPNEGO. That is pretty nice configuration but it really doesn't allow anyone that is not found from the default LDAP to access anything.
