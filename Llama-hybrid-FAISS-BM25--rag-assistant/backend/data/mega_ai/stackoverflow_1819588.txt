If you're using instance subclassing (SetWindowLongPtr), then since when the window gets torn down it doesn't matter which WndProc it's using--it's about to vanish anyway. If you're using global subclassing (SetClassLongPtr) then it would probably be a good idea to remove the subclass once the last subclassed window is closed (i.e. not per window) so that any future windows created with that class don't get subclassed--unless that's what you want, of course.
