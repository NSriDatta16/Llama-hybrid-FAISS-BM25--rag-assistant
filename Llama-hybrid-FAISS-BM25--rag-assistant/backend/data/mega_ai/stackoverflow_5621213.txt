MVC pages slow on first view

I have a simple application with MVC pages that have no javascript, images or anything other than HTML and Razor C# code (not much). Seems to me that when the pages first load they take a long time and then after that they are much quicker. Is there some compilation going on with MVC3 the first time a page is requested. Robert
