This will make bit clear, RMSE calculated between two sets, eg: set and predicted set, to calculate the error, eg : price Vs predicted price 10 12 12 10 13 17 $$ {RMSE}=\sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^N{(F_i - O_i)^2}}{N}} $$ f = forecasts (expected values or unknown results), o = observed values (known results). we find the difference of each row, then sum the differences, and square it, divided by N and finally root... (or you can use a single fixed predicted value and subtract from all rows) RMSD will use a single set to calculate the spread, (not between predicted, but itself) price 10 12 13 $$ {RMSD}=\sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^N{(x_i - \mu_i)^2}}{N}} $$ Î¼ is the average value
