This question explains what stationarity is and why we want it. Intuitively, a time series is stationary if its distribution does not change over time. Anything with trends or seasonality is not stationary. Differencing means taking differences between observations one period apart, i.e. working with $y_2-y_1, y_3-y_2, ...$ instead of $y_1, y_2, y_3, ...$. This addresses some kinds of non-stationarity. See here for other ways to address non-stationarity.
