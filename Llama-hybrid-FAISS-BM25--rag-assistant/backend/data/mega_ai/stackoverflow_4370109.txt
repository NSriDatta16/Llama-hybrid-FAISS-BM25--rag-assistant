Eclipse for Java EE allows you to create a number of different projects that could be considered Java EE and/or J2EE projects. If you are creating a web application, you should create a Dynamic Web Project. There is also an EJB Project, an Application Client Project, a Connector Project and an Enterprise Application Project. You can find out more about these projects in the Eclipse documentation for Ganymede (the moonish name of Eclipse 3.4). You may want to consider upgrading to Eclipse 3.6 for Java EE developers, too. It is the 'current release'. It is called Helios.
