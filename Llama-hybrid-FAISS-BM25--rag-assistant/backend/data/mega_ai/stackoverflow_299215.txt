Efficient data binding for Flash ActiveX hosted in .Net Forms (not asp.net)

This Question asked about embedding a flash player in .net. The provided answer is to host the ActiveX Flash player on the form. This works for simple things, like playing a flash movie. But what if you want to provide data hosted by the .net application to a flex application? Is there an efficient way to transport data from the .net application to the flex runtime?
