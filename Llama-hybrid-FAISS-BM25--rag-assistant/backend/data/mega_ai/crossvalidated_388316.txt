What you are (almost) doing is calculating some transformation (inverse logit, but it should be $e^x/(1+e^x)$ ) of the regression coefficient that for logistic regression would transform to an odds ratio. For alinear regression I am not aware of any useful interpretation of this quantity. The one useful link between a linear model and an odds ratio occurs when you want to know what the probability of the outcome being greater than some threshold. That one can usually estimate from the linear model much better than by dichtomizing the data into above/below threshold and looking at that.
