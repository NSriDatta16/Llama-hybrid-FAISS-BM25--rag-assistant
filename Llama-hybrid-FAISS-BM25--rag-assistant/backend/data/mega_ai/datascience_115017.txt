Checking Linearity in Logistic Regression Model by plotting log-odds against each independent variable

Is plotting the log_odds vs independent variables an appropriate way to check the linearity in logistic regression with multiple predictors? I feel the assumption should be that linearity between dependent and an independent variable exists when other independent variables are kept constant. But since in the data other independent variables are also varying, is such a scatter plot appropriate way of checking linearity?
