Reparameterization of Poisson Distribution

In deep learning, especially generative models, sometimes we need to add some random noise to the input of model. To make the sampling of random noise learnable (or differentiable), we need to reparameterize the sampling, just like diffusion models do. For example, given x ~ N (μ, σ 2 ) , if we sampled x directly, the mean and variance would not be differentiable. In practice we need to reparameterize it with x = μ + σ*ε , where ε ~ N (0, 1) . So we sample ε instead of x , making μ and σ differentiable and learnable. But if given x ~ Poisson (λ) , how to reparameterize it to make λ learnable?
