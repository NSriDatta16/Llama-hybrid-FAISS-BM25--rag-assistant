Is there a statistic or metric that measures variation (or deviation from mean) in a time-dependent manner?

I am evaluating two time series. One has a larger Coefficient of Variation (CV) than the other. But I have also noticed that one of the time series has longer consecutive deviations from the mean. This is particularly important for the purposes of my analysis. Is there a statistic or algorithm that captures that information? Should I do an ad-hoc metric?
