Allow User to Change Text By Clicking Word

I'm trying to use PHP to display a short paragraph of text in which each word can be potentially clicked and changed by the user. For example: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." The user could click on "jumps" and change it to "walks", either via a popup window form or a menu that appears. I'd like to use a database to keep track of the changes and maybe display the text in its past iterations in some way, too. I am kind of a novice, so don't be afraid to be specific. Thanks!
