storage lucene index in database using data objects in java

Is this possible? I cannot access the database directly--only through data objects. Would I be able to search the index if the items are returned in something like ArrayList? If this is not possible, is there some way I can use Lucene (or some other tool) to do fuzzy matching against an object using java? For example, I have a Person object that has a FirstName and LastName. I want to do a fuzzy match on the name. So, say I have an array of x amount of Person objects, would there be an efficient way of looping through each Person object and comparing the names?
