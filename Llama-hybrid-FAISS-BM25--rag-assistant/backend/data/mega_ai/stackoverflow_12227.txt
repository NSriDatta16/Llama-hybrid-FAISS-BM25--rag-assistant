I work for a small e-commerce company, there's 2 developers and a DBA, me being one of the developers. I'm normally not in the habit of updating production data on the fly, if we have stored procedures we've changed we put them through source control and have an officially deployment routine setup. Well anyways a user came to me needing an update done to our contact database, batch updating a bunch of facilities. So I wrote out the query in our test environment, something like update facilities set address1 = '123 Fake Street' where facilityid in (1, 2, 3) Something like that. Ran it in test, 3 rows updated. Copied it to clipboard, pasted it in terminal services on our production sql box, ran it, watched in horror as it took 5 seconds to execute and updated 100000 rows. Somehow I copied the first line and not the second, and wasn't paying attention as I CTRL + V , CTRL + E 'd. My DBA, an older Greek gentleman, probably the grumpiest person I've met was not thrilled. Luckily we had a backup, and it didn't break any pages, luckily that field is only really for display purposes (and billing/shipping). Lesson learned was pay attention to what you're copying and pasting, probably some others too.
