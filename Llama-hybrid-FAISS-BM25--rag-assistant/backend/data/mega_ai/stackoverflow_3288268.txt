As it seems, a lot of libraries and other organisations make information such as "ISBN" available through MAchine-Readable Cataloging aka MARC , you can find more information about it here as well. Now knowing the "right" term to search for I discovered WorldCat.org . Maybe this whole MARC thing gives you a new kind of an idea :)
