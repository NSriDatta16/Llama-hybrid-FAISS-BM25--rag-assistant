Pause after first keypress

There is a slight pause after any first keypress. Here's the log: [00.000ms] keypress -- first keypress [496.00ms] keypress -- second keypress after 496 ms [39.000ms] keypress -- every other keypress after about 20-40 ms. [41.000ms] keypress [21.000ms] keypress [39.000ms] keypress ... So there's a pause of half a second after a first keypress, the rest is fired after 20-40 ms. This is the code to grab the keypresses: // If we're using the webkit engine, capture the keydowns if(navigator.userAgent.indexOf("WebKit") != -1){ window.onkeydown = onKeyPress; } else{ // If we're using gecko, capture the keypress if(navigator.userAgent.indexOf("Gecko") != -1){ window.onkeypress = onKeyPress; } } The first thing the onKeyPress function performs is a debug output (the one from the log above) Does anyone know why the pause is there? It's like that on Windows or Linux; Firefox or Chrome.
