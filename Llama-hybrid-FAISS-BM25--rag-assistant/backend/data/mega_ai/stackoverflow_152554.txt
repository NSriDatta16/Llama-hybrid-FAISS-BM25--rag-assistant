Take a gander at this code:- function writeLn(s) { //your code to write a line to stdout WScript.Echo(s) } function Base() {} Base.prototype.methodA = function() {} Base.prototype.attribA = "hello" var derived = new Base() derived.methodB = function() {} derived.attribB = "world"; function getMethods(obj) { var retVal = {} for (var candidate in obj) { if (typeof(obj[candidate]) == "function") retVal[candidate] = {func: obj[candidate], inherited: !obj.hasOwnProperty(candidate)} } return retVal } var result = getMethods(derived) for (var name in result) { writeLn(name + " is " + (result[name].inherited ? "" : "not") + " inherited") } The getMethod function returns the set of methods along with whether the method is one that has been inherited from a prototype. Note that if you intend to use this on objects that are supplied from the context such as browser/DOM object then it won't work IE.
