Abstract classes and Pod::Coverage

I've recently started to try to use Dist::Zilla for maintaining Path::Class . I added the [PodCoverageTests] plugin, and it's reporting some failures in the Path::Class::Entity class, which is the abstract base class for Path::Class::File and Path::Class::Dir . What I'd like is some way to tell the testing code that Entity doesn't need docs, but its two derived classes do - even though the methods are only defined in the parent class. Anyone know some way to do that?
