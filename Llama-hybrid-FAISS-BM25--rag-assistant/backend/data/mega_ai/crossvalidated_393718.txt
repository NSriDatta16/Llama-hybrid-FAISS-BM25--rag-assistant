It could just be an issue of precision. Repeated measures data have intraclass correlation, meaning that a correct analysis will be, on average, less precise/efficient than would be the case if the data were completely independent. That could be one reason why the LOESS curves you show do not agree with the model results: LOESS treats those data as independent. I agree the graph suggests that one or more month term should interact with sex, as measured by a statistical significance test. Have you inspected a panel or spaghetti plot to see if there is heterogeneity in the mean response by sex? That is, is the tendency toward 0/1 in the earlier months driven by a few individuals who lie more than a few SDs beyond the average response? One possible impact is that the random intercept predicts a large unobserved latent response for them, so that their contribution to the analysis is downweighted significantly. Are you using a logistic link or a linear link for your GLMM? You might also consider using a GEE to assess the reliability of the mixed model results. These handle the correlation structure in a slightly different way. In some ways, they make better use of outlying observations by not-so-dramatically downweighting their contribution to the estimated average and standard error.
