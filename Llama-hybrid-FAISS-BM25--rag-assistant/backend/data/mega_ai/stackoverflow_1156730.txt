You should probably not use raw GUIDs as your primary key. Doing so leads to substantial fragmentation of your data. SQL Server has a function to give you a "sequential guid" to help mitigate this problem. There is a good discussion of this topic in depth here . Another excellent discussion of that is here ... This shows the amount of fragmentation for random guids is very significant (It is recomended that "Fragmentation in Percent" should be as near to zero as possible). The number of pages used by random guid is 40% higher and the amount of space used on each page is less, therefore the disc space required will increase.
