Maybe this is just personal preference but I find that hard to read and would write it as = @portfolio_queued.each do |artist| %p artist.name %br artist.status Also, again personal preference - using paragraph tags for something that isn't a block of text is perceived as poor SEO/CSS; a span, div or table cell might be better.
