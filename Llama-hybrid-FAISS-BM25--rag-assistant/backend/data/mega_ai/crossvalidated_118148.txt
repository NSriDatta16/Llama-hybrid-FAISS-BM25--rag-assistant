If two classes come from the same distribution, then yes, separate PCAs should yield similar results. But the opposite is not true! PCA analyzes covariance structure of the data, which means that it ignores the mean . So the two classes can be 100% linearly separated (leading to 100% classification accuracy with a linear method), but still have identical within-class covariances, e.g.: Therefore your approach does not seem to make a lot of sense.
