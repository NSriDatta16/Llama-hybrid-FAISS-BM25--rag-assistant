Last time I needed a board, I just created a two-dimensional array of user-controls, gave each user control a border, and had their paint method draw anything on the inside of the board. You can have your board user control and your game piece user control be separate objects or the same object, depending on what you are doing. This strategy will take only a few hours to do, and gives you a lot of power. For example, it is easy to add features to recognize things like drag/drop, clicking, etc. Another way to create a game board is to just use a DataGridView . That's really not the intended use of that class and the code for that will get a little bit ugly, but if you write a wrapper around it it probably won't be too bad.
