data science / machine learning resources?

In a few weeks I'm starting a new job that will be involved in machine learning and data science. I have a masters degree in probability / mathematics but I have no knowledge of machine learning and data science. Are there any online resources like courses or books that could help me prepare for my new job? Basically I'm trying to get a head start on my new job. Right now the only things I really know related to this fields are regression methods like linear regression and logistic regression, and I have a decent grasp of mathematical concepts so I'd prefer something that is not totally dumbed-down
