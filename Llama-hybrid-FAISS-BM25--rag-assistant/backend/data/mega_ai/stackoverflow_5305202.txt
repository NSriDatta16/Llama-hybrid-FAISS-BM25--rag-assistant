The JPA provider is supposed to handle low level connection details like the ones you are talking about. In JPA you can limit the number of rows returned by calling the setMaxResults() method on the Query interface. You can then use the setFirstResult() to page through the result set at runtime. The Postgres dialect implementation in EclipseLink is responsible for doing the best it can to make the communication with the postgres as effective as possible. http://download.oracle.com/javaee/5/api/javax/persistence/Query.html
