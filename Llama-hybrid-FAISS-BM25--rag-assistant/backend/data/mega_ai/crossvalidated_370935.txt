I'm not sure if this is what you're asking, but from the practical side, you can check for heteroscedasticity of the residuals in logistic regression models with DHARMa , and you can correct it, e.g., with glmmTMB . The fact that you will never be 100% sure if you have the right model is inherent to any applied statistical problem. It is a problem for sure, but I don't see that the issue of heteroscedasticity is more problematic than any other misspecification problem (though it is probably less frequently checked). EDIT - due to the comments, here an example how to diagnose the model misspecification in DHARMa set.seed(12345) dat $error error $x)) dat$ y 0) + 0 fit $x,seq(0,1,0.02)) dat$ sizegroup = cut(dat$x,unique(qnt),include.lowest=TRUE) res2 = recalculateResiduals(res , group = dat $sizegroup) testDispersion(res2) plot(res2) plotResiduals(1:nlevels(dat$ sizegroup), res2$scaledResiduals)
