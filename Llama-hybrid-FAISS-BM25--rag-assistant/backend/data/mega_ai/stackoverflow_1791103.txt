Drag-and-drop accordion panels? (ASP.Net)

I have a set of accordion panes(dynamically created) contained in an Accordion control. Basically, what I am wanting is for the user to be capable of dragging these accordion panels so that instead of A pane B pane C pane They can drag and drop it to be something like B pane A pane C pane Or whatever. Also, more importantly, I would need to be able to detect that they have changed the order. Would there be a way to have it when they "drop" the pane that it can update a hidden field or something? I don't need a postback on every single drag and drop, but rather I want for when they hit a save button for the server application to detect the order in which the panes are so that it can save this order. I would prefer to stay away from javascript libraries, but if it would be the easiest way, then I'll consider it.
