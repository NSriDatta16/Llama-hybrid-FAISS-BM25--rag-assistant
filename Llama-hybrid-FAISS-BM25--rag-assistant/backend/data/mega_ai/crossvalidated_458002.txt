Yes, you should do a conversion. You’re effectively measuring your LSTM in feet and your other modes in meters (or miles and kilometers). The comparison is not fair. So LSTM has an error of 6 and ARIMA an error of 7...if the units aren’t the same (they’re not) then you cannot say which is performing better. This has nothing to do with LSTM or neural networks. If you did yet another ARIMA mode but with scaled data, you would have to do some kind of conversion. (I am assuming you’ve scaled your response variable. Since you’re considering an autoregression, it seems like you have just a univariate time series that you’ve scaled, meaning that you’ve scaled the response variable. I think you know this, but I want this comment here for someone coming by and getting confused.)
