Polynomial kernel function

Consider SMV with the polynomial kernel $k(x_1,x_2)=(\langle x_1, x_2\rangle + 1)^d,$ where $d > 1.$ Is it true that if the dataset is separated with a hyperplane then the SVM (with the kernel $k$) always separates the dataset with a hyperplane (without any errors in the dataset)?
