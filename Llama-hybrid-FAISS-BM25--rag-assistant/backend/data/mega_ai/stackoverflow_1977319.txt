Unfortunately, right now, it seems to be limited to local disk volumes only :-( See this article at Simple-Talk: An Introduction to SQL Server FileStream Towards the end of the article, there's a section on FILESTREAM Limitations which has one point: * FILESTREAM data can be stored only on local disk volumes From what I've been reading, a SAN (Storage Area Network) could possibly be used for FILESTREAM storage, but not other forms of storage systems. For 10 TByte, I would assume you're planning on a SAN anyway, right? Also see this other Stackoverflow question (and the answers for it) on the topic.
