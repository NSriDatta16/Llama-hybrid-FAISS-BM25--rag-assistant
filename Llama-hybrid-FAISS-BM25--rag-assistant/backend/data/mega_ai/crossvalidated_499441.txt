Having a special unknown token is a common practice regardless of whether you work with words or characters. However, note that the model needs to learn how to handle the unknown characters. If any unknown character never appears in the training data, its embedding will end up randomly initialized and the model will behave randomly if such a character appears at inference time. So what you want to do is either exclude some infrequent characters from the training data from the vocabulary or sample the unknown symbols randomly at the places of some infrequent characters.
