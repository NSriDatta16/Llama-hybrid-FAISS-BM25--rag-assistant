I agree with @Nick Cox. This figure is pretty, but doesn't seem very good to me except as eye candy. In essence, this is a Sankey plot (a.k.a., river plot or flow diagram) with just two levels where the ends have been bent into semicircles. If you're married to that, I would use a Sankey plot where the ends have not been bent into semicircles for easier readability. You can see an example of a Sankey plot (in R) in my answer to Chart suggestions for data flow . Apparently these can be made in Python using matplotlib . However, I think you would do better to use a mosaic plot or a biplot from a correspondence analysis . I have an example of a mosaic plot in my answer to What's the best way to visualize the effects of categories & their prevalence in logistic regression? , and an example of plotting the results of a correspondence analysis in my answer to Which is the best visualization for contingency tables? Both mosaic plots and correspondence analyses can also be plotted with Python.
