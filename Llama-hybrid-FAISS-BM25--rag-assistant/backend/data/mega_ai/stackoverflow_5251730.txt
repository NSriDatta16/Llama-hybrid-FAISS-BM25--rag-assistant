Some nitpicks I found #include : in this program you need , , and magic numbers: use enum or #define rather than sprinking your source with "magic numbers" pay attention to buffer overflows when using scanf and check return value style: prefer '\n' at end of output: printf("...\n") vs printf("\n...") try not to repeat the strcmp s Compile with warning level pushed to the MAX, and try to get rid of all warnings.
