How to combine two measurements at different scales without affecting outliers

I have two set of measurements with different scale: Unemployment: range (1000 - 100,000) Unemployment growth in a year: range (0 -100) I want to see the combine effect of these two measurements. Kind of an unemployment index. My first idea was to normalise the values in both measurement sets using the min-max formula. Then taking the average of the normalised/scaled values. However, min-max scaling would affect the outliers in the sets. Isnt it ? Another approach i was thinking was to calculate the z-score. Then determine the percentile from z -score. And averaging the percentiles for both set. Can anyone suggest a better way to combine measurements with different scale ?
