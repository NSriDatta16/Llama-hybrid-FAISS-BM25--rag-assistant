Does random effects account for covariates not included in my regression model?

I am using a (Bayesian-based) mixed-effects regression model that incorporates both fixed effects and random effects.I have 3 fixed effects/covariates: 1) employment rate 2) crime rate 3) home ownership rate. I have 2 questions: 1) Suppose we assume, I have only 2 covariates available: 1) employment rate 2) crime rate. That is, we assume covariate 3) home ownership rate was not available for whatever reason to be included in my regression. Would the use of random effect terms in my model account for the influence of unavailable covariates such as home ownership rate? 2) Would the exclusion of home ownership from the model (which we assume is relevant/significant to the dependent variable) make my interpretation of my results unreliable/misleading or would the inclusion of random effects handle this problem of excluded covariates and a potential 'incorrect'/unsound model. ( *NOTE : by ' results ' I am referring to the influence/impact of regression coefficients from the 2 other variables: employment rate and crime rate on my dependent/outcome variable*)
