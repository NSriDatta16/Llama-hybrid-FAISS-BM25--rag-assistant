Understanding Support Vector Machine Algorithm

I understand the SVM classifying algorithm in my book given the assumptions. My book says, suppose we have these two lines passing through the support vectors of the two classes. They then give the minimizing generalization error argument and proceed to make maximize the margin between the lines passing through the support vectors. What I do not understand, is how to get the original two lines passing through the support vectors of the two classes? These lines are really defined by the support vectors. When implementing the algorithm, how do you pick the support vectors? What is commonly done in practice or in many libraries? EDIT: What I meant by 'original two lines' is the decision boundary lines. Thanks for all the help!
