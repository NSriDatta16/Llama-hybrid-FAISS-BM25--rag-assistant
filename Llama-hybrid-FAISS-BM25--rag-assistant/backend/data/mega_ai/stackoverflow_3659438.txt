Embedding page in sharepoint webpart

I need to create webpart in sharepoint 2010 which will allow me to view page from specific URL. I.E. I'd like to view http://google.com from this webpart. What's the simpliest way to accomplish that ? I'm totally novice to Sharepoint developement, I've just downloaded SDK and watched some screencasts about creating webparts. Also I'd like to have few of this webparts on one page. Maybe there is another and better way than creating a webpart ?
