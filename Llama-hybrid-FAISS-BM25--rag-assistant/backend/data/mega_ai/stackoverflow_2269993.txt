It's hard to give a definitive answer on this. Haskell has the advantages that Don mentioned along with having a more powerful type system and cleaner syntax. OCaml will be easier to learn if you coming from almost any other language (this is because Haskell is as function as functional languages get), and working with mutable random access structures can be a little clunky in Haskell. You will also likely find the performance characteristics of your OCaml code more intuitive than Haskell because of Haskell's lazy evaluation. Really, I would recommend you evaluate both if you have the time. Here are some relevant Haskell resources: http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hslibsvm http://hackage.haskell.org/package/HSvm Real World Haskell : this is a great freely available book for Haskell Learn You a Haskell : this tutorial is just plain fun to read Oh, if you look further into Haskell be sure to sign up for the Haskell Beginners and Haskell Cafe lists. The community is friendly and eager to help out newcomers (is my bias showing?).
