I don't see a problem with the solution you've already come up with, but I figured I'd mention that using a combination of the ":not" and ":first" selectors you can more directly get the desired result you're looking for: $(".sortable").sortable({ connectWith: ".sortable", cancel: '.no-drag', items: 'li:not(:first)' }); Alternately, you could use the "gt" selector to specify all list items of a greater index than 0: $(".sortable").sortable({ connectWith: ".sortable", cancel: '.no-drag', items: 'li:gt(0)' }); I'm sure there are plenty other ways of going about it as well.
