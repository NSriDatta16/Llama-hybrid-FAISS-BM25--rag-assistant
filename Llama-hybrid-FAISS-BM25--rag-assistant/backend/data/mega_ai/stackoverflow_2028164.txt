How do I search through regex matches in Python?

I need to try a string against multiple (exclusive - meaning a string that matches one of them can't match any of the other) regexes, and execute a different piece of code depending on which one it matches. What I have currently is: m = firstre.match(str) if m: # Do something m = secondre.match(str) if m: # Do something else m = thirdre.match(str) if m: # Do something different from both Apart from the ugliness, this code matches against all regexes even after it has matched one of them (say firstre), which is inefficient. I tried to use: elif m = secondre.match(str) but learnt that assignment is not allowed in if statements. Is there an elegant way to achieve what I want?
