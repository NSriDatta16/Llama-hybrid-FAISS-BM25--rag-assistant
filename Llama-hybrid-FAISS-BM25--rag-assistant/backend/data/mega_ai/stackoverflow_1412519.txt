Reasons are addressed by Mayo - but to answer the other question: No, it is absolutely not safe to ignore the issues unless you have a very clear understanding of why they arise at which point you may be able to choose to not worry about them (although I'd probably not be particularly happy to have to so do). There are reasons why it may not be practical but pragmatically I require that we can pull a project from version control, build and run and it more or less should run pretty much as live (there are a few caveats about meeting requirements for installed stuff and any necessary config) - certainly I'd expect the appearence to be right.
