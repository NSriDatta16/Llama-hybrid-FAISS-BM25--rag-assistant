Add the code below in between uc.connect(); and uc.getInputStream(); : uc = url.openConnection(); uc.addRequestProperty("User-Agent", "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0)"); However, it a nice idea to just allow certain types of user agents. This will keep your website safe and bandwidth usage low. Some possible bad 'User Agents' you might want to block from your server depending if you don't want people leeching your content and bandwidth. But, user agent can be spoofed as you can see in my example above.
