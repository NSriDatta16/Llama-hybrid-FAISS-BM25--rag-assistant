Which is the best method for Neural Network Layers in Keras

In keras we can create neural network layers in many ways. 1. Sequential API . for example model=sequential() 2. Functional for example x1=Input(shape=(2,) x2=Dense(2)(x1) 3. Subclassing for example class Mymodel(keras.layers.Layers): def __init__(self,output): My Question is: 1. Whether which one to use and their pros and cons.
