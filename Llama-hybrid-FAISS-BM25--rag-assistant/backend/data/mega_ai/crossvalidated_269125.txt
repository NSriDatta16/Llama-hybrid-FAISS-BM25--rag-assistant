Expected value of a sum of pulses

Given a sample function X(t) of a random process as \begin{equation} X(t) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} {[\mathcal{H}(t-nT-to) - \mathcal{H}(t-nT-to-T/2)]} \end{equation} where A and B are constants, and to is uniformly distributed from 0 to T. The process is an ergodic one since it is an ensemble of pulse functions with a random variable as time origin (to). How one could evaluate its expected value without arguing that it is an ergodic process (and so evaluate its time averaging)?
