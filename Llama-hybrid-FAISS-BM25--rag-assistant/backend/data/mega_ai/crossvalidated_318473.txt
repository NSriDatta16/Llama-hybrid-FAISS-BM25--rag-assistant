How to run logistic regression accurately

I am interested in understanding the specific relationships between an dependent variable (low birthweight), which is binary and various independent variables (which are also binary). So far, the way I have been doing the logistic regression is to run the regression with low birthweight and all of the independent variables. My question is: Is running the regression with all of the variables the same as running the regression with each independent variables one by one? I ran both of them (one by one, and all at once) and I received different coefficients. So which one is more accurate?
