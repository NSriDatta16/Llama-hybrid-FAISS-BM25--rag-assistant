I can think of a few reasons you might want to do something like this. Perhaps you want to leverage some of the non-db-related methods on ActiveRecord or you want to pass your object to something that expects and ActiveRecord instance. Without more info, it is impossible to say whether the choice to use AR here is correct or incorrect. In any event, if you want to continue on this path... check out this Railscast http://railscasts.com/episodes/121-non-active-record-model and also checkout this gem: http://github.com/kennethkalmer/activerecord-tableless-models/tree/master
