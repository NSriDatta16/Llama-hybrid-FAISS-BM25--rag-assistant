I think random forests are still mostly used in the form they were introduced by Breiman in his 2001 paper. There have been some attempts to improve them by e.g. moving beyond majority voting ( http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-30115-8_34 ), but my impression that this stuff isn't main-stream practice. You can find a good recent review of random forests in Elements of Statistical Learning ( http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/ ). The datasets used by Breiman can be found at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/ . These datasets are well known classics. The downside is that they are not very large compared to some other datasets out there. That being said, I think the UCI datasets are a great place to start your investigations. Finally - I think there's still a lot of good work to be done on random forests; the field is far from complete. Good luck!
