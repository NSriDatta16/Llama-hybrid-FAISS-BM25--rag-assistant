What I don't understand is why aren't the values stored with the key (string, number, whatever) as the, well, key And how do you implement that? Computers know only numbers. A hash table is a table , i.e. an array and when we get right down to it, an array can only addressed via an integral nonnegative index. Everything else is trickery. Dynamic languages that let you use string keys – they use trickery. And one such trickery, and often the most elegant, is just computing a numerical, reproducible “hash” number of the key and using that as the index. (There are other considerations such as compaction of the key range but that’s the foremost issue.)
