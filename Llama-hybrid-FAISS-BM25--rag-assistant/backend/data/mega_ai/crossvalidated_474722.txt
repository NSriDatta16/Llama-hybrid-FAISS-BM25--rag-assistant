Interpretation of sampling distribution as the main distinction between Bayesian and classical statistics (Leamer)

In Hendry et al. (1990) p. 187-188, Edward Leamer says: To me the essential difference between the Bayesian and a classical point of view is not that the parameters are treated as random variables, but rather that the sampling distributions are treated as subjective distributions or characterizations of states of mind . Thus, I can compound those with a subjective prior distribution. Nobody is going to object that there exists a subjective prior distribution, but people will object that this prior distribution can be multiplied by a sampling distribution, which some people think of as characterizing a "natural process." To me they both reflect states of mind. And by "states of mind" what I mean is the opinion that it is useful for me to operate as if the data were generated in a certain way. (Emphasis is mine.) To me the distinction Leamer makes is counterintuitive. I think (based on the context within the article) it addresses the question of whether we should believe in the existence of a true, immutable data generating process. I had not heard this mentioned discussing essential differences between Bayesians and classical statisticians before. But this was said 30 years ago. Questions: Is Leamer's point salient among the Bayesians? Has it ever been salient? References: Hendry, D. F., Leamer, E. E., & Poirier, D. J. (1990).
