You should try lots of models. The 'no free lunch' theorem states that there is no one best model - every situation is different. Logistic regression for example is desirable when it works because parameters are very interpretable. Random forests are great because they can deal with very difficult patterns, but forget about interpreting them. The point is - never stick to just one approach.
