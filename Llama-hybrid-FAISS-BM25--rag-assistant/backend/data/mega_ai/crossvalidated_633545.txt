In general, the term "representative sample" is ill-defined. There are many different, conflicting meanings people intend when they use that term, and so it's not terribly helpful. For example, some people mean that the survey was conducted with random sampling with a 100% response rate, while others mean that the demographics of respondents look similar to the population. Those two definitions of representative have very different implications for the quality of estimates based on the sample. The following StackExchange post discusses this point a bit further: https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/229213/94994 The survey methods literature has a couple of terms that are helpful to know about for digging into the literature related to your problem. "Coverage error" : This refers to systematic error in survey estimates caused by drawing samples from a sampling frame which differs from the population of interest. This seems to be one of the problems you're facing. "Non-probability sampling" : This broad term refers to sampling methods where each member of the population has an unknown probability of being included in the sample. Volunteer web panels are a very common source of survey data, and they are typically subject to coverage error: for example, they systematically exclude people without internet access or digital literacy skills. But data from such panels are also often viewed as non-probability samples, both because the samples drawn from such panels are often done using non-probability sampling (e.g., quota sampling of panel members to invite to take a particular survey) and because the panels themselves can be viewed as a non-probability samples from the population. So in general, it's helpful to use methods from the non-probability sampling literature to work with such data. Pew Research published a nice accessible explanation of non-probability surveys here: https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2018/08/06/what-are-nonprobability-surveys/ This fairly recent paper in the Journal of Survey Statistics and Methodology provides a nice overview of approaches for estimation from non-probability samples: Cornesse et al. "A Review of Conceptual Approaches and Empirical Evidence on Probability and Nonprobability Sample Survey Research."
