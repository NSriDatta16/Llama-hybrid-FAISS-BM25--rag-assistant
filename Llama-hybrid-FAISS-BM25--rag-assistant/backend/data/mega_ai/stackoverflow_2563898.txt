How can I get access to the positions of pairs of vertices? You can't do that simply if you are just using a vertex and a fragment shader. Easy way is to use geometry shaders . Inside this shader stage you can have access to the pair of vertices that compose your line segment. Then it's straightforward to determine the line orientation and pass it to the fragment shader. If geometry shader is not an option (because of your target audience) you could duplicate your geometry (storing in each vertex the actual vertex plus the next vertex) and then do the computation in the vertex shader.
