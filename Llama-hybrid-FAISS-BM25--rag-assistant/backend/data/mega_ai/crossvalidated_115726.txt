Regression produces a high coefficient of determination, but also a high MSE

I've ran several regression models on a dataset (the SEER cancer dataset). I'm trying to use regression to calculate how many months a cancer patient can expect to live. Each record consists of around 20 features, such as tumor size, race, etc. The training data includes the months each patient lives, which I use to train the regressor. I split the dataset into train and held out test sets, but I'm observing something interesting. I'm getting a high, satisfactory $R^2$ (scikit learn score function), but also a high MSE. My code (for one of the algorithms I used) is below alldata = pd.read_csv('alldata.csv') cols = [col for col in alldata.columns if col not in ['Survival months', 'Survived']] X = alldata[cols].values y = alldata["Survival months"].values Xr, Xt, yr, yt = train_test_split(X, y, random_state=6131997) rfr = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=2000, oob_score=True, n_jobs=-1) rfr = rfr.fit(Xr, yr) ypred = rfr.predict(Xt) acc = rfr.score(Xt, yt) print mean_squared_error(yt, ypred) print rfr.oob_score_ print acc scores = cross_val_score(rfr, Xr, yr, cv=10) print scores print("Accuracy: %0.2f (+/- %0.2f)" % (scores.mean(), scores.std()*2)) The output: 76.9924308448 (MSE) 0.899907201044 (oob score) 0.894280365688 (score / R^2 / coefficient of determination) [ 0.9027185 0.89860441 0.90686577 0.90264802 0.90139131 0.90345359 0.89532146 0.89681607 0.90167825 0.89130112] (10 fold crossvalidation outputs) Accuracy: 0.90 (+/- 0.01) (average of the crossvalidation outputs, and their stdev) How can the regression model correlate with the data 90% of the time, yet have such a high MSE? That's around 8.8 months of error on average with the prediction. I'm quite new to regression, so I may be interpreting the MSE incorrectly. Could you give your opinion on my results: are they satisfactory or not, and by what metric / why did you choose that metric? The data includes patients that had survival times ranging from 0 months to 70 months and beyond; 8.8 months seems like a significant amount to be off.
