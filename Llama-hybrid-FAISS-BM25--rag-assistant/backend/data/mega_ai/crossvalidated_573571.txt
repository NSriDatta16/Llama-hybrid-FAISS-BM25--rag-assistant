Multiple mediators and interaction effects- causal mediation effect

Assume we have a structural equation system with treatment $T,$ mediator $1$ (discrete) and mediator $2$ (continuous). We write this as: $$ Y=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}M_{1}+\beta_{2}M_{2}+\beta_{3}TM_{2}+\beta_{3}T+\epsilon $$ $$ M_{1}=\alpha+\alpha_{1}T+v $$ $$ M_{2}=\gamma+\gamma_{1}T+e $$ For $M_{1},$ the causal mediation effect is easy to obtain- $\alpha_{1}\beta_{1}.$ However, given that we have an interaction effect with $M_{2}$ , would the causal mediation effect be: $$ \gamma_{1}\beta_{2}+\gamma_{1}\beta_{3}M_{2} $$ If this is the case, would a ``reasonable'' estimate of the causal mediation effect be: $$ \gamma_{1}\beta_{2}+\gamma_{1}\beta_{3}\mathbb{E}\left[M_{2}\right] $$ where we take the average value of $M_{2}?$
