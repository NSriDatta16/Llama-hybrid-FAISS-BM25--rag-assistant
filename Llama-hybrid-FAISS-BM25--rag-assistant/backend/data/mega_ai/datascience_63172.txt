Converting Text Entries into values for machine learning - KNN

Consider the following dataset. | Area | Job Type | Complete | ------------------------------- | AAA | Install | N | | AAB | Repair A | Y | | OOC | Repair C | Y | | LCX | Cease | N | ------------------------------- I am using JavaScript (Started getting into Tensorflow.js amongs other ML algorithms and theories.) and I am struggling to find a suitable ML method to process this. There could be over 100 areas and over 15 Job Types, but Complete can only be Y/N. I was thinking about assigning a number to each case as follows AAA -> 1 | Install -> 1 | Y -> 1 AAB -> 2 | Repair A -> 2 | N -> 0 OOC -> 3 | Repair C -> 3 | LCX -> 4 | Cease -> 4 | ... -> x | Is this viable? would it work? I want to give it another case and return the % chance of that case happening. I have tried to use Naive Bayes classifier and has some success. ------------------------------- | LCX | Cease | 10% | ------------------------------- This is just a small sample there are other x's that I want to include that are a mix of floating points and other String Values. the whole main data-set contains over 40 million entries and over 40 possible columns that could be a factor that effects 'completed' so plenty of training data to go around! What would the best method be what approach would you recommend?
