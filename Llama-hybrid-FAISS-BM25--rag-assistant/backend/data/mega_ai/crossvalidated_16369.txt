Simulation of an exponentially distributed variable

A one-period jump diffusion model of a stock is the following: given the stock value at $T0$, $S(T0)$, the stock value at time $T$, $S(T) = S(T0)exp(x)exp(y)$. Given the inputs $m$, $s$, $pup$, $pdown$ and $\lambda$, and: x is normally distributed with mean m and standard deviation s y equals 0 with probability 1 – pup – pdown (i.e. no jump). y is positive with probability pup; if it is positive , y is exponentially distributed with density p(y) = λexp(-λy) for y > 0. y is negative with probability pdown; if it is negative, y is exponentially distributed with p(y) = λexp(λy) for y x and y are uncorrelated & independent. I am to write a MATLAB program that siumulates the stock prices. Two random numbers per trial are required: A uniformly distributed random number that determines if a jump has occurred An exponentially distributed random number that determines the size of the jump I've transormed a uniform random variable to an exponential variable using $-ln(1 - U(a, b)) / \lambda$. Where I'm confused is how we're using the uniformly distributed random number that determines if a jump has occurred given I am given pup and pdown. Also, why do I need an exponentially distributed random number for the jump size. I thought I just integrate the pdf? For some reason I struggle mightily with the exponential distribution.
