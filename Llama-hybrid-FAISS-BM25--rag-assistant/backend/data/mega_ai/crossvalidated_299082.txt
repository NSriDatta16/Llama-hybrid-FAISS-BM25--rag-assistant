Whenever we fit or train a model, there are several assumption which are made. One of the major assumptions made is that the data belongs to a certain distribution (Normal/Poisson/Binomial). Moreover, the noise present in the dataset is also assumed to follow a certain distribution. If you really want to generate new data, fit a distribution on the negative data. Pick random points from the distribution and add random noise following the distribution to each point. Having said the above, generating new data just to have class balance has very little advantage. This is due to the fact that class imbalance does not effect regression models like logistic regression: International Journal of Forecasting. "Instance sampling in credit scoring: An empirical study of sample size and balancing". Moreover, in ML methods like Support Vector Machines which only look at the boundary training examples, the added data does not really improve anything. Finally even if you are able to generate data by either the method you mentioned above or the method I mentioned, it would still contain the information present in the data you already had, and will follow the same distribution as the data you already had. Hence this new data will not improve the performance of the your model.
