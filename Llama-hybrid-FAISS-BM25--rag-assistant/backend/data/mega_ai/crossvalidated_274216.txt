Removing outliers through averaging?

Is it okay to remove outliers by averaging the data set? Say we have a response $Y$ for every day, and $Y$ ITSELF is an average. Some days happen to give outlier responses. This makes analysis hard, but we do not really want to delete the outliers. So, can we "average" them out? For example, the data might be "average time per day spent eating". Some days, there might be some outliers that we want to deal with before fitting the model. So, we take two consecutive days, take the responses, and then average them. Then, the response is "average time spent eating for this two-day period". Is this ok? If I do this, do I only do it for the outlier-responses, or do I transform all data like this?
