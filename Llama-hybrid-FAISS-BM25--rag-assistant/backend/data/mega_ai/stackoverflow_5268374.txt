This is waaaaay oversimplified, but on a general level, all of the layout panels are more "div" like, vs. the original panels being organized in tables. So, when you want to do predictable stuff across disparate screen sizes, etc., the layout stuff does what you've come to expect. So definitely use them over all else. In fact, if you're trying to use GWT for the ease of writing in Java and ignoring web design, use as many FlowPanels with css as possible.
