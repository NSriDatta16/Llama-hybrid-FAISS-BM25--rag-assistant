The way I understand LOOCV is like this: You want to fit your model to the data, but you also want it to not 'overfit' that is you want to also be able to generalize your model to data not in your data set. It is hard to get an estimate of how well your model is doing by testing it on the data that generated the model. Therefore you fit your data on a subset of your data ($n-1$ data points for LOOCV). This will give you an estimate of your parameters ($\hat{a}, \hat{b}$, and $\hat{c}$ in your model). Then you test your model on the remaining variables (the one you left out). From this fit you can get some kind of measure of how poorly you fit to this one data point. You repeat this for every data point in your data (without removing anything). Then you plot the measure of error against all of these iterations. The parameter estimates that produed the lowest error would be your LOOCV estimated parameters. These measures of error should then be averaged to get an appropriate estimate of how well your model fits data.
