following on from my other post... I have a table that uses two fields to make a primary key... TravelEventID RemarkNo Keyword Text 0001 1 TVL LOWCOST BOOKING 0001 2 TVL CREDIT CARD USED 0001 3 PSG COST CENTRE REQUIRED 0001 4 PSG EMPLOYEE NUM REQUIRED 0002 1 TVL CREDIT CARD USED 0002 2 AGT BOOKED BY AGENT 0002 3 AGT CONFIRM WITH AIRLINE 0002 4 TVL LOWEST FARE CONFIRMED 0002 5 TVL NO CANCELLATION CHARGE 0003 1 TVL LOWCOST BOOKING 0003 2 TVL CARRIER : EASYJET 0003 3 TVL LOWEST FARE CONFIRMED 0004 1 TVL LOWCOST BOOKING 0004 2 TVL CREDIT CARD USED I need to extract the TravelEventID where the Text does not contain LOWCOST BOOKING. I.E from the example table I would want only 0002. I try and perform a query where Text <> 'LOWCOST BOOKING' however that obviously matches on most of the rows and as a result I get back all the TravelEventIDs. Hope I've explained myself well! Cheers Darren
