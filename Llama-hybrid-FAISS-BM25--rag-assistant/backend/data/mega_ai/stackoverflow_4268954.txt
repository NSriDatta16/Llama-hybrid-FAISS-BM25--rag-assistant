array_merge is the elegant way: $a = array('a', 'b'); $b = array('c', 'd'); $merge = array_merge($a, $b); // $merge is now equals to array('a','b','c','d'); Doing something like: $merge = $a + $b; // $merge now equals array('a','b') Will not work, because the + operator does not actually merge them. If they $a has the same keys as $b , it won't do anything.
