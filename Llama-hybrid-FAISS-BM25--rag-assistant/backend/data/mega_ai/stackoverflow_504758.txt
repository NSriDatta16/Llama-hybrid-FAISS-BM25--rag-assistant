You need to add an event listener o the loader first so that you know when the load is complete. So from your code snippet i would suggest something like var request:URLRequest = new URLRequest(file); loader.addEventListener(Event.COMPLETE, function(event : Event) : void { var swfTimeline:MovieClip = loader.content as MovieClip; swfTimeline.nextFrame(); }); loader.load(request); Lots of different ways to organise this code but that should do the trick
