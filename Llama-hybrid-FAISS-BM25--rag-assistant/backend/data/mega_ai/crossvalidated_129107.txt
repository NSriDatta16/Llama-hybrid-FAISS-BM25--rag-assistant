Forecasting product of two time series with correlation

I am trying to forecast the product two time series. That is, given $\{x_t\}_{t=0}^{T-1}, \{y_t\}_{t=0}^{T-1}$, forecast $x_T\cdot y_T$. The two time series have minimal but nontrivial correlation ~0.1. I can apply standard time series forecasting techniques individually and then multiply two independent forecasts but that seems to introduce a lot of bias due to the correlation. What is standard practice in this case? The data can be assumed to be stationary.
