C# using Excel Interop Updating Formulas

I have a C# application that builds Excel files from an existing template. On the template I want to have my row totals/averages in place and to update to however many rows are inserted by the application (Between the header and footer rows). This should be simple but I am drawing a blank in trying to remember how to do such a thing.
