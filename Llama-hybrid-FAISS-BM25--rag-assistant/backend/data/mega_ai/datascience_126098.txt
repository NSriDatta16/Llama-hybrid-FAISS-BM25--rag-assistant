There are a couple of approaches you can use for this. The first involves using regular expressions and some string manipulation to extract the relevant details. This can only work if the layout of the document is simple and the types of layout are not too diverse. The second more robust and accurate approach is to use AI to extract the details. This approach involves 2 components. One is the OCR Engine and the second is a Deep Learning model . First you have to extract all the text present in the document using the OCR Engine. After extracting the text, feed the text to a Deep Learning model (you'll have to train the model on your custom data first!), so that the model can extract the required details. I have delivered multiple similar projects and in my opinion the best approach is to combine both the approaches (kind of a hybrid approach) to get the maximum accuracy. Cheers!
