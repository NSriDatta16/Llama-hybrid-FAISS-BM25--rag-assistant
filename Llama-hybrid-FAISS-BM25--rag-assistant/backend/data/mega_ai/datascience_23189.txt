K-Means is an algorithm primarily used to find clusters in higher dimensional datasets. I have never come across K-Means being used for single dimensional datasets. So, a 2D K-Means (or even higher dimensional) works this way: Decide the number of clusters you want (k value). Initialize k number of random 2D (or higher dimensional) points (centroids). Each point in your dataset gets assigned the centroid it lies closest to. The centroid positions then gets updated to the average of all points that were assigned the said centroid. Repeat from step 3 till stopping condition reached. And for your second question, yes, that is a correct method, and the answer to that question is correctly explained.
