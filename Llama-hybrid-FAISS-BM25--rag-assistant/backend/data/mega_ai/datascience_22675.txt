You have asked about any pointers. What about applying some basic/intermediate probability theory? If you already have the probabilities that a machine fails, you can use the Geometric Distribution to calculate the probabilites that a machine fails on the next day. For a machine that breaks with 10% probability on a single day: (This example is using R's built-in pgeom() function) # probability that the machine breaks on 5th day or earlier pgeom(4, 0.1) # 0.4095 # probability that the machine is still working on 20th day 1 - pgeom(19, 0.1) # 0.1216 Maybe you can use an educated guess for your probabilities as a baseline model for more sophisticated neural network models.
