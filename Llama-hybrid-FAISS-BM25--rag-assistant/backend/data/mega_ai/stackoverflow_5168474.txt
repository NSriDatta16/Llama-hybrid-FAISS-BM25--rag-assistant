In iOS the class for a progress bar is UIProgressView . If you really wanted to add a UIButton to a UIProgressBar (as in the question title). Then you can use the UIView method addSubView: For example: UIButtonWithProgress* button = [[UIButtonWithProgress alloc] init]; UIProgressView* progressView = [[UIProgressView alloc] init]; [button addSubview:progressView]; progressView.progress = 0.5; I think what you really want to do is create your own UIControl (so you should subclass that instead). You can override the method drawRect: to use quartz to draw your own progress bar animation, and the touchesBegan:withEvent: to detect the user tapping on your custom control, as well as adding any other methods you wish to control the state of the control (such as the progress level). Note: In my code example I also give an example of correctly setting the progress of the UIProgressBar, just in case you were unclear.
