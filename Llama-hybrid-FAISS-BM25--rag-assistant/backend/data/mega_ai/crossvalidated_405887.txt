Terminology: Is DTW considered to be machine learning or signal processing?

The DTW Wikipedia article puts this method in the category "Machine learning algorithms". On the other hand, the famous paper " Dynamic Programming Algorithm Optimization for Spoken Word Recognition " was published in IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing, indicating that DTW might have been considered a signal processing algorithm by the authors. Admittedly, the term machine learning might not have been as common in 1978 as it is today but I still wonder the following: Is DTW considered to be a machine learning algorithm or a signal processing algorithm?
