It seems me that the interpretation of structural equation models (SEM) in econometrics is matters of debate. Judea Pearl strongly defends the causal interpretation of SEM, and of its parameters. For example you can read: The Causal Foundations of Structural Equation Modeling - Pearl (2012) . The distinction between SIM (simultaneous equation model) and SEM is artificial even if, literally speaking, SEM can be considered a broader class. The term SIM is widely used in economics but unfortunately the role of such a model is ambiguous. In Pearl's opinion, SIM is a terminological strategy for remove/obscure causal meaning at SEM (page 3). In his opinion, SEM must be carried out such that it always has a clear causal meaning. SIM are not thinked for forecasting, Indeed VAR ( vector autoregression ) born precisely with the idea of a system, useful for forecasting, that avoid economic/structural/causal thinking. SIM bring us to speak about structural form and reduced form . Please, if you know one econometrics textbook or serious article that speak about SIM without this distinction let me know. Reduced form, per se, carried out only correlational/regression meaning but via identification we achieve structural one. Surely structural meaning go beyond correlational one (in broad sense, not necessarily linear) but if the structural meaning is not causal It is not clear what it is. Moreover SIM share his math and logic with SVAR ( structural VAR). Even if the in the SVAR some lags are usually added we can consider SVAR like a restyling/extension for SIM; but the mentioned ambiguities remain. Time series context is also related, see my question here: About the meaning of ARMA parameters
