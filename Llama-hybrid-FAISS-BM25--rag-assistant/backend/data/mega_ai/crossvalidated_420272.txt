I've found this paragraph in wiki , which directly answers my question. For example, for a 95% CI and sample size N=100, sample SD lies from 0.88 × SD to 1.16 × SD So, to find N all I need is to choose what difference from real SD I can let and how confident I want to be. Here's a full answer, if the wiki will be updated: The standard deviation we obtain by sampling a distribution is itself not absolutely accurate, both for mathematical reasons (explained here by the confidence interval) and for practical reasons of measurement (measurement error). The mathematical effect can be described by the confidence interval or CI. To show how a larger sample will make the confidence interval narrower, consider the following examples: A small population of N = 2 has only 1 degree of freedom for estimating the standard deviation. The result is that a 95% CI of the SD runs from 0.45 × SD to 31.9 × SD; the factors here are as follows:
