Text classification with small dataset for a specialized domain

I have a multiclass text classification problem where I have very few documents for each class. The classes are imbalanced but I want to be able to predict the class when I have at least 200 - 300 documents. What methods do you suggest? Also the documents are from a specialized domain so I dont think transfer learning will work. Would you recommend word embeddings when working with specialized domain text?
