You don't mention what web framework you are using, but if you are using ASP.Net, you can assign objects to the Application object or the Session object, which will hold information across the application between requests, and across all requests from an individual user respectively. If you are asking in a general way, and I suspect you are as this is marked subjective+discussion, then you can try using a cookie to hold the variable across all requests for a user. As for holding some value for all users, you should have a look at the web framework you are using. You have options such as storing something in a file that is accessible at each request, through to storing something in the equivalent of the Application object of ASP.Net. I'm sorry if I'm being too pragmatic here, but it's late where I live :).
