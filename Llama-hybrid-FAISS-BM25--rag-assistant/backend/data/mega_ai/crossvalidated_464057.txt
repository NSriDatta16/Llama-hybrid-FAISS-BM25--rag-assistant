It's hard to say without a concrete example as the details may depend on both the data and the variable importance measure. Possible reasons could include: A cross-table between the response and a predictor assesses the marginal effect. However, in a random forest you can also capture more complex patterns involving other regressors as well. Possibly, there is a good surrogate variable for B but not A among the other predictors. Possibly, A has more categories than B which might be "penalized" more in a significance test compared to a variable importance measure.
