First of all you won't be able to achieve this in design-time by simply adding a select query. You cannot parametrize the schema. However there's a solution for this.Here's how you can do that. 1.) Drag and drop the table into your typed-dataset designer which will create a typed-data-table for the table and the table-adapter to access database table . table adapter is aware of the schema of the data-table. 2.) Now create a stored-procedure in your database that takes two arguments . one is the schema of the table [?.ModuleVariable] and other would be your where clause or maybe anytihng you may want as criteria. You can create overloads of this as you wish. This stored-procedure will then construct the sql query based on the arguments and execute it on the database. This will return the result-set to calling table-adapter . 3.) From the design-view Add a method to table-adapter which will fetch results from the stored-procedure. Make sure that the schema of results exactly meets the schema of the associated data-table . 4.) Now from the code you can create an instance of the table adapter and call the method which in turn will call your stored-procedure and return you with the data-table filled in with results . Have fun!
