Weka contains two meta-classifiers of interest: weka.classifiers.meta.CostSensitiveClassifier weka.classifiers.meta.MetaCost They allows you to make any algorithm cost-sensitive (not restricted to SVM) and to specify a cost matrix (penalty of the various errors); you would give a higher penalty for misclassifying 1 instances as 0 than you would give for erroneously classifying 0 as 1 . The result is that the algorithm would then try to: minimize expected misclassification cost (rather than the most likely class)
