There are two (system unit) procedure variables involved: Exceptproc which handles the exception and backtracestrfunc that handles address to lineinfo retrieval. The current handling iirc is layered the system unit only terminates with an error but defines above procedure variables to override this. the sysutils unit converts RTEs to an language exception and overrides exceptproc with a default language exception handler (sysutils.catchunhandledexception) the lineinfo (for stabs) or the linfodward (dwarf, 2.4.0+) units override the backtracestrfunc procedure variable to provide the lineinfo. So in short: copy the sysutils.catchunhandledexception routine to your own code. only modify the way the copy does output in some way that you like, and make it rock solid (since exceptions during exceptions are confusing and annoying) assign the functionanme of the copy to exceptproc Note that the lineinfo unit is implicitely included when you do -gl
