None of these solutions quite worked for me Dave Roberts solution was the closest to what I actually got working. I do not have Get latest version of item on check out enabled, however it seems to be a server policy. My solution to this is to check the file out for edit, get specific version, then when the conflict is detected use the merge tool (and manually merge none of the changes) so that the file is in the condition it was. I was going to go with compare with the specific version and copy the entire file then just paste it over the top of the old one. Still there should be an easier way to do this!
