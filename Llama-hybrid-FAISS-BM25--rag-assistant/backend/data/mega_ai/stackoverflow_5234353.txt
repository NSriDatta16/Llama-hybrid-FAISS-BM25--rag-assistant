Do DirectX Textures share/reduce Address Space of the (32 Bit) Application?

Imagine this: a 32 bit application which has 2 GB address space and can therefore allocate at max 2 GB of memory (let fragmentation beside) a Graphic card with 1 GB of graphics memory When the application uses e.g. 1.5 GB of memory, can it allocate another 1 GB of textures? It would use in sum 2.5 GB of memory which is not possible for the 32 bit application itself. AFAIK textures are only mapped into the address space of the application when it "locks" the texture to get a pointer to the memory. So my assumption is the address space is only needed during the lock. As only some textures are locked it shouldn't consume the whole address space.
