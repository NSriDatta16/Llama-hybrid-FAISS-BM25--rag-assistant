I have rolled back the hack which using active profile above, because found more elegant way to solve my problem. Source of the problem was transitive dependency due using of some my testutils module with compile scope dependency on JUnit (which have to be after JMockit in classpath), while in the parent POM test dependencies was defined as bellow: ... mockit jmockit 0.994 test junit junit 4.7 test ... coverage mockit jmockit-coverage 0.994 test ... The found solution was replacing JUnit scope from test to provided. Is it better trick?
