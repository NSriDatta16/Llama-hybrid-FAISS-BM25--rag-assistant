After a few days, I decided it may be best to use an alternative method. What I did was sample the data such that it reflected the reported distributions in the population. I repeated this a number of times, each time randomly sampling in appropriate proportions, and took the average performance on the classifier. I continued to use the case-control design to find the features that I wanted, however in the validation step and subsequent performance reporting I used the sampling method. This seemed to me a simpler and more straight forward alternative to using a Bayes Factor.
