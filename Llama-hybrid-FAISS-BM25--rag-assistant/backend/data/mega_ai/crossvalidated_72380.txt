Lets say $Y$ is your disease and $X$ are your covariates. Technically you shouldn't be able to model the probability of disease (since this is a case control study; you fixed the margins, the probability of disease in your sample is 0.5). However, there was a landmark paper in 1979 by Prentice and Pyke ( http://biomet.oxfordjournals.org/content/66/3/403.abstract ) that shows that modeling $Y|X$ in logistic regression gives you same estimates as modeling $X|Y$. So it does not bias model estimates/predictive power.
