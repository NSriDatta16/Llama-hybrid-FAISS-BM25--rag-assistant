Is it always beneficial to use return_sequences=True for time series prediction with RNN?

I roughly understand what return_sequences=True does when being used for time series prediction with RNN (each RNN cell outputs its hidden state). Now my question is it always advisable to use return_sequences=True for a conventional RNN or a LSTM? What are the pros and cons of using it? Reminder : Would anybody mind sharing his/her experience on that topic. Do you usually use it or not? I'll appreciate every comment.
