Can I calculate the change of the bicycle's modal share from marginal effects obtained by logistic regression?

I want/need to analyse the influence of certain parameters on the share of cycling in the total number of trips. What I have is a database of more than 960,000 trips within Germany in 2017, containing: Trip data: length, mode of transport, weather, purpose, ... Personal data: age, attitudes, access to car (y/n), driving license (y/n), ... Data about the county where the trip started: rural/urban, traffic density, cycling infrastructure, topography, share of students, ... My dependent variable is: "was this trip made by bike? (y/n)". I did a logistic regression and calculated the marginal effects. So I know the influence (if significant) of some variables on the propability that a trip is made by bike. My question now is: Can I somehow deduce from this the influence of certain developments (e.g. more bicycle infrastructure, less car ownership, ...) on the current share of cycling in total traffic? If yes, under which circumstances? Thank you in advance for your support!
