Selecting best binomial model. Case of flowers pollinated by bees

I'm looking to build a binomial model in R for a fascinating experiment involving flower pollination at various temperatures. In this experiment, plants exhibit a dynamic range of flowers and floral stems. Some plants even boast different floral stems, each with a varying number of flowers. As bees work their magic and successfully pollinate these flowers, they transform into fruits. My curiosity leads me to explore whether the probability of pollination, or the generation of fruits, is influenced by temperature. I'd love to delve deeper into this and hear your thoughts on the matter! For this, I use the glmer function from the lme4 package. Now, I'll describe how my database is structured. library(Matrix) library(lme4) temperature As you can see, the variable "spike" simply indicates, when applicable, the number corresponding to each floral stem. Since the floral stem depends on the same flower, I believe it should be nested within each plant. As mentioned in some literature, one can use the cbind function to create a small matrix with proportions. This is done as follows: response2 Now, let's create the models, starting with the simplest one, which does not consider the plant ID as a random effect. idk if thats correct, or if i need to begin with the complex one model1 We can observe that the probability of pollination is indeed influenced by temperature. However, this analysis doesn't account for the previously described implications. Hence, we'll create a second model, incorporating the plant ID as a random variable: model2 I think we've progressed quite well up to this point, and I would appreciate your support at this stage. I'm not sure if I did the statistically correct thing by nesting 'spike.' It's a doubt I have about whether this is correct. Can you help/explain me? model3 Also, I have the issue that this is a simplified example, but in my real data, I have another variable that could explain pollination. It is the abundance of bees at each experimental site. I was thinking of including it as a covariate with the symbol +, but I really don't know how these approaches should be done. Should I first try simple models and then make them more complex? Or does it depend on whether we find significant differences? It could also be started with the most complex and then remove variables that do not explain. Thank you very much for your attention and your responses
