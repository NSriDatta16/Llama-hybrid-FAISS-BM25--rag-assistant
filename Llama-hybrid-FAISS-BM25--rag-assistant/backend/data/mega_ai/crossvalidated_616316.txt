Structural break near the end of training sample

I have multivariate time series (VAR), and i found a break near the end (84.7%). I wanted to use a dummy variable in this situation, but even if I choose 90% training set, the dummy only trains on 100 values (i have 1900 values in total).Ð¡ould this skew the results?
