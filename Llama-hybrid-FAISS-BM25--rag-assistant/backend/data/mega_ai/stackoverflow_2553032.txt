You can loop through the form fields by name, use String#split to split the names on dot, and build up your resulting structure. Concept code: function serializeDeep(form) { var rv, obj, elements, element, index, names, nameIndex, value; rv = {}; elements = form.elements; for (index = 0; index Note that that doesn't allow for fields with repeated names (which should create arrays), nor does it elegantly handle a situation where you use the names "foo" and "foo.bar". But it should get you started.
