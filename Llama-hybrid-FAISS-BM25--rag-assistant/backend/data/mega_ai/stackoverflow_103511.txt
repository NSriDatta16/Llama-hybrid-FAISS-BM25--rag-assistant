I would recommend UTF-16 for any kind of data manipulation and UI. The Mac OS X and Win32 API uses UTF-16, same for wxWidgets, Qt, ICU, Xerces, and others. UTF-8 might be better for data interchange and storage. See http://unicode.org/notes/tn12/ . But whatever you choose, I would definitely recommend against std::string with UTF-8 "only when necessary". Go all the way with UTF-16 or UTF-8, but do not mix and match, that is asking for trouble.
