There is likely a multitude of ways to report missing values, however I will offer a really simple approach. This is to directly report the response rate of each of those 4 questions, which could be expressed in counts or percent of sample size. This will lead your intended audiences' attention to potential sampling issues. I would also recommend that you give some discussion for your readers on what some of the potential reasons why people would prefer to respond or not respond. Your readers will likely appreciate a nuanced appraisal, and will understand that your reported statistics for certain variables pertain only to a subset of the respondents.
