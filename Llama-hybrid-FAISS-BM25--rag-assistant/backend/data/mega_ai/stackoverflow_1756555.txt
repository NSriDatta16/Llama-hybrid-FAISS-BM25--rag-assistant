I believe the first appearance of iterators and generators were in the Icon programming language, about 20 years ago. You may enjoy the Icon overview , which lets you wrap your head around them without concentrating on the syntax (since Icon is a language you probably don't know, and Griswold was explaining the benefits of his language to people coming from other languages). After reading just a few paragraphs there, the utility of generators and iterators might become more apparent.
