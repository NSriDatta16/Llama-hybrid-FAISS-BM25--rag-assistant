It's not actually something about the editor itself. This usually happens because of A) custom tags that are missing a start or end tag cause an imbalance in the translation or B) is the result improper handling of scripting variable for custom tags by the JSP Validator. One's a fault in the JSP file and the other's the fault of the validator. Neither will cause this problem in the upcoming WTP 3.0.3 and Ganymede SR2 releases.
