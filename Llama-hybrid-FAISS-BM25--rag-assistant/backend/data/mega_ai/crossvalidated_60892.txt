Perhaps the problem is trying to point out that with the same relative error (50%) there is a big difference in whether the estimate is made as a whole or in parts. You've already seen the whole example. For the in parts case, you have each estimate is on average 40 hours, with variance of 20*20 = 400. For 25 parts, this would be a total variance of 25(400) = 10000, which gives a standard deviation of 100 hours. Thus the range from 900 to 1100 hours, which is plus or minus one standard deviation. In my opinion this is a poor example presented poorly (the text, not your question), but at least we can understand what they are doing.
