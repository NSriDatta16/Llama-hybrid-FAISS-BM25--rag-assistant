I dont use it to layout controls as it is quite slow but they have improved it in vs2008. I do find it saves a bit of time dragging a user control onto it but would prefer to lay controls out properly as it genrates some dirty html. Saying that we recruited 2 developers recently who insist on using it so each to their own.
