mod_rewrite to text/type/id

My current code is something like this store.php?storeid=12&page=3 and I'm looking to translate it to something like this mysite.com/roberts-clothing-store/store/12/3 and something like this: profile.php?userid=19 to mysite.com/robert-ashcroft/user/19 I understand that it's best to have the SEO-friendly text as far left as possible, ie not mysite.com/user/19/robert-ashcroft (what stackoverflow does) I can't figure out how to do this in apache's mod_rewrite.
