WinForm: Selection box flickers when dragging the mouse

I made a click-drag selection box in a picture box. In the picturebox Paint event hander I use e.Graphics.DrawRectangle(pen, rectangle); and update the rectangle and refreshe the picturebox in the mouse move event handler. The selection box looks smooth as long as the mouse remains at the bottom-right corner (i.e. drag to right/bottom). However if I want to drag the mouse to the left or up, rectangle.X/rectangle.Y has to be re-set constantly and the box flickers very noticeably. Is there a better/more efficient way to do the drawing? Much appreciated!
