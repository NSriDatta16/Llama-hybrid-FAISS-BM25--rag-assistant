A few options: Split the time series into several fixed length windows and manually extract some features from each window. That way your input always has the same length and can be fed to any standard classification algorithm (neural nets, decision trees,...). Split the time series into several fixed length windows and feed them directly to a convolutional neural network . CNNs basically do the feature extraction on their own. Look into algorithms that naturally consume time series data - like recurrent neural networks (especially LSTMs ).
