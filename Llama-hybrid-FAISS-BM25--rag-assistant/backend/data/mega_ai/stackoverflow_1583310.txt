Elegantly designing a method with 2 overloads, one accepts an object the other doesn't

I need to design a method that can potentially take as a parameter an object, if it doesn't then the method has to create a new object by itself. Is this a good way to do it? public void Method1(int companyId, int userId, int clientId) { Method1(null, companyId, userId, clientId); } public void Method1(SpecialObject o, int companyId) { if(o == null) o = new SpecialObject(userId, clientId); }
