You job in modeling is to be true to the data, so that stakeholders can apply the results appropriately. As Bj√∂rn said in a comment, much depends on how the model will be used. Centers need to be in the model. If there are significant systematic differences among transplant centers after differences in patient characteristics and the difficulties of procedures are taken into account, then that issue needs to be addressed. Although you worry about implications for distribution of future organ donations, one might argue that donations ought to be focused on the most successful centers, and transplant patients should be directed to those centers. Furthermore, your results could help identify why some centers are less successful than others and eventually help improve their performance. In terms of transplant year, modeling might provide some ability to make reasonable informed projections. Ideally you are not modeling each year as a separate factor but are handling it in a smooth continuous form, for example with a natural regression spline. If there is evidence of a continuing trend in success over recent calendar time, then stakeholders can use the information from the model along with understanding of the subject matter to determine whether it makes sense to project that trend for a few years into the future or simply carry forward predictions based on the most recent year.
