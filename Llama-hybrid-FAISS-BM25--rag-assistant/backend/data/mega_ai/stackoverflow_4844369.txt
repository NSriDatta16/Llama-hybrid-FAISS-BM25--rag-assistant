Your page is rendering in Quirks mode in IE8: Quirks mode is a rendering mode used by some web browsers for the sake of maintaining backward compatibility with web pages designed for older browsers or coded without standards conformance. You can't hope that a page which is created to work in IE Quirks mode will work in any other browser - it almost always won't, as it the case here. So, you should change the doctype (first line) to to get it out of Quirks mode and fix the (numerous) problems from there. If you need more advice on how to fix your HTML/CSS to work with a proper doctype, let me know and I'll provide a more thorough answer on how to do this. I tested this in IE7/8, Firefox, Chrome: it renders consistently. I tried to keep as much of your HTML/CSS as possible; because I did that, the code could be more elegant, but it works! I added all the styles at the top just to make it easier to test; you should put them in your stylesheet. You will have to add back in your PHP where appropriate. I added in one tiny snippet of PHP to output the current year.
