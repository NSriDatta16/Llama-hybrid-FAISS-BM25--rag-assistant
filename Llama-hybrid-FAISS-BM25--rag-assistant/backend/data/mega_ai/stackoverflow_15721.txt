If you can I'd be horrified. Why would you be horrified? Air is a desktop platform, and having access to the OS's APIs (such as registry access) makes plenty of sense. That being said, it isn't supported now (and as Adobe seem to be very Mac-centric, I doubt it will ever be added). I have settled on grabbing the users name from the name of the user directory Using File.userDirectory.name will work in most cases, but it seems like a very fragile implementation, it relies on the OS maintaining the convention of having the username as their directory. I can think of a few possible things that might break it (playing with TweakUI etc).
