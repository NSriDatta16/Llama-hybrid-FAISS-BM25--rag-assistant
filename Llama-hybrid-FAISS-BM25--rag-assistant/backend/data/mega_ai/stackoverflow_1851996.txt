Backing up (and restoring) a Plone instance

I have a Plone installation in my home directory under Linux. ~/Plone . This was made from a default distribution of Plone from its website. So Plone compiled own python and is bundeled with Zope. Please tell me, which files are necessary to backup if I want to: 1) Backup the whole data ever stored in my Plone instance; 2a) Restore the backed-up data in a same version of Plone, but located elsewhere. 2b) Restore the backed-up data in a (slightly) newer version of Plone. I thought, maybe it's a good idea to just backup the whole ~/Plone/zinstance directory, but I found thousands of occurrences of /home/me/Plone/... , even in the file zinstance/var/filestorage/Data.fs (!!!) . Can this be right? I found this resource, but it's not specific enough.
