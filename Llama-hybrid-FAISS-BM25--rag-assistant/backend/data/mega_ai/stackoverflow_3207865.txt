magento product popup

I'd like to create a popup window for products instead of directing to another page. I'm looking for advice on the best way to basically make a copy of the product view template to modify for my needs without having to create separate models and blocks. I'm using version 1.3.2.2. Let me know if anything needs clarification. I realize there are modules that do this, but I'd like to do it myself. Partly for learning.
