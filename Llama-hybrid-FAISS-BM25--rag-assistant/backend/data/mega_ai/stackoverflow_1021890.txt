I'm guessing it's just not supported by the hardware. I was recently trying to get antialiasing working on my MacBook (cf. glEnable(GL_POLYGON_SMOOTH) ), and after trying everything I could think of, I eventually discovered it simply wasn't supported by my hardware, according to this thread . I have no idea whether you can achieve antialiasing with vertex or fragment shaders, since I'm unfamiliar with them.
