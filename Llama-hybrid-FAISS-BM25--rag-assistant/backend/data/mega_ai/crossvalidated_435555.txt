You ask "which is more advanced and useful" but we must presume you mean useful to you, not to us. You also say that you can only afford one and that you want to be able to do something "useful". Unfortunately, if we combine those goals with your comments about how much statistics you know (i.e. not much) then they conflict. One course is not enough. If I were you, I would take course 1. First, while I don't know that particular text, Agresti is a very good writer. He is a very clear writer, given the level of whatever book or article he is writing. Second, knowing the basics really well is very important (and lacking in many people who call themselves data scientists). But perhaps I am misreading your statements about how much statistics you know. You mention "hearing about" statistics 2 years ago. But what were you doing for those 2 years? If you were taking statistics courses, then surely one of them covered the sort of material in course 1. But, if that's the case, you would not be asking this question. Course 2 is going to be much more mathematical. I'd bet that there are mathematical prerequisites for that course. Do you have them? Were/are you a math major? In any case, I think this sort of theory course is less useful for practical work (other people may disagree). Course 3 is specialized. Bayesian methods are very popular and useful, but taking course 3 without course 1 (or its equivalent) is like trying to build an apartment building starting on the 10th floor.
