Help with Interpretation of a logistic regression

I'm being confused about how to interpret my logistic regression and I would appreciate some input on the matter. I work with R's glm. I have one binary response (emerged/not emerged), and two predictors, one continuous (treatment time) and one binary (group, 0 or 1). My n=20 per group per treatment. My data looks like this (I've calculated the % emergence for each treatment): Treatment(h)___28___29___30___31___32___33___34___35 GRP 0___________0____0____0____0___59___70___97___100 GRP 1__________50___21___51___79___87___97___100__100 My question is "Does group 1 emerge faster than group 0"? I have built a model with an interaction for time*group, here is R's output where sp = group and trait = time treatment. Call: glm(formula = hatch ~ sp * trait, family = binomial(link = "logit"), data = logecl2) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -2.7110 -0.3975 0.1659 0.5032 1.6355 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -66.0207 8.3820 -7.876 3.37e-15 *** sp1 43.7401 8.8134 4.963 6.94e-07 *** trait 2.0491 0.2602 7.877 3.36e-15 *** sp1:trait -1.2903 0.2755 -4.683 2.82e-06 *** --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 (Dispersion parameter for binomial family taken to be 1) Null deviance: 822.09 on 610 degrees of freedom Residual deviance: 399.09 on 607 degrees of freedom AIC: 407.09 Number of Fisher Scoring iterations: 7 exp(coefficients(model)) (Intercept) sp1 trait sp1:trait 2.126048e-29 9.910386e+18 7.760981e+00 2.751994e-01 Apparently the interaction is statisticaly significant. At first glance, it's obvious that group 1 emerges faster than group 0, but I'm not sure how my model supports this observation, or how to interpret it correctly. Can someone help me interpret the results? Every replicate is unique: I take 20 eggs of each group for treament 28h, check their status, then dissect them. I repeat the process for every development time (treatment). Here is the structure of the data : head(logecl2) id sp trait line hatch 1 1 0 28 A5 0 2 2 0 28 A5 0 3 363 1 28 A5 1 4 364 1 28 A5 0 5 365 1 28 A5 1 6 366 1 28 A5 1 sp = group : 1 for test; 0 for control trait = time treatment, from 28 to 35 (h) Line = is irrelevant Hatch = emerged (1) or not (0)
