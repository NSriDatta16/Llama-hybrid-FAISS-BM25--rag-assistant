Flash has some neat security measures in place. Allowing users to upload swf's to your site and embedding them is unsafe, you're basically setting yourself up for an XSS attack. However, allowing them to hotlink should not be a problem. The swf will be locked to the domain that is hosting it and is not allowed calling url's outside of that space. It will still be open to "evil links" (i'm sure theres a proper word for them), and by that I mean having regular links to yoursite.com/admin/deleteallpages.php which it tries to load "as" you. It will not however be able to use this data in any way, it'll basically be the same as a normal link, and I'd guess modern cms' are protected from that type of attacks. You could get the same protection by hosting your flashes on a different subdomain, since flash considers this the same as a completely different domain.
