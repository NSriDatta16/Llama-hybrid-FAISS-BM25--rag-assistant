Moving averages are not generally assumed to be dimension reduction procedure but rather smoothing one. It could be commented that a SMA is reducing the variability of a dataset in a way analogous with a low-pass filter but once more this is filtering/smoothing procedure rather than dimension reduction. Ultimately a simple moving average is "simply" a kernel smoother with a fixed width rectangular kernel . We can re-express a SMA in many different ways as it a special case of a convolution filter (e.g. as a Savitzky-Golay filter too) but that's mostly academic chit-chat. :)
