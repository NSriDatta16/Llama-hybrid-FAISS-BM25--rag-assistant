A general rule for building secure webb applications: Don't ever trust any input from the client. Assume that each request has been handbuilt in order to break through your security system. The only thing safe is to ignore any data coming back from the disable fields. That data will have to be stored in the session, or reloaded from the database (or whatever data storage you use).
