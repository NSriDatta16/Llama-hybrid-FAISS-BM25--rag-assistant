jQuery Tree plugin

I am looking for a jQuery plugin which can do following jobs: Presents a tree view of certain list of objects ( probably only list tags could suffice too for the moment) Every node's subtree is expandable & collapsable List items can be dragged & dropped to alter the tree structure I can retrieve & infer tree structure & do some processing on it in back end. I have looked at some of the plugins which I could find on "Binging". I am not yet satisfied fully though.
