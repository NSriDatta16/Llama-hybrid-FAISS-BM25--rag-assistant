Random noise and nugget effect are indeed quite similar to some extent. The difference between the two appears when there are repeated observations (i.e., several observations at the same location), and when you compute the predicted value at an observation point. The random noise model assumes that observations are corrupted by additive, IID Gaussian noise. Practically, this means that repeated observations at a single location are producing differents outcomes. The posterior mean of the GP is not equal in this case to the observed value (even if there is only one observation at a particular location). This is GP regression , with a (usually) smooth regression function . The nugget model , on the other hand, assumes a deterministic observations model (repeated observations should provide to the same value) but a very rough underlying function. The posterior mean of the GP is equal in this case to the observed value at each observation point, but is discontinuous at these points. This is in fact a form of GP interpolation , with a discontinuous interpolant . Remark: in the first case (random noise), the individual values of the repeated observations do not matter. The posterior distribution of the GP depends only on the number of observations at each location and on their average.
