I would advise providing images for ldpi, mdpi, hdpi and optionally xhdpi (depending on your target users). That will allow you to cover the most commonly used resolutions just fine. If you end up with the feeling that your application is getting too large (either by deciding to add all possible image sizes or other reasons), you can also look into allowing your application to be moved to an SD card. That way, storage won't be much of an issue anymore. ( http://developer.android.com/guide/appendix/install-location.html )
