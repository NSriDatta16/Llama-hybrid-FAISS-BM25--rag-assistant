Estimate E[x|A,B]: alternatives to bucketing for non-parametric estimation

I have a set of products. I would like to estimate Expected Value of items sold of the products wrt product price and age of the purchaser. One alternative is to assume a distribution and fit it. One other way, non-parametric, is to estimate the quantity by bucketing the data and estimating the desired quantity by averaging the sample points in each bucket. What are the alternatives to bucketing for non-parametric estimation? New to the subject, could you pin point me to relevant literature so I could also build up the proper technical jargon?
