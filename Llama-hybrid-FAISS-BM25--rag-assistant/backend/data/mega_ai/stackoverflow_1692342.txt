My solution is to get the indexes of the distance vector, given a row and the size of the matrix. I got this from codeguru int Trag_noeq(int row, int col, int N) { //assert(row != col); //You can add this in if you like if (row After translating to R, assuming indexes start at 1, and assuming a lower tri instead of upper tri matrix I got. EDIT: Using the vectorized version contributed by rcs noeq.1 So, with the example: sumd2 This was much slower than as.matrix for small matrices before vectorizing. But just about 3x as slow after vectorizing. In a Intel Core2Duo 2ghz applying the sum by row of the size 10000 matrix took just over 100s. The as.matrix method fails. Thanks rcs!
