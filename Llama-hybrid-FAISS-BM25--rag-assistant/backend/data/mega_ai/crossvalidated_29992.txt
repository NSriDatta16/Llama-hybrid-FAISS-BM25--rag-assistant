You are right, normal distribution or gaussian is a scaled and shifted $\exp (-x^2)$, so the importance of $\exp (-x^2)$ comes mostly from the fact that it is essentially the normal distribution. And normal distribution is important mainly because ("under mild regularity conditions") the sum of many independent and identically distributed random variables approaches normal, when "many" approaches infinity. Not everything is normally distributed. For example, your survey results may not be, at least if the responses are not even on the continuous scale but something like integers 1â€“5. But the mean of the results is normally distributed over repeated sampling, because the mean is just a scaled (normalized) sum, and the individual responses are independent of each other. Assuming the sample is large enough, of course, because strictly speaking, normality appears only when the size of the sample becomes infinite. As you see from the example, normal distribution may appear as a result of the estimation or modeling process, even when the data is not normally distributed. Therefore normal distributions are everywhere in statistics. In bayesian statistics, many posterior distributions of parameters are approximately normal, or can be assumed to be.
