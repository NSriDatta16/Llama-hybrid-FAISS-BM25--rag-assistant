on the agent account in developer.apple.com You must create a distribution certificate You must also create a Distribution Provisioning Profile. Download both of these and drag them onto xcode. In the target info for your project you need to go to the code signing section and make sure you have selected your distribution profile. Another thing you may need to do is create an entitlements file, declare this under 'code signing entitlements' as described on the apple page here http://developer.apple.com/iphone/manage/distribution/index.action
