Why can we do this in SVM optimization?

I posted this question in the datascience stackexchange but no one answered so I thought I would post it here aswell: Ok, so I've been trying to read up on how SVM:s work and started with maximal margin classifiers. At page 132 in ESL (Elements of Statistical Learning) the authors "reformulates" the optimization problem but I can't seem to understand what they are doing from 4.47 to 4.48. Does anyone know? Here is an excerpt: What I don't understand is why we can arbitrarly set the magnitude of beta to 1/M. What does a positively scaled multiple mean in this case? Just a multiple larger than 0?
