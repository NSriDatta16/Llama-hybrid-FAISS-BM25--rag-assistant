Clustering events in a sequence

I have a sequence of recurring events that I would to group together into representing different operation activities of the underlying process. These events may have an order in their occurrence; or maybe not. Consequently, I would like to explore and investigate if any relationship exists between the events. Are there any better methods than using Hierarchical clustering? I might want to build a model that can determine the operational activity based on the events it recognized as belonging to the clusters representing them operational activities. Maybe HMM, RNN, etc. I have been searching for an algorithm that lends itself to the problem that I am trying to solve. I came across a few that might be adapted to be able to solve the problem such as HMM, RNN, or clustering algorithms. I am not looking for a solution, but for advice and guidance in the right direction towards solving the problem. I appreciate any insight you may have to share with me.
