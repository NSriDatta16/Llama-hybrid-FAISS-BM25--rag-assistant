Your first intuition is correct. This is called a plasmode simulation and is a great and frequently used way to compare the performance of estimators for data with covariate and treatment distributions like the one you have. See Franklin et al. (2014) who use this method exactly as you intend. The key, though, is in choosing a model with which to generate the outcome. ideally, it would reflect a data-generating process similar to the one that exists in the real data, but if you knew that, you wouldn't need to estimate treatment effects in the first place. What you can do instead is to simulate data with varying qualities and relationships (e.g., linear, quadratic, piecewise, etc.). This way, if you can demonstrate one method works on all (or most) data-generating scenarios, you have evidence in favor of using it for your dataset. The 2016 Atlantic Causal Inference Conference data competition did exactly this. The paper about it ( Dorie et al, 2019 ) is very thorough. It explains the many ways they generated the data and what features each data-generating model had that would make it more or less challenging for estimators. The results of the competition were that BART and TMLE dramatically outshone all the other methods, although CEM was not included. This type of simulation study has no less merit than the simulation studies you typically see in statistics papers demonstrating a new method or comparing methods. You can also use the data from this contest to compare your own method. They have an R package described in the article which allows you to simulate the data they simulated and apply your own pet method to it. It's unlikely this data will look much like your own dataset, though, so this alone might not sway your colleagues. Ask your colleagues why they like CEM so much. It's a generally poorly performing method in that it discards huge amounts of data, the causal effect doesn't correspond to the average treatment effect in any population of interest specified a priori (i.e., not the ATT or ATE), and it relies on many arbitrary decisions by the researcher. I can't think of any study other than the one introducing CEM in which it outperforms another method. One paper that comes to mind is Zubizarreta et al (2014) , in which it does so poorly, an effect can't even be estimated from it (i.e., it throws away all the data). I just noticed you are doing a case-control study rather than a case-cohort study. I'm not a biostatistician so I don't know whether the same methods can be used for both types of study, but maybe someone else can comment on that.
