iPhone application is crashing and not leaving behind a .crash log file

I'm working on catching a seriously insidious bug that's happening in my code. The problem is, the bug is completely random and can happen either 9 minutes into the application's runtime or 30 minutes. I've gone ahead and added the fabulous PLCrashReporter to my project ( http://code.google.com/p/plcrashreporter ) and that works fine for trivial bugs. Also, when I'm in doubt, I will navigate to the crash logs found in ~/Library/Logs/CrashReporter/MobileDevice/ and run symbolicatecrash on the crash log. This + GDB will eventually catch any bug, except for the one I'm facing now. Apparently the nature of this bug is preventing even Apple's crash logs to be properly written to storage. This shows when I sync my iPhone or iPod Touch with iTunes and run symbolicatecrash on my app: sf$ symbolicatecrash foo.crash No crash report version in foo.crash at /usr/local/bin/symbolicatecrash line 741. It might be that my application is not leaving a crash report at all, and exiting due to memory issues. I do indeed see the applicationWillTerminate: executing my NSLog statement before exiting, in my App Delegate. However, after running the application through ObjectAlloc, my application never reaches > 2.08MB of usage. Although if I'm reading the results proper, I did allocate over 28MB of memory throughout the entire duration of my test run. Thanks again for everything.
