According to Alexander (1990) the Olin-Pratt estimator is not suitable for meta-analysis. See https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.3758/BF03334037.pdf One should average the Fisher z transformed r values (possibly weighting them) and back-transform the averaged correlation. It might be sensible to use meta-analytic software for this (e.g., the (free) R metafor package).
