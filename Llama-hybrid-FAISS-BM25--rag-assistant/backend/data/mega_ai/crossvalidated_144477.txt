After adding additional features, same accuracy on test data, but higher accuracy on training data, how should I interpret ?

I've done 5-fold cross-validation and the model is SVM. 300 features: 0.53 on test, 0.55 on training; 700 featuers: 0.53 on test, 0.67 on training. Does this mean that the additional 400 features is useless ?
