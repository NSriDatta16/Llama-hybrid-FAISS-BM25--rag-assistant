If your interest is in skills that are "marketable," I would say learn about a variety of modeling techniques (GLMs, survival models both continuous and discrete, random forests, boosted trees) with an emphasis on prediction over estimation. Mathematical statistics can occasionally get too bogged down in estimation under parametric models, trying to answer questions that become irrelevant when the model isn't literally true. So before delving too deeply into a problem consider whether or not it's still interesting and applicable when the model doesn't hold, because it never will. You should be able to find many such questions in the field of time series, if that's where one of your interests lies. Also appreciate that there are challenges involved in the analysis of real world data that a statistics education alone may not prepare you for, so I would consider supplementing your education with the study of topics like relational databases and general computation. These fields can also be very fascinating and offer a refreshing perspective on data. Finally, as Matthew Drury already pointed out it's essential to be able to program. I would work on becoming strong with R and / or Python, and start learning about SQL, which you will encounter inevitably. A lot of companies still use SAS, but do you really want to work for one? A compiled language such as C or Java also doesn't hurt, but this isn't really critical.
