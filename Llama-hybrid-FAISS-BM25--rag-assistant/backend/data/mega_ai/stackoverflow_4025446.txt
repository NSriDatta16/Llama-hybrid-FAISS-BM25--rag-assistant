My problem was I was setting the Content in my Style, and Content cannot have more then one logical parent. I needed to move that to a Template instead. Since I didn't want to lose the base style, I set the content in the ContentTemplate property of the HeaderedContentControl (DraggablePanel in my code). +1 to Davy anyways for helping me walk through this.
