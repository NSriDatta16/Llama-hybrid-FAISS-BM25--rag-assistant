If I understand correctly, you need a datastructure for your tree. Each individual node requires a record to hold its data. But the underlying heirarchy can be managed in a few different ways. Im guessing this is all to be managed in some sort of database - This has already been talked about on this site, so i will point you to: Implementing a hierarchical data structure in a database and here: What is the most efficient/elegant way to parse a flat table into a tree? and here: SQL - How to store and navigate hierarchies?
