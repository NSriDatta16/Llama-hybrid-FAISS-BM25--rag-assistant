I believe it depends on your career aspirations. If you're looking long-term at being a consultant or maybe evening being an indepedent analyst, becoming and expert in your technology area is critical. You'll need to focus a lot of time mastering technology in your given area, and you don't have the spare time to become e generalist unless you choose not to sleep. I don't recommend that for the long-run. Then again I cannot recall how many times I've seen an organization dump a perfectly good code base just to upgrade to the "next-thing" due to the career aspirations of project managers. So maybe it is out of our control? In the end, I honestly feel that domain-critical knowledge is more important than technology skills. But that is maybe because I'm not only the front lines these days. I'm all for a general lemma that says you should know more than one programming language, but I seriously question those who claim to proficient in ten languages and ten frameworks and ten different operating systems.
