Personally, I have 2 use cases for Ruby: Maintenance scripts . I have a lot of tasks at work that I'd classify as "maintenance". These tasks range from manipulating data from an excel spreadsheet and importing into a SQL Server Database to cleaning up a directory full of files to generating test data that I don't want to manually create. Some of these scripts are quick 10 line scripts and some of them expand out into small applications that I use quite frequently. There are a few things that make Ruby really nice for this: It's really easy to get started with a script. Tools like Rake are designed for organizing tasks, and I don't need to create a bunch of extra framework junk just to get started. Libraries. I know that other languages supposedly have superior libraries, but so far Ruby's libraries have suited my needs. And RubyGems makes it really easy to install a library without having to manually download and install it. Ruby has a lot of built features that make reading and processing files really simple. DSLs . There are a lot of tasks that are repetitive and lend themselves to creating domain specific languages. Ruby has a very flexible syntax and it has some functional aspects that give you a lot of flexibility in the way that you write your programs. Often, you can wrap up common functionality into a DSL that's suited for your task. The other thing I use Ruby for (to a lesser extent) is web development . The Ruby on Rails framework is what I've used mostly, but I played around with Merb a little bit before the announcement that it was merging with Ruby on Rails. I like Ruby on Rails for all of the reasons that I like Ruby. In fact, it's mostly the features of Ruby that make Ruby on Rails great. Rails itself is a domain specific language written in Ruby that make web development a lot more fun (in my opinion) and speed things up quite a bit. I think a lot of people feel the same way I do about Ruby, and the community still seems very active and vibrant. I think it's a great language to learn that's going to be used for quite some time.
