IMHO, The main disadvantage is that your test plan, execution, and coverage is more susceptible to changes in the underlying implementation, and is thus less useful for regression and acceptance testing. White box testing is useful at lower-levels and in addition to black-box tests, but I would be nervous if I was due to deliver software with only white-box tests.
