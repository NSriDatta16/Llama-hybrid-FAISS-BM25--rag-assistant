How to sum two indices of time series?

I have two time series $X_{t,A}$ and $X_{t,B}$ with an index (2015=100) as unit of measure. To be more concrete, my two time series are the index of the level of employment in countries A and B. I want to sum both of them. Of course, it does not make sense to do $X_{t,A}+X_{t,B}$ . I do not have the time series of the level of employment for each country, but I do have the level of employment for one specific period (starting just before the beginning of the time series). I will call them $L_A$ and $L_B$ . Can I compute the relative share of employment in each country to sum the two indices? Formally : $X_{t} = w_AX_{t,A} + w_BX_{t,B}$ with $w_A = \frac{L_A}{L_A+L_B}$ and $w_B = \frac{L_B}{L_A+L_B}$ I understand that this is an approximation, but does it make sense to you? Thanks in advance !!
