I think you can simply implement Convolution neural nets on categorical data. As we know there are two representation of Texts ( think of it as a huge categorical data): one-hot and embedding representation. you can merge all of your categorical data into one feature. for example by merging 3 genders and and 8 ethnicity you will have 24 values of a new feature. However you also have numerical data alongside categorical data; in this case you would better to some feature extraction on your data with a Embedding layer and then merge your all data. In this stage your data will be ready as input of convent neural network.
