How to compare two sets with very few samples

I have two sets of independent data including 10 samples. It's like, set A set B 1 961 965 2 919 934 3 886 921 4 896 913 5 881 967 6 918 924 7 927 925 8 942 915 9 477 896 10 921 930 These are the time taken to arrive destinations for vehicles. Because the environment is dynamic, it sometimes arrives early and late. And, set A is the results from transportation policy A, and set B is from transportation policy B. I assume that I don't know whether policy A and policy B are same or not. And, What I want to know policy A is different from policy B? and how different? . Before thinking about statistics, my method to calculate was just, min value of set A . So, if the average is in range of above inequation, policy B is different from policy A. To be accurate, I considered Jensen-Shannon divergence (because it should be symmetric). But I'm not sure that Jensen-Shannon divergence is the best though the samples are few. How can I compare two sets?
