I had some problems with result transformers combined with HQL queries. When I tried final ResultTransformer trans = new DistinctRootEntityResultTransformer(); qry.setResultTransformer(trans); it didn't work. I had to transform manually like this: final List found = trans.transformList(qry.list()); With Criteria API transformers worked just fine.
