Interpreting significance of predictor vs significance of predictor coeffs in multinomial logistic regression

I have a multinomial logistic regression with dependent variable valued in {-1,0,1} (reference category is 0) and a number of continuous and discrete predictors. After running the regression a continuous predictor of interest ('size') has a Type 3 analysis of effects p-value of 0.0683, and the two coefficients (corresponding to outcomes of -1 and 1) have p-values of 0.8786 and 0.0220 respectively. I read somewhere that one should only look at the significance of the coefficients if the predictor itself is significant at the chosen level. Is this right? My naive sense is that the predictor is borderline (taking alpha=0.05 for argument's sake), and that 'size' has a significant relationship to outcome=1 but not to outcome = -1. I would say that the significance of the relationship to outcome=1 is not terribly strong, but that is ok for the application in mind (or at least, with the indirect data I am forced to use)
