Rails - caching and permission based views

I use CanCan to check user permissions and display or suppress page content conditionally for my users. I want to cache my pages though, and even with fragment caching can't find an elegant solution... for example: cache do # much code if can? # little code else # little code # much code if can? # little code else # little code # much code Surely I'm not alone and there's a good way to do this. What is generally considered the best practice here? Thanks very much for your input.
