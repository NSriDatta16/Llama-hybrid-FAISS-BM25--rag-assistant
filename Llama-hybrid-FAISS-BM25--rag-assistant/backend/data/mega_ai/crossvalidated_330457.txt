Is there rotational ambiguity in PLS?

There are linearly overlapped components typically in curve resolution or factor analysis techniques [1] [2] . Also for PCA, it is common that it is easy to change the sign of the loadings or scores as both could be multiplied by (-1). Given that partial least squares is constrained to two data blocks (X and Y), is it the case that there is no rotational ambiguity? \begin{align} X &= TP^T + E\\ Y &= TQ^T + F \end{align} I.e., the loadings P and Q have no ambiguity in their signs?
