Firefox's CSS3 "nth-child" support?

According to css3.info's selector test , Firefox 3.0 supports some permutations of the nth-child selector. However, the code shown here (#30) doesn't work for me. It should select the empty paragraphs, so I edited my code to the following but it doesn't show in Firefox (it works in Opera). div :nth-child(even) { background-color: yellow; height: 30px; } Does this element match? Does this element match? Is this a bug in the test, or have I made an error somewhere?
