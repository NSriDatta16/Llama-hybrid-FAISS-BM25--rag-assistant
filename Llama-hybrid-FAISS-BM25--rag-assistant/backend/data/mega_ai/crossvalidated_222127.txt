I think you may find this link helpful regarding the interpretation of VAR models. As windows, you can do this using the window function of the ts{} package. Create a time series object, and then a window using foo_ts To make correlograms, one package that makes pretty plots is corrplot . Make a dataframe of your time series windows, and try using corrplot.mixed(dataframe) This is a great website for that package. Alternatively, you could use the corrgram package, in which case corrgram(dataframe, order=NULL, lower.panel=panel.pts, upper.panel=NULL) might give what you're looking for.
