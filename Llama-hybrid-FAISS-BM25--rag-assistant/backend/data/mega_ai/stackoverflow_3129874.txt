Database randomly deletes itself every so often

I have a normal SQLite database in my app, managed through my own ContentProvider and implemented via SQLiteOpenHelper. On the Droid only, every few weeks or so, the database just disappears. I have several users who wrote me about that, and I've seen it myself too now. I added some debug info (hard to repro when you only see it every few weeks), and in one instance, it just happened inbetween widget updates - first, the widget is displayed and shows the data just fine, the next time, the SQLiteOpenHelper's onCreate is called. The app itself does some multi-threaded shenanigans, but all ContentProvider implementations have the synchronized keyword, all access to the database is via the content provider, and in the instance described above, there is no multi-threading going on (the app itself hadn't been running, just the widget). And again, this is only on the Droid. I've never seen it on the G1. I never close the database, but it being a content provider, it sounds like I'm not supposed to do that in the first place (I remember hackbod saying that the idea is that the OS will close the app's process when necessary, which will automatically close the database). Any ideas?
