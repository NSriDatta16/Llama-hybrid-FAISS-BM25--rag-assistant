linking file menu items to buttons

I'm in need of linking some buttons in a 'document based' application to the file menu (bold text, italic text, make text bigger etc.). The issue is that since its a document based application, the MainMenu.xib is a completely different XIB file than the MyDocument.xib, so I can't drag the connections in Interface Builder like I usually would. Does anyone have a workaround? Is there a way to link button actions to a separate XIB files' built in menu functions? Zach
