Description: RAD in Action: Unit Testing in Delphi Featuring Nick Hodges Watch Now Join Embarcadero and Delphi programming expert and author, Nick Hodges, for an in-depth look at unit testing in Delphi. Without unit tests your code is fragile, hard to change, and unreliable. Unit testing is the only way that you can be sure that your code does what it is supposed to do. In this webinar, Nick discusses the basics of Unit Testing as well as providing a demo that illustrates the points at hand using the new DUnitX framework. This will lead to a discussion of stubs and mocks, and the use of the DelphiMocks. Topics covered include: What is Unit Testing? Why you should be doing Unit Testing Proper unit testing techniques including covering the "middle of the plate", the "outside corners" as well as checking exceptions A specific use case or unit testing using a real world example Be warned - the video is over 2 hours long.
