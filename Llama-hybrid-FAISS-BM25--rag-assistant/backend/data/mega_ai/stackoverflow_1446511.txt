UIScrollView - (bounces = NO) seems to override (pagingEnabled = YES)

I have a UIScrollView with paging in it (so the typical model with a UIPageControl and dragging/flicking left and right between pages), and I've got that working fine. The weird thing is that when I wanted to get rid of bouncing (so that you can't see black behind the UI on the left and right sides), suddenly paging no longer works. In other words, when: scrollView.pagingEnabled = YES; scrollView.bounces = YES; Everything works fine, except I don't like the bouncing at page(0) and page(length-1). But when I do this: scrollView.pagingEnabled = YES; scrollView.bounces = NO; It stops snapping into place at each page, instead treating all the pages together as one long page. So it seems that for some reason paging is dependent upon bouncing, which is fine as long as I can somehow stop the bouncing. So, is there another way to get rid of it? Or is there something I'm doing wrong? EDIT: The solution: @interface PagingScrollView : UIScrollView @end @implementation PagingScrollView - (id)initWithFrame:(CGRect)frame { if (self = [super initWithFrame:frame]) { self.pagingEnabled = YES; self.bounces = YES; } return self; } - (void)setContentOffset:(CGPoint)offset { CGRect frame = [self frame]; CGSize contentSize = [self contentSize]; CGPoint contentOffset = [self contentOffset]; // Clamp the offset. if (offset.x contentSize.width - frame.size.width) offset.x = contentSize.width - frame.size.width; if (offset.y contentSize.height - frame.size.height) offset.y = contentSize.height - frame.size.height; // Update only if necessary if (offset.x != contentOffset.x || offset.y != contentOffset.y) { [super setContentOffset:offset]; } } @end
