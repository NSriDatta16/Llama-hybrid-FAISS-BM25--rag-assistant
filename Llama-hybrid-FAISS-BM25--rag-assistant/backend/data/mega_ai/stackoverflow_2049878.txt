UI for SQL Server User managment

I am building a solution for a small business without any in house IT staff. The central datastore is SQL SERVER (express2008) I would like to leverage SQLs built in security (certain views for certain classes of employees). However the boss (the one who needs the control to say who sees what and who can edit) is overwhelmed by Management Studio. No I know that in just 16-20 hours I could put together a nice interface that uses SQL to manage the users. It just seems silly for me to reinvent the wheel for what seams like it must be a common problem and must have been solved many times before. but searching on the web has not turned anything up. I would rather something that I could package with my app (WPF/C#/Linq2Sql) but if it was stand alone it would also be great as long as it was dummy proof. While I am on the topic. How do users usually change their sql passwords (when you are forced to used mixed authentication)? Thanks
