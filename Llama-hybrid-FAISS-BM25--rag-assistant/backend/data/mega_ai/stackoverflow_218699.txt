Your choice of cross-browser javascript GUI

UPDATE - A comprehensive comparison, updated as of February 2015, can be found here: Alternatives to Ext JS 2008 question : There are a number of great and not so-great Javascript GUI frameworks out there. I've looked at some (only superficially). And I can't make my mind about any of them Scroll to the end of this question to see what others say Ext.js The obvious choice by many since it's one of the most known frameworks. Advantages: Looks awesome , large community, lots of extensions/plugins, GPL'ed Disadvanatges: Inability to use third-party extensions with commercial license (and some of those extensions have killer features) Backbase Relatively less known. A curious mix of XML and Javascript that is reminiscent of XUL. However, it's already cross-browser Advantages: Looks good , very extensible, allows easy incorporation of some really neat stuff Disadvantages: Pricing is steep and CPU-bound (though free to use on up to 2 CPUs), forums are slow to respond (though commercial support is supposedly fast) qooxdoo Also very popular. Advantages: Please, fill in Disadvantages: Code is slighly messy (based on hearsay) YUI Fill in description Advantages: Well organized code Disadvantages: Many widgets still in beta Dojo Fill in description Advantages: Incremental loading of classes Disadvantages: MIght feel bloated jQuery UI Advantages: Widgets not dependent on each other Disadvantages: In an early stage of development, very few widgets Possible tendency towards wider acception: jQuery to be shipped with ASP.NET MVC What say you? What do you use and why? What would you rather use and why? In any kind of project To be updated with your input... See this excellent comment from Sergey Ilinsky which explains very nicely which framework you should choose when you want to just pimp up your page, build an application with a rich frontend (with several choices, no less) An interesting comment in another thread compares jQuery, Dojo, Prototype, Mootools, Sproutcore and Cappuccino (the question was removed) .
