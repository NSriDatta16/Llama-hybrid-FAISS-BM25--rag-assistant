I installed jQuery support using the gem as described here , and ran the jquery:install generator. That installed the necessary .js files, but it did -not- automatically cause them to be included in the HTML generated by To get that to generate the correct HTML, I had to follow the last instruction in the Manual Installation section and manually change "%w()" to "%w(jquery rails)" on the config.action_view.javascript_expansions[:defaults] = %w() line in my config/application.rb file, after which, everything began working properly. If it makes any difference, I had created my application using the --skip-prototype option in anticipation of using jQuery instead of Prototype.
