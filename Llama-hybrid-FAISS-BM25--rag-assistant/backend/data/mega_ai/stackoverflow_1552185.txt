I would suggest starting with Firebug because it traditionally has provided the most powerful set of debugging features. However IE dev tools (and others such as Opera Dragonfly ) are rapidly catching up and are probably preferred if your pages are being displayed primarily in those browsers. So I don't think you can get away with just learning one or the other. Find out which browsers your users prefer and install the developer tools for each browser. You'll save yourself a lot of time solving obscure browser specific Javascript or DOM bugs using the debugging platform specific to that browser.
