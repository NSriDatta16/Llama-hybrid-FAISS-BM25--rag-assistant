I interpret your question as follows: You want to do a multinomial logistic regression, and you don't want to choose a reference category for the dependent/explained/left-hand-side/$y$- variable. In that case the answer is: no, you need a reference category. The problem is that probabilities add to 1. So if you have 3 categories and estimated two of the probabilities, you have estimated all there is to know: the probability of the third category is just one minus the already estimated probabilities. If you don't want to choose a reference category for a independent/explanatory/right-hand-side/$x$-variable, then you can don't need a reference category, see: http://maartenbuis.nl/publications/ref_cat.html
