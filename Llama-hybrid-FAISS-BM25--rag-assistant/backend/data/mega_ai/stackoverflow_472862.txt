I agree, distributing your code as an egg is a great way to keep it organized. What could be more organized than a single-file containing all of the code and meta-data you would ever need. Changing the way the bytecode compiler works is only going to cause confusion. If you really do not like the location of those pyc files, an alternative is to run from a read-only folder. Since python will not be able to write, no pyc files ever get made. The hit you take is that every python file will have to be re-compiled as soon as it is loaded, regardless of whether you have changed it or not. That means your start-up time will be a lot worse.
