How is the target variable passed to the final estimator in this pipeline?

There is a pipeline like below. X is features and y is the target variable. I would like to know how y is passed to the estimator, LinearSVC . As far as I know, StandardScaler returns only transformed X . So, I thought that y was not passed to LinearSVC . However, this code worked and I could make prediction. Thus, I would like to know how y was reached to the final estimator. from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline from sklearn.svm import Linear SVC svm_clf = Pipeline([ ("scaler",StandardScaler()), ("linear_svc",LinearSVC(C=1,loss="hinge")), ]) svm_clf.fit(X,y)
