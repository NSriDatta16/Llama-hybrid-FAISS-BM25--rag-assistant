How to setup Connectivity between the web component and java app

I am confused about the approach for application that am writing. I have developed the application jar and will be distributing via java webstart. Now i need to putup a website supporting my app. doubts i have 1)Can i pass this username and password to the jar that i will be launching? 2)Can the webcomponent calculate the time for which the app was launched. Basically i need to understand how will the webcomponents and my java app interact with each other in terms of any data required to pass to the app and any info retreaving from the app and putting on the web. Thanks Krisp I want to pass arguments like username to the JNLP and then want to pass it to the main class. Is there any direct way to do so rather than use database? since JNLP is just an xml file. I could not find a direct way to do so. Can i anybody refer me some working code example.
