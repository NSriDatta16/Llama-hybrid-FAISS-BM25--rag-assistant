You may want to try with vector generalized linear models (VGLMs) applied to time series in R , part of my PhD. My family function AR.studentt.ff() , through the modelling function vglm() , estimates the three parameters (location, scale and degrees of freedom) of the the errors distribution, assumed as shift--scaled Student-t, by MLE using Fisher scoring. This family function imposes an AR model on the data, as yours above, also estimated. My R package, VGAMextra, will be realized soon via CRAN, with further choices. This is an extension of the package VGAM. See below for a very simple example. Note, only central Student-ts are handled currently. ### Estimate the parameters of the errors distribution for an ## AR(1) model. Sample size = 50 set.seed(20180218) nn
