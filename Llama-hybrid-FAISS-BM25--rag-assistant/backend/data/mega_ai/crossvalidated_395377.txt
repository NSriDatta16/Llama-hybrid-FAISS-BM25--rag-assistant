Use sparse data types for sparse data Today, English-language tweets have a character limit of 280 characters (previously, it was 140). This implies that a tweet can only contain a relatively small number of words, so a binary word-tweet matrix would have many 0 values. Using a sparse matrix will dramatically reduce your memory usage because you don't have to store all of the 0 values. I'm not aware of a generator type that is compatible with sklearn classifiers. But the sklearn random forest classes do accept some sparse data types. For more information, see the documentation .
