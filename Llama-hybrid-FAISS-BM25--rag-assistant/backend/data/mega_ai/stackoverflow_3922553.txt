You need to store it in a place where only the current user has acccess too. Basically there are two ways to do this: Store it in an EFS encrypted file . Store it in the secure local storage . Internet Explorer uses 2. But if you can get local access, you can decrypt both 1. and 2. if you have the right master key and algorithm (for instance, iepv can get at the Internet Explorer passwords). So: If you can, avoid storing passwords. Look for alternatives (like Windows authentication, directory services, etc) first. --jeroen
