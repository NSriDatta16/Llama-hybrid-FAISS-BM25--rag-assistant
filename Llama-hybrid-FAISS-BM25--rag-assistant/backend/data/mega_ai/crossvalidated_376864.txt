There is no perfect solution to anything when modelling. A good method for handling zeros will depend on the application you are working on. I am not a neural network expert, nor am I a time series expert, so I can't help you without knowing a little more about the problem you are working on. However, I do know a little something about zero inflated models/hurdle models. A hurdle model posits that the zeros and non-zeros occur from different processes. Here is an example of zeros occurring from a hurdle process: Flip a coin. If the coin is heads, then roll a die and record the outcome. If the coin is tails, record 0. In order to get a non-zero result you have to "jump the hurdle" (i.e. the coin has to be heads). The processes which result in zeros and non-zeros are distinct. Here is an example of a zero inflated process: Flip a coin. if the coin is heads, flip another coin. If the second coin is heads, record 1. If the second coin is tails, record 0. If the first coin is tails, record 0 and do not flip the second coin. The zeros in this process are a mix of the first and second process. You can see where the name "zero inflation" comes from. Now, back to your problem. I would determine which of these, hurdle or zero inflation, is most realistic. You know more about the process than I do, so I can't make any recommendations. Once you have decided, you'll be able to make more informed choices about your modelling. How can this help you? Suppose that your process is best modelled as a hurdle process. Maybe the returns are zero only when it rains. Then, you can model the hurdle process as a function of the covariates, and use the result of that process to model the returns.
