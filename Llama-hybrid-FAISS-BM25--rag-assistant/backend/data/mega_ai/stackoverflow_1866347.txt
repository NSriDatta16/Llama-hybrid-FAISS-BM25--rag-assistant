Tree Drag and Drop Functionality

label1 | | *label2 | *label3 |___label4 |___label5 I want a tree in this structure, having line between the nodes, also, instead of Open and Close Folders, I have added my own graphic there with label. I did by extending TreeItemRenderer Class. Now, I if iam dragging and dropping a child node ex:label5, and try i drop it above label1 here, it is getting dropped there. i.e.,it is becoming like label5 ----------> This should not happen.Child should be restricted from being added label1 above parent. | | _ label2 |_ *label3 |___label4 I need to restrict the same. Kindly help me regarding the same.
