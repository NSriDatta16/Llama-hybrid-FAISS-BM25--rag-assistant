Using machine learning to optimize parameter scores

I have a dataset containing fraud and non fraudulent data. The system in place is a rule based engine with over 20 rules. If the total score is above a certain threshold the payment is classified as fraudulent. What would be an effective way of using machine learning to optimize the assigned score to the different rules(fraud rules). Thanks
