This is not PHP-specific. Locality of reference for data often matters, because cache misses are expensive. For instance, if you're processing items in parallel arrays (all ?1 , then all ?2 ...), it is more efficient to organize them in memory as: A1 B1 C1 ... A2 B2 C2 ... A3 B3 C3 ... Instead of the typical: A1 A2 A3 ... B1 B2 B3 ... C1 C2 C3 ... Of course, it depends on your specific calculation. Loading your data into the first layout may take considerable time. In the end, profiling is the only way to be certain.
