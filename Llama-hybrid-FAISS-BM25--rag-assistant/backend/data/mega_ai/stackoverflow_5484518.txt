Is Java EE 6 something specific to an EJB container, such as JBoss or Glassfish? Java EE 6 is a specification. It's agnostic as to how that spec is implemented, but generally this is done by an appserver such as the two you mention. Does this mean that if you have an EE 6 container, it automatically supports JPA? Yes. JPA is part of JavaEE v5 and v6. Is JPA a specification, or an API? Both. The spec defines the semantics, the API defines the syntax. Are Hibernate, Kodo or OpenJPA, DataNucleus, EclipseLink, TopLink all implementation of the JPA specification? Yes. Different appservers ship with different JPA implementations. If the container I'm using supports / contains a JPA API, then I'd rather not deploy one with every application? That's the general idea. Use the services that your appserver provides. I had this idea in my head that Tomcat 7's JAR's may have it? I'm not familiar with v7 specifically, but Tomcat isn't a full JavaEE implementation (it provides JSP, servlets, and a couple of other things like JNDI), but not JPA. If you deploy to Tomcat, your application will need to package its own JPA implementation.
