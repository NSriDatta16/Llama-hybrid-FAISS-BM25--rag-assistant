Drag/Slide div inside overflow:hidden container on iPhone

I am creating a wepapp, that has a horizontal menu. The menu is limited to 320px and has overflow set to hidden. Inside the links are wrapped in a div which has a width set to it. The list overflows on the x axis. I have applied a jquery plugin called OverScroll so you can drag this list left and right to reveal the hidden menu items. It works great on a desktop browser but I am having difficulty on getting this to work on the iphone. I have set up a demo at www.irfanyasin.com/iphone/ Any ideas? Thanks
