Would machine learning be able calculate such a range as an output if the input is df.age and df.survived? ...can a machine learning algorithm some how do this classification on their own. What you're asking about is a classic example of unsupervised learning and an application of clustering algorithms. Essentially you're looking for an algorithm that can find data points that are similar to each other (those with high survival rate) and at the same time dissimilar from others (those with low survival rate). A good place to start is k-means . As you'll read, the trick is finding the right number of clusters , k. In your example you have 3, but that's based on some analysis you did yourself. It's unclear if that's the "perfect" number of clusters. However there are ways to identify a good number of clusters vs. a bad number.
