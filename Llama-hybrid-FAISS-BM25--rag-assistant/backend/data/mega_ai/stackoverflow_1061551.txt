Prerequisites & Runtimes : My guess is that you have included a large number of merge modules , runtime packages or prerequisites such as the .NET framework in your MSI. A prerequisite like Crystal Reports is a common way to bloat your package. MSI File Fragmentation : Another possibility is that you have saved the MSI many times . MSI files are COM-structured storage files, and they don't feature any "defragmentation" of the internal streams. To determine if this is the problem, just open the MSI in Orca and do a Save As... If the file size is reduced, the problem (or part of it) was caused by file fragmentation. Old-Style Office Files : Note that the "Save As..." behavior is the same as in Office documents. When doing Save As on a Word document, for example, the file size may be drastically reduced. The cause of this is the "defragmentation" that occurs when the file content is streamed to a new file with no fragmentation. Newer versions of Office uses a Zip-format with XML and resources in there instead of COM structured storage files.
