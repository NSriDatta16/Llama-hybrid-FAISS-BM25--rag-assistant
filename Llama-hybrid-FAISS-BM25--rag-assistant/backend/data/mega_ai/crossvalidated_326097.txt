Adding any regularization (including L2) will increase the error on training set. This is exactly the point of the regularization, where we increase bias and reduce the variance of the model. Hopefully, if we regularized well, as a result, the testing error will be reduced with the regularization. Here are some related topics. What problem do shrinkage methods solve? How to know if a learning curve from SVM model suffers from bias or variance?
