It doesn't surprise me that Bayesian data analysis by Gelman et al. does not cover ICC since it is a general handbook about Bayesian methods, so it cannot cover everything. For more focused book you can check handbook by Lee and Wagenmakers (2014) that describes similar kind of models (but as far as I remember does not describe ICC per se ). Recently ICC is defined in terms of random effects model (Gelman & Hill, 2007): $$ y_{ij} = \mu + \alpha_j + \varepsilon_{ij} $$ where $y_{ij}$ is $i$-th observation for $j$-th group, $\mu$ is overall mean, $\alpha_i$ is a random effect, and $\varepsilon_{ij}$ is error term. So we have random variables $$ \alpha_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_\alpha^2) \\ \varepsilon_{ij} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_\varepsilon^2) $$ and ICC is defined as $$ \frac{\sigma_\alpha^2}{\sigma_\alpha^2+\sigma_\varepsilon^2} $$ If $\sigma_\alpha^2$ is variance explained by $\alpha_i$ grouping factor and $\sigma_\varepsilon^2$ is variance unexplained by it, then ICC is a fraction of total variance explained by grouping. This means that you are interested in Bayesian estimation of hierarchical/random effects models that are nicely described by Gelman and Hill (2007). Since you will be mostly focused on variance components, you can check paper by Gelman (2006) who discusses choosing priors for them. Finally, you can easily find multiple papers focusing directly on Bayesian estimation of ICC, e.g. Burch and Harris (1999), Ahmed and Shoukri (2010), Jelenkowska (1998), or Chung and Dey (1998), to name some. But honestly, I never studied this topic in detail since ICC can be misleading and interpreting variances directly seems to be more straightforward approach. Gelman, A. & Hill, J. (2007).
