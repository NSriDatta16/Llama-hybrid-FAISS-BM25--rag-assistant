Have you considered using a simple notification pattern? You could have your service layer raise events such as NewObject, ChangedObject, DeletedObject that, will be listened to by a generic service layer which can then take the object and save the results. If you want to save the state of the object you could leverage Xml Serialization. Another approach is available if your using SQL Server 2008 you can implement the new Auditing features which will let you audit changes to database records you can even track (I think) when the data is read.
