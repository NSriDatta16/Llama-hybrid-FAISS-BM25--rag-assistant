Unique ID for MS Word 2007 paragraph

I am writing large MS Word 2007 documents, which are often being changed. I have to number paragraphs with stationary unique numbers, that will not change while changing the documents. The numbers should be unique, and will not change even if previous numbers are deleted. The order of the list is not mandatory, and addition of a new number before existing numbers is possible (for instance: the sequence 1, 4, 3 means that paragraphs 1-3 were written, then #2 was deleted, then #5 was added. #3 was not affected by the later editing) The mechanism should be internal to the document, as I am working on line and off line. The numbers are allocated to every document individually. Since I don't know to program under MS Word, I'd appreciate getting a complete solution.
