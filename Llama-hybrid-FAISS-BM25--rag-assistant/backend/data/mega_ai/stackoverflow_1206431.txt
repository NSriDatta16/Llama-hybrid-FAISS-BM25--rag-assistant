The proxy class is a generated file and as such it can contain mistakes. If you have a copy of the data contract you are free to change the proxy class to use the correct type rather than System.Object and things ought to work properly. The Visual Studio "Add Service Reference" tool and svcutil.exe are very good at generating proxy classes but they are not perfect. The files that they generate are yours to modify and I would encourage you to simply modify the operation to return the proper data contract.
