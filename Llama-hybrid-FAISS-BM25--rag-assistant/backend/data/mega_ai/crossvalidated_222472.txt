Calculate the root mean square deviation in a sliding window over the course of a time series. Set a threshold to define "Convergence". Stop when the root mean square value falls below the threshold. i.e. $$WindowRMSD_j=\sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-\bar{x})^2 }{n-1}}$$ where $n$ is the window size, $j$ is the current window, $x_i$ is the $i$th value in the window, and $\bar{x}$ is the mean of the values in the window. The first element in the window should begin with the index $i=0$. As the time-series approaches convergence, the WindowRMSD will approach zero if the values converge.
