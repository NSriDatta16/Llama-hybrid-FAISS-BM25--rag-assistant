R: Checklist for data checking

I am new to data science and new to R. I see a lot of resources on data cleaning (i.e., dplyr, tidyr, tidyverse), but not so much on raw value verification. What are the "best practices" I should apply to verify the accuracy of the raw values or detect possible coding errors before cleaning? For example, I have been told you should ensure NAs are true NAs, or ensure there are no spaces in front of numerical or character values after you import data into R. Thanks in advance.
