Importing access keys and secrets to an Android device

I've got an app that can save stuff you like to Google Storage for Developers . Assuming, of course, that you have an account and associated access keys. Their web based key management tool allows you to create keys and associated secrets. My question is regarding how a user can most easily install these in their copy of my app, allowing them to use the cloud storage. A key is a 20 character alphanumeric string, and an associated secret is a 40 character Base-64 encoded string. It is clearly impractical for the user to enter these manually. Cut and paste across activities seems way awkward to me. How do you suggest getting two strings from a web page to two activity EditText fields - or to a tmp file I can read and then dispose - or ?? thanks.
