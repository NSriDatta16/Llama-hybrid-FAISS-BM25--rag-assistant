Take a look at Repeated Measures Correlation . There you can see when it comes for repeated measures and linear regression one common solution is to average the repeated measures data for each participant prior to performing the correlation. That means, averaging repeated measures (as you proposed) to resolve the issue of non-independence in the errors is not wrong but it can produce misleading results if there are meaningful individual differences. Despite of the solution proposed by the cited article, one can also use panel linear models (i.e. adjusting for the subject effect) which can be seen as the econometric analogon to linear mixed-effects models. Analog informations are provided in Correlation Coefficients for a Study with Repeated Measures
