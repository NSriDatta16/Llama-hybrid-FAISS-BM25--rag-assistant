not sure about python but this will read a text file and open windows let me see if I can get tabs for you though set locations to paragraphs of (read (choose file with prompt "Pick text file containing urls")) repeat with aline in locations if length of aline is greater than 0 then tell application "Safari" make new document at end of documents set URL of document 1 to aline end tell end if end repeat EDIT: Ok this is better and it opens them in tabs of a single window set locations to paragraphs of (read (choose file with prompt "Pick text file containing urls")) tell application "Safari" activate set adoc to make new document end tell repeat with aline in locations if length of aline is greater than 0 then tell application "Safari" to make new tab at end of window 1 with properties {URL:aline} end if end repeat New Addtion this is yet another way based on regulus6633's post in conjunction with mine set locations to paragraphs of (read (choose file with prompt "Pick text file containing urls")) repeat with aLocation in locations tell application "Safari" to open location aLocation end repeat
