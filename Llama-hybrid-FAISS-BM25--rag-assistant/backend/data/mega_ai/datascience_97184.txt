How to handle imbalanced NLP text data set e.g. some classes only have 2 records

I am working on a dataset with around 2000 records. Around 80% records have their the categorical labels. There are around 200 categories, some categories got more than 20 records; whereas others only have TWO.... Considering this is a text dataset, so I cannot do the oversampling for minority categories with techniques like what I could do for images. I am using Fast AI which is based on PyTorch. So what can I do for it?
