No you can't get the raw logs, but there's nothing stopping you from getting the exact same data logged to your own web server logs. Have a look at the Urchin code and borrow that, changing the following two lines to point to your web server instead. var _ugifpath2="http://www.google-analytics.com/__utm.gif"; if (_udl.protocol=="https:") _ugifpath2="https://ssl.google-analytics.com/__utm.gif"; You'll want to create a __utm.gif file so that they don't show up in the logs as 404s. Obviously you'll need to parse the variables out of the hits into your web server logs. The log line in Apache looks something like this. You'll have lots of "fun" parsing out all the various stuff you want from that, but everything Google Analytics gets from the basic JavaScript tagging comes in like this. 127.0.0.1 - - [02/Oct/2008:10:17:18 +1000] "GET /__utm.gif?utmwv=1.3&utmn=172543292&utmcs=ISO-8859-1&utmsr=1280x1024&utmsc=32-bit&utmul=en-us&utmje=1&utmfl=9.0%20%20r124&utmdt=My%20Web%20Page&utmhn=www.mydomain.com&utmhid=979599568&utmr=-&utmp=/urlgoeshere/&utmac=UA-1715941-2&utmcc=__utma%3D113887236.511203954.1220404968.1222846275.1222906638.33%3B%2B__utmz%3D113887236.1222393496.27.2.utmccn%3D(organic)%7Cutmcsr%3Dgoogle%7Cutmctr%3Dsapphire%2Btechnologies%2Bsite%253Arumble.net%7Cutmcmd%3Dorganic%3B%2B HTTP/1.0" 200 35 "http://www.mydomain.com/urlgoeshere/" "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/525.19 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/0.2.153.1 Safari/525.19"
