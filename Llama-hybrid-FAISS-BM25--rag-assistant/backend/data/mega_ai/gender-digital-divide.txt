Gender digital divide refers to the inequalities in access to, use of, and participation in digital technologies and the technology sector based on gender. It encompasses disparities in digital skills, internet access, representation in computing and STEM fields, and exposure to gender-biased technologies such as artificial intelligence and voice assistants. The divide is shaped by broader socio-economic, cultural, and educational factors and is more pronounced among women and gender minorities in developing countries, rural areas, and lower-income populations. Despite global efforts to close this gap, significant challenges remain, including patriarchal norms, safety concerns, affordability issues, and limited access to digital education. Addressing the gender digital divide is considered essential for achieving broader gender equality, inclusive economic development, and equitable digital transformation. Background Education systems are increasingly trying to ensure equitable, inclusive, and high-quality digital skills, education, and training. Though digital skills open pathways to further learning and skills development, women and girls are still being left behind in digital skills education. Globally, digital skills gender gaps are growing, despite at least a decade of national and international efforts to close them. The economic and political interests of its indicators have also been questioned. Digital skills gap Women are less likely to know how to operate a smartphone, navigate the internet, use social media and understand how to safeguard information in digital mediums (abilities that underlie life and work tasks and are relevant to people of all ages) worldwide. There is a gap from the lowest skill proficiency levels, such as using apps on a mobile phone, to the most advanced skills like coding computer software to support the analysis of large data sets. Women in numerous countries are 25% less likely than men to know how to leverage ICT for basic purposes, such as using simple arithmetic formulas in a spreadsheet. UNESCO estimates that men are around four times more likely than women to have advanced ICT skills such as the ability to programme computers. Across G20 countries 7% of ICT patents are generated by women, and the global average is at 2%. Recruiters for technology companies in Silicon Valley estimate that the applicant pool for technical jobs in artificial intelligence (AI) and data science is often less than 1% female. To highlight this difference, in 2009 there were 2.5 million college-educated women working in STEM compared to 6.7 million men. The total workforce at the time was 49% women and 51% men which highlights the evident gap. While the gender gap in digital skills is evident across regional boundaries and income levels, it is more severe for women who are older, less educated, poor, or living in rural areas and developing countries. Making women much less likely to graduate in any field of STEM compared to their male counterpart. Digital skills gap intersects with issues of poverty and educational access. Root causes Women and girls who live in patriarchal cultures may struggle more than those who do not to access public ICT facilities. Due to the social challenges these cultures create as well reinforces the struggles and creates an overlap. They may struggle to access these facilities due to unsafe roads, limits on their freedom of movement, or because the facilities themselves are considered unsuitable for women. They may also lack financial freedom creating a large barrier to purchase any form of technology or have any type of internet connection. If they do have access to technology of the internet, it is usually controlled by the men in their households and limit their content selection to content focused on women's appearances, dating, or the role of motherhood. Fears concerning safety and harassment (both online and offline) also inhibit many women and girls from benefiting from or e
