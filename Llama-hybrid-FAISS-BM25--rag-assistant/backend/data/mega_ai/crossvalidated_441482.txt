Full model (with significant and non-significant parameters) is given in Suvanto et al. 2019. In detail it consists from 17 estimates (last 2 of them are second-order interactions). Although one solution to your question would be to use some internal R function, here I show you some internal details of how it really works (i.e. GLM with logit and interactions). Suvanto, S., Peltoniemi, M., Tuominen, S., Strandstr√∂m, M., & Lehtonen, A. (2019). High-resolution mapping of forest vulnerability to wind for disturbance-aware forestry and climate change adaptation. bioRxiv, 666305. Note: you need this mini function logit2prob to convert value given by model equation ( logit ) to odds and finaly into probability (p). Creating function according to model output: library(car) logit2prob Notice, that variables which enter the function ends either with .BIN or .CONT. This is for you to know what to insert. In case of .BIN use either 0 or 1. In cace of .CONT, use exact value of continual variable (f.e. temperature). Another important thing. In model details you can find, that tree species could be given in 3 categories (pine, spruce, other) , but as you can see only estimates for spruce and other care listed. This is not TRUE. Estimate for pine is in fact the value of Intercept. So in case that you are estimating for pine , the input looks like this: forest.damage.function(spec.spruce.BIN = **0**, spec.other.BIN = **0**,...etc.) If you are estimating for spruce , the input looks like this: forest.damage.function(spec.spruce.BIN = **1**, spec.other.BIN = **0**,...etc.) The same ("the Intercept thing" listed above) is true for all other categorical variables. # example uf use... forest.damage.function(spec.spruce.BIN = 1, spec.other.BIN = 0, height.CONT = 5, last_thinning.6.10.BIN = 0, last_thinning.over.10.BIN = 1, wind.CONT = 35, open_stand_border.BIN = 1, soil_min.fine.BIN = 1, soil_organic.BIN = 0, soil_depth.more.30cm.BIN = 1, site_fertility.BIN = 1, temperature_sum.CONT = 350, damage_density.2to3.BIN = 0, damage_density.morethan3.BIN = 1)
