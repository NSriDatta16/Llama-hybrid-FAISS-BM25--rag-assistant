In my experience, its usually best to let a thread exit gracefully by itself. How about having some common variable that the main thread could set to false if things go awry. The second thread could periodically check this variable and if it has been set to false, it knows it should clean up and return. I think you could use condition variables in a more elegant fashion, but his approach with the proper use of NSLock should work.
