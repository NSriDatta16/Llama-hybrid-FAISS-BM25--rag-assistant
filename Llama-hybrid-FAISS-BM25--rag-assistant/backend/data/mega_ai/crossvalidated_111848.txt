There is no general way to do this because the contribution of each variable will be different at different levels of the other variables. This is true in any logistic regression. But you can look at the contribution at particular levels of the other variables. In SAS there is a slice statement that does this. There is probably something similar in polr but you'd have to look at the documentation.
