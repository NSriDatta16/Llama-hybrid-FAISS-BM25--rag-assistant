I'll add some more thoughts to Nils' thorough answer. don't use doubles. I'm not familiar with NDS, but I doubt it's got any hardware for double math. I also doubt model view and projection are not already multiplied if you are reading the hardware registers. I have yet to see a hardware platform that does not use the full MVP in the registers directly. the matrix storage into registers may or may not be in the same order as OpenGL. if they are not, the multiplication matrix-vector needs to be done in the other order.
