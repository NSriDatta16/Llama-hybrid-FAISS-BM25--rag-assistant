If you mean [any destination port] to [one port] then you will have to rely on special drivers. The problem with windows is the inability to natively block [drop] packets. For example a common solution is winpcap. However, while you can monitor traffic, you cannot stop the traffic or modify it in a useful way. On windows the only solution I've seen would be to use some open TUN/TAP adapter . With that, you would be able to modify every packet that leaves your system. If you know beforehand the destination port you will be using then it gets rather simple. Simply write a passthrough c++ socket program that will only change the destination port. If you want to redirect browser requests then you can simply edit the settings in your browser.
