You've left the default value for n_iter , 10, in the search. That's way too low for most uses with more than a couple important hyperparameters, and especially if your search space contains large regions of poorly performing hyperparameter combinations. In particular, I think your tree complexity controls are too often too strict: a small depth or large min samples per split or leaf or small max leaves will likely cause underfitting. You could jump n_iter to 60-100, shrink the ranges of those parameters to less-strict ones (or don't select uniformly), and/or just search over fewer of those similar-purpose hyperparameters. The random forests with very few trees are likely to have unstable scores, as well; better not to search that hyperparameter, and just leave it at something large-ish.
