How can backpropagation through convolutional neural networks be vectorized?

I have got a good grasp of backpropagation algorithm for fully connected neural networks and I can derive the vectorized implementation for it but after getting into convulutional networks, I think due to my not-so-strong linear algebra background, I have a lot of trouble trying to come up with a fully vectorized implementation for backpropagation. The network architecture is as follows :- Input->conv->relu->pool->fully_connected_network I have used only one convolutional Layer for simplifaication How can the vectorized implementation of this network be derived ?
