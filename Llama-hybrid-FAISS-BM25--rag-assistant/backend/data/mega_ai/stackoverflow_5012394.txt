Although I do not know the ragel .But looking at the code it seems that it converts a string into a number .If you remember ASCII value of numbers 0-9 range from 48 to 57.Thus suppose input string is '123' so you are obtaining first character and subtracting it by 48 to obtain its value that is 1.And then multiplying by 10 form the decimal number 123.
