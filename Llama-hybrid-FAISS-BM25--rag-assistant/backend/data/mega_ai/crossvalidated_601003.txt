Overdispersion in logistic regression --- Use beta-binomial?

I have some cell counts obtained via flow cytometry - simply put, I have the amount of positive cells (Successes) from the overall number of cells (Successes + Failures). Based on the data structure, I thought to use a classic binomial/logistic regression. After performing the regression, using packages such as DHarma , I realized that the model is overdispersed. One of the things I've read is that you can use beta-binomial regression to solve some overdispersion problems. What I would like to know is: Is it reasonable to look for other distribution families (e.g. beta-binomial or quasibinomial) when overdispersion occurs? and Is beta-binomial a good idea to solve my problem?
