Is there a language that encourages good coding practices?

While I love PHP I find its biggest weakness is that it allows and even almost encourages programmers to write bad code. Is there a language that encourages good programming practices? Or, more specifically, a web-related language that encourages good practices. I'm interested in languages who have either a stated goal of encouraging good programming or are designed in such a way as to encourage good programming.
