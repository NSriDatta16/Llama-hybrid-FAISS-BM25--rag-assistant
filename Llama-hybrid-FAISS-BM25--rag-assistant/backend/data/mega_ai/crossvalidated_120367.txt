You will be best off using ordinal logistic regression . There are at least four ways to do this in R (meaning different functions in different packages). The uniformly excellent UCLA statistics help site has a fairly comprehensive tutorial (albeit using only polr in MASS) here . There is a nice overview of the different possibilities here (it is primarily code you can run, with less explanation). Note that there isn't really such a thing as R-squared for generalized linear models such as ordinal logistic regression. There are a number of so-called pseudo R-squareds, but it is important to understand what each one measures (there is a nice guide here ), and their value is debatable (for an overview of the issues, see this excellent CV thread: Which pseudo $R^2$ is the one to report for logistic regression ).
