post hoc power analysis on secondary data using Binary Logistic Regression

I am currently analysing a series of data collected annually. each year varies, however, it is convenience sampled. one year, for example, has a sample of 2427 positive cases, of a known population of 251800. I am using binary logistic regression to investigate the cases by subgroup and demographic. I have been asked by my supervisor to provide a post-hoc power analysis and don't understand which method to use, given I know the population, and the cases.
