Testing Code for Embedded Application

Background: I am developing a largish project using at Atmel AVR atmega2560. This project contains a lot of hardware based functions (7 SPI devices, 2 I2C, 2 RS485 MODBUS ports, lots of Analogue and Digital I/O). I have developed "drivers" for all of these devices which provide the main application loop with an interface to access the required data. Question: The project I am developing will eventually have to meet SIL standards. I would like to be able to test the code and provide a good level of code coverage. However I am unable to find any information to get me started on how such a testing framework should be set up. The idea is that I can have a suite of automated tests which will allow future bug fixes and feature additions to be tested to see if they break the code. The thing is I don't understand how the code can be tested on chip. Do I require hardware to monitor the I/O on the device and emulate externally connected devices? Any pointers that could be provided would be highly appreciated. --Steve
