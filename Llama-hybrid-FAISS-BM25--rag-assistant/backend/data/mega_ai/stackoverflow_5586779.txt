found the prob... very basic. There's a diff between and the transformer when doing transformer.Transform(navigator, Nothing, output) is case sensitive when it uses the xslt file. the xml tag is Dr the xslt tag is I've used the debugger to track that enabling the transformer debugger // Enable XSLT debugging. XslCompiledTransform xslt = new XslCompiledTransform(true); Enjoy !!
