Is there an XSLT name-of element?

In XSLT there is the to get the value of an element, but is there something to select the tag-name of the element? In a situation like this: Robert programmer photography : To get output like this: name : Robert profession : programmer hobby : photography Of course the above XSLT won't compile because doesn't exist. But how could this be done?
