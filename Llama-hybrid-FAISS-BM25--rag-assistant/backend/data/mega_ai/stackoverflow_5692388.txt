As you found out, dragging it into Xcode is all you usually need to do. When you release the drop you get the sheet that asks if you want to copy it the project directory and also has the add to target table which by default has the target checked. Having the target checked is the magic part. Doing so causes the library to be added to the link build phase. If you ever forget to check the target when adding or have a situation like you add a 2nd target and want some libraries with it while other libraries are with the first target, you can manage that by selecting the project in project navigator and then the target in the detail view. In the Build Phases tab there's the Link Binary With Libraries phase. It lists which libraries that target is linking against. You can add or remove libraries to it as needed.
