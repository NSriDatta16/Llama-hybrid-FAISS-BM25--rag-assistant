vbscript/WSH is actually what Microsoft wants you to use - unfortunately, I've written a few of those and it is not pleasant - I totally agree with Mikael - if you know what systems will be running the scripts and you can install interpretters on them, go with a scripting language like Python or Ruby Of course it depends on what type of automation you need to do - if you're messing with the OS or Active Directory settings, go with WSH - but for your average file housekeeping, use Python or Ruby
