A few things. The fact that the data in the DB server is not encrypted in no way is a factor in the communication between the User and the Web Server. It is a concern obviously for communications between the web server and the database server. Your risk point between user and web server is in that packets could be sniffed if a person was able to interject in the middle of the communication chain. However, this risk is mitigated by the fact that your on an internal network. Therefore, unless you are VERY concerned about the other people in your organization, you are more than likely ok. However, if it is really sensitive data, you might do ALL communications via SSL to ensure that it is transmitted securely. IF you are this concerned, then I would also look at the security of the DB and the communications from DB to webserver.
