Setting Entity Framework Fields

I generated a Members table and a MembersType table which has a primary key which links to the Type foreign key in the Members table. The MembersType table is literally just 3 records, so that each Member can be of MemberType 1, 2 or 3. Now the problem is that when Entity Framework generates the data layer and objects for the Members object, it creates a MemberType object in the Members object, but all I want to be able to do when setting it is: Members.MemberType = 1; but because of the above, I have to do this: MemberTypes = db.MemberTypes.Where(x => x.MemberTypeId == 1).AsQueryable().First() Is there anyway to stop it from generating an object on foreign keys so I can just set it as an int? Surely this is more quicker and resource efficient than querying the type table everytime too.
