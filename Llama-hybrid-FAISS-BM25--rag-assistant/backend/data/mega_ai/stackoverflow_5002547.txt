Firstly, if you want to quote table names, then you need to use back ticks not single quotes. A single quote is only used for string literals. Secondly, CHANGE is used when you want to rename the column, whereas MODIFY allows you to change the column definition without renaming it. So you should be using: ALTER TABLE compdetails MODIFY compName varchar(60) NOT NULL; The online MySQL documentation is very good and I would encourage you to check it whenever you come across problems with syntax.
