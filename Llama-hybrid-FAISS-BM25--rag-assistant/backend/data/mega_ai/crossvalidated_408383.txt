You can't decide on the significance level of a test after calculating a p-value. If the prespecified alpha level was 0.05, you can say the test is significant at that level. (You don't reject the null hypothesis just because p-value is small, suppose your alpha level was even lower. You can't say anything about the sign of the two samples that you put in this test. The 95% confidence interval just tells you the mean of X is lower than Y. (the average of the CI will give you the actual mean difference). But X mean could be 100 and Y mean could be 102 or X mean could be -100 and Y mean could be -98 and the results are the same.
