Python + R: How much R do I need to know to use random R libraries in python Using Rpy2

I'm just getting into data science from a qualitative background, and I want to be able to do the most stuff with least amount of overhead. (mostly machine learning and agent based modeling). I'm currently learning python, and would hate to switch languages in the middle of my coursera class mitx 6.00x. Also, I like that python is better for other stuff like scripting, data munging, NLP etc. However, I am eventually going to need to use some R packages (probably) it seems. Can I get away with learning only a minimum of R (how much and what exactly), if I learn pyhton + packages and use Rpy2 to access random R libraries, or would i still have to learn both languages fully?
