The reason for the change in order is that the q-value measures a fundamentally different thing than the p-value. q-value is the false detection rate (FDR) at a given level of statistical significance. Let's say your 5th lowest observed p-value was 0.02 and by using some statistical method you estimated that you would get on average 2 false positive detections by using this threshold for significance. This would give an FDR of $2/5 = 0.4$ . Let's then say that the 8th lowest p-value was 0.045 and the estimated number of false positives was 3. Then $q = 3/8 = 0.375$ . The order of q-values doesn't match the p-values.
