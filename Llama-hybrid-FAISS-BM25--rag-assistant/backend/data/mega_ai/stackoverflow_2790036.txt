IntelliJ 9 and Android - Filtering LogCat

Having got fed up with Eclipse I switched my IDE over to IntelliJ and so far have not looked back (Granted only been using it for a day or so). I never used ADT drag and drop layout editing either preferring to code my XML layouts by hand or in DroidDraw, so this was never a problem. However, one thing I do miss is the ability to filter out the LogCat display depending on the Tag I am using. I've found that you can put a Search Query into the box and that acts like a filter, but there's no way to get it into it's own tab and it's also a pain flicking back and forth between that and the full LogCat view. The search also includes some type of drop down and I was hoping this would be filled in by what ever I searched for, but I can not get it to function at all, it's always blank. I've searched through the documentation and can not find anything. Does anyone know how I can use this search box to act like a multiple filter choice, or if I am missing something and IntelliJ already includes this ?
