Stationarity of time series when there is a clear trend

Hi I'm new to time series analysis and analyzing mobility level time series these days. The mobility level time series show a clear trend (increasing over time); however when I run Augmented Dickey Fuller test to see if the time series object (without de-trend or de-seasonality) is stationary, it gives me a p-value of Also, I'm using R studio to analyze the time series object. When I run adf.test, it gives me a result like below: Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test data: mobility.ts Dickey-Fuller = -4.8819, Lag order = 4, p-value = 0.01 alternative hypothesis: stationary However, after I import aTSA (Alternative Time Series Analysis) package, it gives me the result : Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test alternative: stationary Type 1: no drift no trend lag ADF p.value [1,] 0 -1.464 0.153 [2,] 1 -1.019 0.313 [3,] 2 -0.193 0.587 [4,] 3 0.113 0.675 Type 2: with drift no trend lag ADF p.value [1,] 0 -3.32 0.0183 [2,] 1 -2.60 0.0992 [3,] 2 -1.45 0.5367 [4,] 3 -1.21 0.6240 Type 3: with drift and trend lag ADF p.value [1,] 0 -4.35 0.0100 [2,] 1 -3.71 0.0273 [3,] 2 -2.40 0.4080 [4,] 3 -2.06 0.5479 ---- I am a bit confused why the p-values are different and why the first case rejects the null hypothesis and the second case doesn't.
