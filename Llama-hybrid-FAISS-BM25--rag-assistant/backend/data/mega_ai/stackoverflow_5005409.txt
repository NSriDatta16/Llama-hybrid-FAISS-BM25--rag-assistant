Exception with Resolving assemblies: Attempt to load an unverifiable executable with fixups

I'm embedding required assemblies to my project and resolving them on runtime with AppDomain.CurrentDomain.AssemblyResolve event. All works okay except irrKlang 's .net4-wrapper, which throws an exception if i try so; System.IO.FileLoadException: Attempt to load an unverifiable executable with fixups (IAT with more than 2 sections or a TLS section.) (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80131019) at System.Reflection.RuntimeAssembly.nLoadImage(Byte[] rawAssembly, Byte[] rawSymbolStore, Evidence evidence, StackCrawlMark& stackMark, Boolean fIntrospection, SecurityContextSource securityContextSource) at System.Reflection.Assembly.Load(Byte[] rawAssembly) at xyz.Utility.Helpers.AssemblyManager.Resolver(Object sender, ResolveEventArgs args) in C:\Users\shalafi\Desktop\xyz\trunk\xyz\Utility\Helpers\AssemblyManager.cs:line 55 at System.AppDomain.OnAssemblyResolveEvent(RuntimeAssembly assembly, String assemblyFullName) Basicly i suspect of CLR not being able to load mixed mode assemblies with Assembly.Load(byte[]) though i'm not sure. I was not able to find anything related to the exception message; Attempt to load an unverifiable executable with fixups (IAT with more than 2 sections or a TLS section.) Help appreciated.
