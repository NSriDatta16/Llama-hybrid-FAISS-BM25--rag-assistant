Robust LMM or Random Forest?

I have non-normally distributed, heteroscedacic and autocorrelated data. To overcome these issues I would like to use robust linear mixed models with the robustlmm package in R or random forest regression. Which do you think is better suited? My continuous response is yield [dt/ha] and my fixed effect predictor variables are weed coverage [%, continuous], soil moisture content [%, continuous], distance [categorical] and treatment[categorical]. Date, Site and Plot shall be modeled as random effects. I am quite new to statistics, so short and easy answers with as less math as possible are highly appreciated. :) Thanks a lot in advance!
