Just do an average over all points and use it as the position of rectangle sides.. of course this assumes you are able to distinguish the four sides of the rectangle otherwise you could try a way to split the coordinates into 4 sides (by checking the horizontal and vertical variation with some threshold) and then compute the average for each side and adjust it to link sides.
