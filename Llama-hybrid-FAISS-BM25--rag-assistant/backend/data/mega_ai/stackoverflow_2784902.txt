Personally, I have some resentment for built-in pop-ups and dialog boxes, maybe because they block browser completely (including other tabs). A site employing them will likely never see me again. Never used twitter, but gmail message style seems very balanced to me. You always notice them, but they never distract too much. As another option, overlay windows are often helpful for showing important message or requesting decision, especially in ajax-based application. Some nice touches: graying out rest of the page to grab attention and dismissing message window when user clicks anywhere outside of it. Nice big buttons also help: I hate to practice in sharpshooting with my mouse :p Progress bar or 'busy' indicator is obviously needed, although I don't see two principally different ways to implement it. My two cents.
