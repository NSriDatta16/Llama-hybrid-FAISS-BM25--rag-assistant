Market fragmentation for 3d hardware has always been a huge problem. There is no simple answer. You need to define who your uses are. Is this a casual-oriented game that you intend to sell to people who haven't updated their computer in years? Is this a business application that is aimed at workstation-grade hardware? Are you just looking for an average middle-of-the-road game-buyer? Is this something simpler than a game like a screensaver that you plan to sell to people who don't buy games at all? Do you need to support laptops? Netbooks? The market fragmentation is considerably worse with OpenGL than it is with DirectX. The official standard requirements from the Khronos Group are all well and good. But the hardware vendors tend to be very slow to update their drivers to match the standard. Many features are required by the GL spec, but are only implemented in a fallback software path that is absolutely unusable in commercial software. The new OpenGL 3.1 spec tries to improve this situation by removing support for most older, poorly supported features. But if you need to support hardware more than a couple years old (or most modern Intel integrated GPUs) then GL 3.1 would be aiming too high. A good place to start for general hardware usage stas among game purchasers is the Steam Hardware Survey ( http://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey ). Steam is the most popular digital game distribution service that covers a variety of games from casual to core. They reset the numbers periodically to keep it current. Last year they reported that they had 25 million active users, so the sample population is pretty good. So you probably need to narrow your target customer group down more. I would recommend picking some recent competing applications that you consider to have a similar customer base to yours and basing your target hardware around what they require.
