Does PostgreSQL support transparent compressing of tables (fragments)?

I'm going to store large amount of data (logs) in fragmented PostgreSQL tables (table per day). I would like to compress some of them to save some space on my discs, but I don't want to lose the ability to query them in the usual manner. Does PostgreSQL support such a transparent compression and where can I read about it in more detail? I think there should be some well-known magic name for such a feature.
