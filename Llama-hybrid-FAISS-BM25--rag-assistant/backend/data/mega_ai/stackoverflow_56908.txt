C#: Create a virtual drive in Computer

Is there any way to create a virtual drive in "(My) Computer" and manipulate it, somewhat like JungleDisk does it? It probably does something like: override OnRead(object sender, Event e) { ShowFilesFromAmazon(); } Are there any API:s for this? Maybe to write to an XML-file or a database, instead of a real drive. The Dokan Library seems to be the answer that mostly corresponds with my question, even though System.IO.IsolatedStorage seems to be the most standardized and most Microsoft-environment adapted.
