If you've set: config.time_zone = 'UTC' In your environment.rb (it's there by default), then times will automagically get converted into UTC when ActiveRecord stores them. Then if you set Time.zone (in a before_filter on application.rb is the usual place) to the user's Time Zone, all the times will be automagically converted into the user's timezone from the utc storage. Just be careful with Time.now. Also see: http://mad.ly/2008/04/09/rails-21-time-zone-support-an-overview/ http://errtheblog.com/posts/49-a-zoned-defense - you can use the JS here to detect zones Hope that helps.
