I would have expected multiarray to be just as efficient. But I'm getting similar results on a PPC Mac using gcc. I also tried multiarrayref, so that both versions were using the same storage with no difference. This is good to know, since I use multiarray in some of my code, and just assumed it was similar to hand-coding.
