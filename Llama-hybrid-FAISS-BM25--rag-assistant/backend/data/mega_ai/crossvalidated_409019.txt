The easiest way to measure if the anxiety is changing over time is to apply a Moving average . The second question is very hard to answer: first, you have to know, what the distribution of your data is like? Is it Gaussian normal? Is it uniform? Has it fat tails? Once you determined the nature of your distribution, you can figure out, how probable a given value is, and then say something like "ok, a 2 has a probability of 10%, so it is ok, a 1 has a probability of 1%, so I have to interfere". This last statement comes from the idea, that the most important events are events of high negative impact and low probability of occurence. Obviously, you have to define the threshold where you interefere by yourself.
