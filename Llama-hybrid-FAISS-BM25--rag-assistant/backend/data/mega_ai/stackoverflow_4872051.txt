There are no differences in server-side code. The main different is in the UI. While Microsoft tries to maintain a UI experience similar to Windows applications using its custom controls and the designer, you need a good knowledge in HTML and CSS if you want to create complex UI tasks. Custom controls actually generate client side code such as HTML, CSS and Javascript. So your main challenge will be the presentation layer and how to create client side code that is well parsed on different browsers. It's more difficult than Windows' "Drag and drop" technique, but it's quite a lot more powerful. You'll notice that you can't drag and move controls the way you do with Windows apps, changing their coordinates on the screen. HTML is not about coordinates, it's based on a certain document flow in manually defined layouts. Don't be tempted by changing Web controls to absolute positioning, just because you think it's "easier". It's a mistake a lot of migrators to ASP.NET do, and it's generally a huge mistake that I suggest you don't fall into.
