No need to create instance of the Files class, so either make all methods static as already suggested, or use such code pattern which in my opinion is more elegant: namespace Working_with_Files { public class Files { private static Files instance; public static Files Instance { get { return instance; } } static Files() { instance = new Files(); } private Files() { } public bool CheckFile(string path) ......no change in rest of code..... } } And to call the methods: Files.Instance.CheckFile("myfilehere")
