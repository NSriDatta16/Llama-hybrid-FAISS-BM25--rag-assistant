Why is CIHI recommending that we multiply the multiplicative error estimate by the per-capita rate?

I feel like this question is mostly about how to translate vague documentation into math than a statistics question per se , but please bear with me. I am reading the Canadian Institute for Health Information 's (CIHI) Cardiac Care Quality Indicators: General Methodology Notes 2020 . On page 8 they have the formula $$\text{Risk-Adjusted Rate} \triangleq \frac{[\text{Observed Cases}]}{[\text{Expected Cases}]} [\text{Canadian average rate}].$$ The observed cases are defined as the number of observed events (or numerator cases, such as actual number of deaths) , and the expected cases is defined as the number of expected events, adjusted for the distribution of risk factors in hospitals; coefficients are derived from regression models to obtain the expected number of cases. The Canadian average rate is just the relative frequency of the event in Canada. I have inferred that the (sample) ratio $$\frac{[\text{Observed Cases}]}{[\text{Expected Cases}]}$$ is an estimate of the multiplicative error of the model used to estimate the expected number of cases. This model happens to be a logistic regression , although I am not sure that has any bearing on my question. Rather, I am curious why they multiply by $[\text{Canadian average rate}]$ . At a glance I had thought this might be a conditional expectation but then I realized that we are not using the right probability for that. I also considered LOTUS , but that doesn't seem to work here either. So my question is broadly how is this definition motivated or justified and specifically why are we multiplying the multiplicative error estimate by the per-capita rate ? A colleague of mine found some related resources where a similar calculation is performed. https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://community.jmp.com/kvoqx44227/attachments/kvoqx44227/discussions/50682/1/PAPER225.PDF&ved=2ahUKEwiYgumAy_eCAxXarokEHcWJA6YQFnoECCcQAQ&usg=AOvVaw2b3Z7RT8qVA1hkcipA4nVZ https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1536867X19854021&ved=2ahUKEwiYgumAy_eCAxXarokEHcWJA6YQFnoECCEQAQ&usg=AOvVaw3oUPZSdkwWXcazhdqfGTRU
