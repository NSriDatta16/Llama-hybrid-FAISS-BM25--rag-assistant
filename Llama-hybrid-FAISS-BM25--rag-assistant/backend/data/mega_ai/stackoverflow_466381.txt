My small shop uses a pretty simple workflow: Anyone can create an issue (I think it's unnecessarily restrictive not to allow this) This includes customers and users of our open source projects. A change control board (sounds fancy, but it's just QA lead and head of engineering, plus product manager) reviews new issues and assigns fix version and priority Anyone can reassign a bug, to ask the reporter a question or pass on to another person to fix or test Anyone can mark a bug resolved Only QA can close a bug - we do this to enforce verification of each bug fix. This way, everything gets logged in the bug tracking system and we keep things efficient by not restricting updates. You can end up with a bit of "bug spam" this way, but it's better than creating bottlenecks in my experience. We use JIRA as our bug tracker - it's possible to set up all kinds of custom workflows in JIRA to enforce your particular process, but I've never found the need to do that in smaller organizations.
