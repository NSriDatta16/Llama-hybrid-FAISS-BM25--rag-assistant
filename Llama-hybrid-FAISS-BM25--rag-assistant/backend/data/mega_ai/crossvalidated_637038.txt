Is a database either a population or sample population?

I am writing a paper, and I hit a singular obstacle. What are databases in statistics nomenclature? How do we call databases in statistics vernacular? Populations or sample population or databases or just datasets Obviously, statisticians and data scientists make heavy use of the term dataset in statistical analysis, statistical learning (e.g. sample bootstrap), and machine learning. However, datasets are generally subsets of large databases (many linked data objects), but in the machine learning literature we notice few references of the database information system in statistical terms, even though datasets are made of disparate data-driven applications that often rely on a form of database to store data points. Thus, my question. If you can link some papers and how they use the term database in statistical terms, that will be useful. I want to be explicit that the focus of this question is on the statistician/data scientist viewpoint and not that of a database administrator or developer.
