http://www.microsoftpdc.com/ which is broadcast online next week, has as session entitled The Future of F#: Data and Services at your Finger Tips Don Syme listed. (We are always thinking about new ideas, but now that we are part of a shipping product (VS2010) with a typical release cadence (every couple years or so), it is likely that we will be a little less transparent in the months just after shipping a major release, as we start to "bake" some new ideas while encouraging people to use the shipped product... as time passes and it becomes time to ship some CTPs/Betas and whatnot, I expect you'll hear more about the future. Don's talk (and PDC in general) is somewhat forward-looking, I think.)
