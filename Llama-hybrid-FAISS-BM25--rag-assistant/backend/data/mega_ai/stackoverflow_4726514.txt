Try using littletable. It works with a list of objects, infers column names from object attributes, and supports simple query, join, and pivot table operations. One of the nice things is that the results of query and join operations are new, full-fledged, queryable littletables. littletable hasn't gotten a lot of attention or use yet, so I'd be very curious to hear your feedback/experience with it.
