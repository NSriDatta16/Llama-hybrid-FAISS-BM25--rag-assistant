Reducing Mean Square Error

The topic of mine is face recognition using artificial neural networks using MATLAB code. I tried my work by taking the images from web and started implementing the program by using neural networks. By typing nprtool command in MATLAB ,i started training, testing and validating the images from database. When i started to calculate the mean square error for each image ,the values of mse are being increased for each and every training. I need to decrease the mse. So is there any body to help me out in telling the command in MATLAB code. Its also helpful for me if any body provides me the exact MATLAB code for face recognition using artificial neural networks.
