Firstly pick one of the two languages, either Objective-C or Java, as learning both at once might not give you encouraging results and you're gonna have a lot on your hands than you can handle at one time. So, I'd suggest you go ahead with Java as Java is also going to be your first class. Java is huge, so keep it simple in the beginning and concentrate more on the fundamentals and you can build on top of that as you progress. And you can always ask questions here on SO. Also you probably might find the java classes easy as you've already been doing your homework. In addition to the java books already mentioned, I'd suggest you go ahead with the Sun's java tutorials. As a java beginner, you might also find this free book helpful: http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkapjava/
