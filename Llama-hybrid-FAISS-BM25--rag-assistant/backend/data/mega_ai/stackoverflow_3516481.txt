Database SQL Compatibility

I am deploying a Ruby on Rails application that I developed with Sqlite3 to a server with either MySQL or PostgreSQL. I quickly discovered that the "group by" and "strftime" functions that I am using heavily to produce by-month rollup reports are working differently or not compatible between the various databases. I can refactor my code to do the grouping, summing and averaging - but the database does such a nice job of it and reduces the processing required by the server! Advanced applications go beyond simple select and join. ActiveRecord gives us :group, but the DATABASES are not CONSISTENT. So my question is a matter of architecture - does anyone expect to create truly "database portable" applications in Ruby on Rails? Should I modify my codebase to work with MySQL only and forget about the other databases? Should I modify my codebase to do the advanced grouping, summing, and averaging? cheers - Don
