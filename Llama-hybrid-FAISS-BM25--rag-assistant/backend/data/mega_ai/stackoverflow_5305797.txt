What class contains this code? That matters as it's important if it's being created more than once. If it's created once in the process' lifetime, you can do this, if not you should lock a static object instance. I believe though that it's good practice to create a separate object that's used only for the purpose of locking, I've forgotten why. E.g.: IsolatedStorageFile storageObj; //initialized in the constructor (static) storageObjLock = new object(); ... // in some method lock(storageObjLock) { //save code }
