How to create a custom loss function from sklearn metrics in Keras?

I'd like to use the mutual information metric from sklearn as a loss function for a neural network in Keras, but I'm not sure how to do it. I'd like to try this because relationships in my dataset are non-linear and I believe it would help to use this metric instead. Posts about creating custom loss function are more than a year old so I was hoping there was maybe some easier way to do this as some of it goes above my head. Any idea about how to go about this? Thanks a lot
