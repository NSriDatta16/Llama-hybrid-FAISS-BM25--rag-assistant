Time series and regression with dataframes as features

I am working on a data science project where I have 4 different dataframes representing 4 different metrics (let's say, met1, met2, met3 and met4). These metrics are time series and each one of them was measured on 100 different individuals. The dataframes are structured as follow : Indexes : Time vector Columns : Number of individual (eg, 100 columns) The cells contain the value of the metric at a certain time (line) for a certain individual (column). Example for one metric : 0 1 2 ... 99 0 0.000241 0.000211 0.000125 ... 0.000227 1 0.000241 0.000248 0.000175 ... 0.000227 ... ... ... ... ... ... 39 0.000211 0.000351 0.000158 ... 0.00187 Questions : I want to build a simple regression model where the target is met1, as a function of met2 and met3 fixed (replaced by a given constant). How would one manage the data processing phase ? How can we manage features when they are dataframes and not simple vectors, to build the regression model ? Thank you for your help.
