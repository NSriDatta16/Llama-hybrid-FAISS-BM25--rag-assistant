Markov chains vs. HMM

Markov chains makes sense to me, I can use them to model probabilistic state changes in real life problems. Then comes the HMM. HMMs are said to be more suitable to model many problems than MCs. However, the problems people mention are somewhat complex to understand such as speech processing. So my question is can you describe a "real and simple" problem for which HMM is better suited than MC? and explain why? thanks
