White noise terms in moving average model

As many before, I lack the clear intuition behind the Moving Average model. Eventhough I read quite a few threads on CV. The Moving Average $MA(q)$ model consists of a constant and White Noise terms. $X_{t}=μ+ε_{t}+θ_{1}ε_{t−1}+⋯+θ_{q}ε_{t−q}$ By definition White noise terms are uncorrelated with zero mean and constant variance. Given that white noise is uncorrelated with respect to past realizations, makes it unpredictable. So why do we bother to include them in the model? Assuming the DGP follows an $MA(q)$ process: Why does it make sense to relate white noise terms with eachother ? How can $ε_{t}$ be White noise if it is by definition related to its past value $ε_{t-1}$ ? Since: $X_{t}=ε_{t}+θ_{1}ε_{t−1}$ $ε_{t}=θ_{1}ε_{t−1}-X_{t}$
