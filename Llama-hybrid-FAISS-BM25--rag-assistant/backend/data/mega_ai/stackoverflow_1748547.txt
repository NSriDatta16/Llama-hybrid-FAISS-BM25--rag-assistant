Query Problem in SQL Server

I have a problem writing a query. At the moment I can retrieve an hourly recording of percentages for each machine running and I've got a table which shows, on a daily basis, each percentage recorded for each machine per hour. The code looks like this: ....... WHERE (tblCheckResult.DateTime >= @DateFrom) AND (tblCheckResult.DateTime CheckID being the ID for the percentages. What I want to do is show an average Monthly recordings and a Yearly recordings e.g. Jan 80%, Feb 95% etc. Can anyone please advise? Thanks
