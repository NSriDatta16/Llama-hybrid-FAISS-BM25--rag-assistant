Even if the effects are not statistically significant, you should still include them in your interpretation of the model, with the caveat that the effect was not significant. As for interaction effects, it's typically a rule of thumb that one shouldn't include interactions without main effects (although as with all rules of thumbs, there are exceptions to the rule). So lets suppose you find only $\beta_3$ is significant in your results. I would still report all the estimated effects, but also note that we had only found enough evidence to conclude that SENT has a positive effect with firms of SIZE = 1. In terms of interpreting insignificant results, let's use the example that $\hat \beta_1 = 1$, but is insignificant: "We observed that in our sample, the average abnormal returns from firms of SENT = 1 with SIZE = 0 was 1 higher than the average of abnormal returns from firms with SENT = 0 and SIZE = 0. However, we did not observe enough evidence to conclude that this was a real systematic difference between these two groups, rather than the possibility of random chance".
