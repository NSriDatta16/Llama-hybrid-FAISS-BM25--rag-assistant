As it behooves a well designed memory allocator, there is only one way to allocate garbage collected memory. It is very fast, allocating merely requires adjusting a pointer. Much faster than the allocator that native code has to use. Which has a much more difficult job to do, once native memory is allocated it cannot be moved anymore. Which makes it hard to write an allocator that doesn't suffer from fragmentation. The counter-measures add overhead. Not an issue in a GC heap, it can compact. You cannot improve on the speed of the GC allocator.
