The difference between (sample) ACF and PACF is easy to see from the linear regression perspective. To get the sample ACF $\hat{\gamma}_h$ at lag $h$ , you fit the linear regression model $$ y_t = \alpha + \beta y_{t-h} + u_t $$ and the resulting $\hat{\beta}$ is $\hat{\gamma}_h$ . Because of (weak) stationarity, the estimate $\hat{\beta}$ is the sample correlation between $y_t$ and $y_{t-h}$ . (There are some trivial differences between how sample moments are computed between time series and linear regression contexts, but they are negligible when sample size is large.) To get the sample PACF $\hat{\rho}_h$ at lag $h$ , you fit the linear regression model $$ y_t = \alpha + \, ? y_{t-1} + \cdots + \, ? y_{t-h + 1} + \beta y_{t-h} + u_t $$ and the resulting $\hat{\beta}$ is $\hat{\rho}_h$ . So $\hat{\rho}_h$ is the "correlation between $y_t$ and $y_{t-h}$ after controlling for the intermediate elements." The same discussion applies verbatim to the difference between population ACF and PACF. Just replace sample regressions by population regressions. For a stationary AR(p) process, you'll find the PACF to be zero for lags $h > p$ . This is not surprising. The process is specified by a linear regression. $$ y_t = \phi_0 + \phi_1 y_{t-1} + \cdots \phi_p y_{t-p} + \epsilon_t $$ If you add an regressor (say $y_{t-p-1}$ ) on the right-hand side that is uncorrelated with the error term $\epsilon_t$ , the resulting coefficient (the PACF at lag $p+1$ in this case) would be zero.
