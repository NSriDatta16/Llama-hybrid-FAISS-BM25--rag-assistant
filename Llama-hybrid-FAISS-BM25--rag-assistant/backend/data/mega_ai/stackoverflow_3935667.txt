MVC2/Jquery validation issues

I have read the following: http://weblogs.asp.net/imranbaloch/archive/2010/08/23/asp-net-mvc-jquery-validation-and-validationsummary.aspx http://haacked.com/archive/2009/11/19/aspnetmvc2-custom-validation.aspx And still can't get the jQuery validation to work with MVC2. I can get non jQuery working but when i swap out the JS files it doesn't work. It's going on day 3 and I'm totally stuck at this point. So here is what I have. I appreciate your help. Site.Master " type="text/javascript"> " type="text/javascript"> " type="text/javascript"> " type="text/javascript"> " type="text/javascript"> ViewModel: namespace OurNamespace { [ExcludeFromCodeCoverage] public class OurDataModelView : PersistedDataModelView { public OurModelView () : base() { ID = -1; StartDate = DateTime.MinValue; EndDate = DateTime.MinValue; Description = string.Empty; Deleted = false; } [DisplayFormat(DataFormatString = "{0:MM/yyyy}")] public DateTime? StartDate { get; set; } [DisplayFormat(DataFormatString = "{0:MM/yyyy}")] public DateTime? EndDate { get; set; } [Required(ErrorMessage="Description is required.")] [StringLength(250000, ErrorMessage = "A maximum of 250000 characters are allowed")] public string Description { get; set; } public int? ID { get; set; } public bool Deleted { get; set; } } } ASPX page " %> ... ... our partial view that validation is done on: " %> ... model.ID) %> Description model.Description)%> model.Description) %> ... * *SO by doesn't work here is what I do see. on view source I see: // However, client side validation is not appearing. I click on the textarea type in a char and delete it unfocus from the element and nothing happens. Any ideas for debugging this?
