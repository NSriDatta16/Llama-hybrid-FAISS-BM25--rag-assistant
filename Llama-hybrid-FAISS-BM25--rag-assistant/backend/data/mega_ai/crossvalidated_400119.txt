Okay, so with help from @whuber and @Nick Cox (thank you!), I think I can now answer this for a folded root with $\lambda=(1/2)$ . a. @Nick Cox gives the formula $f(p) = p^\lambda - (1 - p)^\lambda$ for the folded root. b. @whuber gives the formula $f(p) = \sqrt{1/2}\left(\sqrt{p} - \sqrt{1-p}\right)$ for the folded root where $\lambda=(1/2)$ . These are different, but both are versions used by Tukey. I think that both versions are symmetrical about p=0.5, and f(0.5)=0 for both. I plotted a quick graph of f(p) against p for each version: I had to go about this one by writing out the algebra, squaring both sides of the equation and rearranging. Eventually I get down to the quadratic equation, with $p - p^2-c = 0$ , so $a=-1$ and $b=1$ in the quadratic. a. For @Nick Cox's formula, $c=((1-(f(p))^2)/2)^2$ . b. For @whuber's formula, $c=((1-2(f(p))^2)/2)^2$ . The quadratic formula gives us two possible solutions. If f(p) is negative, then p $(-b+\sqrt{b^2-4ac})/2a$ . If f(p) is positive, then p>0.5, and we want the solution for the quadratic form $(-b-\sqrt{b^2-4ac})/2a$ (I'm not sure if there's a theoretical/mathematical reason for why it works out that way round?). There may be a simpler/more elegant way to do this, I would love to hear what it is. Particularly because I am still struggling to generalise this to less simple cases e.g. $\lambda=(2/3)$ , where I'm stuck at multiplying out the cubed bracket/trying to simplify from there.
