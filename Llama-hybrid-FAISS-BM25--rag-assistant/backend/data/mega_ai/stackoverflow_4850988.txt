Drop nodes in a JTree at different nesting levels

I am implementing drag and drop in a JTree. I want the user to be able to drop a node at different levels in the tree. In the example below, imagine that the user inserts an item between "grandchild A2" and "child C": root child A grandchild A1 grandchild A2 child C grandchild C1 Now there are two options: Append a new grandchild to "child A", which will be "grandchild A3", or Insert a new "child B" between "child A" and "child B". In SWT this is possible by moving the node a bit in the vertical direction. A horizontal line indicator will show at which nesting level the tree node is inserted. Is this possible at all in Swing? I cannot seem to find information on this. The line indicator in Swing is always shown at one level only. And if not, is there a workaround?
