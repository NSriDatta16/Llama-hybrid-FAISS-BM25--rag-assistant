The general policy for untrusted (i.e. not signed) applets is that they are only allowed (network-wise) to connect to the server they are loaded from. For applets loaded locally from the file system, this means they can connect localhost. Asking the user for permission will only occur if either the applet is signed (but then the user gives permission for everything, if there is not a special security policy file) or the applet uses the JNLP functions to request some access (but this is only for local access) - for this, you would need the latest plugin (1.6.0_10 or later). As Tom mentioned, a remote server can permit applets (and other dynamic web-content like JavaScript, Flash and so on) from other sites to access his server with a cross domain policy file . I'm not sure from which version on the Java plugin implements this, though.
