From standard HMM to Bayesian HMM

I'm trying to understand what the difference between a standard HMM and a Bayesian HMM is. Wikipedia just briefly mentions how the model looks like but I need a more detailed tutorial. Does someone know of a paper or an implementation which I can look at? Also I have issues with the terminology used. What does it practically mean if you "place/put a Dirichlet prior on a distribution"?
