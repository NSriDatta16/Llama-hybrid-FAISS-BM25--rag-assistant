To add to what others have written, would just like to add if - like me - you find you sometimes end up with crazy long names (because you like being descriptive) then it's worth bearing in mind selectors, which also promotes style re-use and helps keep things easy to read. e.g. h1 { 1.5em; } styledParagraph { font-size: 1em; } /* Override the default font size if the styledParagraph element is inside an element with the class articlePage */ .articlePage .styledParagraph { font-size: 1.5em; } /* Make all elements in .articlePage -> . styledParagraph larger than the default */ .articlePage .styledParagraph h1 { font-size: 2em; } This is very widely supported (even in MSIE 6) and it's much easier to read than a class name like . articlePageStyleParagraphHeading .
