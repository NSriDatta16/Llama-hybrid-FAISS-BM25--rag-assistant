Doug Finke produced a great video ( only 7 mins ) about converting C# to Powershell http://dougfinke.com/video/CSharpToPowerShell.html Roberts example is very good indeed, though comma delimiting will implicitly be treated as an array the shortest way of doing it would be to put it all into a single pipeline : $dir = "App_Data", "bin", "Content" | % { if("drwxr-xr-x 1 ftp ftp 0 Mar 18 22:41 App_Data".EndsWith($_)) { $_ } } | select -first 1
