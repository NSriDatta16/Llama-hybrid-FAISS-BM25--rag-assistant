To explore different complexities of your model, try doing a grid search over one of the hyperparameters that limits the depth of the model. For example min_samples_split or min_samples_leaf over a range (0.001, 0.3). Then you can plot validation set accuracy versus number of decision nodes, and chose a model with a good balance of complexity and performance. This can be done in combination with feature engineering, for example the recommended one-hot encoding.
