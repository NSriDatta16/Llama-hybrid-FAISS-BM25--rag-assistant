Validating decimal in C# for storage in SQL Server

I have a decimal database column decimal (26,6) . As far as I can gather this means a precision of 26 and a scale of 6. I think this means that the number can be a total of 26 digits in length and 6 of these digits can be after the decimal place. In my WPF / C# frontend I need to validate an incoming decimal so that I can be sure that it can be stored in SQL Server without truncation etc. So my question is there a way to check that decimal has a particular precision and scale. Also as an aside I have heard that SQL Server stores decimal in a completely different way to the CLR, is this true and if so is it something I need to worry about?
