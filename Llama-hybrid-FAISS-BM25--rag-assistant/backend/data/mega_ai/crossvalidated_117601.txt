Which measure of Central Tendency should I choose for skewed data?

I am trying to find out the best measure of central tendency from a list of data. As a first step, I'm trying to figure out the outliers in my distribution by using the usual Q1,Q3 and IQR formulas. My IQR is 157 (which means there is a lot of variability in the data). My lower outlier bound is -170 and the upper bound sits at 459. My question is: Since this is a skewed distribution, should I choose the mode or the median as the measure that will best represent my data set? As a side note, what I am trying to figure out is the average booking lead time of guests (in days) from a particular market in a hotel. My data set is made up of figures from November 2013 to September 2014.
