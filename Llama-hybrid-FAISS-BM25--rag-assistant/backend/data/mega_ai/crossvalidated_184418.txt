To understand the local connectivity, first think about giving an image as input into just a regular fully connected neural network. Each input (pixel value) is connected to every neuron in the first layer. So each neuron in the first layer is getting input from EVERY part of the image. With a convolutional network, each neuron only receives input from a small local group of the pixels in the input image. This is what is meant by "local connectivity", all of the inputs that go into a given neuron are actually close to each other. For your second question, yes, both the fully connected layers and the convolutional layers can be trained using back propagation. You take the errors after propagating back to the first fully connected layer and start your convolutional layer propagation using those.
