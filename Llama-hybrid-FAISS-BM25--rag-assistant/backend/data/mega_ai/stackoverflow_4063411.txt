I have done a lot of development in Qt but I'm still learning Ruby and QtRuby so, please, take this with a grain of salt. I wouldn't take the gem route and would try to package it just like the commercial Qt application I used to work on. A single package including everything for the program needs to run. This would include the Qt4 Ruby bindings and Qt libraries and everything else that you need it to run but it's not on [a Windows vanilla install/a MacOS vanilla install/The most commonly supported Linux Standard Base] with the possible exception of the Ruby interpreter in itself. Wrap your application in script to setup LD_LIBRARY_PATH and other kind of environmental variables to make sure everything works with the dynamic libraries you're shipping but are not installed on Linux target. On Windows just leave them (dynamic libraries) in the main main folder although you can go for the script route too. I never deployed on the Mac so I don't know but I can imagine it to be similar to the Linux route. I know it's not elegant but at least it works.
