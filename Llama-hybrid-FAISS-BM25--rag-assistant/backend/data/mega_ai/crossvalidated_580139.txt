Time-series loss function combining RMSE and Classification accuracy

I am working on a time series regression problem applied to finance. I am interested in predicting the price change of a stock and how much will it change by. I have framed this as a regression problem using MSE as my loss function. This gives good MSE accuracy. I would like however improve on the directional accuracy (will the price move up or down) by giving this information in the loss function (since the sign is ignored in the MSE loss function). I understand one way to improve of this is to switch to a classification problem. Switching to classification on the other hand would not give me any information on the amount of change. Is there any way to customise the loss function in such a way so as to account for bother MSE and direction? Or is there any loss function recommended for this type of problem? Thanks
