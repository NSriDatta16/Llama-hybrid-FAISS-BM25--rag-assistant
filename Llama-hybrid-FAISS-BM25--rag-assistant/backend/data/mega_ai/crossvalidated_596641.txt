Relationship between Random variable ,population and sample.

I am trying to understand this, first, let me define it then I have to construct an example to understand this, please let me know if my intuition is correct or not. Thanks. A statistical population consists of all the measurements of interest in a statistical investigation. Usually, a population is described by a random variable $X$ . If we can gain some knowledge about the probability density function $f(x; θ)$ of $X$ , then we also gain some knowledge about the population under investigation. A sample is a portion of the population usually chosen by method of random sampling and as such it is a set of random variables $X_1, X_2, ..., X_n$ with the same probability density function $f(x; θ)$ as the population. Once the sampling is done, we get $X_1 = x_1, X_2 = x_2, · · · , X_n = x_n$ where $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$ are the sample data. Okay so I am trying to understand the above definitions, Suppose we have a population of 6 people namely $A, B, C, D, E,F.$ and we have a random variable $X$ which is the salaries of these 5 peoples suppose $X=100\$,200\$,300\$,400\$,500\$,600\$ $ be the corresponding salaries of $A, B, C, D, E, F$ respectively. Suppose we want to know the average salary of the population. Choose a sample of size 2. $S=\{A,D\}$ then we have a random variable $X_1,X_4$ such that $X_1(A)=100\$$ and $X_4(D)=400\$$ so $S=\{X_1,X_4\}$ is it correct?
