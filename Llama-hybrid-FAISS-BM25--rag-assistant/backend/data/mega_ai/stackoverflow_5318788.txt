Get yourself "Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers" and install JBoss Tools. The combination of the two will allow you to configure projects and server instances such that it is easy to deploy and test incremental changes. Note that for this to work, your projects need to be WTP conformant. If you aren't using WTP already, take a look at the structure and metadata of projects created with Dynamic Web Project, EJB and Enterprise Application Project wizards. Either copy your source into new projects or copy the metadata files and fragments (very carefully).
