Evaluating time series clustering through EM/GMM

I perform clustering of time series into k=[2,N] number of clusters by using either DTW+kmedoids or DTW+single linkage+hierarchical clustering (HC ), as advised in a previous post: Dynamic Time Warping Clustering Regarding the evaluation of optimum number of clusters, I want to use expectationâ€“maximization (EM) Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and determine the k that maximizes the log-likelihood for each approach. My questions are: What should be the input dataset in EM/GMM? The DTW similarity distance or the raw dataset? Can the initializations in EM/GMM be the clusters centers of either the kmedoids or randomly selected seeds from the HC clusters? Should I run k-fold cross-validation of the input dataset with the EM/GMM and return the average log-likelihood value?
