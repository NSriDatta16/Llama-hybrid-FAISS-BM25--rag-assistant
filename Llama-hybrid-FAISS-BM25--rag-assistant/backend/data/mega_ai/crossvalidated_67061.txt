Am I correct that you shuffled the cards for all subjects? If not, then simply test the average number of seconds among subjects with shuffled piles versus the average number of seconds among subjects with non-shuffled ones. Otherwise, however, I think you're asking two questions here. Question #1) If the distribution of the ten cards is disproportionately in the first two stacks, will that affect the number of seconds it takes for a subject to identify all ten cards? To test this hypothesis, perhaps use a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test? You can compare the average distribution of subjects who answered in under 130 seconds to subjects who answered in 130+ seconds. $\quad$ I doubt you'll find a significant result in your data - but I agree that a lopsided draw might affect the number of seconds: you probably won't find anything significant just because your sample is so small. Question #2) When you randomly shuffled the decks, are the ten cards randomly distributed into the ten piles? Yes, and I think - for what you're doing - this is the more important question. In other words, you can assume from the start that each subject had the same chance of getting a lopsided distribution... so question #1 doesn't really matter.
