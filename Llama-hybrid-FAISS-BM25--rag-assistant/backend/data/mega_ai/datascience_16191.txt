Python Neural Network library/program with simple installation? (Solved?)

Edit: I found a solution to my problem; there's a scipy installer that doesn't require openBLAS, and that seems to have worked. I'm trying to find a neural network library for Python, but nothing I've tried has been what I've wanted; the libraries a lot of people seem to be recommending (e.g Keras, scikit-learn) require scipy, which won't actually install on my computer. (I think it requires openBLAS, which doesn't seem to have a tutorial for installation.) I did find a program that looks like it will work, but it has a maximum of one hidden layer. Can someone point me to a library that actually works, or show me how to install scipy?
