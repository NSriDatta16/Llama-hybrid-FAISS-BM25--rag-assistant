Following off of skaffman: Change your my.cnf (and restart MySQL) to include: innodb_file_per_table = 1 ( http://mysqldba.blogspot.com/2006/12/innodbfilepertable.html ) This will give your databases dedicated file storage and take it out of the shared pool. It will then let you do fun things like place the tables/indexes on different physical disks to even further split up I/O and improve performance. Note this doesn't change existing tables; you'll have to do work to get 'em in their own file ( http://capttofu.livejournal.com/11791.html ).
