What is the percentage of unique words in a average document?

I am doing research for a data science class and am looking into the benefits of storing all unique words in a document along with the entire document. I am looking for some research that has been published that averages the number of unique words in a document against the total number of words in a document. I want to evaluate the added storage requirements when storing a list of unique words along with the original document versus the reduced search space when searching for words in a document.
