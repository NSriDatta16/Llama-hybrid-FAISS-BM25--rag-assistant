Does frequentist statistics support the use of priors?

My understanding of the main difference between Frequentist vs Bayesian stats is that the former treats parameters as variables with fixed but unknown values whereas the latter treats them as random variables. From that perspective, I get the impression that priors (and posteriors) would only make sense in Bayesian statistics. Is this understanding correct?
