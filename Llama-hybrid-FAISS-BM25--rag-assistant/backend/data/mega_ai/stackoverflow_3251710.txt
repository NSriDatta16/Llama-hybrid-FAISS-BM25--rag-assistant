OpenXML: Replace element with table in WordprocessingML

I'm using the OpenXML SDK to programatically replace some elements with chunks of OpenXML (WordProcessingML) markup. For example, I have a paragraph with these contents: Text before ... ... Text after And a table with a structure like this: ... ... gridCol elements ... ... ... Cell contents ... Cell contents Basically I want to replace the element in the paragraph with the table markup. The problem is that I cannot just replace it because it will create an invalid document (a table with paragraphs inside another paragraph element isn't valid). The result that I want to get is this: Text before ... ... gridCol elements ... ... ... Cell contents ... Cell contents Text after I was thinking on creating a method that created a new paragraph with the elements before the element, and another one with the elements after the sdt element, but it seems like such a method would be error-prone. Is there a method that can do what I want without having to do it manually (a method that does what Word does when I try to insert a new table inside a text line)? Any help will be greatly appreciated.
