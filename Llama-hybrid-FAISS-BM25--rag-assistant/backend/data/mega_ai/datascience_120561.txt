The default threshold is 0.5, so it is computed on that basis. It is kind of a problem as it isn't well documented (not even on the logistic regression predict page) and a very common pitfall. The two most common approach are either to use another metric (auc is a good exemple, proper scoring rule might be even better), the other approach is to buil a custom prediction function so as to incorporate your own threshold in your pipeline.
