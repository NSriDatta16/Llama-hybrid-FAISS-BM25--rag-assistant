The intuitive view of the kernel as measuring the similarity between observations is necessary for machine learning algorithms to be useful. However, kernels used in practice also need to satisfy formal conditions. Kernel matrix needs to be positive semi-definite so that the optimization objectives of kernelized machine learning algorithms remain convex and can be solved to global optimality.
