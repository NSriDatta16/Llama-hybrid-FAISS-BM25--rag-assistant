Thanks Nigel, My SQL is not as elegant as could be, but I needed a solution that required SQL only, not PLSQL or TSQL, so it ended up looking like this: SELECT CUSTOMER, CUSTOMER_ID, COUNT(PRODUCT) PROD_COUNT, RTRIM( XMLAGG( XMLELEMENT (C, PRODUCT || ',') ORDER BY PRODUCT ).EXTRACT ('//text()'), ',' ) AS PRODUCTS FROM ( SELECT DISTINCT CUSTOMER, CUSTOMER_ID, PRODUCT FROM MAGIC_TABLE ) GROUP BY CUSTOMER, CUSTOMER_ID ORDER BY 1 , 2 Still not exactly sure what the XML functions do exactly, but I'll dig in when the need arrises.
