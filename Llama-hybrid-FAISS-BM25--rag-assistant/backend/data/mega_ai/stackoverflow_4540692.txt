You'll need to break every word out of your input, and use it in its own LIKE clause: SELECT `title` FROM `table` WHERE (`title` LIKE '%Stack%' OR `title` LIKE '%Overflow%') That said, I'm not sure why your original statement did not match the 3rd example you gave there. Also, you may want to check out fulltext indexing . I've never had much success with it, but in theory, it is designed to do what you are trying to set up (assuming a few things, such as the MyISAM storage engine).
