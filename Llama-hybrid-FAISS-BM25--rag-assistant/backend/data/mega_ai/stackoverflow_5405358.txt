It makes no architectural or design sense to have the ConstructTable() and GetProducts() methods with their current implementation as the codebehind on a winform . There is little or no cohesion between these methods and the visual representation of the data in your form, which is clearly illustrated by the fact that you end up calling code in one form from another. Move this code into a class library and consider using Linq or some less archaic data access logic to retrieve your data. With respect to the specific problem that you are experiencing I would recommend that you attach a debugger and trace through these lines of code. Pay attention to the value of the parameter being sent to GetProducts()!
