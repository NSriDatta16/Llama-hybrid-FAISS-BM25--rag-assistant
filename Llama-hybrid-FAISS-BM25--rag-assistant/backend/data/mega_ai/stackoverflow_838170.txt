As a SharePoint consultant I'm probably a little biased, but I'd go with SharePoint - it's got a good range of out of box capabilities and development practices are getting reasonably mature. I would also note that I've seen a lot of organizations moving from Notes to SharePoint - it's not relevant in technical terms, but may be important in the future. Ultimately the choice of platform doesn't matter so much as what you do with it, particularly in terms of infrastructure and development practices. I've seen some really badly organized SharePoint systems, but the issues are always something that could have been avoided if it was all thought through properly at the start.
