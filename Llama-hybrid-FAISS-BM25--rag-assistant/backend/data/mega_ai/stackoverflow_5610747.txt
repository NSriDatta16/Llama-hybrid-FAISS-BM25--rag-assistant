It seems you're loading all your data in memory using Jena/RIOT. As far as I know, LinkedIMDB is large enough to give you problems with this approach. What you're doing is bringing all your database to memory. Increasing the heap of your JVM could be one possible solution but it won't scale if your data keeps growing. The right solution is to go for other configurations of Jena that are designed for this size of datasets. These are: Jena SDB , which uses relational databases as backend. Jena TDB , which uses a native Java storage based on B-trees indexes to speed up queries. It scales better than (1). Optionally you could go for scalable RDF databases such 4store and query your data via Jena ARQ . This solution is by far the one that will scale and perform better.
