You might get better answers if you specify the specific algorithms you're interested in. I use R for this sort of thing (I do time series econometrics, though, not machine learning); you can see the existing functionality here: http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/MachineLearning.html and there is R code to implement the analysis in Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman's Elements of statistical learning : http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/ R's packaging system is pretty great and nudges people towards documenting their code, and it's open source so you can always go look at the implementation. I haven't used Matlab in a few years and didn't use it for much machine learning -- their toolboxes are usually well documented but can be pricey, but user-contributed code is going to be as poorly documented as any other.
