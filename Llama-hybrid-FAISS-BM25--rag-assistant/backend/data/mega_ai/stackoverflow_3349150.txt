stuck in a rut, need help breaking through to the next level

I'm working on a humble website with my mediocre, self-taught PHP skills, and the current interface structure is like this: This worked ok at first, and seemed pretty well organized, but the functionality required has grown by a factor of 10 and it's rapidly turning into an unmaintainable, embarrassing mess and I don't know how to get out of it. I feel that the functions being called for each situation are fairly well-written and focused, but am at a loss as to how to handle the middle-step between the user and the functions that creates the layout and handles the return. I have a feeling that MVC is one solution? But I'm having a hard time grasping how to go from here to there... I apologize for any headaches or unpleasant memories the above code may have prompted. Thank you for your time.
