We recently went through this in my organization. Although it is not the best solution, and hitting the right session across multiple browser windows is rough, we put a countdown timer on our page, included a button that just went back and hit the server to restart the session, and also provided the user with a JavaScript popup (the user's favorite part of the solution) with a message saying that the session was, say, five minutes from timing out and to hit the "OK" button to restart. Then the button would hit the server to restart the session, restart the timer on the base page, close the popup and the base page didn't need to be refreshed at all.
