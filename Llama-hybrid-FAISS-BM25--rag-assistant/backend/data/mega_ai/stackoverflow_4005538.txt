rails PaperClip / S3 / ImageMagick

I'm using paperclip in my rails 3 app to upload photos, resize with ImageMagick and then post to S3. For the life of me, I can't figure out why this process is soooo slow on my localhost? Even without any resizing it's crazy slow... 30+ seconds for one photo? And my network & cpu aren't even working hard? Why? Updating with Model: class Photo :commentable #Paperclip for photo has_attached_file :photo, :styles => {:large => "600x600>"}, :default_style => :original, :default_url => '/images/:attachment/default_:style.png', :path => "/photos/:user_id/:attachment/:id/:style/:basename.:extension", :storage => :s3, :s3_credentials => File.join(Rails.root, 'config', 's3.yml'), :s3_protocol => 'http' end
