I find it to be a huge failure that many log formats do not separate columns with proper unique field separators. Not because that is best, but because it is the basic premise of unix textutils that operate on table data. Instead they tend to use spaces as separators and quote fields that might contain spaces. One of the most practical simple changes I made to web log analyzing was to leave the default NCSA log format produced by the nginx web server, to instead use tab as the field separator. Suddenly I could use all of the primitive unix textutils for quick lookups, but especially awk! Print only lines where the user-agent field contains Googlebot: awk 'BEGIN {FS="\t"} $7 ~ /Googlebot/ { print; }' Find the number of requests on for each unique request awk 'BEGIN {FS="\t"} { print $4; }' And of course lots of combinations to find specific visitors.
