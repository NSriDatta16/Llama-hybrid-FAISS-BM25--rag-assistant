Visual Studio and Eclipse are great IDE's because of customization. You should never feel like you need to drag and drop in either of these, even if someone is forcing you too. You should be able to setup your workspace the way you need it and never think about such things again. These tools are designed to make coding easier for you, not to code for you. They are there to help keep your files/folders/projects organized and readable. As a bonus there are many more tools they contain which you will fluently guide you to not breaking your head while coding. Such as debugging, profiling, searching, refactoring, and many more. I spend about 95-100% of my time writing code and navigating through files using these IDEs. If I ever need to drag and drop, for example lets say generating HTML I will use Dreamweaver or Microsoft's Expression toolset. For dull operations such as changing spelling or fixing small text based files, it is ok to jump into Notepad/Notepad++. Like you it took me a while to get used to the IDEs, but now I don't know how I can live without them (in a good way :D ) .
