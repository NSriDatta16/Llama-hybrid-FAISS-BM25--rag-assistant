You can generate symmetrical distribution(s) by suitable transformation: Your distribution is mainly right-skewed, therefore a log10 transformation is required. You can also use an auto-binning method and combine it with dummy variables for the spikes. If you then perform a feature selection, the learner will automatically choose the most significant features. Learners like XGBoost automatically take care of multicollinearity.
