I am a programmer who has to deal with a lot of code on a daily basis. Open source and what has been developed in house. As a programmer, I find it useful to have many source files open at once, and often organise my desktop on my (widescreen) monitor so that two source files are side by side. I might be programming in both, or just reading one and programming in the other. I find it dissatisfying and frustrating when one of those source files is >120 characters in width, because it means I can't comfortably fit a line of code on a line of screen. It upsets formatting to line wrap. I say '120' because that's the level to which I would get annoyed at code being wider than. After that many characters, you should be splitting across lines for readability, let alone coding standards. I write code with 80 columns in mind. This is just so that when I do leak over that boundary, it's not such a bad thing.
