How can I determine best performing groups in a series

Not sure if this is right place for this question, but taking an example of the following trend, how can I determine that groups A and B are the areas where the result has been best? I have already tried by doing an average and finding all those above the average. But finding out a group and driving a conclusion is tricky part. How can I do this?
