ning speech synthesis by a developer known as 15 (at the age of 18) during their freshman year at MIT as part of its Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program. 15 was inspired by DeepMind's WaveNet paper, with development continuing through their studies as Google AI released Tacotron 2 the following year. By 2019, they had demonstrated at MIT their ability to replicate WaveNet and Tacotron 2's results using 75% less training data than previously required. The name "15.ai" is a reference to the developer's statement that a voice can be cloned with as little as 15 seconds of data. 15 had originally planned to pursue a PhD based on their undergraduate research, but opted to work in the tech industry instead after their startup was accepted into the Y Combinator accelerator in 2019. After their departure in early 2020, 15 returned to their voice synthesis research and began implementing it as a web application. According to a post on X from 15, instead of using conventional voice datasets like LJSpeech that contained simple, monotone recordings, they sought out more challenging voice samples that could demonstrate the model's ability to handle complex speech patterns and emotional undertones. During this phase, 15 discovered the Pony Preservation Project, a collaborative project started by /mlp/, the My Little Pony board on 4chan. Contributors of the project had manually trimmed, denoised, transcribed, and emotion-tagged thousands of voice lines from My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic and had compiled them into a dataset that provided ideal training material for 15.ai. 2020â€“2022: Release and operation 15.ai was released in March 2020 as a free and non-commercial web application that did not require user registration to use, but did require the user to accept its terms of service before proceeding. At the time of its launch, the platform had a limited selection of available characters, including those from My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic and Team Fortress 2. Users were permitted to create any content with the synthesized voices under two conditions: they had to properly credit 15.ai by including "15.ai" in any posts, videos, or projects using the generated audio; and they were prohibited from mixing 15.ai outputs with other text-to-speech outputs in the same work to prevent misrepresentation of the technology's capabilities. More voices were added to the website in the following months. In late 2020, 15 implemented a multi-speaker embedding in the deep neural network, which enabled the simultaneous training of multiple voices. Following this, the website's roster expanded from eight to over fifty characters. In addition, this implementation allowed the deep learning model to recognize common emotional patterns across different characters, even when certain emotions were missing from the characters' training data. By May 2020, the site had served over 4.2 million audio files to users. In early 2021, the application gained popularity after skits, memes, and fan content created using 15.ai went viral on Twitter, TikTok, Reddit, Twitch, Facebook, and YouTube. At its peak, the platform incurred operational costs of US$12,000 per month from AWS infrastructure needed to handle millions of daily voice generations; despite receiving offers from companies to acquire 15.ai and its underlying technology, the website remained independent and was funded out of the personal previous startup earnings of the developer. 2022: Voiceverse NFT controversy On January 14, 2022, 15 discovered that a blockchain-based company called Voiceverse had generated voice lines using 15.ai, falsely showcased them on Twitter as a demonstration of their own voice technology without permission or attribution, and sold them as NFTs. This came shortly after 15 had stated in December 2021 that they had no interest in incorporating NFTs into their work. A screenshot of the log files posted by 15 showed that Voiceverse had generated audio of characters from My Litt
