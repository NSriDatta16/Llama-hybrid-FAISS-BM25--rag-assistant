Analysis of design of experiments with binary response

Having a hard time determining the best way to analyze this DOE, as I'm generally used to outputs in a different format and with numeric responses. I've essentially got 2 variables at 3 levels and a summary table with the type of failures at each combination, something like this: A B numSamples failA failB failC 1 1 100 2 12 62 2 1 100 3 3 23 3 1 100 1 21 31 1 2 100 2 2 22 2 2 100 3 34 13 3 2 100 1 1 11 1 3 100 2 2 22 2 3 100 9 19 9 3 3 100 8 8 18 I need to find the factors/combinations with the most significant contributions, most examples I'm finding apply to numeric response and I'm frankly at a loss for where to begin. Am suspecting that I might need to mutate the data in some way before analysis.. but I'm pulling up on a dead end. Appreciate any comments/assistance. Additional info: An item can only fail in one particular way (failA OR failB OR failC). If an object fails, the failure is then classified into one of these categories. For example, you could think of these as A = failure by inconsistent shape, B = failure by cracked outer surface, C = failure by too large size. etc. Note it is sometimes possible to have multiple failures but there is only one recorded. By significance of their contribution I'm looking for something akin to an r^2 in a LM. For example, if there is a general trend that for B=3 increases failA (i.e. what's the coefficient of failA ?) At this point I'm leaning towards manipulating this raw data to a long format along the lines of: A B Failure Type 1 1 TRUE A 1 1 FALSE NA 1 1 TRUE C ... 2 1 TRUE B ... And then performing a logistic regression via glm. Not certain this is the best approach yet.
