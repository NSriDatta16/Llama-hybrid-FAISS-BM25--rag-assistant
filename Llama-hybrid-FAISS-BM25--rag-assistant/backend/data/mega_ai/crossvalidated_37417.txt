It may simply be that the variables you have measured do not capture behaviour in a predictive way. I would recommend using 10-fold validation in order to build and assess your models. This is a machine learning technique that allows to to evaluate how data dependent your models are. If theere is a lot of drift in your beta coefficients across folds it means you are modelling noise (overfitting). This approach builds a model on 90% of your data and predicts in the remaining 10%. It does this iteratively until you have predictions for all data points without considering those points in the training process. You may want to look at mixed-effect modelling - this can account for outliers to some degree. Also, other non-linear models - take a look at fractional polynomials (capture asymptotic data better). This gives you a good idea of whether you can achieve good prediction accuracy. I suggest reading about prognosis, forecasting and validation.
