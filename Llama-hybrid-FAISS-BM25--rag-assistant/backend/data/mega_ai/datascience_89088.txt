Federated Learning is a machine learning setting where the goal is to train a high-quality centralized model with training data distributed over a large number of clients each with unreliable and relatively slow network connections. From Nvidia Federated learning decentralizes deep learning by removing the need to pool data into a single location. Instead, the model is trained in multiple iterations at different sites.
