Anyone with experience on embedding CINT into a C++ app?

I'm talking about ROOT's CINT . I've been developing a game in c++ which uses Python for programming the AI. As much as I love Python, and how easy it makes programming the AI (generators and FP are really sexy), it makes non trivial algorithms run so slow. Then I remembered I read somewhere about CINT, and how it can be embeddable. Now I need your help to decide if implement CINT as an alternate scripting system. With python I use Boost::Python, which makes it almost unpainful to expose classes and objects once you get used to it . Is there such ease with CINT?
