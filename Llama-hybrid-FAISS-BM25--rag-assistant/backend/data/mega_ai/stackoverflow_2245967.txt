Implementation issues with SSO

Let me preface this by saying I'm a beginner in a PHP environment so there may be a simple answer here. We're trying to use phpCAS to connect to our university's CAS server. Our server has been set up to match these requirements: http://www.ja-sig.org/wiki/display/CASC/phpCAS+requirements , and we have installed phpCAS to it's own accessable directory & included its path in the "include_path" variable so it can be easily accessed. When running the /CAS-1.0.1/docs/examples/example_simple.php that comes with the install, i receive the following warnings over and over: Warning: error_log() [function.error-log]: open_basedir restriction in effect. File(/tmp/phpCAS.log) is not within the allowed path(s): (/var/www/) in /var/www/html/root/CAS-1.0.1/CAS.php on line 453 Warning: error_log(/tmp/phpCAS.log) [function.error-log]: failed to open stream: Operation not permitted in /var/www/html/root/CAS-1.0.1/CAS.php on line 453 I get these warnings repeated over and over on the screen, followed by this message: CAS Authentication wanted! You should already have been redirected to the CAS server. Click here to continue. Clicking the login sends me to our appropriate cas server, then redirects me straight back to this page, with all the warnings still visible. Any thoughts?
