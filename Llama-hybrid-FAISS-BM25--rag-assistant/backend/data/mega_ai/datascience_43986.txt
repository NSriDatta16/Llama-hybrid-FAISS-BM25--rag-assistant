Machine Learning in real time

I am a newbie in ML world, but very curious and enthusiastic about it. Have gone through articles and some hands-on too. Still got a silly doubt. In sample datasets (like Iris or diabetes or breast cancer etc.) and exercises, I find the data to be well-formed and ready to be digested by ML model (algos). But, in reality, it is much more than that. For example, Amazon's feature of suggesting (cross-selling) products. Based on my previous searches and orders, it probably would be looking into several features and predicting further items. I'm curious - How does it work in real time? How my product searches (they are not numbers) are fed into the ML model under-the-hood? Please share your thoughts. Regards, RB (using Python 3.6 & latest-1 versions of NumPy, Scikit and Pandas)
