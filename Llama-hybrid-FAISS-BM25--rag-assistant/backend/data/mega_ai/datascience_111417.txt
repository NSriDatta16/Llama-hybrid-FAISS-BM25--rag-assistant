Tensorflow/Keras are not end-to-end librairies that cover every data science process: they are mainly focused on Machine Learning. The least they can do with input data, is to convert it to tensors. import tensorflow as tf import pandas as pd mydata = pd.read_csv("/path/file.csv") (...preprocessing data steps here...) tf_tensors = tf.convert_to_tensor(mydata) print('tensors= ', tf_tensors) I recommend to use other libraries such as pandas, seaborn or scikit learn to preprocess data. You will find plenty of sources to preprocess data efficiently with those libraries, for instance: https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2020/09/pandas-speed-up-preprocessing/
