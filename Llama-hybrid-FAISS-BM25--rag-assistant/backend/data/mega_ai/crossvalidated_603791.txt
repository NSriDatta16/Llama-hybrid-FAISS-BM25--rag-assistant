Combining logistic regression and decision tree?

I'm working on a project classifying patients as having (1) or not having (0) a particular condition. Someone I work with has suggested fitting a decision tree on this data, and using the leaf node membership as input to a logistic regression model. In other words, which leaf node a sample falls into is used to create a categorical variable for logistic regression. For a tree of depth 3, that would be 8 possible "classes". Is this a legitimate approach? The only thing I could find resembling this is this post . This suggestion doesn't seem right to me, but wondering if anyone has encountered this before?
