Local data storage â€“ A subroutine frequently needs memory space for storing the values of local variables, the variables that are known only within the active subroutine and do not retain values after it returns. It is often convenient to allocate space for this use by simply moving the top of the stack by enough to provide the space. This is very fast compared to heap allocation. Note that each separate activation of a subroutine gets its own separate space in the stack for locals. Stack allocation is much faster since all it really does is move the stackpointer. Using memory pools you can get comparable performance out of heap allocation but that comes with a slight added complexity and its own headaches. In Heaps there is another layer of indirection since you will have to go from stack -> heap before you get the correct object. Also the stack is local for each thread and is inherintly thread safe, where as the heap is free-for-all memory
