The average is not the exclusive statistic that can be used to measure the central tendency of the bias of an estimator, and by restricting yourself to the average the problem ends up being the equivalent of saying that the average does not equal the median. Take n=1 (just sample populations consisting of a single sample) so that the only value an estimator t of the median m of the population distribution X , t(X_1) , can have is X_1 , thus E(t(X_1))=E(X_1)=E(X)!=m , therefore it seems there can be no unbiased estimator of m . Yet median(t(X_1))=median(X_1)=median(X)=m ... therefore an unbiased estimator does exist: the sample median!
