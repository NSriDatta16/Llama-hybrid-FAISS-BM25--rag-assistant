I found a similar reparametrization in [Nijkamp et al., 2022] , with a bit more context for the conditions of the transformation. It answers most of my questions, but I could still use some help to clarify a few points. [Nijkamp et al., 2022] use a (volume preserving) normalizing flow specifically as a generative model. This leads to the following equation (recall the definitions: $z \sim p(z)$ , $x = G_{\phi}(z)$ ): \begin{equation} p(z) dz = p_{\phi}(x) dx \end{equation} And similarly for the new EBM model: \begin{equation} p_{\phi, \theta}(z) dz = p_{\phi, \theta}(x) dx \end{equation} From here, we can derive the reparametrization as: \begin{align} p_{\phi, \theta}(z) dz &= \frac{e^{-E_{\theta}(x)}p_{\phi}(x)dx}{Z_{\phi, \theta}} \\ p_{\phi, \theta}(z) dz &= \frac{e^{-E_{\theta}(G_{\phi}(z))}p(z)dz}{Z_{\phi, \theta}} \\ \end{align} $dz$ cancels out from both sides and we get: \begin{equation} p_{\phi, \theta}(z) = \frac{e^{-E_{\theta}(G_{\phi}(z))}p(z)}{Z_{\phi, \theta}} \end{equation} Note that this only holds if $G_{\phi}$ is a volume-preserving transformation. I still don't know how [Xiao et al., 2020] use any generative model (e.g. VAE) to perform the same transformation.
