How exactly does machine learning theory work/help in practical problems?

For past 3 months, I have gone through a machine learning theory course that focuses purely on theory. It covered many obscure concepts, like L1/L2 regularization, ill conditioning，sparsity, VC dimension, gradient descent, logistic regression, entropy，information gain, Euclidean distance—and the math behind it. The most confusing thing to me is: How exactly is machine learning theory working in practical problems? Is it worth knowing all of the technical details and math proofs? After reading the theory materials and knowing how the algorithm are built, I still don't know things like "use a less complicated algorithm first", "what kind of algorithm is more complicated", "what kind of algorithm should be chosen to the hypothesis or what kind of problem is learnable", "how to offer a right hyperplane or making good features to fit the model," etc.
