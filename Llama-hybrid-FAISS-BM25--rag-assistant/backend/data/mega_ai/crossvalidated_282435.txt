I am no expert in machine learning, but there is a method similar to what you have described called the "Receiver Operator Characteristic" (ROC), which evaluates the the ability of a continuous variable to distinguish between binary outcomes. Bellow I have linked a video that carefully explains how the ROC curve works, as well as the Wikipedia page, which gives a good description of the method. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYIIZR_XIyY https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic The ROC curve is easy to request in most statistical software packages. I have personally used it more often in behavioral and social sciences, but I have been told that it is quite useful in machine learning. The area under the ROC curve is a decent metric of how well a factor is able to classify your binary variable, so you could compare separate factors or models using this metric.
