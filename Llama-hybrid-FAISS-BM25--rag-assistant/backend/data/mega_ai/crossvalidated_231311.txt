Does collinearity largely impact the performance of neural network?

I am build a neural network (NN). Its input include the parameters of a distribution, e.g., mean, median, standard deviation. For example, I am using NN to predict the height of a person. The input features include some attributes of the person. A subset of the attributes are the parameters of the height distribution of all people from the same country. The parameters are like the mean, median, and std of the distribution. Does this introduce collinearity problem to the NN? Does this impact the accuracy of the prediction?
