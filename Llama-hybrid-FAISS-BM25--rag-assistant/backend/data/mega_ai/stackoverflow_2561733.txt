I guess that you want to plot an average (or at least calculate it) from already plotted data. With plotAverage from the Matlab File Exchange , you can do it quite easily. %# plot some data figure plot(randn(100,5)) %# add the average line at every 5th point [plotHandles, average] = plotAverage([],5:5:95); %# and you have a line on the plot, and its handles and data in the workspace.
