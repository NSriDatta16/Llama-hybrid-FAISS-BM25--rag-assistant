PCA is used to find the variables that contain the most information, and to remove the ones that have little information or sometimes just noise. If only 2 dimensions out of the initial 10 dimensions carry the most information, then only those 2 dimensions need to be used. Hence the PCA has helped in reducing the dataset's dimensions.
