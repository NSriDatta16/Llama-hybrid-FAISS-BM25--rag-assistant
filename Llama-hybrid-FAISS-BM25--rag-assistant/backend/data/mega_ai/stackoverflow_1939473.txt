How to organize sources of complex program?

We're creating very complex embedded system and «sources» contains few projects of Visual C++, IAR, Code Composer Studio and Altium Designer schemes and pcbs. All of that possibly could be in few versions. So, what practice could you advice me to arrange all that stuff? Thank you
