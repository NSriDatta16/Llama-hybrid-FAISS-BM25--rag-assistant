Analyse my ACF and PACF

I am new to time series analysis, I tried first to decompose my data using the decompose function in R, hoping I'd get a stationary data in the random obtained. I'm planning to fit an ARIMA model to it. But when I plot the ACF and the PACF of the random error obtained from decomposing I got the foloowing correlogram plots: I am not able to determine from these plots the nature of the obtained error, and the order of the ARIMA model that I should use. Would someone help me in analysing the obtained plots? I would prefer if there is a reference (book, paper, link..) that could help me.
