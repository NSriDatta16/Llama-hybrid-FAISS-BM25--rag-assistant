The term are loosely defined. In your question, We use the term data ($D$) and parameter ($\theta$). In other literature, people use another set of terms: evidence ($E$) and hypothesis ($H$), which are exactly the same thing to your $D$ and $\theta$. Using the evidence and hypothesis combo, following notation is also widely used. $$P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)}$$ Check the wikipedia page on Bayesian Inference, you can see the formula.
