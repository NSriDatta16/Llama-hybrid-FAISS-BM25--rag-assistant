A famous theorem (Theorem 3.1.1., Brockwell, Davis. Time series: theory and application ï¼‰states that an ARMA( $p$ , $q$ ) process $$\phi(B)X_t = \theta(B) W_t$$ is causal if and only if $\phi(z) \neq 0$ for all $z \in \mathbb{C}$ such that $\left|z\right|\leq 1$ . So in order the AR( $2$ ) process to be causal, the coefficients $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ must satisfy $$1 - \phi_1 z - \phi_2 z^2 \neq 0$$ for all $\left|z\right| \leq 1$ . It is not a causal process for all $\phi_1, \phi_2$ . For example, $\phi_1 = 2, \phi_2 = 0$ .
