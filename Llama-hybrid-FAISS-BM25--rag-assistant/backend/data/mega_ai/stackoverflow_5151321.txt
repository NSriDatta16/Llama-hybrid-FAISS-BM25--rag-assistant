Side effects of cobertura

After some efforts I finally get cobertura running correctly for my web application on a tomcat server. Everything seems fine until I committed it to the svn and hudson finished(failed) his work. Without this build script I would have never (or later) discovered this issue. My build script tried to move the catalina.log to another directory but the catalina.log was missing. After some testing I assume that the pure presence of the cobertura.jar in classpath (without instrumenting anything) changes the logging behaviour of my tomcat. Since I'm not that experienced with neither tomcat nor cobertura, can anyone confirm my observation. Are there anywhere any other side effects documented?
