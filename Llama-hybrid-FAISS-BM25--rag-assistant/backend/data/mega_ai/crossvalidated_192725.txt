You may look at the last paragraph of Section 5 Discussion in Vincent, P. (2011). A connection between score matching and denoising autoencoders. Neural computation, 23(7), 1661-1674. The tied weights rise when you differentiate the energy function w.r.t data to do score matching, see Equation 4.6 and 4.6 in the paper.
