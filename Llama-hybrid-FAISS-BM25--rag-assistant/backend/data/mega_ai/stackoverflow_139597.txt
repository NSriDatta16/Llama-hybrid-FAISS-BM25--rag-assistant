I have worked in an environment for several years where this was common practice and it was really painful. Make sure that the merges are part of your project plan because they are going to consume a lot of time and are sources of delay. Documenting the branches and assigning them specific responsibilities helped a little. We had to create a tool to help us merge changes incrementally (one change at a time, instead of merging the tip of branches) because CVS does not behave well if the two branches diverge. Often synchronize (at least once a week). I think the best way to approach this in retrospect would be to make sure that divergence remains minimal and splitting the risky development in different milestones by using Scrum for example. I also encourage you to read SCM Patterns . This books contains a lot of good advices.
