Namespaces provides a way to organize your code, which it is useful for. Namespaces does not provide any extra functionality to C++. If used poorly it tends to the code more complicated to debug. If you decide to use namespaces, try avoid putting "using namespace" in your source files. Never use them in your header files. Point out specific classes instead "using std::vector" or similar, or add the use of "using namespace" inside a scope. This will make all your future use of namespaces much less painful.
