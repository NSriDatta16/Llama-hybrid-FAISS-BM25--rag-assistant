What is a "story" in the Text Object Model?

This documentation describes RichEdit and ITextDocument, which are part of MFC. RichEdit uses TOM, or text object model. The documentation makes repeated reference to "stories": The GetStoryCount property-get method retrieves the count of stories in this document. The GetStoryRanges property-get method retrieves the story collection object used to enumerate the stories in a document. At other places in the documentation, it's a unit of measurement of the document, in a progression like: character > word > sentence > paragraph > story > page But what exactly is a story?
