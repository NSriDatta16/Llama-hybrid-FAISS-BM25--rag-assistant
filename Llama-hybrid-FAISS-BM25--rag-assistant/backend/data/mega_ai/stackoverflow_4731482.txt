PubSub/Loosely Coupled & MVC patterns in Javascript

Ok, i'm a newbie in this, i've been trying to study MVC patterns and Publish/Subscription patterns in Javascript/jQuery, however i believe that i haven't grasped the concept entirely. Since i've been doing it alone, i humbly come here to ask for opinions about a small educational exercise that i tried to make following these patterns http://jsfiddle.net/Couto/R62V8/ Ok, the exercise is mainly a login form, where the values are saved in localStorage, again it's purely educational, i now it's not safe in anyway and it should not be used in production. Would you please tell me your opinion about the patterns used, did i fail at achieving the right use of patterns? Please hurt me if needed, i just want to learn, but i'm not sure if i'm doing it right.
