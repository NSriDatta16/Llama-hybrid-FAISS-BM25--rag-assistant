Correcting biased polling

Let's say I'm polling for a binary election in different states with known biases. Furthermore, let's say I only manage to poll only a small sample of people in each of these states. How would you combine the results to come up with the best estimate for the election? My best guess is the normalized vote is: $$ \sum_i \frac{\text{# polled in state}_i}{\text{# total polled}} * \text{normalized vote} $$ where $$ \text{normalized vote} = \frac{p(d) - \text{average}(p(d))}{\text{stdev}( p(d))} $$ Assuming $d$ is one of the binary choices, and I have a history of $p(d)$ in each state.
