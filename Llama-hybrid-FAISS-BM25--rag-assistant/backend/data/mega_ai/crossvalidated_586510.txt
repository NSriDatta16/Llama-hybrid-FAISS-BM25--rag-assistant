There are three facts that led me to the conclusion that replacement gives a higher expected value: 1. Products result in right-skewed distributions. When you multiply numbers together, you tend to get results clustered mostly in small numbers, with a few large results. 2. Among right-skewed distribution, increasing the variance tends to increase the mean. Since extremes above the median are more extreme than the extremes below it, getting more extreme increases the result on average. For instance, in the question you present, we can quickly estimate the median as being somewhere around $5\times6$ (the product of the two middle numbers). The minimum is $1\times1$ , and the maximum is $10\times10$ . So getting an extremely low number costs us at most $30$ , while an extremely high number can give us as much as $70$ over the median. 3. Allowing replacement increases the variance. With replacement, you can get something consisting entirely of the most extreme numbers. Without replacement, you can only get one instance of the maximum and the other one can be at most second highest, and similarly for the minimum. This isn't a rigorous proof, but understanding how asymmetry, variance, and replacement interact is important for working with statistics. As a side note, I don't think is really game theory. If simply phrasing it as a choice between options made it game theory, then all optimization problems would be game theory (and pretty much everything can be phrased as an optimization problem).
