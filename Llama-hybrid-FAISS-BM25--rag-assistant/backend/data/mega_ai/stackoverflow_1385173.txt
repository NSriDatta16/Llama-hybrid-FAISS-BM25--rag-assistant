It's worth noting that there are two kinds of archiver; a 'dumb' one, which just persists the object graph, and a 'keyed' one which permits the data structure to evolve over time. The keyed archiver is a much better choice (and the preferred one) since you can then separate the storage element type from the persisted storage time.
