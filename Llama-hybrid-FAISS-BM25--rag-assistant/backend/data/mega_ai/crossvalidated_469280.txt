... I want to know which characteristic make the product more prone to be sold. ... And I want to know if the product being yellow increase the probability of selling it and if it does, if it's more important than the material. Is that something I could do with random forest and other models? And is there anything I should look at that we usually don't look when running them for prediction? It sound like you are generally interested in finding causal relationships and if present the relative strength of the effects of different variables on the probability of selling the product. If so, you should have a look at Is machine learning less useful for understanding causality, thus less interesting for social science? . You may be able to finds such effects and compare them using random forest, a machine learning method, or a statistical model but this depend on the assumptions you make and the way that the data is collected.
