Prediction in multiclass classification

Context: I need to make an multiclass classification to predict what type of sentence(law) the case will have in the end. Data: I Have several columns to predict the case:client, cause of action, state and some columns of types of court. My target column is well balanced, and all the columns are categorical (strings) code 1: My code in R of naive-Bayes: library(e1071) model $Sentenca[row] == prediciton_Bayes$ Predicao[row]) { hits Code 2: My code of random forest in R: library(randomForest) set.seed(123) sample_indices $sentenca sentenca) model Problem: Both have low precision, 0.40 and 0.33 respectively. Question: What i can do to increase precision? i'm starting in data science and im kinda lost in this part of make the code/model better. Thanks in advance!
