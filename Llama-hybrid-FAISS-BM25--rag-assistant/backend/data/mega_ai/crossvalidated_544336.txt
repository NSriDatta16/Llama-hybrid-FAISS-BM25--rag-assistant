Interpretation of the Breusch-Pagan bptest () test in R

I am a little confused regarding the interpretation of the Breusch-Pagan bptest () test in R. Thus, a p-value below 5% would mean that homoskedasticity is present and thus in turn reject null hypothesis. If, on the other hand, I have a p-value greater than 5% I have heteroskedasticity so I accept my hypothesis. In my case after bptest () I have: So in this case there is no heteroskedasticity right? BP = 3.8463, df = 4, p-value = 0.4272 ```
