So it seems that the problem was a corrupted Shared Service Provider ( no idea how it came about, but there you go ) and the only working solution I could find was to delete it and start again. I suspect there may have been a more elegant fix by changing something in the database somewhere, but I don't know the Sharepoint Database model well enough to find it in the time available.
