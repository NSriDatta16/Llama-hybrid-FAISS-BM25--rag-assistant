One can construct a confidence interval for the median difference using Walsh averages. It does assume that the distribution of the differences is symmetric, but it seems to be OK here. See this document for an explanation of the procedure. It appears that somebody even wrote a Matlab function for this calculation. EDIT: implementation in Matlab The psignrank function in R calculates the cumulative distribution of the Sign-rank test statistic. If Matlab does not have that function, then you probably can't easily calculate an exact confidence interval. However you can calculate an approximate interval as described here . I think that is the calculation attempted at the end of the Matlab code.
