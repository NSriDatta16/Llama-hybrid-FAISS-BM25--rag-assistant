One way to interpret what's going on here is the equivalence of an MA(1) to an AR( $\infty$ ). Reflecting the MA representation, the ACF goes to 0 after 1 lag. Reflecting the AR representation, PACF (speaking loosely) has non-zero terms out to $\infty$ . Moving average order 1 is equivalent to an auto-regressive order $\infty$ You have created an MA(1) model which is equivalent to an AR( $\infty$ ) model. Your model is: $$y_t = \epsilon_t + \frac{1}{2} \epsilon_{t-1} $$ Using the lag operator , you can write this as: $$ y_t = \left( 1 + \frac{1}{2} L \right) \epsilon_t $$ You can show this is invertible since $\left|\frac{1}{2}\right| hence: $$ \left(1 + \frac{1}{2} L \right)^{-1} y_t = \epsilon_t $$ As I discuss in this answer , this gives you $\sum_{j=0}^\infty \left(-\frac{1}{2} \right)^j y_{t-j} = \epsilon_t $ . \begin{align*} y_t - \frac{1}{2} y_{t-1} + \frac{1}{4} y_{t-2} - \frac{1}{8} y_{t-3} + \ldots &= \epsilon_t \end{align*} From the MA representation, you can easily compute the autocorrelation function: $$ \rho(k) = \left\{ \begin{array}{rr} 1 & \text{ for }k = 0 \\ \frac{1}{2} & \text{ for } k = 1 \\ 0 & \text{otherwise}\end{array}\right. $$ The the slowly tailing off partial autocorrelation reflects the infinite order AR representation. Based on answers here and here , you'll find the PACF for $k\geq 1$ is: $$ \alpha(k) = \frac{\left( \frac{1}{2}\right)^k(-1)^{k+1}}{\sum_{j=0}^k \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{2j}} $$
