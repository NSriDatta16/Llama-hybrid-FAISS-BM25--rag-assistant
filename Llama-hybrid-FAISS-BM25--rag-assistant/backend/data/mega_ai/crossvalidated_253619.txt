This has been up for a while Bind size makes no difference. Yes it put you at a higher risk if getting stacked but the ratios are the same. Lets say have 150 bb You can live 100 orbits before blinding out (ignore blinds go up) Let say you only play if you are 50% or better and the average is 55% So you play exactly 1/2 the hands. We can ignore the blinds as you lose and many as you win. You only check if you are in The average ending pot is 73 bb (that is kind of dangerous as you only start with 150 bb) So for every two orbits the EV for two orbits is -.45(54) + .55(54) = 5.4 bb Lets just ignore you will win more pre-flop action Notice that is in terms of bb so bb going up is not a factor So lets look at you go cold and loose every hand Every 2 round +72/2 + .75 (blind) = 37 If you start stone cold you can live 8 orbits You would need to lose a .45 4 times .45 * .45 * .45 * .45 = 4.1% On average you are going win 2.7 bb so about the only way to go out is go stone cold early. You have the option of folding the flop, turn, or river if cards don't hit, and can raise if they hit then things go up. If you have re-buys then you cannot lose. If it is a tournament with starting stack of 150bb then you will win 95% of the time.
