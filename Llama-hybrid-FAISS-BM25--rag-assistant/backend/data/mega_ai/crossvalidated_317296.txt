Alternatives to ordinal regression when proportional odds assumption is not met

I'm trying to fit an ordinal logistic regression using the ordinal package but the proportional odds assumption is not met. I have read all post here on this. My specific question is that, if you change logit to probit link function, is the proportional odds assumption to be met?
