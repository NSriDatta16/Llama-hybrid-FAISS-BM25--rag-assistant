My suggestion would be to run a goodness-of-fit (GOF) chi square test - as you initially suggested, followed by pairwise comparisons between weekdays, applying the Bonferroni correction. Goodness-of-fit test: If we pretend the following data to be the average number of visits per day of the week observed: week We can calculate the expected to follow a uniform distribution, where the daily frequency of visits is $1/7$ of the weekly total: names(week) And we run the test: chisq.test(week, p = expected) The result is highly significant: Chi-squared test for given probabilities data: week X-squared = 135.6439, df = 6, p-value Pairwise comparisons: This poses a significant problem. If it were only three groups it would be more straightforward, as in this post , but with seven days the pairwise comparisons will amount to ${7 \choose 2} = 21.$ The Bonferroni correction with an initial risk alpha of $0.05$ would be $0.002380952$. We can run a loop : mat And the output in this case will always include $1$, which is Monday - I set it up so that it was the only pairwise comparison with a "significant" p value.
