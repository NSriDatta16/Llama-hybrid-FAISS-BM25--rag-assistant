Magento Checkbox for bundle products needs qty

With a bundled product in magento you can select various types of options - drop down for example adds a Qty box so you may choose the quantity of items from the drop down. I am using Checkboxes instead as i need many choices and need a Qty box associated - how is this possible? I've spent hours trying to code this.
