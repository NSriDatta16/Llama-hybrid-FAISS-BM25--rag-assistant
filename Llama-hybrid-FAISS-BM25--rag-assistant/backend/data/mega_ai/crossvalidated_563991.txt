How to find the likelihood probability of an exponential data model

I have a very basic knowledge in statistics, so I am struggling a bit with the ideas of Bayesian inference. My data model looks like this, $$ z(t) = \sum_{n = 1}^{N} e^{j 4\pi/\lambda \sqrt{(x_{n, t -1} + u_n.dt)^2 + (y_{n, t -1} + v_n.dt)^2}} + \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2) $$ Parameter space is $\theta = [u_n \quad v_n]$ The idea is to find a distribution for $u$ and $v$ given the measurements. I know the prior probability distributions for $u$ and $v$ . So, that is $p(\theta) = p(u_n) . p(v_n)$ . I assume they are independent. Am I correct here? Then, as I understand from the model, $z$ is an exponential complex function of $u$ and $v$ . Therefore, the probability density of $z$ shouldn't be the same as $u_n$ and $v_n$ right? So, how to come up with the likelihood that is necessary in Bayesian inference algorithms? That is $p(z|\theta)$ ? Every example I see, they always start with a PDF model for the data instead of the data model directly. Any idea how to proceed? In the equation, $\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$ is additive zero-mean Gaussian noise with variance $\sigma^2$ , $dt$ is the time step. The $z$ samples are samples in time. The term $N$ is the number of targets. $x_n$ and $y_n$ are positions of $N$ targets and $u_n$ and $v_n$ are their velocities. I also see a potential difference between $z$ and $\theta$ . The $\theta$ is a function of targets and $z$ is a signal in time $t$ .
