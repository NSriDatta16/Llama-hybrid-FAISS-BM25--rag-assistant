Difficult question, what the Amiga scene needs is a growing critical mass. Enough developers interested in the platform to keep contributing code, and programs/applications, i.e. enough wares to make it a viable. Interesting looking at MorphOS, how that platform is coming along. Porting the operating system to many types of old PPC Apple hardware and trying to lower the cost of buying into the platform. PPC has unquestionably had it's day, and although I know that the Amiga scene has an unwarranted distaste for anything x86 based, ARM may come to its rescue, and be alternative enough for the Amiga scene to employ. ARM market dominance of mobile and embedded devices can't be argued with, and their future in desktop/server markets will likely depend on energy efficiency concerns, the development of Internet technologies and essentially the declining importance of desktop applications. So, to answer your question, what do we need? We need to excite developers old and new, and bring the platform into focus. Personally the only thing that would REALLY galvanize people would be an open source Amiga OS 4 port to x86. Anything other that is beating around the bush. And no, a hardware based platform is not going to succeed in the long run, most Amigans are pushing 30-40 (years old) now so it's worth bearing in mind that we aren't getting any younger! Another ten years most young university computer science graduates will be wondering what the fuss is about operating systems, as they try just run their HTML5 apps in Chrome or Firefox and don't bother going deeper than Javascript or C#. ...hang on a minute aren't we already there yet?
