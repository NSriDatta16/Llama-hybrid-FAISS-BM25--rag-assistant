Another good source for "computing algorithms" for HLM's (again to the extent that you view them as similar specifications as LMM's) would be: McCulloch, C., Searle, S., Neuhaus, J. (2008). Generalized Linear and Mixed Models. 2nd Edition. Wiley. Chapter 14 - Computing. Algorithms they list for computing LMM's include: EM algorithm Newton Raphson algorithm Algorithms they list for GLMM's include: Numerical quadrature (GH quadrature) EM algorithm MCMC algorithms (as you mention) Stochastic approximation algorithms Simulated maximum likelihood Other algorithms for GLMM's that they suggest include: Penalized quasi-likelihood methods Laplace approximations PQL/Laplace with bootstrap bias correction
