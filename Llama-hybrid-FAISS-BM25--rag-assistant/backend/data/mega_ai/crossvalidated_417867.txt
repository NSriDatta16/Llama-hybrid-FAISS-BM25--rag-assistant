Similarity measure/metric for long time series

I'm looking for a similarity measure/metric to cluster long time-series datasets. I feel that Euclidean distance won't do any good for my application, for it is not robust enough to detect patterns that are shifted in time. My primary intention was to use Dynamic Time Warping, but the algorithm just doesn't converge with my time-series dataset. This could be due to the fact that my time series are extremely long. I am looking for the next suitable alternative. P.S: I am thankful to the community for replying to my question, in the absence of data. I was essentially looking for a technique that could work well with any generic time-series dataset. I know that there is currently no (and probably will never be) any metric that fits all datasets, but I still wanted to test different metrics on the sets of proprietary data that my project contains and see what works best.
