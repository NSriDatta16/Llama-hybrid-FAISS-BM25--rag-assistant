For your very specific scenario (user id), the short answer is NO ! For the long answer, imagine this hypothetical scenario: You navigate to stackoverflow.com; Fill your username/password and submit the form; The server sends you a cookie containing your user ID, which is going to be used to identify you on the next requests; Since your connection was NOT secure (HTTPS), a bad guy sniffed it, and captured the cookie. The bad guy gains access to your account because the server didn't store, let's say, your IP address, and thus, can't distinguish between your machine and the bad guy's. Still in this scenario, imagine the server stored your IP address, but you're on a corporate LAN, and your external IP is the same of another 100 machines. Imagine that someone that has access to one of these machines copied your cookie. You already got it, right? :-) My advice is: put sensitive information on a HTTP session . UPDATE: having a session implies a cookie (or at least an ugly URL), thus leading us back to the very same problem: it can be captured. The only way to avoid that is adding end-to-end encryption: HTTP+SSL = HTTPS . And if someone says "oh, but cookies/sessions should be enough to discourage most people", check out Firesheep .
