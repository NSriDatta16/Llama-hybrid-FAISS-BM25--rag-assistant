Application could not be verified error when building app for iPhone device

OK, I've just got myself a shiny new MacBook Pro, and having been developing my iPhone app on another MacBook, I wanted to migrate my development to my new computer. I've got to the stage where I can build the app and run it on the simulator no problem, but when it comes to running the app on my iPhone, I keep getting "The application could not be verified". I have installed a new developer certificate, and installed the provisioning profiles (all generated new), but I'm at a loss as to why I should still be getting the error. Anyone have any ideas as to where I'm going wrong? EDIT I've recreated the certificate and profisioning profile, etc... The Build succeeds, and the status at the bottom gets all the way to 'Installing on Device', then two modal dialogs are displayed with the same "Application could not be verified" error message. Is there any output I can get to that will give me a precise error? EDIT OK, I've got the appropriate log from Organizer showing the problem. It looks like I haven't set up the Entitlements.plist, but in xcode, I have. (I've added an Entitlements.plist fole, then unchecked get-task-allow, then added Entitlements.plist to the project settings under Code Signing Entitlements). The log is: Tue Jun 16 07:35:42 unknown mobile_installation_proxy[1162] : install_embedded_profile: Skipping the installation of the embedded profile Tue Jun 16 07:35:42 unknown securityd[1158] : mobile_installat[1162] SecItemCopyMatching: missing entitlement Tue Jun 16 07:35:42 unknown securityd[1158] : mobile_installat[1162] SecItemCopyMatching: missing entitlement Tue Jun 16 07:35:42 unknown securityd[1158] : mobile_installat[1162] SecItemCopyMatching: missing entitlement Tue Jun 16 07:35:42 unknown securityd[1158] : mobile_installat[1162] SecItemCopyMatching: missing entitlement Tue Jun 16 07:35:43 unknown mobile_installation_proxy[1162] : entitlement 'get-task-allow' has value not permitted by a provisioning profile Tue Jun 16 07:35:43 unknown mobile_installation_proxy[1162] : verify_executable: Could not validate signature: e8008016 Tue Jun 16 07:35:43 unknown mobile_installation_proxy[1162] : preflight_application_install: Could not verify /var/tmp/install_staging.1WIVsB/BouldrData.app/BouldrData Tue Jun 16 07:35:43 unknown mobile_installation_proxy[1162] : install_application: Could not preflight application install Tue Jun 16 07:35:43 unknown mobile_installation_proxy[1162] : handle_install: Installation failed Tue Jun 16 07:51:53 unknown afcd[1181] : user mobile has uid 501 Tue Jun 16 07:51:53 unknown afcd[1181] : mode is 0x41e8 Can anyone shed any light on why this isn't working as expected? EDIT Got the build working, but I've not accepted an answer yet, as I have no idea as to what's going on. Anyone with any idea as to what is going on?
