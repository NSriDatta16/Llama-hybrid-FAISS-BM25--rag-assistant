You are looking for the wrong keywords. Logistic regression is for 0-1 outcomes, where the probability of being 1 is modeled with an S-shaped (logistic) function, not the actual data points themselves. Looking for nonlinear regression, specifically the four-parameter logistic model: $y = A + (B-A)/(1+\exp(-(a+bx))) + \epsilon$ (it can show up with other parametrizations). You fill find lots of ELISA related stuff if you search for this model. There is specialized software for fitting this, and of course the major statistical packages also can handle it. Unfortunately, if there is a lot of variability, estimation might be difficult, and the fitting process might "not converge".
