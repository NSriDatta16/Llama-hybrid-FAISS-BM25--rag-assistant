The filestream of sql server 2008

The FILESTREAM feature of SQL Server 2008, allows storage of and efficient access to BLOB data using a combination of SQL Server 2008 and the NTFS file system. When insert a row on a table which contains varbinary column with filestream attribute, the file (data) is stored directly on the file system and assigned the new name (e.g. 00000016-00000079-0006). Is any API of TSQL can check that which file on the file system is associated with the particular row?
