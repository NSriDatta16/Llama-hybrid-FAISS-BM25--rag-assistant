correlation coefficient between weather data and power consumption

I have power consumption and the corresponding temperature data for one year, that is, for several weeks (week1, week2,..., week48) as one month has 4 weeks. I want to forecast power consumption for a month. Forecasting power consumption means forecasting 4 weeks(a month has 4 weeks). I am using Ms excel to obtain the pearson correlation coefficient. The power consumption data and temperature data have a strong correlation of 0.8 for week1 to week48, that is, they have a good correlation for one year. One year means over a large time interval. But over a small time interval, for eg, correlation b/w power consump and temperature for 12 weeks (3 months) is weak (0.2). I want to use a neural network with window size of 3 to represent 12 weeks(3 months) to forecast the next 4 weeks(next month). My question is: since the power data and temperature data has good correlation(0.8) for 48 weeks(1 year) but weak correlation(0.2) for 12 weeks(3 months), is it possible to use a neural network with window size of 3 as mentioned above to predict the power consumption for the next month with input variables power data and temperature data?
