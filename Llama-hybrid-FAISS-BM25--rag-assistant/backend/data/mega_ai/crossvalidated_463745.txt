There is no " $R^2$ " in logistic regression as there is in linear regression. Instead there are a variety of pseudo- $R^2$ s (see here ). None of them mean the same thing as the $R^2$ from linear regression, so they shouldn't be compared (it may help you to read through some of the threads listed here ). When you run this in Excel, you are using what's called the linear probability model . It is possible for it to be an acceptable model (see: Linear probability model ). I might worry a little that you have fewer observations at higher levels of $X$ . I might especially worry about assuming linearity given that $X$ is ordinal. You are making a strong assumption about the nature of $X$ ; you need to be clear about that.
