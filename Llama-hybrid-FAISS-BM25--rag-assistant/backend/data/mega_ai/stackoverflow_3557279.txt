A pt is 1/72th of an inch and is a useless measure for anything that is rendered on a device which doesn't calculate the DPI correctly. This makes it a reasonable choice for printing and a dreadful choice for use on screen. A pixel (px) is formally defined as 1/96 of an inch. Pixels are relative to the viewing device. For older low-dpi devices, 1px is one device pixel (dot) of the display. CSS provides a bunch of other units, and which one you should choose depends on what you are setting the size of. A pixel is great if you need to size something to match an image, or if you want a thin border. Percentages are great for font sizes as, if you use them consistently, you get font sizes proportional to the user's preference. Ems are great when you want an element to size itself based on the font size (so a paragraph might get wider if the font size is larger) â€¦ and so on.
