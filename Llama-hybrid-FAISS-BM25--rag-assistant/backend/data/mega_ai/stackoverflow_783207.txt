I'm not sure what you're trying to do, but if you're looking for something that can say 'this is valid English' or 'this is valid Finnish', then you're looking at a class of problems that is quite likely unsolvable. If not, then use a dictionary and/or letter frequencies and Bayesian analysis to determine whether or not given text is English-like or Finnish-like. If you're trying to auto-detect a language, this is likely the best route, although you'll run into problems with mixed-language text.
