Django timezone mess

I'm working on a localized Django app with a simple forum. Some posts' timestamps show up as if they were posted 7 hours earlier. What's weird is that it happens to some users, sometimes (a user may post once and it's OK, posts again and it's wrong). settings.py: TIME_ZONE = 'Europe/Prague' LANGUAGES = ( ('cs-cz', _('Czech')), ) DATABASE_ENGINE = 'sqlite3' model: class Post(models.Model): created = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True) Running on Apache with mod_wsgi.
