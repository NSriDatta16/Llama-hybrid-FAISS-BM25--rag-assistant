Typically when I was tinkering with these kinds of algorithms, I found that using the open-source Weka Toolkit was a great way to prototype and discover a whole bunch of different learning algorithms (not just artificial neural networks). These days, it looks as though they have bindings from a bunch of different languages, so you shouldn't be tied to Java if you want to interact with Weka at the code level. Once I found and understood something that was cool/doing a pretty good classification job, I wrote the algorithm in C or C++ partly for fun and partly to gain the necessary speed gains required to work with larger data sets.
