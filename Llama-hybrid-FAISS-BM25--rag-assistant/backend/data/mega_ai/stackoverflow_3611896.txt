I'm assuming this doesn't directly apply to you, but if you're developing packages for Bioconductor there's an incentive to use S4 as they actively encourage it's use and have for the better part of a decade now - so all of the core packages make heavy use of S4. I find all of the extra overhead to be a pain - the setGeneric, setMethod, dealing with NAMESPACE, etc. That being said, I find that the structure that it imposes, potential for extensibility and other such things can be worth it. As with everything, there are tradeoffs involved. I think it can be a lot cleaner - I dislike how S3 methods are simply disguised by naming convention (foo.class). All that being said, I tend to avoid using S4 heavily in my own code unless I'm being told to do so.
