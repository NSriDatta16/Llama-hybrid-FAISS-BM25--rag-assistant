Magento 1.4 - Get the quantity of most selling products

What is the php/magento code I can use to get the best selling products and display that name of the product. For example, say I've sold 10 Foos, 20 Bars and 50 Bazes. I want to know how to query the Magento system and have it say "Bazes" are the high selling products (with 50). Thanks you
