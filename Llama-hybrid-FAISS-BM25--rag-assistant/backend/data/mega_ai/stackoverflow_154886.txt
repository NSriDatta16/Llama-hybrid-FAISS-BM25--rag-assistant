Kyle's answer is probably the most perlish, but in case you have it all in one string and want to use a single regex, here's a (tested) solution: ( Second update : fixed a bit, now more readable then ever ;-) my $re = qr{ ( # capture in $1 (?: (?!\n\n). # Any character that's not at a paragraph break )* # repeated error (?: (?!\n\n). )* ) }msxi; while ($s =~ m/$re/g){ print "'$1'\n"; } Ugly, but you asked for it.
