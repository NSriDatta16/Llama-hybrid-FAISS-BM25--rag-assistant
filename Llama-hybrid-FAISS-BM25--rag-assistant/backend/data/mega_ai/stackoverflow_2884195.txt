If you're referring to the HTML5 technology umbrella that includes HTML5, CSS3 JavaScript, SVG, Canvas, Web Workers, Transforms etc etc. then potentially a hell of a lot of processing logic will move onto the client, with server-side tech processing a lot of Ajax requests serving JSON/XML. The server-side will still be very important, you'd still need to validate everything that comes from the client for security reasons, also you'll still be storing stuff on the server-end despite advances in HTML5 offline storage (one of the main benefits of web apps is storing your data in the cloud and accessing from anywhere). Job wise, you're quite safe if you're more into server-end web development, but if I were you and you wanted to keep your skills relevant I'd seriously look at all the HTML5 technologies coming out, it's all very exciting stuff!
