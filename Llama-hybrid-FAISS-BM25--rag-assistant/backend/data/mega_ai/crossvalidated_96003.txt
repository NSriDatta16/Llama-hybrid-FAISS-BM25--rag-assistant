Difference between hierarchical dirichlet process and nested dirichlet process

There have some extensions to Dirichlet process. One is Hierarchical Dirichlet process, and another is Nested Dirichlet Process. What are the differences between these two? I once read the paper of Bayesian Nonparametric Inference -- Why and How . The author discusses their differences as follows, but I am not clear how to understand this. Any more explanations is highly appreciated.
