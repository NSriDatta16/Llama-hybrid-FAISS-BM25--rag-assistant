setprecision(2) will round to the nearest two-digit floating point number, in this case 1.0. If you wanted to truncate (i.e. get 0.99) you could always multiply the number by 100 (i.e. 10^[num-digits]), cast to an int, and then divide it back into a float. A little messy but it gets the job done. const float numberToDisplay = 0.999; const float numberTruncated = (int)(numberToDisplay * 100) / 100.0; // float numberTruncated is 0.99
