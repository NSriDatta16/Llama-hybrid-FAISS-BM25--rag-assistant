Taken from this link - Hope this will help you - This is caused by the following lines in the file c:\Python26\include \pyconfig.h # ifdef _DEBUG # pragma comment(lib,"python26_d.lib") # else # pragma comment(lib,"python26.lib") # endif /* _DEBUG */ So please: Provide python26_d.lib in the installer. or Remove this automatic "pragma comment lib" from pyconfig.h, since I can't disable it from the outside (as far as I know).
