Yes, ordinal logistic regression (also referred to as the proportional odds model) is your best choice. If your outcome were to have 7+ ordered categories, linear regression may also be used, though because you have few ordered categories (i.e., 4) I would use ordinal logistic regression as suggested in the comments by @mkt. Bauer & Sterba (2011) and Bürkner & Vuorre (2019) are good introductions ordinal regression. References Bauer, D. J., & Sterba, S. K. (2011).
