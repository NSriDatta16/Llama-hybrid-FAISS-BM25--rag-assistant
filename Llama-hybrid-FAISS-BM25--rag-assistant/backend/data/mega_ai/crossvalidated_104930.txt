I've thought about this issue before. I've never tried to actually implement my way to resolve the issue so there might be better ways to do this. One thing you can do is assume some unobserved quality of each thing you're evaluating. In this case, you are evaluating students, so this might be something that would be correlated with IQ/standardized test scores/conscientiousness. However, in this case we'll assume you can't observe these variables (or at best the quality variable could be assume to be a function of standardized test scores if you have them). When you have unobserved variables, you typically need to rely on an EM algorithm, though it might be easier with a Bayesian approach (Gibbs sampling or Stan). You would then have a second step of models predicting the grades for each class given this quality measure. There are a number of ways to do this, which I won't get in to (given the quality measure, it's standard). Given you can find the quality measure, you can rank the students. Of course, ideally you should incorporate some measure of uncertainty into the evaluation. For instance, if you assume the quality measure is normally distributed, then it might be that the students with 5 class have lower standard deviations than students with 3 classes. Of course, there are simpler techniques you could use, like multiple imputation for the missing scores and then take a weighted average based on the importance or difficulty of the classes, that would take less time. However, if it were really important to get the rankings right, then this is what I would do.
