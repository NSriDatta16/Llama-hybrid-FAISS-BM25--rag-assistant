Removing a line feed from the header in of a c# web request

I need to remove the last line feed from a http webrequest in order to communicate with an json-rpc service. The request which .net generates looks like this. POST http://localhost.:8332/ HTTP/1.1 User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; MS Web Services Client Protocol 4.0.30319.1) Authorization: Basic dGlwa2c6dGlwa2c= Host: localhost.:8332 Content-Length: 42 Expect: 100-continue Connection: Keep-Alive {"id":1,"method":"getinfo","params":[]} What I would need would be this (notice the missing line feed after last header value and the begin of the json content): POST http://localhost.:8332/ HTTP/1.1 User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; MS Web Services Client Protocol 4.0.30319.1) Authorization: Basic dGlwa2c6dGlwa2c= Host: localhost.:8332 Content-Length: 42 Expect: 100-continue Connection: Keep-Alive {"id":1,"method":"getinfo","params":[]} I can't find anything where I could manipulate the header which is actually sent to service. See http://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?topic=2170.0 for more background on the problem...
