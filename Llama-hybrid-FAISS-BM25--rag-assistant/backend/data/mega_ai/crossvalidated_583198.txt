model learning with binary variable

Let's say I collected data from a single mouse that either pressed a lever (1) or not (0). There were a total of 3 environments ( env ), and the mouse spent 10 minutes wandering (the time variable levels corresponds to each minute). dat1 I'd like to model the mouse's behavior across time , such that larger estimates indicate faster learning. Given that my dependent variable response is binary, I guess logistic regression is my only option, so I tried: summary(glm(response ~ time, data=dat1, family="binomial"))) Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -4.8633 1.7654 -2.755 0.00587 ** time 0.9424 0.3223 2.924 0.00345 ** However, changing the data such that it simulates the mouse learning slower dat2 |z|) (Intercept) -16.2691 7.6916 -2.115 0.0344 * time 1.9912 0.9392 2.120 0.0340 * The estimate for time is actually larger. What is the reason for this? And is this how I should set up my model if the aim is to determine how quick the mouse has learned?
