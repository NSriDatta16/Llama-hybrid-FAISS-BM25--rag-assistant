To add to what derobert said: You're calling 'new' in the 'SUPER' namespace but passing it the object (or string), '$class'. You don't have to use SUPER, as you can give the full package name of the parent (useful in cases of diamond inheritance): sub init { my $self = shift; $self->ParentClass1::init(); $self->ParentClass2::init(); }
