How to create list with different elements and actions?

I want to create list with different types of items. They should call different intents or do other things (display a map etc.) . It should act like contact details. Numbers of items and actions is predefined. How to achieve this effect elegantly? I don't need exact code but guidelines and information where to look. Any help will be appreciated :) UPDATE: By "this effect" I mean creating a list of different types of items (onClickListener, layout). On picture above you can see that you have a contact with various options: calling somebody, emailing, chatting, looking at google maps etc. All of those options are grouped at list. I'm wondering if it could be achieved by xml layout without defining custom Adapter class. I want also be able to add some static header rows with eg. category name.
