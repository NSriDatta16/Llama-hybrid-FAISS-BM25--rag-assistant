If you have a 5-point Likert scale, you would want to entertain an ordinal logistic regression . The analogues of $t$-test is then a regression with dummy variable coded categorical variables (just one regressor with 0/1 values for the $t$-test, and multiple variables with many categories for ANOVA). Some low categories may have to be collapsed to identify the thresholds. For more details, see J Scott Long's book on categorical dependent variables .
