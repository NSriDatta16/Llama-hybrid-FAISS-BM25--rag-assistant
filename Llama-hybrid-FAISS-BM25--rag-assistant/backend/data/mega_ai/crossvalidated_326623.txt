Apply some filters to the data is certainly a good idea. If you look into time series and change point detection literature, you will find many methods that try to model the data with segment-wise different mean. I suggest beginning with this classic: M. Basseville, I.V. Nikiforov, Detection of Abrupt Changes - Theory and Application. Prentice-Hall, Inc., Apr. 1993. which can be downloaded from the authors personal page: http://people.irisa.fr/Michele.Basseville/publis.html
