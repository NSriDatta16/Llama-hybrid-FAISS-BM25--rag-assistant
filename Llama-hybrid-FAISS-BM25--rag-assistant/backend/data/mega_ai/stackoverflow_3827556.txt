Juval Lowy has a great article on the WCF Discovery protocol: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/ee335779.aspx In a nutshell, this leverages UDP's broadcast mechanism to discovery the location of services that implement a specified interface. So, the pattern could be that when a client comes on line it will discover the location of a service and for the life of that client and service they will communicate back and forth. In the event that the service provider were to become unavailable the client can revert to discover another service and then continue. This pattern allows the administrator to setup endless backup services with minimal configuration on the client.
