Storage is billed as an average of all data stored per month. From the Amazon docs : The volume of storage billed in a month is based on the average storage used throughout the month . This includes all object data and metadata stored in buckets that you created under your AWS account. We measure your storage usage in “ TimedStorage-ByteHrs ,” which are added up at the end of the month to generate your monthly charges. Storage Example: Assume you store 100GB (107,374,182,400 bytes) of standard Amazon S3 storage data in your bucket for 15 days in March, and 100TB (109,951,162,777,600 bytes) of standard Amazon S3 storage data for the final 16 days in March. At the end of March, you would have the following usage in Byte-Hours: Total Byte-Hour usage = [107,374,182,400 bytes x 15 days x (24 hours / day)] + [109,951,162,777,600 bytes x 16 days x (24 hours / day)] = 42,259,901,212,262,400 Byte-Hours. Let’s convert this to GB-Months: 42,259,901,212,262,400 Byte-Hours x (1 GB / 1,073,741,824 bytes) x (1 month / 744 hours) = 52,900 GB-Months So in your example (assuming the 2nd megabyte is stored for the remainder of the month) you will be charged for 1MB. Remember though, that there are other charges to consider too, like data transfer in/out and total requests etc.
