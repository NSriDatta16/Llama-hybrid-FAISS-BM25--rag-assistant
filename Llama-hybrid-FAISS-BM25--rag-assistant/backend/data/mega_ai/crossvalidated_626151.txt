Adding 1 before taking the log is not great because of the reasons identified in the comments. However, I'm guessing your DV is measured per county or something like that. It's unlikely you have actual 0s. A county in which not one person has Medicaid? I mean, I suppose it's possible (there are some very small counties) but, in that case, I'd combine neighboring counties. But why take logs? One reason is if our interest is in multiplicative rather than additive notions of the DV. This frequently happens with money variables. We think about raises, or price increases, or whatever, in % terms, not amount terms. \$5 off on a car is meaningless. \$5 off on a sandwich is amazing. How about your case? Are you interested in what causes the Medicaid coverage rate to increase by a fixed amount, or a fixed ratio? Is a change from 10 to 20 the same as one from 20 to 30? Or is it the same as one from 20 to 40? I don't know, but maybe you do.
