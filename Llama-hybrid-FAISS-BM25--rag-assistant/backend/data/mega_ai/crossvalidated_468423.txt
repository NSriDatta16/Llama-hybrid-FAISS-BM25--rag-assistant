How to find the upper outlier threshold in a right skewed distribution?

Say we have a right skewed distribution (tail on the right side) like income. Above what value can I consider data points to be outliers? One way could be Q3 (75th percentile) + 1.5 * Interquartile range (IQR) The other way could be using box-cox transform to convert into a normal distribution and finding the value corresponding to z-score of 3. However, I would like to know if there are more elegant ways of finding outlier thresholds.
