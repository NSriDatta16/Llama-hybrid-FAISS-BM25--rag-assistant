Posting all my findings related to this: Looks like the difference is in-fact between web-app mode and safari mode. You'll get the short user agent in web-app mode (and have no browser bar), the long user agent in safari mode. There are two ways to get into web app mode: Create a web clip and check the 'Full Screen' checkbox Add a meta tag to your website As for why we see both user agents from the same user? When you enter a site in web app mode, clicking on a link will swap the web app and re-open the page in Safari. This will also have cause the cookies to clear, possibly playing foul with your authentication scheme.
