The typical IPv6 allocation is a /32 (four octets) to an Internet provider (which can be a multinational company), then /48 (six octets) to an end site (typically a client organization). You can get a starting point in the IANA list of delegated blocks . This is only for registrations found in the databases of the RIR. Assignment to end users is typically not recorded so, my current address, 2a01:e35:8bd9:8bb0:92b:8628:5ca5:5f2b will tell you only that my provider's headquarters are in Paris (since it is a national company, the clients can be anywhere in France). Another exception is the PI (Provider-Independent) assignements, which are typically /48. Also, there exists many databases of geolocation for IPv4 and, to my knowledge, none for IPv6. You will have to do everything yourself. To summary: more work than you apparently believe.
