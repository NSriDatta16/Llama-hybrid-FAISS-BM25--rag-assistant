Sorting sets of ordered linked lists

I'm looking for an elegant, high performance solution to the following problem. There are 256 linked lists. Each list contains the same types of object that among other things holds a whole number that is used to define a sort order. All numbers across all lists are unique Each individual list is sorted in ascending order by these numbers How would you create a single ascending ordered list from all the objects from the 256 original linked lists? I'd prefer not to brute force it, and have a few other ideas, but this seems like one of those problems that there's a standard, optimal solution for.
