Java Opening external scripts AND giving input/getting output

Alright, still working on a science project involving the testing of the speeds of data sending over the internet with different languages. My teacher doesn't seem to think this is difficult enough, and wants me to run a main Java program to control the clients. I have figured out how to run external files (Still having trouble with spaces in the file name, though) and am fine with that. My trouble is that I need to somehow commucate to the opened client (I've got Python, C, C++, Java, and Ruby client) the number of times to test, and I need to get the dataset obtained through the testing. In the end, I need to find out how to send input to Python, C, C++, Java, and Ruby scripts from java AND gather output from them to put into java. As a last resort, I can probably have a text file act as a mediator between the main java program and each of the clients. This is not a very elegant solution, so I'd rather avoid it.
