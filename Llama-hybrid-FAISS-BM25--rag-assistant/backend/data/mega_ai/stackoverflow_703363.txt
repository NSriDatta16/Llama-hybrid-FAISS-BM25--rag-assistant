NullReferenceException on Page_Load

I'm trying to edit a textbox's text in a Page_Load form on an ASP.NET page, but when I try to edit TextBox1.Text it throws a NullReferenceException because the TextBox has not yet been instantiated. Specifically what I'm trying to implement is this: http://www.codeproject.com/KB/user-controls/popupcalendarcontrol.aspx but it is written for an older version of ASP.NET and does not work for me. Is there a way to instantiate the controls at the start of Page_Load? or another event that I can catch on load? With a normal windows form I would call InitializeComponent() in the constructor.
