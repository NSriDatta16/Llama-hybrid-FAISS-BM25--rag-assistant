Seasonal ARIMA models are just ARIMA models with AR & MA terms at particular lags & some constraints on the coefficients of those terms; so they're modelling additive seasonalityâ€”the variance of the error term doesn't increase with the level of the series. See e.g. here , where it's shown how to express $SARIMA(0,2,1)\times(0,0,1)_{12}$ as $$Y_t-2Y_{t-1}+Y_{t-2}=e_t+\Theta_1e_{t-12}+\theta_1e_{t-1}+\theta_1\Theta_1e_{t-13}$$ A log transformation of the observations is often used when variance does increase with the level: see When to log transform a time series before fitting an ARIMA model .
