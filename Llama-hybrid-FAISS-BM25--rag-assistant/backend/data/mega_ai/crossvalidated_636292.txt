two fixed effect question

I was reading this journal article on two way fixed effects by Michelle M. Marcus & Pedro H. C. Sant'Anna The Role of Parallel Trends in Event Study Settings: An Application to Environmental Economics https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/711509 It says The canonical DID method presumes the existence of two groups, the treated and the comparison group, two time periods, pretreatment and posttreatment periods, s such that the comparison group is not treated in either time period, and the treated group is only treated at the posttreatment period. Then, one estimates the average treatment effect among those treated units by comparing the average difference in pre- and posttreatment outcomes of two groups or, equivalently, by using a two-way fixed effects regression model with a group and a time fixed effect; Hereâ€™s an example of how such a data looks like. ###### Generate random heights and weights heights "2017",1,0) testdf $Year, testdf$ Z) 0 1 2000 1 0 2001 6 0 2002 3 0 2003 9 0 2004 10 0 2005 5 0 2007 8 0 2008 29 0 2009 35 0 2010 49 0 2011 41 0 2012 36 0 2013 35 0 2014 72 0 2015 66 0 2016 92 0 2017 104 0 2018 0 150 2019 0 208 2020 0 24 2021 0 17 How is it possible to fit a two fixed effects model $y_{i,t}$ = $\beta_0$ + $\beta_1$$Z_i$ + $\beta_2$$t$ + $\beta_3$$Z_{it}$ as mentioned by Michelle & Sant'Anna when $Z_i$ {0 or 1 treatment indicator} and time $t_i$ are multi-collinear ? I am stuck here and would greatly appreciate any advise. Thanks in advance. Response to Tomas suggestions i represents each individual subject(child) y is outcome BMI t time in years Exchangeability: Although we have only BMI(outcome) measured once for 99% of the subjects, during either the pre or post period, I am relying on the exchangeability assumption. Because subjects during the pre-treatment era(before 2017) and treatment (2017) were randomly selected, I am assuming exchangeability holds
