Root-mean-square error when having multiple prediction horizons

I have a basic question about the root-mean-square error (RMSE). I have a prediction using an ARIMA model. I predicted a time series and use a rolling-horizon approach with overlapping or non-overlapping prediction horizons. For simplicity let's just say we have not overlapping prediction horizons and I calculate forecasted values from a time series with 30 entries having a prediction horizon of 10. This means that I have 2 iterations: Learning data: ts [0:10], prediction ts [11:20] Learning data: ts [0:20], prediction ts[21:30] Now I want to calculate the RMSE. My question is whether I should calculate the RMSE of each prediction iteration which leads to 2 different RMSE or whether I should store all predicted values and calculate only 1 RMSE for the whole time series? Further I would like to know if the total RMSE in this case would be equal to the average RMSE of the individual prediction iterations? I implemented a function i R to calculate both the local RMSE of the single prediction iterations and the global RMSE of the whole time series. It turned out that the total RMSE is not the average of the 2 local RMSE. As I would definitely not rule out that I made a mistake in the calculation, I would like to know from you whether the total RMSE should be the average of the local RMSE? Here is my R code for calculating both the total RMSE and the RMSE of the single prediction iterations. #This function calculates different error measures for a predicted timeSeries by using the automated #Arima model in a rolling horizon approach with overlapping or non-overlapping prediction horizons errorCalculationArima Can anyone say something about these issues? I'd appreciate every comment. What do you usually do when evaluating a prediction of time series? Do you calculate the total RMSE or the average of the different perdiction interations? Does nobody have an idea about that? Have you never used the RMSE to evaluate prediction results?
