File Storage is not OS independant, even though the contents may be the same, the way it is interpreted is different. A point in case is many years ago I had to port (Business Basic) programs and data from a Datageneral minicomputer to DOS. The files came across with 8bit encoding and had to be translated (to 7 bit) before it could be "understood" on DOS.
