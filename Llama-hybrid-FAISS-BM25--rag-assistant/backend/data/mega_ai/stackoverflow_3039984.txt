First of all - what do you mean by objects? In Python functions are objects and you're most likely using them. :) If by objects you mean classes and instances thereof, then I would say something obvious: no, there is no reason to saying that using them is making your code better by itself. In small scripts there is not going to be any leverage coming from sophisticated OO design.
