Example of REINFORCE implementation without neural nets

Do you know of any REINFORCE algorithm implementation that use other optimizer instead of neural networks? Every implementation I see around uses them (like https://medium.com/@thechrisyoon/deriving-policy-gradients-and-implementing-reinforce-f887949bd63 ), and as far as I know the algorithm does not exactly require its use.
