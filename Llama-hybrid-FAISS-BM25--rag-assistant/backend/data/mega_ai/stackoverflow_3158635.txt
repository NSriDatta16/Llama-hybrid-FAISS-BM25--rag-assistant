How to implement the Bayesian average algorithm for a binary rating system

I have a system where people can up vote or down vote an item and I want to display the results of that as a 5 star rating. I have been trying use the Bayesian Rating algorithm explained here and here with no success. For example: I have three items (A, B and C) in my database: A = 500 UP and 500 down votes B = 0 UP and 1000 down votes C = 0 UP and 1000 down votes How do i calculate the Bayesian average rating for each item so that it has a score on a scale of 1 to 5?
