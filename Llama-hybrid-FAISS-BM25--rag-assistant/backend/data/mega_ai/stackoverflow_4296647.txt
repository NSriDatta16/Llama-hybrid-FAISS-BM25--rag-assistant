The color property does not belong in the fonts or text categories of properties. It actually lives in its own section of the spec, both CSS1 and CSS2.1 . There is even an entire CSS3 module dedicated to color. Each specification refers to color as defining the foreground color, then describes it as referring to the color of the element's text content. But since foreground-color would be unnecessarily verbose, the word "foreground" is left out of the property name. background-color is self-explanatory and serves as a distinction from color . That said, while the color property typically affects the text of an element, if you also specify a border but don't specify a border-color , the border will take on the same color as the text. This is completely normal because it is stipulated in the CSS box model specification : If an element's border color is not specified with a border property, user agents must use the value of the element's 'color' property as the computed value for the border color. This block has red text and a red 1-pixel dotted border. Notice only the width and style are specified in the style attribute. Martin Algesten in his answer has a nice summary of the difference between the font and text properties.
