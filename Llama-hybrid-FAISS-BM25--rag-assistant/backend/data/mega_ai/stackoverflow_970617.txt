If you are unable to find a solution using nhibernate, you could look into something like RedGate's SQL Compare tool. This tool makes it incredibly easy to perform comparisons on different databases and see the schema differences. They also have a software development kit that allows you to leverage the power of SQL Compare in your own applications (something I have not yet gotten into, but would love to if the need ever arose).
