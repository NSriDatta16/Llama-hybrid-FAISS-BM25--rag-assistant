How do I create a schema like .dbo in SQL Server [2005]

I am creating a database in SQL Server 2005 and cannot remember the "CREATE SCHEMA" statment, if that's it, to create a new schema similar to ".dbo". I did it last night, but I cannot remember how and cannot find the article. What I'm trying to accomplish is a database organization like that of the AdventureWorks database where the tables are separated into: Person.Contact, Person.*, HumanResources.blah, Other.Blah, etc. It's an easy question I'm sure...I just can't remember. Thanks in advance!
