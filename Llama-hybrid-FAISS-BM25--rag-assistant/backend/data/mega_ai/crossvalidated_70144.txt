How to accomplish unsupervised separation of subpopulations?

I have a dataset drawn from a social network that looks Bimodal on logarithmic scales for all attributes (I'll demonstrate only one here): I know the variable that would give me a clean separation for the two subpopulations (e.g., gender): However, I need to come up with the same separation of the two clusters without using that binary variable (I could use internal knowledge of the two sub-populations statistics such as averages, stds etc .. ) in an unsupervised manner. I tried using Gaussian Mixture Models with EM, however, it didn't perform well on this dataset. Clearly what seems normal on logscale it isn't in reality :P I am looking for a package in python, R or Matlab that would be able to assign individual points to those two clusters.
