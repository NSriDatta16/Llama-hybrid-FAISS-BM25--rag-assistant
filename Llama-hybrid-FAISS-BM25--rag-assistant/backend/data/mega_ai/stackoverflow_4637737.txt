If you're already using jQuery here, you might want to consider jQuery templates here, it would most likely clean up your code quite a bit and make your life easier. There can be performance tradeoffs (but I think string interpolation is faster than string concatenation in JavaScript, so this could even be faster?), but what you may or may not lose in performance, it's a much more elegant solution. You could keep your entire template in one place (maybe an external file, or parts of it hidden in the DOM of your document, I haven't used it enough to tell you what the best practice is), and then use jQuery templates to do the string replacement. There are multiple jQuery-based template frameworks, but the one I linked to is becoming an official part of jQuery.
