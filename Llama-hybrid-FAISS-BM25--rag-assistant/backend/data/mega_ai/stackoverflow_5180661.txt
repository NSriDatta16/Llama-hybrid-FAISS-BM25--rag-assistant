Looking for something similar to this dropline menu

I have searched high and low looking for a menu like the one at the following site: www.ultragraph.co.uk All i can find is simple dropline menu's. Does anyone know where i might be able to find one similar to the one on ultragraph.co.uk? I'm basically trying to find one where the sub-menu is hidden and reveals on mouseover. Thanks in advance, Lee
