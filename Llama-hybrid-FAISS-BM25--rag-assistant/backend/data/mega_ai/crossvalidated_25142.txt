How to select discrete cosine transform coefficients as a feature vector?

I need to use DCT on frames of videos as a feature vector to train a Feed-forward artificial neural network, but the problem is the large number of coefficients (in thousands or so). How can I choose some of these coefficients and still capture the majority of information for my image (frame)?
