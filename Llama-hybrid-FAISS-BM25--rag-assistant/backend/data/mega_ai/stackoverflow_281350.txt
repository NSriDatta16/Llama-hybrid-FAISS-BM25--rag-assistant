release configuration management

Our windows deliverable has different sets of config files and binary assets for different customers. Right now the configuring is done by hand before packaging and its error prone. What do you think of using branches for each customer, and having the package build/script automerge the customer's branch with trunk? I'm less concerned with scalability than I am of getting this automated ASAP. The entire packag contents is in SVN, but SVN branching and merging is so delicate that I don't trust it to work consistently when its automated. If you guys like the idea I might try to use git-svn for this, because it will hopefully make merging less delicate. We don't necessarily have to merge the assets, because they are organized so the installer can just skip inappropriate directory trees, but configuration is not so simple.
