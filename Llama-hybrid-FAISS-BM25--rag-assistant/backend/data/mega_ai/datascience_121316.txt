Different patterns in dataset

Suppose some features in a dataset have a linear correlation with the target variable, some have a polynomial correlation, and for categorical features, the target values tend to distribute differently across classes. What should we do in such a situation? Should we create separate models for each scenario and then average their outputs, for instance? Or is there a way to handle all of these cases simultaneously? One approach that comes to mind is using decision trees or random forests. However, wouldn't that be a waste of the linear or polynomial correlation with the target values?
