parallelize inner loop using openmp

I have three nested loops but only the innermost is parallelizable. The outer and middle loop stop conditions depend on the calculations done by the innermost loop and therefore I cannot change the order. I have used a OPENMP pragma directive just before the innermost loop but the performance with two threads is worst than with one. I guess it is because the threads are being created every iteration of the outer loops. Is there any way to create the threads outside the outer loops but just use it in the innermost loop? Thanks in advance
