Most efficient way to make sure a line exists in a plain text file

I'm using C# (.Net 2.0), and I have a fairly large text file (~1600 lines on average) that I need to check periodically to make sure a certain line of text is there. What is the most efficient way of doing this? Do I really have to load the entire file into memory each time? Is there a file-content-search api of some sort that I could use? Thanks for any help/advice.
