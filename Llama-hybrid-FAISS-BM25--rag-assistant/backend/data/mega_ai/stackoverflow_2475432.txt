Trying to get unique records with MySQL

I have a query that is looking at a 'page_views' table. And I so far have the ability to get the total views by day. However, I am having an issue with getting unique views by day. The column I am testing against is user_id... Here's the query I have for total views. SELECT site_id, CONCAT( month(created_at) , '-' , day(created_at) , '-' , year(created_at) ) as created_at_date, COUNT(*) as total_results FROM page_views GROUP BY day(created_at) I can't figure out the logic to just get the total unique views by day unique being based on the user_id column. Schema: id:int user_id:int site_id:int request_uri:varchar referer:varchar user_agent:varchar created_at:datetime
