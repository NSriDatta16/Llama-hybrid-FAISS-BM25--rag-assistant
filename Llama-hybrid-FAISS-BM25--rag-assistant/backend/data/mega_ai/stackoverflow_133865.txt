How to access button positions from codebehind?

I have one third party Popup to display message. It has two properties OffsetX and OffsetY. To set its position in browser. Now i am invoking this Popup on Button Click event. I need this popup just next to my Button and for that i have to set above mentioned OffsetX and OffsetY properties of Popup. I tried following code on Button's Click Event, Popup.OffsetX = Button.Style.Item("Top") Popup.OffsetY = Button.Style.Item("Left") But values of Button.Style.Item("Top") and Button.Style.Item("Left") are always nothing and Popup always appear in Left Bottom corner due to value = nothing. FYI, I did not set Top and Left from CSS. I just dragged the button from tool box.
