Probability of mean of random sample being in a certain range

I got this question on a test: The average jumping distance for males between the ages of 20 to 30 is 6.5 feet with a standard deviation of 0.523 feet. What is the probability, from a sample of 5 males between the ages of 20 to 30, having a sample mean jumping distance between 6 and 7 feet. I don't want you to solve it for me, but please point out the general workflow for solving such problems, because I don't know where to begin.
