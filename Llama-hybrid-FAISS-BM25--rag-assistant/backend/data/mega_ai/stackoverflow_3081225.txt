You will need to install the relevant database engine with the correct service name, and create the database and relevant objects on installation. Overall probably not a good solution unless you really need a fully fledged database engine, and even then i local database might be easier. Bear in mind that the installation of a serious database engine often has complication which would baffle the average PC user. Can't you use something like sqllite, or berkelydb? What exactly are the requirements?
