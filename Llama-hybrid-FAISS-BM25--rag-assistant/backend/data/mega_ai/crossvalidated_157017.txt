The average proportions across the nominal variable groupings can be tested for rate differences as suggested. The Tukey test for two group comparisons would be one appropriate test, based on the information supplied. As noted, chi-square tests across the two-way table of observed frequencies would also work as a basic test of unrelatedness or independence. This test assumes symmetry of the rows and columns. A more appropriate test would be to use an asymmetric log-linear model where the rows (test vs control groups) predict the columns (binary outcome). For two-way tables, the answer shouldn't change, but the hypothesis and design would. You haven't said anything about the total sample sizes. For chi-square tests, the rule of thumb is to have sample sizes 4 or 5 times the number of cells. That raises questions about type II or power errors. Do you have enough information to detect a significant and meaningful difference, if one exists? We don't know.
