Proxy account has failed while executing SSIS through Agent

Recently when I created a SQL Server Agent(2008) job to execute a SSIS package with proxy account, it failed with the below error message. What is this exception about? What causes it and how do I resolve it? Error Message Executed as user: blaw. The process could not be created for step 1 of job 0xD5A5 (reason: A required privilege is not held by the client). The step failed. Note:-It is working fine with Agent Service account. Thanks
