Supervised learning depends on the quality of the labelling, and in fact mislabelled examples can be highly problematic in some regimes (e.g. consider a 0-1 problem and boosting combined with a generative classifier, when a mislabelled point is very representative of one class but labelled as belonging to the other). With good labelling I think that you would expect a supervised approach to outperform a semi-supervised applied to the same problem on average (but not always). I don't have a reference, but I think one could show this using an information theoretic argument along the lines of "conditioning reduces entropy". Unsupervised learning is rather different, but I imagine when you compare this to supervised approaches you mean assigning an unlabelled point to a cluster (for example) learned from unlabelled data in an analogous way to assigning an unlabelled point to a class learned from labelled data. Similarly to semi-supervised, I think supervised should do better on average assuming the labels on training data are good. If I understand you correctly, you are using an unsupervised method to apply labels to training data, and you then want to employ a supervised method trained on that labelled training data. Then I think you can only expect to do well if your unsupervised method is good at labelling, and probably poorly otherwise.
