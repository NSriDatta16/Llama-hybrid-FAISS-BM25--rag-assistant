from http://api.jquery.com/load/ Loading Page Fragments The .load() method, unlike $.get(), allows us to specify a portion of the remote document to be inserted. This is achieved with a special syntax for the url parameter. If one or more space characters are included in the string, the portion of the string following the first space is assumed to be a jQuery selector that determines the content to be loaded. So, basically, use load() function and add the specific div selector at the end of the url.
