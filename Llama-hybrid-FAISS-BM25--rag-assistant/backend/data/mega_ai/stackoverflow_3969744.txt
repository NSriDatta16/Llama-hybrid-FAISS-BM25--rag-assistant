Stream the file into a SAX parser and read it into memory in chunks. SAX gives you a lot of control and being event-driven makes sense. The api is a little hard to get a grip on, you have to pay attention to some things like when the characters() method is called, but the basic idea is you write a content handler that gets called when the start and end of each xml element is read. So you can keep track of the current xpath in the document, identify which paths have which data you're interested in, and identify which path marks the end of a chunk that you want to save or hand off or otherwise process.
