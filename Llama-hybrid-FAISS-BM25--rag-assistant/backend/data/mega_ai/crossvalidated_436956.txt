If you care more about predictive accuracy you are better off using a machine learning method (e.g. regression trees, support vector machines, etc.). Multinomial regression is difficult to interpret at the best of times, while something like a regression tree can give you more easily interpretable statistics like variable importance. However, I think there might be a conceptual problem with your approach. Is your goal to create a model that will take in a list of ingredients a person likes and then predict a single dish that they would like to eat? If so, you won't have 40 dependent categorical variables. Rather your will have a one categorical variable with 40 levels. This is a problem that either multinomial regression or a classification algorithm (as mentioned above) can handle. The output would be a single a single dish that the model predicts the individual would like the most. If you want to create a model that will take in a list of ingredients a person likes and then predict for each dish the probability the individual would like to eat it, then you actually have a multivariate problem. It would become multivariate as there would be 40 categorical variables with each one having a score for being liked (1-5) that the model needs to predict. In this case you could use something like a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) or its permutational variant (PERMANOVA) and then predict the score for each variable. Since your response variables are all ordinal and ranked 1 - 5 they are basically on a likert scale, which MANOVAs are robust enough to handle . Let me know if anything is unclear or I have misunderstood your question!
