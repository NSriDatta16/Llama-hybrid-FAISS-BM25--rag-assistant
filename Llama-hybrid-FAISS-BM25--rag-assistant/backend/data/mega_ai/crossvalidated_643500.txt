Why run a chi-square of independence test before the multinomial logistic regression?

I would like to find out why is it necessary and key to run the chi-square test before the multinomial logistic regression? I am reading someone's unpublished work and it says the Chi square test is initially performed to confirm which variables to run the multinomial logistic regression model, what does this imply and why is it necessary? Does it mean only those with a significant association are assessed further through multinomial or binary logistic (since I am using the two models)? What is the link between association (significant and non significant) and regression? I understand the role of the chi-square test is to test the association between the dependent and the independent variables (socio-demographic variables in my case). I am not sure the link about the chi square and regression and why you need to perform the two to identify the factors that affect a phenomena under study? The two papers first did a chi square test before the multinomial logistic regression.
