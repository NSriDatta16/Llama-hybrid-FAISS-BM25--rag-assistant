The information requirements are the most important part. This is another way of saying "determine the purpose of your system", from a response provided by CMS. Conceptual data modeling is just an organized way of collecting and presenting the information requirements. Every value stored and served up by the database is connected to an attribute, and every attribute to a domain. Attributes, in turn, describe either entities or relationships among entities. Subject matter entities and relationships make up the conceptual structure of the "real world" that the data describes. Building an ERD from a conceptual model is easy, although tedious. After that, you can pick a DBMS, design the logical database, design the physical database, and build. At each step, the decisions you make are more reversible, due to data independence. Data independence encapsulates design decisions inside the database, except for performance consequences. You have to know your tool, of course. Having a tool for managing models, and converting them to diagrams and scripts can be very helpful at speeding this process up, and cutting down on errors. But if you have serious errors or omissions in your information requirments, no amount of clever design or implementation is going to make up for that.
