Auto-encoders' learning process and overfitting

Reading about autoencoders from Ian Goodfellow's deep learning book , and they made this statement about autoencoders learning process on page 494: "Unfortunately, if the encoder and the decoder are allowed too much capacity, the autoencoder can learn to perform the copying task without extracting useful information about the distribution of the data." Can someone please explain what they mean by this sentence, capacity in what sense?
