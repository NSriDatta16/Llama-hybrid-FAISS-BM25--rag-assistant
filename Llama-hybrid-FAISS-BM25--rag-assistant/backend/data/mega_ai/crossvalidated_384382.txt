Should the validation set have the same ratio in the categories as the whole data?

I'm currently working on a classification problem. The variable Y in 70% of cases is 0 and in 30% of cases is 1. Does my validation set have to have this same proportion? I ask because after using random forest and training my model I get this prediction values with the training set: precision recall f1-score support 0 0.92 0.92 0.92 1485 1 0.88 0.88 0.88 949 avg / total 0.91 0.91 0.91 2434 and these with the validation set: precision recall f1-score support 0 0.88 0.68 0.77 890 1 0.09 0.25 0.13 110 avg / total 0.79 0.64 0.70 1000 That is to say there is overfitting in the label 1. The only thing that occurs to me that can happen is that this badly built validation set. I already tried to modify the hyperparameter but always presents the same phenomenon
