You can refer to the link Forecasting Time Series: Stationary vs Non-Stationary . For your question, I believe that it may can be used for stationary data but with a several impact. As what been discussed in the previous question in the link, certain model are not limited to specific type of data but it might come with a price. The ARIMA (0,1,0) for example can be used for non stationary data even though most are familiar with using it for stationary data. Hence as for the implication, the outcome might be different as what been described for long run and short run. By using a model that is not specified to be used might cause the model outcome to be problematic in the long run but for the short term, the outcome maybe can still be used.
