IDE Duel -- Zend Studio 7 or Dreamweaver CS4

I'm developing PHP apps that leverage several frameworks (though not the Zend Framework yet...) and I make good use of Javascript (mostly jQuery). All mark-up is XHTML, of course, with CSS, etc. I'm looking to move beyond the beautiful simplicity of Notepad++. I'm using Windows Vista. I'm trying to decide between Zend Studio 7 or Dreamweaver CS4. They seem pretty on par with each other, but the price points are different. I've seen a few lists of "Good things about Dreamweaver" or "Good things about Zend Studio" but I've yet to find a head-to-head comparison. Any suggestions on the next IDE to move up to? In addition to the language support and basic error checking (syntax-related, like missing semi-colons or something), I'm looking for two things that are absolutely necessary: "Projects" or something similar -- open a project and it gives a tree listing of all related files beneath. I'm pretty sure both support this. As lightweight as possible. Vista's a hog as it is, and I'd like to have a lightweight enough IDE that having 10 files open and moving between them won't drain my resources. Other niceties: Automatic documentation (not sure what the phrase is, the stuff in comments above functions with the @parm stuff). Templating. SVN support. FTP/File upload capabilities. ... And, if Zend or Dreamweaver isn't the thing -- any suggestions about what is?
