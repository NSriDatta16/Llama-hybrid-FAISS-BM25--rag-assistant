I would recommend switching to SL4 if you want many advanced features which are present in a traditional desktop Application. Some of them are You can have better clipboard support -- I just heard about it, have to check it out Printing support will be added. At present it is not there At present if you try to scroll a DataGrid using your mouse ball, it doesn't work. It is there in SL4 You can create right-click menus to handle right-clicks. Reminds you of desktop apps? You need Microphone access? Or webcam access? At present Flash can do it but Silverlight cannot. It is there in upcoming SL4 I heard that RichTextArea is also coming. I need to confirm this and tell Somone I know was talking about support for codecs like H.264 ! Since Microsoft has paid the royalty for H.264 to MPEG LA , they can probably think of putting it inside Silverlight 4 for streaming videos. My 2 cents :) Probably they are giving some more enhancement in DataGrid apart from mouse-wheel. Let's see. Apart from that as far as I remember from the Silverlight 4 beta announcements, can anyone confirm? Notification API COM Support Better themeing support Drag and Drop Probably the list is endless. OTOH if you want a list of what's new in Silverlight 3, you probably need to read the release notes or here are a few things, I have no idea if you need them or not. NetworkStatus API to check if network is available or not. i.e. Connected/Disconnected It can use GPU to relieve your CPU from the heavy stress If you want to make beautiful UIs, then Pixel Shader can come to your use. I have never tried, but heard that there is Perspective 3D support too.
