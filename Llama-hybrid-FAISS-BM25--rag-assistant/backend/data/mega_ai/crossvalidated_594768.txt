Chi-square is perfectly acceptable for data like this. However, there are added benefits to logistic regression. Where as chi-square asks "is there difference between groups?" logistic regression asks " what is the difference between groups". You also get confidence intervals for both proportions and the difference in those proportions (albeit on the log odds scale, but there are ways around this). Logistic regression offers a much richer set of inferences in my opinion.
