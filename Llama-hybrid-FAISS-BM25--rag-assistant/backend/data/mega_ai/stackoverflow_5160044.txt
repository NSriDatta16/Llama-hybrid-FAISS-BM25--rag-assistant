C++: What is the proper way of organising a programs subsystems?

Imagine you have a large application project, the code is split into a range of subsystems implemented as classes derived from CBaseSubsystem. Here already comes my first question: Is it a good idea to organize subsystems as classes [derived from a base class]? Then, you have your subsystem classes. Now, you will need create have instances of them somewhere. But where? Is it a good idea to have every subsystem instance stored in a global variable, for example: extern CEventSystem* g_EventSystem; Where should the instances be actually created? All together in a main()-like function? Or is it better to avoid global variables entirely and organize the instances in a CSubsystemManager class or the like? Would using singleton classes be an appropriate approach?
