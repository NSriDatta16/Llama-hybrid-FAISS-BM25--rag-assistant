There are a few different ways that you could do this. One approach would be to use the Beta-Binomial distribution ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-binomial_distribution ) and use the predictions from your logistic regression to choose values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ that give the predicted probability and sum to the approximate degrees of freedom for your model. A probably simpler approach (with a fast computer) is to use simulation. First simulate a probability from a normal (or beta may be better) with mean $\hat p$ and variance $\frac{\hat p (1-\hat p)}n$ , where $n$ is the degrees of freedom from your model. Then generate a count from a binomial with the simulated $\hat p$ , repeat the whole process a bunch of times, then take the middle portion of the predicted counts as your prediction interval. If you fit the logistic regression using Bayesian methods and McMC computations, then this is even simpler as you would just generate a random count based on the predicted $\hat p$ for each iteration.
