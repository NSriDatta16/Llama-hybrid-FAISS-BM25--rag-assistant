Can I send an ACK response to a successfully received SYNACK using BSD raw sockets?

My code tries to manually establish a TCP handshaking, and then, it sends a data segment requesting a resource via HTTP GET . I'm using raw sockets to craft the headers and send the packets, and libpcap in order to check for the received packet headers. The SYN is successfully sent to the receiver, who then replies me with a SYNACK . At this point so far it works, but when I receive that SYNACK , I try to ACK it, and then send HTTP GET next, which doesn't look to work. I can see the headers are ok in wireshark. So my questions are: can i ACK the SYNACK via raw sockets just as I receive it using the same socket I used to send the SYN ? And is there any required OPTIONS to go along with the headers in order to accomplish that? I'm ACKing that SYNACK , and just after that I send a segment with ACK and PSH flags set in order to request a resource via HTTP . I can see them both on wireshark, but I don't get a response from the server.
