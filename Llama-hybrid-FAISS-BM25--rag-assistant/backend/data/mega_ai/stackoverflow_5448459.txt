I am answering instead of commenting so this can be voted on. Choosing a codec that is not on this list ( http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff462087(v=VS.92).aspx ) will be problematic for you. To my knowledge there is no way to play an audio file outside of using one of these formats (I could be wrong). Regardless (for a WP7 app) I would stick with on of the standard codecs. You have a couple options.. you can use the standard Silverlight MediaElement (which will let you play any of the aforementioned codecs) or you can leverage the XNA library's SoundEffect/SoundEffectInstance classes (A good starting place for SoundEffect is here - http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.xna.framework.audio.soundeffect.aspx ). The XNA classes will give you more flexibility, BUT (from what I have read) you will be limited to WAV files only (someone can corect me if I'm wrong).
