Think a bit about how your libary will be used, and organize it that way. If someone is unlikely to use one small part without using the whole thing, structure it as one big include. If a small part is independent and useful on its own, make sure you can include just enough for that part. If there's some logical grouping that makes sense, create include files for each group. As with most programming questions, there's no one-size-fits-all answer.
