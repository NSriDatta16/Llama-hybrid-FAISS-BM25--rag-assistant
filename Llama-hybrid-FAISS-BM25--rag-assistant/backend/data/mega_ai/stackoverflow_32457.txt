Load is a big consideration. Put limits on how often you crawl a particular site and what is the most basic info you need to accomplish your goal. If you are looking for text do not download all images, stuff like that. Of course obey robots.txt but also make sure your user agent string includes accurate contact info and maybe a link to a web page describing what you are doing and how you do it. If a web admin is seeing a lot of requests from you and is curious you might be able to answer a lot of questions with an informative web page.
