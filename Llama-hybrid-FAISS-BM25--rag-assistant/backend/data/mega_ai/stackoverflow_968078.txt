FORTRAN 77 To be fair, perhaps that in 1977 it was a pretty good language, but by the time 1999 rolled around I had to maintain a FORTRAN 77 program that was originally started by my advisor when he was a grad student sometime in the 1970's, (on punch cards, orignally). The program was 'enhanced' hacked, plugged for over twenty years by people of various abilities. The oldest code was ALLCAPS, chock full of GOTO statements, global variables, and functions with more parameters than I have fingers. Originally variable names in Fortran were limited to 6 characters, but to save bytes most variables were given such descriptive names as 'A', 'B', 'AA', 'II', etc. Granted, much of my experience was related to how the program was written, but the language didn't really encourage good programming style: Implicit typing depending on the first letter of the variable name (e.g. names that started with an 'I' to 'N' were integers, otherwise the default was REAL) Fixed statement layout (a holdover from punch cards: column 0 would indicate a comment line if it had a 'C', labels in columns 1-5, continuation character in column 6, statements in columns 7-72) Statement labels (numeric labels at that) KEYWORDS WERE ALL CAPS Thankfully it's been 10 years since I've looked at FORTRAN and I've forgotten more of the annoyances that I remember.
