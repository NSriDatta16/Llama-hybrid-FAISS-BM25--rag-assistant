I think the error might be caused because you are giving a plain text as input to your model. While preparing a model and training it, I usually use a tokenizer from keras.preprocessing.text.Tokenizer and after the training session I save the tokenizer as a .pkl file. You can then load the tokenizer along with your model and feed the already trained tokenizer with your text, and after all this process you can give as input to your model the tokenized text. Example: from keras.models import load_model loaded_model = load_model("model.h5") tokenizer = pickle.load(open('tokenizer.pickle', 'rb')) text = "i love machine learning and google" token = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences([text]) # you should make the proper padding before prediction token = keras.preprocessing.sequence.pad_sequences(text, maxlen=250) loaded_model.predict(text)
