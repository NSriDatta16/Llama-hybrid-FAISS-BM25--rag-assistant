Experiences with User Interface Schema Definitions?

On my current project, we're developing a "designer" tool (with GWT) that allows users to build forms in their browser. These forms are displayed in various channels (e.g. web, mobile, sms) to capture data and make decisions based on user input. When I joined the project, it was in a proof-of-concept phase and the form definitions created where serialized as XML (using JAXB) with element names that seemed logical. Now that we're moving the PoC to production mode, we're thinking it might be better to change our form definitions to leverage something that's more "industry standard". If nothing else, it'll help with marketing. ;-) I've found a number of options and wondering if anyone has experience using them. User Interface Markup Language (UIML) USer Interface eXtensible Markup Language (UsiXML) Numerous others: including AAIML, AUIML, XIML, XUL, XAML and XForms If you've developed some sort of "form designer" tool that renders to multiple channels, I'd love to hear about your experience. Did you use some sort of industry standard to define your form elements, layout, etc. or did you come up with your own? Thanks, Matt
