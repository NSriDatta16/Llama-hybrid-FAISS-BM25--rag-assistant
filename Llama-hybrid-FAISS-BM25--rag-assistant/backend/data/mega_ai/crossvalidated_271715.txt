It would appear to me that "binge-iness" is a relative notion. It would be nice to produce an estimate in real units in order to compare users. You might consider storing the actual mean time-between-events instead of the mean label. Then, each user has an average visit period in units of minutes, which is nice, because we can directly compare different users. In the previous construction, a user who did the thing once every 10.1 minutes would be indistinguishable from a user who visited every 200 minutes. Further, a user who visited the site every 10.1 minutes would look much worse than a user who visited every 9.9 minutes, despite being quite similar. After that, you could take the 90th percentile of visit periods and label them "bingey". Futher: plotting this distribution will give you a clear sense of what the boundary of "bingey" ought to be.
