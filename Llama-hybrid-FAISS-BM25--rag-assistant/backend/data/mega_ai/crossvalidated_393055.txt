Try squaring your transformed PC1 (eqn 1) and compare it to the directly weighted loading (option 2) - you will see that it is the square of the direct weighting. For your purposes there is no need to manipulate the eigenvectors themselves, what you should adjust is the scores applied to each PC (which is method 2).If you manipulate the eigenvectors themselves, you are directly manipulating the underlying reality of your covariance structure. Eigenvectors are unit vectors, so they have an overall weight of 1 - if you mess with that you just make life complicated for yourself in correcting for when to square and when to square root, as you would need to work out with solution 1. If you manipulate the scores, you are simply observing what happens as you manipulate observations, which sounds more like what you want. The PCA equation it is very simple. $ Data = Scores * PCs$ If you adjust the scores there is no squaring involved - the effect of scaling changes are inherently handled by the nature of linear algebra multiplication.
