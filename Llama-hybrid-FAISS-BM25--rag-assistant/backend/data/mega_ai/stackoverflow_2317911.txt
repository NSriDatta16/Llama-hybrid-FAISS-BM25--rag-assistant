At the end of the day I solved it using a secondary nvarchar column. and triggers to translate between them. I have written functions in plsql that do a byte conversion to and from Unicode, using a custom encoding realized by many many if statements. And for each column with the problematic data I added a second column with nvarchar storage, and triggers that uses that function to translate the problematic data. So the legacy applications uses and updates the varchar columns, and the triggers translate it to the Unicode columns. and the .Net code uses the Unicode columns, and again the triggers translate the info to the problematic encoding used in the legacy application. If you need more info, please feel free to contact me for more information
