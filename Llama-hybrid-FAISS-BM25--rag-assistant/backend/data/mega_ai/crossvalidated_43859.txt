After digging about and reading various papers I discovered that the definition is referenced as given in a paper by R.Kohn in 1980, On the Spectral Decomposition of Stationary Time Series Using Walsh Functions. I In short there are two definitions depending upon whether or not the values being added are integers or reals. Luckily I am only concerned with the integer case which is a little simpler. Kohn defines the $\oplus$ operation on integers as follows: Let $m,n$ be integers and $m_j,n_j$ be restricted to 0 or 1, then \begin{align} m=\sum_{j=0}^fm_j2^j \hspace{2mm} \text{and} \hspace{2mm} n=\sum_{j=0}^fn_j2^j \end{align} the dyadic sum then is \begin{align} m\oplus n=\sum_{j=0}^f|m_j-n_j|2^j \end{align} He gives as an example $5\oplus 3=6$. While $f$ isn't defined it appears to mean the 'useful' domain of the function because \begin{align} 5=2^0*1+2^1*0+2^2*1+\sum_{j=3}^{\infty}0*2^j\hspace{2mm} \text{and} \hspace{2mm} 3=2^0*1+2^1*1+\sum_{j=2}^{\infty}0*2^j \end{align} Then \begin{align} 5\oplus 3=2^0*|1-1|+2^1*|0-1|+2^2*|1-0|+\sum_{j=3}^{\infty}|0-0|*2^j=6 \end{align}
