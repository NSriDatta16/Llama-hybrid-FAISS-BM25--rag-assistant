Simple question on trend in time-series

Problem: I have a single list of data that is updated with a new value every few seconds. I simply want to check whether the data points in that list are decreasing, increasing or staying steady over time. It would also be helpful to quantify that the strength of the trend. So far, I have looked at the Pearson correlation and differences in values, but neither has helped (or I am not using them correctly). I also looked at other answers here, but I couldn't find anything that worked for me. Question: Are there any other tests or calculations that I can do to determine the direction of the data? Would the moving average give any information? This might be a relatively trivial question, but I would appreciate some help or pointers to the right resources.
