How to ignore Parent's event handler in order to use Child event handler (for DragEvent) in WPF

I am having a problem in using the DragEventHandler . The scenario is that: A parent element which has its own DragEventHandler s (in this case Grid) contains child element (Panel) which also has its own DragEventHandler s. So when an item is dragged over the child element, the event handlers of the parent elt is used instead of the child. I 've child to use child.PreviewDragEnter .. instead of DragEnter but it does not work. Strange enough, for MouseEvent like mouseEnter or mouseLeave handlers of both Parent and child work. Can anyone help me with that. How can the drageventhandler of the Child elt be used instead. Thank you very much.
