This is because jQuery's clone() method does not clone the id. To do so would break valid DOM/HTML rules. You need to set the id yourself, eg: var dropElem = ui.draggable.html(); var clone = $(dropElem).clone(); var widgetType = 'ClonedElementX'; //whatever you want the id to be clone.attr('id',widgetType); $(this).append(clone); Of note is that by default the id will not be sent to the server with a GET or POST (AJAX or standard request). If it is an "input" type element, you will need to also set the "name" attribute as well. If have custom code which sends ids in the AJAX request you can ignore this.
