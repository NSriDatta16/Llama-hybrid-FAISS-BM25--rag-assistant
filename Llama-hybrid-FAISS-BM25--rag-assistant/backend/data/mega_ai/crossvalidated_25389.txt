Obtaining predicted values (Y=1 or 0) from a logistic regression model fit

Let's say that I have an object of class glm (corresponding to a logistic regression model) and I'd like to turn the predicted probabilities given by predict.glm using the argument type="response" into binary responses, i.e. $Y=1$ or $Y=0$. What's the quickest & most canonical way to do this in R? While, again, I'm aware of predict.glm , I don't know where exactly the cutoff value $P(Y_i=1|\hat X_{i})$ lives -- and I guess this is my main stumbling block here.
