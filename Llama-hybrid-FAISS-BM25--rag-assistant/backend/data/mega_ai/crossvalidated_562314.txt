Is it possible to explain how the SVM algorithm works with those two approaches in the case of one label in range [1,5] Your target variable (the 'label') $y$ can have 5 realizations: 1,2,3,4,5. Classifying observations into these 5 categories is considered a multiclass problem, yes. The two approaches that you mentioned, one-vs-one and one-vs-rest, aim to make a binary classifier applicable to non-binary classification problems. Note that these approaches are not limited to SVM. So what do these approaches do? One-vs-one In your case, $|y| \cdot \frac{|y| - 1}{2}=10$ models are trained, where |y| is 5 in your case. Each model discriminates between different realizations of $y$ : 1 or 2 1 or 3 1 or 4 1 or 5 2 or 3 ... 4 or 5 One-vs-rest A coarser approach that fits 5 models that perform a 'this or other' discrimination: 1 or not 1 2 or not 2 3 or not 3 4 or not 4 5 or not 5 It is noticable, that the number of models that need to be fitted is growing quite quickly for the one-vs-one approach, while one-vs-rest always requires |y| models. What If I have five labels (ranking [1,5]) and each one has a binary output (0 or 1)? I'm a bit confused about it. Say instead of the vector $y$ that we had above, you have a matrix $Y$ with one column per possible class realization. The values in each column are binary, 0 or 1. Assuming that the row sums are 1 for every row, meaning that an observation is only assigned to one class, then we basically end up with the same method as with one-vs-rest. For each column in $Y$ , one can fit a model that distinguishes between the respective class and 'other'.
