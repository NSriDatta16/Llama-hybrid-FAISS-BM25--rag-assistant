Building of escalators and elevators takes a great deal of time and money. They also require maintenance. But people using them have the convenience quickly getting to the floor they need. They're still walking too. As you see from this analogy, Test Automation clearly is not the same as Automated Testing. But once it's implemented, testers may use it to get test results automatically. That saves time and helps to extend the coverage. You also don't really need elevators in small house with 2-3 storeys. For 5-7 storey building it becomes valuable. For 10 and up storey building it is necessary, and the more floors you have, the more elevators and escalators will be required. Replace storeys with functionality modules to get back to Test Automation needs. Thanks.
