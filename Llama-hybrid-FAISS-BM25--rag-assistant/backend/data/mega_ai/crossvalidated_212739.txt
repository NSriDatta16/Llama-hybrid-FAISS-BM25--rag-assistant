How to utilize the features available in the train data but not in the test data to train the algorithm?

I have recently worked on some kaggle competitions and found some of them provided some features only for the training data but not for the test. For example this Expedia one does not have session info for test data but for training data. I can't train the model directly with these features that the test data don't have. I am wondering what is the best way to leverage these features to improve the model performance? Is there a specific algorithm to deal with these problems?
