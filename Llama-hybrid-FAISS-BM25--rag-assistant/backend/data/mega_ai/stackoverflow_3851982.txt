It's an MSVC-specific pragma that means the named library will be automatically included at link time. The rest of your question about "just including the library" suggests that you're not appreciating the difference between headers and libraries: the header ( GL/glut.h ) describes what functions the compiler can expect at link time. The library ( lib/glut32.lib ) provides the implementation of these functions. As the other answers have explained, it can be convenient, but I personally consider it a terrible idea to use this because it adds another barrier to writing portable code (other platforms and compilers may not support it). This question (thanks, @martin clayton) explains why it's not a good idea for portable code.
