Where can I find a collection of proven deep learning architectures?

I am trying to get some intuition on how to architect neural networks to solve various problems. I am hoping to study known, proven architectures. For example, I know that for image classification, a good example is the VGG-16 network. Where can I find a large collection of network architectures that span a diverse range of problems?
