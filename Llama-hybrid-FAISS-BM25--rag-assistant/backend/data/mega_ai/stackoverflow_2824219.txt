How can I display a manual efficiently in Sharepoint

My organisiation uses Sharepoint for its 'intranet'. I have been given the task of creating a site for my department. One of the things I need on there is a procedure guide, which is basically a 150 page document, whereby each page is a separate procedure. Is there an efficient way within sharepoint that these procedures can be stored and searchable somehow, rather than dumping a 150 page document on there?
