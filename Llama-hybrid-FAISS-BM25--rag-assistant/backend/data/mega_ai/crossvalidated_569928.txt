Bayes: How to use results from a single study to shape data-driven priors

One way to construct informative priors for a subsequent Bayesian analysis is to carry out a meta-analysis of previous studies. Here, substantial research has been done. However, what to do when there is only one previous study that used a frequentist approach? Could we use estimates, and their standard errors, as parameters for a subsequent prior? For example, I want to use Bayes to perform multilevel confirmatory factor analysis (MCFA). I carried out a previous study that used some of the scales I now want to use at the second level in the subsequent MCFA. Could I then use the standardized factor loadings, and their standard errors, from the first study to determine priors for factor loadings in the second study? In this case, the priors would be based on a normal distribution.
