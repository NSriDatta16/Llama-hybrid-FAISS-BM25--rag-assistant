I was going to post this as a comment to an earlier post, but since you've not accepted any answers yet maybe it'll be the one you're looking for. Your original post had one question: "is it particularly easy?" The answer to that is an emphatic no , as evidenced by the answers you're getting. If the other suggestions (native exports/COM/etc) are "way over your head" (your words!), and you're not going to be able to dive in and learn, my suggestion would be that you need to reconsider your proposed architecture. Why not write the shared functions in a C++ library, which can then more easily be used by your existing C++ application? As a general rule it's a lot easier to consume native components from managed code than vice versa - so writing your C# app to consume the shared C++ DLL would be a much easier job. I realise this doesn't answer the original technical question, but perhaps it's a more pragmatic answer to the problem you're facing.
