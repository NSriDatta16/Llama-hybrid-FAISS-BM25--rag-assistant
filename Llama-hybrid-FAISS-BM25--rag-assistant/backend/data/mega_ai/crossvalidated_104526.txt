Mediation analysis when mediator is categorical (SPSS)

I want to do a mediation analysis, with the following variables: X: Independent variable: Categorical (2 levels) M: Mediator: Categorical (5 levels) Y: Dependent variable: Continuous my model: Following MacKinnon, Lockwood, Hoffman, West, & Sheets (2002), I need to perform 2 analysis: Regression analysis with X as independent and Y as dependent variable. Regression analysis with X and Y as independent variables and M as dependent variable. A full mediation would mean: The Regression weight X -> Y in the first analysis is significant The Regression weight Y -> M in the second analysis is significant The Regression weight X -> M in the second analysis is not significant I have 3 questions: Is the above a (so not the) right thing to perform mediation analysis? Is my second analysis a multinomial logistic regression? Is my first analysis a GLM univariate? For my analysis, I can only use SPSS 19 (without SEM).
