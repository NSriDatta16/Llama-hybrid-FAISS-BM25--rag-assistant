How to handle previous interventions within the pre-period of the same time series using causalimpact?

Below you can view the univariate sales dataset for a particular product with x3 promotional interventions/campaigns (highlighted in grey and green); each promotion campaign stretched for a length of 14 days. My main objective is to eventually measure the post-period uplift of all 3 campaigns separately, but to keep complexity at a minimum, I figured it might be better to focus this question on only analysing 1 campaign correctly and then just apply the logic to the other two campaigns afterwards. The promotion campaign I want to analyse with the causalimpact -library, is highlighted in green (campaign #2). Questions: How long should the pre-period and post-period be to analyze promo campaign #2 in the best possible way? More specifically, which of the 4 options is the best to use (if at all)? Note that: Option 1 considers shorter time-frames, but excludes possible adverse effects due to previous campaigns being run. If I do consider to use longer pre-period ranges (Option 3 & 4), should I include the data as is or should I recreate a baseline by handling the outliers and promo spikes the same way as for example the FB Prophet library before building a forecasting model, by either: Drop the data for the outlier & promo campaign 1, and create a new baseline for the pre-period? Set the data for the outlier & promo campaign 1 to zero , and create a new baseline for the pre-period? Set the data for the outlier & promo campaign 1 to none , and create a new baseline for the pre-period? Use another approach, one which I have not considered above? Thanks in advance!
