I wanna add that according to what I have read from many posts : There are many different architecture through DNN like : MLPs (Multi-Layer Perceptron) and CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks).So different type of DNN designed to solve different types of problems. MLPs is classical type of NN which is used for : Tabular Data-sets (contain data in a columnar format as in a database table ). Classification / Regression , prediction pbs. MLPs are very and can be used generally to lean mapping from in put to outputs. But you can try for other format like image data as base line point of comparison to confirm that other models are more suitable. CNNs designed to map image data to an output variable. it's used for : Image data, classification/Regression prediction pbs, It work well with data that has Spacial relationships . It's traditionally used for 2D data but it can be used for 1D data, CNNs achieves the state of the art on some 1D pbs. You have first to "define clearly" what you aim to solve as problem (what kind of data to work with, classification/regression problem ...etc) to know which type of architecture to use. You can refer to those links that have been so useful to me to understand more about those concepts :). MLPS . CNNs. When to Use MLP, CNN, and RNN Neural Networks. Hope this add will be useful :p.
