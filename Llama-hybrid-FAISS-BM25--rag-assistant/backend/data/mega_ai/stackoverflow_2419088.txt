Is gzip compression not sufficient for your needs? It gives you about 10:1 compression ratio, not only with HTML contents but also with JavaScript, CSS etc. files, and is readily available on most servers or reverse proxies (e.g. Apache's mod_deflate , Nginx's NginxHttpGzipModule etc.) and all modern browsers (you can instruct both Apache and Nginx to skip compression for specific browsers based on User-Agent .) You'll be surprised how close gzip compression comes to optimal. Some people have suggested minifying your files ; however, unless your files contain lots of comments (which the minifier can discard completely, i.e. what you probably referred to as "lossy" -- but something you probably don't want to do with HTML anyway, not unless you're sure that none of your or tags are inside HTML comments to accommodate antediluvian browsers), remember that minifying achieves most of its gains from a technique similar to (yet more limited than) DEFLATE -- so expect a minified file to be larger or much larger than a gzip ped original (particularly true with HTML, in which you are stuck with W3C's tags and attributes, and only gzip can help you there), and that gzip ping a minified file will give you minimal gain over gzip ing the original file (again, unless the original file contained lots of comments which can be safely discarded by a minifier.)
