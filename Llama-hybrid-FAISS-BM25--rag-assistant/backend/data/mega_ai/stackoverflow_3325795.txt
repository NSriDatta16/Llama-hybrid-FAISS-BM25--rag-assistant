Let's compare a few different options: Google App Engine : $0.10 per CPU hour $0.12 per gigabyte outgoing bandwidth Google Storage for Developers : $0.01 per 10,000 GET requests $0.15 per gigabyte downloaded for Americas and EMEA Amazon S3 : $0.01 per 10,000 GET requests $0.15 per gigabyte up to 10 TB / month data transfer out Say you're serving 10 million images at 50KB each. On App Engine, with a dynamic handler using 20ms per request, this is going to cost you $57.22 in outgoing bandwidth plus $5.55 in CPU time. On Google Storage or S3, you'll pay $71.52 for the outgoing bandwidth plus $10 for the GETs. So basically if your handler uses less than 36ms CPU time, it's cheaper on App Engine than on services designed for this exact purpose. Somebody double-check my math, please. =)
