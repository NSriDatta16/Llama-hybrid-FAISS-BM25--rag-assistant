Unfortunately, all of these heuristics are quite fragile. In particular, they are usually quite sensitive to data preprocessing, such as normalization. You may want to try different normalizations, and see if you get similar results, or not... Also make sure to use visualization - if the clusters don't make sense in the visualization, then the D index probably did not work.
