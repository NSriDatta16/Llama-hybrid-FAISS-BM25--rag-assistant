I'm confused; you can get an item out of an ArrayList by index simply by: Cust_Info cust = (CustInfo)theList[index]; However, ArrayList is pretty rare in anything >= .NET 2.0, a List would make this much easier. Also, Cust_Info looks to me very much like it should be a class (it is very rare to write a struct in .NET, and usually to denote "values" - a customer isn't a "value"). And public fields are also very much discouraged. Note that currently you are (because it is a struct ) actually copying the Cust_Info whenever you fetch it from (or place it in) the list; that isn't necessarily what you intend...
