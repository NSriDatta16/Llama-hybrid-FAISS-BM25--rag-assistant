Thanks for the responses, the links to the other blog questions were helpful as well, I had read all of Grant Skinner's info on garbage collection too, but searching through those links and going back and re-reading what he had originally said about GC helped refresh the old noggin. In addition to nulling and re-instantiating that single FLVPlayback component, I also realized that I wasn't correctly unloading and destroying my Loader instances either, so I got them cleaned up and now the program is running much more efficiently. I would say the memory usage has improved by around 90% for the site. @aib I will admit the single instance solution isn't elegant, but because flash just won't let go of those FLV files, I'm kind of stuck with it. @grapefrukt I detest the flash components, they typically cause more grief than time saved, however in this case I had a lot of cue points and navigation stuff going on with the video files and the FLVPlayback component was the best solution I found. Of course I'm still fairly new to the ActionScript world so perhaps I over-looked something.
