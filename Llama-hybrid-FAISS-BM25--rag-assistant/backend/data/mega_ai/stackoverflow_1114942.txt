I think you're organizing it incorrectly. Don't organize by what enum/extension, etc. Organize by how the type is used. Put related types together. Also, the guidelines you referenced are from the days of .NET 1.1! The clue is the V7.1 in the URL. The correct reference is Names of Namespaces , which is part of Design Guidelines for Developing Class Libraries .
