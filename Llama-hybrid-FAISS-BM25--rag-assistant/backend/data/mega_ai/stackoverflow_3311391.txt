IMHO, I think a web application is better off being developed using MVC2. Silverlight has and is coming a long way, but to my knowledge, is largely still client-side (please correct me if wrong anyone). As such, I think MVC2 is a better platform because you're leveraging your web server to process all the work and not bogging down processes client-side. I liken this to why we do certain things server-side vs. in JQuery/Javascript. It's mostly because the server has the speed, capacity and ability to process the user experience in the best way possible. MVC2 has come a long way since MVC1. I would definitely support use of MVC2 in any new ASP.NET web applications over webforms. There are trade-offs, especially if you cut your teeth on Webforms like I did :) Overall, best bet for the future is MVC2 as we're still seeing a lot of advances in Silverlight, and not sure it's finished growing.
