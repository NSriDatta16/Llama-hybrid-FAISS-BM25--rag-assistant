How is vector A converted to single value scalar in Andrew Ng's course?

In Andrew Ng's deep learning course on Coursera, how is a single scalar value obtained from a flattened image (feature vector)? First there is $w.T$ of shape $(1, n_X)$ which is multiplied by $X$ of shape $(n_X, 400)$ , so by the laws of linear algebra, the remaining vector is of shape $(1, 400)$ . This is then passed through Sigmoid to form vector A, and the shape remains at $(1, 400)$ . How is this vector then converted to a binary scalar value ( $0$ or $1$ ) for prediction $y$ -hat?
