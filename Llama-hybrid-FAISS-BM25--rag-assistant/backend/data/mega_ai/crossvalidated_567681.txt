Why are prior distributions sometimes conditional probabilities?

I came across the following Bayesian equation in textbook of evolutionary biology: $f(t, r, \theta|X) \propto f(X|t, r, \theta)f(t|\theta)f(r|t,\theta)f(\theta)$ $f(X|t, r, \theta)$ is the likelihood and $f(t|\theta)$ is the prior distribution on times $t$ $f(r|t,\theta)$ is the prior distribution on rates $r$ , and $f(\theta)$ is the prior of the substitution model. I'm having trouble understanding what it means for a prior distribution to be conditioned on other values, as we have in $f(t|\theta)$ and $f(r|t,\theta)$ . Does this mean that our prior beliefs about $t$ depend on $\theta$ and those about $r$ depend on both $t$ and $theta$ ? I.e., that without knowing $t$ and $theta$ , we have no prior beliefs about $r$ ? Does the specification of the priors in this way make this an example of a hierarchical model? If so, what exactly is the hierarchy? If anyone can recommend any literature that might help me understand this, I'd be grateful for it.
