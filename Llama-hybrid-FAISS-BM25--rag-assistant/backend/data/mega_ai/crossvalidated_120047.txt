Nonlinear vs. generalized linear model: How do you refer to logistic, Poisson, etc. regression?

I have a question about semantics that I would like fellow statisticians' opinions on. We know models such as logistic, Poisson, etc. fall under the umbrella of generalized linear models. The model includes nonlinear functions of the parameters, which may in turn be modeled using the linear model framework by using the appropriate link function. I'm wondering if you consider (teach?) situations such as logistic regression as a: Nonlinear model, given the form of the parameters Linear model, since the link transforms us to the linear model framework Simultaneously (1) and (2): It "starts" as a nonlinear model, but may be worked with in such a way that allows us to think of it as a linear model Wish I could set-up an actual poll...
