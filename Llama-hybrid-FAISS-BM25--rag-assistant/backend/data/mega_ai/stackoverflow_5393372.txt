From the ease-of-development point, I think the Vaadin is one of the best. The new Liferay IDE 1.2 already includes the Vaadin support making it very easy to start with it. The same goes for application maintenance and APIs. With Vaadin the application code is simply Java code and that makes it easy to divide the work, and maintain the existing code (OOP benefits). Already a good number of "add-ons" for Vaadin that demonstrate how the Java code can be "componentized" and development split across the organization(s). Only downside comes from the fact that the Vaadin libraries are shared with all the Vaadin- portlets in a portal, which means they should use the same Vaadin version to keep the deployment easier. Anyway, I'd say quite good match for your needs.
