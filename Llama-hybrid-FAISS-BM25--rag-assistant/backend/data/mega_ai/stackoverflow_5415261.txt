What is javax.inject.Named annotation supposed to be used for?

I am trying to understand the javax.inject package and I am not clear what the javax.inject.Named annotation is supposed to be used for. The Javadoc does not explain the the idea behind it. Javadoc is at http://download.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/inject/Named.html I am using Spring 3.0 to write some sample programs, by putting @Named on a bean it seems to add it to the bean factory but the Javadoc description is so light I can't tell if that is the standard behavior or Spring specific behavior. My questions are: What is the difference between @Named and @Qualifier How are you supposed to tell the Runtime system a class should be injectable in other classes what's the annotation for that? The equivalent of @Component in Spring? Update 1 there is an excellent explanation of @Named and @Qualifier at Nice article about @Named and @Qualifier https://dzone.com/articles/java-ee6-cdi-named-components thanks @xmedeko for linking to it the comment below.
