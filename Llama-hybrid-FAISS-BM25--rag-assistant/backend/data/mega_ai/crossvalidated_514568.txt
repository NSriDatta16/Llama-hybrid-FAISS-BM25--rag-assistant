For sure is too late, but you should work with linear mixed models instead of ancova or Lm. Your proposals include obtaining a new variable in both cases to consider it as a DV. With linear mixed models you dont need to do this ( and you can also include trial by trial data) As a general example: ID Condition value Age 1 neutral 6 35 1 negative 3.5 35 2 neutral 7 21 2 negative 2.3 21 .. . ... Here, "value" is the average value of whatever you are using in each condition. In short, if you have this data structure you can easily analise it this way: lmer(value ~ condition + age + (1|ID)) With this model you can test all that you said!
