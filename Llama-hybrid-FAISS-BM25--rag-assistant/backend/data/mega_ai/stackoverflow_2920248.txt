How can I convert one slide of a PowerPoint file to flash in jsf app (using javaSE/javaEE)?

I need to show the first slide of a PowerPoint presentation in my jsf app. It must look something like that: user upload the .ppt file to jsf app the app take the first slide and converts it to Flash user sees the converted slide in the separate (not as part of the another page) I suppose that I couldn't use any external converters because the user of the system will not have them when he uses our system. Also I'm thinkinig about Flash, not HTML, because the presentation can be dynamic. Any ideas? Can I do this task or it's impossible and I need to think in another way (maybe restriction for end users - to save presentation as png, but I think that my boss won't like this decision). Maybe I need to look at .xslt format, maybe it would help?
