Should all the items be entered in a PCA at the same time?

Assume that a few items will load together on one component if only these 3-4 items were entered in a separate PCA. However, if these 3-4 items are entered in the main PCA (where like 15-20 are being grouped together), these 3-4 which clearly represent a different construct will cross-load on the components of the main intended construct (the one with 15-20 items). In that case, can one ran separate PCAs for separate constructs? Will the components score remain valid if entered as a dependent variable later on?
