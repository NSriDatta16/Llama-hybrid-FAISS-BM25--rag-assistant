For dates in Microsoft Chart Controls you have to explicitly specify the minimum dates to start with. Otherwise it takes 29th december 1899 as origin. You can set minimum and max dates on chart like chart.ChartAreas[0].AxisY.Minimum = (new DateTime(2010, 5, 1)).ToOADate(); chart.ChartAreas[0].AxisY.Maximum = (new DateTime(2011, 4, 1)).ToOADate(); The post Creating a Gantt Chart with the MS Chart Controls has some valuable information on Microsoft Chart Controls.
