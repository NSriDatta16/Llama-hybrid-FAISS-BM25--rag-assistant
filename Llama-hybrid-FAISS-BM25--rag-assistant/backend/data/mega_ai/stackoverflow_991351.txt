re.search() breaks for key in form.keys() loop

Perhaps I am just crazy or missing something really basic. Why would this happen? If I use this url index.cgi?mode=pos&pos_mode=checkout&0_name=Shampoo&0_type=Product&0_price=4.50&0_qty=1&0_total=4.50 which runs this code form = cgi.FieldStorage() for key in form.keys() print key if re.search("name", key): print "Found name." The result prints mode If I remove the re.search() it prints all the keys. Why? I searched stackoverflow and google before I posted but I didn't come up with anything. Thanks in advance.
