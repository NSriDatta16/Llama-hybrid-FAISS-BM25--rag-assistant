accessing a set inside a set in raphael js

I'm in the process of creating a little 'infographic' using raphael js. The infographic will render a number of circles with some text inside. The number of circles isn't know and will depend on the data it gets fed. I thought that I would organise the raphael objects into sets, one for each circle and then move those sets into one 'container' set but I am having trouble accessing them programatically using something like: console.log(ss[0].circle); Here is a snippet of the code im using to draw my circles/add them to a set: var r = Raphael('raph', '500px', '500px'); var coord = { '0': {x: 177, y: 75}, '1': {x: 420, y: 173}, '2': {x: 177, y: 415} }; var ss = r.set(); for(var i=0; i Can someone point me in the right direction?
