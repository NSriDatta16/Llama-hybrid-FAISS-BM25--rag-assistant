Testing Django model choices in templates

Say I have a model like: from django.db import models USER_TYPE_CHOICES = ( (1, 'Free'), (2, 'Paid'), ) class Account(models.Model): name = models.CharField(max_length=20) user_type = models.IntegerField(default=1, choices=TYPE_CHOICES) and in a template I want to test the user_type to show a special section if the user is of type 'Paid'. I'd like to do something similar to a C #define or constant to test user_type. So my template code would look like: {% ifequal user_type PAID_ACCOUNT %} instead of using a magic number like: {% ifequal user_type 2 %} What is the most elegant way to do this in Django? Should I just define a custom context processor with FREE_ACCOUNT and PAID_ACCOUNT in it? Perhaps a template tag? Thank you!
