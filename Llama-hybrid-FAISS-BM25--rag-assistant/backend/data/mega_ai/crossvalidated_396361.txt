I think there are two really critical questions to answer here. First is what are you really trying to measure? The second is once you've determined that, what are principled and feasible ways to compare your measurements from the two communities? I will try to address both a bit below. Simpson’s Index as defined by Simpson in 1949 is a probability that as you state, ranges between 0 and 1. Specifically, it is an estimate of the probability that in the entire community you sampled, two randomly drawn individuals would have the same identity. Of the many important things to note, one is that therefore higher values imply a lower diversity. A second is that there are a few ways to compute Simpson based on your data. Sum over all species(relative abundance of species ^2) is that probability of two randomly drawn individuals being the same species in the population, but likely you are interested in estimating that from a subsample of that population. Simpson provided a finite-community-size unbiased estimator (Simpson 1949), and an accompanying variance estimator. To the best of my knowledge, these are valid. So one principled answer to your question is to use Simpson’s estimator of Simpson’s index with Simpson’s variance estimator, and then to determine the chance that those two values are “drawn from the same distribution” based on e.g. the overlap in the CIs from those variance estimators with your favorite statistical test. As C.R. Peterson alluded to, there are many reasons why you might not actually want to use Simpson’s index if you are interested in comparing diversity. Lou Jost’s website, which Peterson linked to, has an excellent description of some of the issues with the raw Simpson index and an argument for using Hill numbers, which instead compute the average species rarity of each community… the Simpson analog is the harmonic mean rarity, where each species rarity (1/relative abundance) is weighted by its relative abundance. In this case, you might use Chao and Jost’s bootstrapped confidence intervals https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.12349 , which you can implement yourself, or use iNEXT (available as web tool online or as an R package) http://chao.stat.nthu.edu.tw/wordpress/software_download/inext-online/ . One thing that is blowing my mind and brought me to your post is that whereas Simpson’s finite size estimate is both unbiased and well constrained/accurate at very low sample sizes, the sampling variance around the Hill number version (the reciprocal of Simpson’s index, sometimes called “Simpson’s Diversity” by Jost and colleagues) can remain really large even for giant sample sizes. Additionally, to the best of my knowledge, although Chao and Jost’s estimator is quite good, there is no known unbiased estimator on the diversity/effective numbers/ Hill scale for Simpson’s diversity. So there is definitely some tradeoff in what you can say about your estimates in terms of interpretation vs. what you can say in terms of estimation. I would love to be more precise in this regard but still have some learning to do.
