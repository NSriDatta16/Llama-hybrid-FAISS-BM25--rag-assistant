How do I get xcode to find the Core Plot header? (iPhone)

I can't seem to make Xcode find the Core Plot header. I've done the following: Clone the hg repo; Drag the CorePlot-CocoaTouch.xcodeproj file into my project; Opened the CP project and compiled it successfully; Dragged the lib file into the target's static link list; Added CorePlot-CocoaTouch as a direct dependency for the target. But I'm still getting the "CorePlot-CocoaTouch.h: No such file or directory" error on compile. I've been googling around trying to find an answer, but only seem to find a few people having the same problem but no clear solution. What have I missed?
