using z scores to compare and average player values from different fantasy hockey analyses?

I'm VERY bad at math - but am trying to find the right statistical technique to use to build a cheat sheet for my fantasy hockey draft. Here's my proposed approach - but I'm hoping for feedback to make sure this is legitimate: 1)I have purchased player value projections for the 2018/2019 season from two different sources, both of which use a "secret sauce" to generate a player "value score" based on the specific settings of my league. 2) However, each source uses a totally different scale for their scores. Since I assume each source has it's own strengths and weaknesses, I want to try to average the two value scores for any given player. 3) I've started by using the Standardize function in excel to generate a z-score value for each player, from each source. 4)Can I now simply average the two z-scores for each player to get an "average value score" for the player, given my two sources? Or am I approaching this the wrong way? Again, sorry for my innumeracy - hoping the great minds here can help me figure this out. Thanks all,
