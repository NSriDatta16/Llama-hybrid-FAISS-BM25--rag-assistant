Do not train a neural network to start with! All the answers are great, but there is one point which ought to be mentioned : is there anything to learn from your data ? (which could be considered as some kind of testing). If the label you are trying to predict is independent from your features, then it is likely that the training loss will have a hard time reducing. Instead, start calibrating a linear regression, a random forest (or any method you like whose number of hyperparameters is low, and whose behavior you can understand). Then, if you achieve a decent performance on these models (better than random guessing), you can start tuning a neural network (and @Sycorax 's answer will solve most issues).
