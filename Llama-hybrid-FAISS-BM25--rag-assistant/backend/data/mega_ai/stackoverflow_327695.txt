there is the custom .ajax "before" and "success" events which you can trigger. Normally however, you would just do something like showLoadingAnimation(); $.getJSON( ..... function(){ dontShowLoadingAnimation(); }); or something similar. Your question is however somewhat vauge, and its hard to ascertain what it is you want to do that you wouldn't already be able to do simply with javascript.
