commission junction and other affiliate network do they have sandbox? how to test drive? i am using popshops

i am developing an affiliate site. it uses linkshare and commission junction. it is for our client. so i do not have any account with any network or agent. either with popshops or the networks. the client has registered with popshops to display merchants. when users click links we need to know which user had purchased which product by sending some information to affiliate networks using the sid option. every thing fine except a sandbox. how do we do a test drive with link share and commission junction? else we have to wait till an user purchases a product. any suggestion and comments would be helpful.
