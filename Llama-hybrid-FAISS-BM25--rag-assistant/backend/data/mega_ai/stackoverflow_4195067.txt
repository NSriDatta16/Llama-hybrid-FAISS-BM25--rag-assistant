According to the current leap-year regulations the average number of days per year will be 365 + 1/4 − 1/100 + 1/400 = 365.2425 days per year This means that we, in average, have 31556952000 milliseconds per year. The long-value represents the number of milliseconds since the Epoch (1st of January, 1970) and the maximum number represented by a Java long is 2 63 − 1, so the following calculation 1970 + (2 63 − 1) / 31556952000 reveals that this representation will overflow year 292278994. This can, as Jon Skeet points out , be confirmed by -> System.out.println(new Date(Long.MAX_VALUE)); Sun Aug 17 08:12:55 CET 292278994
