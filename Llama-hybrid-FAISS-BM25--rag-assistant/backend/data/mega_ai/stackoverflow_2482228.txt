You're not naming your namespaces correctly! You should do something like this instead: ;;; in file src/apprunner/core.clj ;;; (namespace names should contain at least one dot for things ;;; not to go into the default package... or some such thing) (ns apprunner.core (:use apprunner.functions) ;;; the rest of your code for this file follows unchanged ;;; in file src/apprunner/functions.clj (ns apprunner.functions (:use clojure.contrib.duck-streams)) ;;; the rest of your code for this file follows unchanged Running the above at the REPL ( (use 'apprunner.core) etc.) works fine for me. To summarise what was the problem here: Namespace names should contain dots where paths to files definining them contain slashes / backslashes (not that I mean relative paths -- relative to some directory which is actually on the classpath). Also, the src/ directory is the one you put in your classpath, so you don't include a src. part in your namespace names. See e.g. the src/foo/bar/baz.clj vs. foo.bar.baz example in my answer to your earlier question . Oh, and by the way, figuring out the classpath is difficult, period. So, be sure not to let yourself be discouraged by issues of this sort! :-) You might want to include info on how you run your code if you've got more namespace or classpath-related questions or if the above doesn't solve the problem for you, though.
