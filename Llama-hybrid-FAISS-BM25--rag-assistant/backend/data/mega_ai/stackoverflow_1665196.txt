I've used some applications that offered the following customizations: Web pages were configurable - we could drag fields out of view, position them where we wanted with our own name for the field label. Add our own views or stored procedures and use them in: data grids (along with an update proc) and reports. Each client would need their own database. Custom mapping of Excel files to import data into system. Add our own calculated fields. Ability to run custom scripts on forms during various events. Identify our own custom fields. If you clients are larger companies, you're almost going to need your own SDK, API's, etc.
