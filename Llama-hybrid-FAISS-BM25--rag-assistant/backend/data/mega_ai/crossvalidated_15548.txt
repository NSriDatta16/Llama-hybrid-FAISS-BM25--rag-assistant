Validation of clustering results

I have a data which contains several columns which I later reduced using a PCA algorithms to two different components. I then applied the k-means algorithms to the data. Now, how can I verify that my data clustered well into each group? Or how do I determine misclassification rate? For instance, using R, if I check the cluster vector say k$cluster against the labels of the data I had previously before clustering can I just draw a confusion matrix from that and assume that 1 in the clustered vector is equivalent to 1 in my labels? col3 col2 Col1 lables 123 2.32 2.50 0 124 2.81 3.10 1 125 2.72 3.09 2 126 2.92 3.03 3 127 2.32 2.95 4 Please note this is a hypothetical data; my data is way bigger than this.
