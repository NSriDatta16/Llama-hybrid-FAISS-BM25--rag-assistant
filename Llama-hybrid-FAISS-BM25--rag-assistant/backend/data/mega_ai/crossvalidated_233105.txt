Is there a software that can draw a Bayesian model from JAGS?

I have a Bayesian model and I want to draw it like in the book Doing Bayesian Data Analysis page 225. I wonder if there is a software that exists that can do that. I've done this by hand but I'm not sure about the structure. That's why I want to compare with a program.
