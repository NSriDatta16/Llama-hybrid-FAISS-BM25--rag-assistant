There are multiple dimensions to this. For once the * will make your code more fragile. When in later versions you change table layouts code that relies on column order might break - or might not but read or modify the wrong columns if the data types still match which can be a really nasty problem! Moreover if you always request all columns you will require more memory on your database client and the database server for the unneeded columns. This can be really expensive if the table contains long character fields, very many fields and/or BLOBs. Selecting unnecessary columns will also thrash the server's cache by flooding it with superflous contents that is never looked at by a client. So in general you should not use it. Most object relational mapping tools generate SQL that contains all column names anyway, so during development this is probably not an issue anyway. I personally only tend to use * for quick ad-hoc queries that I have to type manually.
