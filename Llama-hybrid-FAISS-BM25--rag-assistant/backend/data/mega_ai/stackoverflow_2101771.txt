Chiming in on this: I agree with most in here that this is fragile, but useful. I'd like to point you to the System.Transaction.TransactionScope class, that does something like you want to do. Generally I like the syntax, it removes a lot of clutter from the real meat. Please consider giving the helper class a good name though - maybe ...Scope, like the example above. The name should give away that it encapsulates a piece of code. *Scope, *Block or something similar should do it.
