I'd put the types of analysis requested as parameters, rather than as part of the path. They could be POST parameters in the body of the request, or specified in the URL list profileId. Example: POST http://server/analysisrequest?profileId=33&analysisType=faceRecognition&analysisType=textDetection . It's perfectly ok to submit multiple values for a parameter. You could submit the binary encoding of the analysis type, but spelling it out is a lot more clear and self-documenting. The binary encoding is a bit fragile when adding a new analysis type as well; adding a new digit would affect the urls all requests, even those that don't use the new type. A server side database is typical for this kind of web application and it's probably a good solution. You might also want to consider an in-process SQL database solution like sqlite or derby to avoid the complexity of a separate database process.
