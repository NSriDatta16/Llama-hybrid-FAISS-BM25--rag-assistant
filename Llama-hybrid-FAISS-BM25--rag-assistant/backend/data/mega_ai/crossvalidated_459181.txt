Let me provide some perspectives from epidemiology. In epidemiology, we are generally interested in risks, which is roughly equivalent to probability $p$ . However, one important reason why we so often work with $\text{odds}=\frac{p}{1-p}$ is because of the case-control study design, in which we sample cases (diseased) and controls (non-diseased) independently and look at the proportion of the 2 samples being exposed to a risk factor. This is called a retrospective design in contrast to the prospective design where two samples with different risk factors are being compared for their risk for developing diseases. Now the neat thing about the odds ratio is that it is invariant to both design -- the retrospective and prospective odds ratio are the same. This means one doesn't need to know the prevalence of the disease to estimate the odds ratio, unlike the risk ratio, from a case-control study. More interestingly, this invariance of the odds ratio extends to logistic regression, such that we can analyse a retrospective study as if we were analysing a prospective study, under some assumptions ( ref ). This makes it a lot easier to analyse retrospective studies as we don't have to model the exposures $\boldsymbol{x}$ jointly. Finally, although the odds ratio is difficult to interpret, with a rare disease, it approximates the risk ratio. That's another reason why modeling the odds is so common in epidemiology.
