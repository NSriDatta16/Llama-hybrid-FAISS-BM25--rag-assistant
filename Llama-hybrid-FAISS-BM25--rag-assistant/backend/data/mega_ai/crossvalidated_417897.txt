Random forest has regularization, it's just not in the form of a penalty to the cost function. Random forest doesn't have a global cost function in the same sense of linear regression; it's just greedily maximizing information gain at each split. Limiting child node size, minimum information gain and so on all change how the trees are constructed and impose regularization on the model in the sense that a proposed split must be "large enough".
