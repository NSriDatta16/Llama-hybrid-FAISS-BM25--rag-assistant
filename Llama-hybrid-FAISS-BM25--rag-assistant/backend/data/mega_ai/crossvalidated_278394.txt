... let a machine find its own algorithms to solve Super Mario ... If you mean asking the computer to solve equation and find the most likely parameters given inputs, it's exactly what a ML is doing. In fact, when you do least-square linear regression your computer give you estimated parameter for your slope and intercept. There are many ML algorithms (e.g. reinforcement learning) that you can use to optimize a given model or framework. The parameters we are talking could be millions. It's certainly possible for a computer to optimize (improve etc) a statistical framework for other computers (or humans) to use. However, I don't think computer is smart enough to come up with it's own algorithms. I mean, a computer magically invent a new algorithm that humans don't know, and program it itself without human inputs.
