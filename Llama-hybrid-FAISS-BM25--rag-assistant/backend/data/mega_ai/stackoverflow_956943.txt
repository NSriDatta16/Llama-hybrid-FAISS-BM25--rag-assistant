The big question is: efficient for what? for oracle ideas might include: read access by id: index organized table (this might be what you are looking for) insert only, no update: no indexes, no spare space read access full table scan: compressed high concurrent write when id comes from a sequence: reverse index for the actual question, precisely as asked: write all rows in a single blob (the table contains one column, one row. You might be able to access this like an array, but I am not sure since I don't know what operations are possible on blobs. Even if it works I don't think this approach would be useful in any realistic scenario.
