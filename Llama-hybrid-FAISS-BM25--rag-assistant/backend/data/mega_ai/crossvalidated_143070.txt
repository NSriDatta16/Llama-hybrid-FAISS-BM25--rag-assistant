If evidence 1 states 15% and evidence 2 states 8%, the likelihood of the true population parameter being 9.5 is more likely, given no other information. However, if we take into account that each evidence has different statistical power, we could weigh the information differently. For example, consider if evidence 1 is based on a sample size of 1250. We would infer that the smaller sample is unlikely to reflect the actual population as accurate as the larger sample. However, we also need to consider to what extent the samples are representative of the population. Perhaps evidence 1 has a better coverage of factors that affect handedness that is considered to be a genetic trait. If evidence 1 provides the actual population parameter, having asked all American men, then we would say that the random sample is not representative. For evidence 3, 20%, the above applies again.
