Your SEARCH syntax is wrong, as the operators are prefix and not infix. The correct search string should be 'SINCE "08-Mar-2011" OR BODY "bobby" OR BODY "robert" BODY "bob"' . But if PHP simply doesn't support OR in imap_search -- and your link indicates that they don't, despite c-client support for it for almost 10 years -- then you'll have to do the conditional OR in your application. Run $box_bobby = imap_search($connection, 'SINCE "08-Mar-2011" BODY "bobby"'); $box_robert = imap_search($connection, 'SINCE "08-Mar-2011" BODY "robert"'); $box_bob = imap_search($connection, 'SINCE "08-Mar-2011" BODY "bob"'); and then merge the three result sets.
