In this particular case: Prelude> map (/2) [1..5] [0.5,1.0,1.5,2.0,2.5] Not only you can use an infix operator as ordinary prefix function, you can also partially apply it in infix form. Likewise, the first example would better be written as map (2/) [1..5] Also, there's flip which is not quite as elegant, but still the best option available for ordinary functions (when you don't want to turn them into infix via backticks): Prelude> let div' = (/) Prelude> div' 2 1 2.0 Prelude> flip div' 2 1 0.5
