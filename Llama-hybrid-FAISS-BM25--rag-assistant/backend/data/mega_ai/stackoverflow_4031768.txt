You shouldn't have to create 2 media elements. Just call .SetSource on mediaElement1 directly. I have similar code which sets the MediaElement source to a movie in isolated storage and that works fine: using (var isf = IsolatedStorageFile.GetUserStoreForApplication()) { using (var isfs = new IsolatedStorageFileStream("trailer.wmv", FileMode.Open, isf)) { this.movie.SetSource(isfs); } } With the above, movie is a MediaElement I've already created in XAML and set autoPlay to true. I did have a few issues with the above when first getting it working. I suggest trying the following to help debug: Ensure that the file has been written to isolated storage correctly and in it's entirety. Handle the MediaFailed event to find out why it isn't working.
