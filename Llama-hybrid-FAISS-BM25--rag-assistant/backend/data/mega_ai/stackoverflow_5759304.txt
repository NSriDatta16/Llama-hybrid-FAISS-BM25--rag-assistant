From the spec : The section element represents a generic document or application sectionâ€¦ The section element is not a generic container element. When an element is needed for styling purposes or as a convenience for scripting, authors are encouraged to use the div element instead. So, if the main intent of the original div s is to help with styling/scripting, you should keep using div s. If it genuinely a way to separate sections of the page, use section s.
