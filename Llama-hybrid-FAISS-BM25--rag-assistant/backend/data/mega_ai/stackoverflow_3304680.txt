You can use method_defined? as follows: String.method_defined? :upcase # => true Much easier, portable and efficient than the instance_methods.include? everyone else seems to be suggesting. Keep in mind that you won't know if a class responds dynamically to some calls with method_missing , for example by redefining respond_to? , or since Ruby 1.9.2 by defining respond_to_missing? .
