Is there a standard way for form layout in ASP.Net?

Here's my forms layout: Note that this form doesn't actually do anything except illustrate the Required Field Validator. Usuario: ' runat="server" /> Contrasena: ' runat="server" /> Hint: Try submitting it before you enter something. This is a simple layout for just learning purposes, but they align themselves badly. They just smooch together. Someone suggested I just prace the 'space' key to create the whitespace between them, but that doesn't align them at all. They can never be correctly aligned. Someone said use tables, but I loathe the idea of using tables for layout. How can I achieve a simple organizational style between these two fields?
