Clusterization a Dataset by Category of Another

I have limited knowledge about Machine Learning unfortunately and I want to clusterize a dataset with attributes of another. I have two different data sets which are users and books. Users have different books and books have different categories: User1 -> book1, book2, book3 User2 -> book1,book3 User3 -> book4, book1 book1 -> Business, Economy, Finance book2 -> Music, Creativity book3 -> Novel, Classics book4 -> Photography I want to get a kind of result such as "Finance lovers" or "Music lovers". What are the techniques/ways that I can apply? I searched the techniques but I all find that related to my issue was this . However this solution is only one part of my issue I believe.
