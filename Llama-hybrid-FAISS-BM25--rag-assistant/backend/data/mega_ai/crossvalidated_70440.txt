Running regularized logistic regressions on very large datasets

I want to run a regularized logistic regression on a dataset with 25 million observations and about a 1000 mostly non-sparse columns with non-ignorable weights. My first choice would be BayesGLM, but I'm sure that isn't remotely close to computationally feasible. I was looking into the LASSO/ElasticNet implementations in SciPi and it doesn't seem to have the ability to take weighted data. Does anybody have any recommendations?
