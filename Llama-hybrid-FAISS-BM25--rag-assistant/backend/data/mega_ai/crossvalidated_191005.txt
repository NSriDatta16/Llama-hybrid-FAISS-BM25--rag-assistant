On any given day, there are 10^9 people with a 1% chance of going to a hotel, so there are 10^7 people going to 10^5 hotels, for an average of 100 people per hotel. How many pair meetings are there on day 1? At each hotel, there are C(100,2) or 4950 meetings. Since there are 10^5 hotels, the total number of pair meetings is 10^5*4950 or 495,000,000, which we'll round off to 5*10^8 . How many pairs of people exist in total? That's C(10^9,2), which we'll round off to 5*10^17 . This means there's a (5*10^8)/(5*10^17) = 10^-9 chance that two randomly selected people will meet in a hotel. In other words, given two randomly selected people, there's a (1-10^-9) chance they won't meet in a hotel today. Reminder: (1-p)^q ~ 1 - pq for small values of p (binomial theorem) What are the chances they won't meet over 1000 days (as given in the problem). This is: (1-10^-9)^1000 ~ 1 - 1000*10^-9 = 1-10^-6 What are the chances they'll meet exactly once over 1000 days? That's 1000*(1-10^-9)^999*(10^-9) ~ 1000*(1 - 999*10^-9)*10^-9 ~ 1000*(1-10^-6)*10^-9 = 10^-6*(1-10^-6) = 10^-6 - 10^-12 Thus, the chance they'll meet 0 or exactly 1 times is the sum of those two probabilities or 1-10^-12 . Thus, the chance they'll meet two or more times is 10^-12 . So, the chance that any randomly selected couple will meet 2 or more times in the same hotel over a period of 1000 days is 10^-12 . Since there are 5*10^17 possible couples (as above), the expected number of couples that will randomly meet in the same hotel two or more times in 1000 days is 5*10^17*10^-12 = 5*10^5 or 500,000 couples. This is twice the answer the book gets. I believe the book is incorrect in stating: "The chance that they will visit the same hotel on two different given days is the square of this number, 10^-18" and that they undercount by a factor of 2, but it's possible there's an error in my own calculation. Hopefully, however, this clarifies the orders of magnitude involved.
