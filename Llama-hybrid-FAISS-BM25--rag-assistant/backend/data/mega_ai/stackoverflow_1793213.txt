Your code does not specify the content of objMasterDetailsPara. I assume it is defined elsewhere. One problem I see is that your header cells ( objCell0...5 ) are never actually added to the pdf document. If objMasterDetailsPara is supposed to contain this column header information, that would explain your problem. It would look like the second paragraph was overlapping the first, when in fact the last part of the first paragraph was never actually added to the pdf document.
