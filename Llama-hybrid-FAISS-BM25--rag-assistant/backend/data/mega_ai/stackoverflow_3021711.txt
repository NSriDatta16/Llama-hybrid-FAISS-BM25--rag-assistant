OWL: get Class from an existent Antology

How can I get an existing Class from an Ontology with the OWL-API? This is a fragment of my ontology: String Docu This class concerns a docu with the content specified as common text. I start with this code: String ontologyUri = "http://mysite.com/my_ontology.owl"; OWLOntologyManager manager = OWLManager.createOWLOntologyManager(); OWLOntology ontology = manager.createOntology(IRI.create(ontologyUri)); OWLDataFactory factory = manager.getOWLDataFactory(); and now I want to retrieve the StringDocu class. How can I get this?
