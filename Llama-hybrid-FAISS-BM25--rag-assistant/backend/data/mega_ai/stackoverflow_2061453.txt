it is near impossible for decompilers reconstruct your original syntax as they are working off the compiler's interpretation of your code. you write java code, which gets compiled to byte code by the java compiler. a decompiler then attempts to create java code from the byte code. since the two code fragments are logically the same, the decompiler has done it's job. EDIT (saw your comment): actually, it's quite possible (and this is pretty common) that the decompiler has made an error. the statement if(!condition2); essentially has no effect whatsoever (provided condition2 is indeed a boolean and not pseudo code). therefore your first //other stuff here would be processed regardless of condition2 in the decompiled version. are you sure the decompiled code works correctly?
