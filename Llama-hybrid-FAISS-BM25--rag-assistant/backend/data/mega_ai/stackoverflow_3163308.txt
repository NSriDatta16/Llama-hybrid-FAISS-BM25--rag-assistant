Take data from a field from exsisting node and make that the default value of a field in different content type

I don't know if I'm on the right track but I'm trying to let users of my web site create there own versions of pages on my web site. Basically I'd like to make our documentation used as a starting point where they just add details and make a new page for themselves in the process. I have a 'book' content type that I have changed with CCK and a 'client edits' content type that uses a nodereferencefromURL widget to link itself to the book node. So simple version of what I'm saying is I have a link on my book pages that creates a node using client edits content type. I would like to put some fields on the client edits content type that take the values of some of the fields from the book page it is linked from. I'm sure I'm missing something as I would have thought someone would have tried this before but I can't even find a hint on how to go about this. All I really need is a point in the right direction if my current thinking is wrong. Current thinking is that I use a php script to get the default value for a field on the new node add screen that drags the value for a field from the book I'm linking from. I'm thinking this is the case because there is an option for default values for the field in cck manage fields that lets you put in a php value to return a default value for your field. Am I on the right track or is there already a module or process that does what I'm talking about and I'm just too dumb to find it.
