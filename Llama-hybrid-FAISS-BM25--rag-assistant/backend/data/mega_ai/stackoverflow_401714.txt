Just an idea that may help... I have not tested this, but, after detecting the tap on a particular imageview turn off userInteractionEnabled of the all other imageviews... I suppose this will help increase a little bit the speed, as iPhone will not last resources trying to find which image is being tapped during a drag. The same is true for multitouch.
