How can the support of proposal distribution impact convergence of RH-MH algorithm?

In the book Introducing Monte Carlo Methods by Casella and Robert, there's a sentence with which I'm having some trouble to understand. «If the domain explored in $q$ [proposal] is too small, compared with the range of $f$(the target's distribution density), the Markov Chain will have difficulties in exploring this range and will converge very slowly» The acceptance probability depends on the proposed state $y$, through $$\frac{f(y)}{q(y|x)}$$ The higher this proportion, the higher the chances of accepting the proposed move. Unintuitive to me at least, a very low transition prob. $q(y|x)$ w.r.t. $f(y)$ would increase the chances of accepting the new move. So, if I'm at $x$ and I'm proposed a move to a lower transition probability state, then I'll want to move... Is that to make me explore the whole domain of $q$? How can the support of proposal distribution impact convergence of RH-MH algorithm?
