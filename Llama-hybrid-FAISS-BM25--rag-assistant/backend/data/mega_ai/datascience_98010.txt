Considering a team like Chelsea has played FA Cup, Champions League, Premier League and other competitions. We need to keep in mind that, other teams would also participate in the same competitions. Sports data from all teams in the competitions would help to identify Chelsea's best win against their toughest competitors that they have faced in FA Cup, Champions League, Premier League. So to answer your first question , you need to take training data for all competitions Chelsea's faced. Coming to second question , what is noise in this model. To identify noise in a signal we can use statistics, noise would be something that's happened by fluke, in other words Randomness. For better understanding, do have a look at Signal Vs Noise in statistics you tube video . The signal is the meaningful information that you’re actually trying to detect. The noise is the random, unwanted variation or fluctuation that interferes with the signal. Coming to your final question What is the most useful approach data science wise? Most useful approaches are neural networks which outperformed all ML algorithms or building a hyrbid model. Sports Analytics for Football League Table and Player Performance Prediction : Sports analytics were studied especially team performance prediction and player performance. This paper also provides information on comparative studies of all methods, some of the most promising methods I found are mentioned below. Method 1 : Dixon, M.J. and Coles, S.G. Modelling Association Football Scores and Inefficiencies in the Football Betting Market predicting the result of a match was created in 1997 by Dixon and Coles. The model is considered a classic and was able to extract probabilities for the goals scored in a match, following Poisson distribution Method 2 : Neural Networks Hucaljuk and Rakipovic utilised Multilayer Perceptron, trained with Back Propagation, equipped with conjugative–gradient algorithms. They concluded that NNs performed better than any other ML technique they used. Method 3 : Hybrid model Goddard, in 2005, compared the two methods, i.e. modeling the goals scored vs modeling win–draw–lose match result and concluded that a hybrid model achieves the best prediction performance Method 4 : Rating concept widely utilised by researchers, most popular ELO Rating Method 5 :Multiple regression model developed by Oberstone. He also used F distribution to compare means of multiple samples (i.e. one–way analysis of variance) to investigate which pitch actions differentiate the four best teams from all the others in the league. He managed to achieve outstanding results Research Papers proof Predicting sport outcomes by mere recognition This paper presents power of recognition in forecasting soccer games. The studies are done on World Cup 2006 and UEFA Euro 2008. Performance measures utilized are ranking rule and odds rule Dolores: a model that predicts football match outcomes from all over the world Dolores provides empirical proof that a model can make a good prediction for a match outcome between teams x and y even when the prediction is derived from historical match data that neither x nor y participated in. While this agrees with past studies in football and other sports, this paper extends the empirical evidence to historical training data that does not just include match results from a single competition but contains results spanning different leagues and divisions from 35 different countries. Predicting The Dutch Football Competition Using Public Data A Machine Learning Approach Principal Component Analysis (PCA), along with ML algorithms (Naive Bayes and Multilayer Perceptron) to predict the Dutch football championship. They achieved an accuracy of almost 55% in their predictions and proved that a hybrid model, combining public data and betting odds could improve accuracy
