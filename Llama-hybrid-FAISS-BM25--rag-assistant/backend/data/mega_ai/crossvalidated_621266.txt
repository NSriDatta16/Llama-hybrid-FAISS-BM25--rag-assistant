Time series analysis for multiple features

I wanted to get some ideas around how I can implement this project. I have a dataset having 3 columns, 2 categorical columns A and B and a column Count. This data is generated every 5 mins in a different file with timestamp. I want to predict the next 5-6 iterations based on previous data for each combination of A and B. My solution was to build a different model for each combination but it would be very hard to maintain. Is there a better solution for this prediction? Also since this is generated every 5 mins. I would need to append the data and retrain every 5 mins to predict for the next 25 - 20 mins. Is there any other better approach to this?
