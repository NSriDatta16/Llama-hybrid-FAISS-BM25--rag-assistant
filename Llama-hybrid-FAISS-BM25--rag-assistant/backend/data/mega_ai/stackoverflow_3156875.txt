Choose appropriate platform dependent DLL at runtime

I'm currently working on project for the .NET Compact Framework which uses DotNetZip for reading ZIP-files. The project is split into two parts. One platform-independent library which should be available for both, a CF project and a desktop project. This common library contains the code for extracting ZIP-files. The problem is that there are two different DLLs of the DotNetZip library, one for .NET CF and one for the .NET Desktop Framework. It's not possible to use the CF version of the library on a Desktop Framework and vice versa but they share the same interface. How do I organize my projects in Visual Studio to be able to use the common zip-code and dynamically load the appropriate DLL (which then is used by the zip-code)? It should also be possible to execute the CF application on a PC so is there a way to choose the DLL at runtime?
