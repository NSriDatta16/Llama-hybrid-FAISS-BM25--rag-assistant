Why are you using IFrames to load your content? That's soooo 1995. You are aware that there's this thing called AJAX that allows you to load separate pieces of content on at different times on the same web page right? Are you using a Viewport at all to organize your content? You might perhaps think about leveraging the objects in the ExtJS library to build up your page instead of embedding them into the HTML.
