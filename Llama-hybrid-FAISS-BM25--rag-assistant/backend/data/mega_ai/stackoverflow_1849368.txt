As Christophe said, a dictionary is used to organise key/value pairs because of the fast access time it provides. If you application needs a fixed index, you should look at the other data structures that provide a specific/known order. Having said that, it should be safe to assume that the order doesn't change unless items are added (there wouldn't be any point to do this expensive operation of reshuffling stuff) etc but, again, don't rely on it.
