Is it possible to automate time series forecasting?

I would like to build an algorithm that would be able to analyze any time series and "automatically" choose the best traditional/statiscal forecasting method (and its parameters) for the analyzed time series data. Would it be possible to do something like this? If yes, can you give me some tips on how can this be approached?
