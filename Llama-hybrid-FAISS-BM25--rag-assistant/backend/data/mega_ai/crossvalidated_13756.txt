How do I create a predictor for a time series once I've confirmed Granger-causality?

I have a set of time series data that I've found granger-causality (i.e. regressed Y vs. X, X-1, Y-1), and am wondering how I can create a predictor from this linear model? Is it simply the coefficients I get back from my model? (I'm trying to code this programmatically, and am still a stats rookie, so if this is obvious, forgive me)
