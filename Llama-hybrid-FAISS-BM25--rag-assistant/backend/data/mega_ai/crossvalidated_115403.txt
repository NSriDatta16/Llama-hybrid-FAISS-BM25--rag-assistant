In my opinion, Artificial Intelligence could be considered as the "superset" of fields such as Machine Learning, Data Mining, Pattern Recognition etc. Statistics, is a field of mathematics that includes all the mathematical models, techniques and theorems that are being used in AI. Machine Learning is a field of AI that includes all the algorithms that applies the above mentioned Statistical Models and makes sense of the data, that is, predictive analytics such as clustering and classifiaction. Data Mining is the science that uses all the techniques above(machine learning mainly) in order to extract useful and important patterns from data. Data Mining usually has to do with extracting useful information from massive datasets, that is, Big Data.
