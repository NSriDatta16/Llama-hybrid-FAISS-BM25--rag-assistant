Using Entity Framework 4 to search inside two comma separated lists

I have an entity that has a property called YearsAvailible, this is a comma separated list of financial years e.g. 05,09,10 I have an API that is passes a string[] of year names and I need to search for all of the entity that have a financial year that is in the passed array. The best I can come up with is this: var hash = new Hashtable(); foreach(var year in financialYears) { var categories = from expCat in All() where expCat.YearsAvailable.Contains(year) select expCat; foreach (var category in categories) { if (!hash.ContainsKey(category.Id)) { hash.Add(category.Id, category); } } } return hash.Values; Whilst this works, it produces multiple database queries and doesn't express its intent very well. Is there a tidier way to do this?
