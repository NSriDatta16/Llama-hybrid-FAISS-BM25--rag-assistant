How to handle a custom event in a XtraGrid control

I am trying to solve a problem with a DevExpress XtraGrid in a winforms app. I have created a custom RepositoryItemButtonEdit control and have one unbound column in a XtraGrid that uses it. This control is a custom search field which throws an event when it has completed a search. What I am trying to do is add an event handler to the cell that is running the search so I can get notified when it has completed. Is this possible in a datagrid?
