There are two routes you can take without needing any extra software involved. The first is to just make an executable jar (Java Archive) file . Java automatically associates the .jar extension with the Java interpreter on most systems. The JAR's manifest file will tell it which class to launch when you double-click it. The second, less recommended route, is to make a Java Web Start application, with a JNLP launcher file. The is aimed more at applications distributed from web sites.
