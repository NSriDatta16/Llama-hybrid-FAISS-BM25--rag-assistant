Doing first clustering and then regression makes only sense, if you want to have information about the groups identified with the cluster. If you want information for each category you can just include each one as dummy. you can try clustering and see if your identified clusters make sense from a topic point of view (this is highly dependent on your data and a quite sensitive approach). If you have a reasonable amount of categories using the dummy approach within regression might be more soundproof. I don't know how many variables you have, but if there are a lot, you might consider adding a lasso-penalty term. In that way, some of your coefficients that are not significant will be shrunken to zero (and not included in your linear regression) and that way you will avoid overfitting your data. Another possibility which often works quite well might be to use random forest regression. There, the number of input variables doesn't matter and you often get good prediction results as well. Just remember, that for lasso and for random forest you have to tune your parameter accordingly!
