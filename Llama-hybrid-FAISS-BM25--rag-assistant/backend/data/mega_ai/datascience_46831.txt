How will Occam's Razor principle work in Machine learning

The following question displayed in the image was asked during one of the exams recently. I am not sure if I have correctly understood the Occam's Razor principle or not. According to the distributions and decision boundaries given in the question and following the Occam's Razor the decision boundary B in both the cases should be the answer. Because as per Occam's Razor, choose the simpler classifier which does a decent job rather than the complex one. Can someone please testify if my understanding is correct and the answer chosen is appropriate or not? Please help as I am just a beginner in machine learning
