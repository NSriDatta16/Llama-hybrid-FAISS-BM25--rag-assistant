Is Intersection at Compile Time for Java useful?

The Java standard allows the manipulation of the AST at compile time. However there is no standard about the API and every compiler implements it differently (even between versions). At work we used to had some hack mixing compile time and load time intersection. We now are changing into a eclipse focused development process and this hack is giving us some trouble. I wrote a JVM Agent that loads a Javassist transformer and rewrites the bytecode, removing the need of compile time intersection, and solving our problems. My question is: Is Intersection at Compile Time for Java useful? Is there a use case in which you can't do it using intersection at load time?
