Common approaches I've seen: if there's not much state then store it client-side, in a cookie - this also has the advantage of not requiring IP affinity so requests can be distributed more evenly shared storage (DB, Terracotta, etc.) - obviously this can become a bottleneck deploy at a quiet time and hope nobody notices remove server from pool for new sessions, then monitor the logs and wait for requests to die off
