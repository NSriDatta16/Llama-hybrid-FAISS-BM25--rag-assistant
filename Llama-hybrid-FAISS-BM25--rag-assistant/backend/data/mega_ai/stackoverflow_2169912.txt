Ragel: http://www.complang.org/ragel/ It fits most of your requirements. It runs on Windows It doesn't declare the variables, so you can put them inside a class or inside a function as you like. It has nice tools for analyzing regular expressions to see when they would backtrack. (I don't know about this very much, since I never use syntax in Ragel that would create a backtracking parser.) Variable names can't be changed. Table names are prefixed with the machine name, and they're declared "const static", so you can put more than one in the same file and have more than one with the same name in a single program (as long as they're in different files). You can declare the variables as any integer type, including UChar (or whatever UTF-16 type you prefer). It doesn't automatically handle surrogate pairs, though. It doesn't have special character classes for Unicode either (I think). It only does regular expressions... has no bison/yacc features. The code it generates interferes very little with a program. The code is also incredibly fast, and the Ragel syntax is more flexible and readable than anything I've ever seen. It's a rock solid piece of software. It can generate a table-driven parser or a goto-driven parser.
