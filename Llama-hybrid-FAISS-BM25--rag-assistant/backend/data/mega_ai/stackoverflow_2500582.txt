I kinda doubt that is. The fact is that Paypal, Google and Authorize.net work in different ways. Paypal handles the payment itself, and the API they expose to the developer is minimal and actually they have about 4 flavours of it (express, uk, payflow edition.. ). Google checkout as well is doing a lot of stuff in the background as integrates the checkout process itself. Authorize.net is just a payment gateway and passes more responsibility to the developer. They have a full and complex API and works only for US. A suggestion. Take a look at Magento shopping cart as they implement paypal, google checkout and authorize.net modules in the default installation.
