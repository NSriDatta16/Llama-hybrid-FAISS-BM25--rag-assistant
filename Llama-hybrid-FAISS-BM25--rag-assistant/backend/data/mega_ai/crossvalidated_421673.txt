Neural Networks interaction between input variables

I want to build a regression NN model that predicts Y variable but takes into account the interactions between input variables (x1,x2,x3,x4,x5) without explicitly specifying them. My current NN model implementation has: 5 input variables (x1,..x5) 1 hidden layer with 5 neurons 1 output (Y) logistic activation function My question is: Can this architecture capture the interactions (if exist) or do I need an extra layer for this? Thank you!
