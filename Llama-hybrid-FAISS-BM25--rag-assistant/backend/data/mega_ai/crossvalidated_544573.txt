How to determine feature relevance using ‘Weights’ method?

The following photo displays the ‘Weights’ method for determining feature relevance in a neural network model. Source: http://sovan.lek.free.fr/publi/160-3%20Gevrey.pdf NB: For anyone confused I believe ‘nh’ must denote the no. of hidden neurons and ‘ni’ denote the no. of input neurons. What isn’t clear to me is how to calculate $Q_{ih}$ if there is more than one hidden layer. Do you just use the weights into the first hidden layer and disregard the rest?
