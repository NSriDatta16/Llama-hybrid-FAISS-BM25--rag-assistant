Yes. Design patterns can be wonderful when used appropriately. As you mentioned, I am now using Model-View-Controller (MVC) for all of my web projects. It is a very common pattern in the web space which makes server-side code much cleaner and well-organized. Beyond that, here are some other patterns that may be useful: MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel): a similar pattern to MVC; used for WPF and Silverlight applications. Composition: Great for when you need to use a hierarchy of objects. Singleton: More elegant than using globals for storing items that truly need a single instance. As you mentioned, a simple pattern but it does have its uses. It is worth noting a design pattern can also highlight a lack of language features and/or deficiencies in a language. For example, iterators are now built in as part of newer languages. In general design patterns are quite useful but you should not use them everywhere; just where they are a good fit for your needs.
