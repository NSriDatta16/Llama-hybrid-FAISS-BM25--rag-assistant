If I recall the gang of four correctly, the Command pattern is about commands like "File - Save", not commands like "svn commit", which is what your code is good for. Martin suggests the Command pattern is unneeded because functions as first class objects take its place, but the Command pattern is richer than just doit() , having, for example, also undo() , is_enabled() , etc.
