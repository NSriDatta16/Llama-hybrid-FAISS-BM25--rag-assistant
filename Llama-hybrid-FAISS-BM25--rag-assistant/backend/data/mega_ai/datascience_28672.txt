Regression - How Random Forest and Gradient Boosting really works?

I read a lot about random forest and gradient boosting, but I do not know how these two algorithms really work. For example, see the simple picture about basketball (picture 1) from this link : How does Random Forest and how does Gradient Boosting work? Has each tree in the random forest different trainings data AND different features? Sorry about m question but I donâ€˜t find an easy non-mathematical answer.
