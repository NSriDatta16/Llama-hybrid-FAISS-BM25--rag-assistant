compare the means of two cross sectional time series

I have bi-variate annual ( $n=6$ ) time series data for each company $i$ (number of companies $k=5$ ): $$\begin{bmatrix} X_{it} \\ Y_{it} \end{bmatrix} ,\, i = 1,\dots, k,\, t = 1,\dots, n$$ Where $X_{it}$ and $Y_{it}$ are not independent ( $X$ is actual profit and $Y$ is expected profit). We want to test if there is a significant difference between $X$ and $Y$ with this data? What is the appropriate test? I think it may use t-test or Wilcoxon test for each company and get $k$ decisions (one for each company), but I don't know how can we damage all this results together. I thought also that if we combined the data of all companies together, it might be possible to compare common means (actual and expected).
