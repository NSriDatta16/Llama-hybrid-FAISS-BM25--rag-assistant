Why are MA(q) time series models called "moving averages"?

When I read "moving average" in relation to a time series, I think something like $\frac{(x_{t-1} + x_{t-2} + x_{t-3})}3$ , or perhaps a weighted average like $0.5x_{t-1} + 0.3x_{t-2} + 0.2x_{t-3}$ . (I realize these are actually AR(3) models, but these are what my brain jumps to.) Why are MA(q) models formulas of error terms, or "innovations"? What does $\{\epsilon\}$ have to do with a moving average? I feel like I'm missing some obvious intuition.
