Why not using composition instead of inheritance? I have a similar issue : an admin app and a public app, with the same database, and only some specific methods on some models for one app or the other. I'm currently thinking I could create a common place with many modules where I would put my methods. I would then include the modules I need in each app (in models, controllers, helpers, â€¦) when I need them. This place could be in the lib directory (updated with a git submodule or svm external) or in a gem (updated with Bundler or a similar tool). What do you think about this ?
