In addition to @Dahn's nice answer , I thought I would try to say a little bit more about where the Bessel and Gamma functions come from. One starting point for arriving at the covariance function is Bochner's theorem . Theorem (Bochner) A continuous stationary function $k(x, y) = \widetilde{k}(|x − y|)$ is positive definite if and only if $\widetilde{k}$ is the Fourier transform of a finite positive measure: $$\widetilde{k}(t) = \int_{\mathbb{R}} e^{−iωt}\mathrm{d}µ(ω) .$$ From this you can deduce that the Matérn covariance matrix is derived as the Fourier transform of $\frac{1}{(1+\omega^2)^p}$ (Source: Durrande) . That's all good but it doesn't really tell us how you arrive at this finite positive measure given by $\frac{1}{(1+\omega^2)^p}$ . Well, it's the (power) spectral density of a stochastic process $f(x)$ . Which stochastic process? It's known that a random process on $\mathbb{R}^d$ with a Matérn covariance function is a solution to the stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) $$ (κ^2 − ∆)^{α/2} X(s) = φW(s), $$ where $W(s)$ is Gaussian white noise with unit variance, $$\Delta = \sum_{i=1}^d \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2_i}$$ is the Laplace operator, and $α =ν + d/2$ (I think this is in Cressie and Wikle ). Why pick this particular SPDE/stochastic process? The origin is in spatial statistics where it's argued that this is the simplest and natural covariance that works well in $\mathbb{R}^2$ : The exponential correlation function is a natural correlation in one dimension, since it corresponds to a Markov process. In two dimensions this is no longer so, although the exponential is a common correlation function in geostatistical work. Whittle (1954) determined the correlation corresponding to a stochastic differential equation of Laplace type: $$ \left[ \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial t_1}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial t_2}\right)^2 - \kappa^2 \right] X(t_1, t_2) = \epsilon(t_1 , t_2) $$ where $\epsilon$ is white noise. The corresponding discrete lattice process is a second order autoregression. (Source: Guttorp&Gneiting) The family of processes included in the SDE associated with the Matérn equation includes the $AR(1)$ Ornstein–Uhlenbeck model of the velocity of a particle undergoing Brownian motion. More generally, you can define a power spectrum for a family of $AR(p)$ processes for every integer $p$ which also have a Matérn family covariance. This is in the appendix of Rasmussen and Williams. This covariance function is not related to Matérn cluster process . References Cressie, Noel, and Christopher K. Wikle. Statistics for spatio-temporal data. John Wiley & Sons, 2015.
