In Python you don't include , you import , also you don't import files and directories , you import modules and packages , which are often (but not always) files and directories present somewhere in the Python path. Therefore the common practice is to put all your modules in a package which the user should place in the Python path, and then import the modules from there. Importing files is possible but discouraged. If your config module is a real module part of your library, internal configuration or site configuration, you need to create a new package named as your project is named, put the config and other modules inside it. Also note that because of the module/package structure used in Python, creating a project with an includes directory for the modules inside it isn't going to work very well. If your config.py file is supposed to be user configuration, you can look at the ConfigParser module, or use the third-party cfgparse .
