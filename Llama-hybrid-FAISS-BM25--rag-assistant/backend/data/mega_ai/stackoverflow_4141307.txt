Possible Duplicate: What's your favorite profiling tool (for C++) Are there any good tools to profile a source code which is mix of of C and C++. What are the pros and cons of any, and which ones have you used and would reccomend for usage. Please do not get me a list of tools from google. I can do that too, what i want is to leverage the personal experience of someone who has used these tools and knows the pros and cons about them. Thanks in advance.
