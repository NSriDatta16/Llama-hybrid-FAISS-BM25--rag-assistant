At least in C++, that code snippet is essentially equivalent to this: if(some_condition) { x = 100; } else { y = 100; } It is guaranteed by the C++ standard, although you have to read the relevant sections carefully. The rules of the operator are surprisingly complicated (mainly due to the type conversions that are performed) so the conditional operator and the if-then-else statement are not exactly equivalent all the time. However, in your code snippet above, this paragraph in the standard is relevant: 5.16/4 Conditional operator: If the second and third operands are lvalues and have the same type, the result is of that type and is an lvalue.
