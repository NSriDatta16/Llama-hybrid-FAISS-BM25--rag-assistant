Logistic Regression, ''Intercept'' instead of a Category

I am currently trying to analyse the effect of an ilness (0= no infection, 1= infection) on 9 different Genotypes in plants. My Dataframe consist of 2 colums Genotyp and Infection. I have 459 rows for all the observerd plants. Here a cutout. [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/NVZRA.png Due to being new to R I used a Youtube Tutorial to help. I just dont know if the output I get is correct or if I should do something else. Because when I run the code Intercept is in the place where the first Genotyp ''aacc'' would be. I tried researching the term Intercept, but couldn't make anything out of it. I would really appreciate the help or any other info. Thanks in advance! model1 |z|) (Intercept) -1.3863 0.3727 -3.720 0.000199 *** GenotypaaCc 1.9871 0.4796 4.144 3.42e-05 *** GenotypaaCC 2.0307 0.4599 4.415 1.01e-05 *** GenotypAacc 1.9253 0.5020 3.835 0.000125 *** GenotypAaCc 1.5466 0.4684 3.302 0.000960 *** GenotypAaCC 0.6242 0.4936 1.264 0.206062 GenotypAAcc 0.7550 0.4474 1.688 0.091491 .
