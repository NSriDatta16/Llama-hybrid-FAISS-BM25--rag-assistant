SVM's are particularly ill-suited for time prediction analysis due to stationarity assumptions. You can circumvent these restrictions by clever use of feature or kernel engineering essential rendering the data distribution stationary though. I'd suggest to take a look at ARIMA related literature & models to see some of the typical "terms" that are included. Specifically, you could try incorporating: Previous predictions (especially $x_{t-1}$) Movement of the distribution (e.g. $(x_{t-1} - x_{t-2})/x_{t-1}$ or PID) Trends (lagged previous averages, say a dummy for every weekday in intraday trading data) The latter should easily solve your problem afaik.
