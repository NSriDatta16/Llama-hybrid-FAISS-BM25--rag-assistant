My 2c: You're trying to be clever, and your causing your own pain. Bitfields and SQL don't mix well, primarily because bitfields cannot be properly indexed and any search will have to do a full scan. Eg. to find all reselers that ship to AK you need to scan the entire table of reselers. Also the solution does not scale to more than 64 values (as you already discovered). It also poor storage choice, it requires a bit with value 0 to store the negative information (lack of association). Use a separate table to model the many-to-many relation between resellers and states/territories/provinces/countries they ship to.
