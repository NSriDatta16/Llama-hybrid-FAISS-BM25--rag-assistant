I think what you're trying to do is organize your code properly and effectively, which I commend. However if I understand correctly, you're going to put all of your javascript, html, and PHP in one file, which is really bad . You want your code to be modular, not lumped together in a single file. I think you should look into using a framework (eg Zend) - PHP frameworks are specifically designed to help your code remain organized, modular, and secure. Your intent (organizing your code effectively) is great, but your idea for how to organize your code isn't very good. If you're absolutely adament about not using a framework (for example if this is a learning/school project), you should at least make sure you're following best practices .
