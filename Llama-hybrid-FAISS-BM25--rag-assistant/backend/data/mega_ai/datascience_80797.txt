Is it possible to classify documents of corpus using labels?

I have a corpus of 23000 documents that need to be classified into 5 different categories. I do not have any labeled data available to me, just freeform text documents and labels(yes, one-word labels, not topics). So I followed a 2-step approach: Synthetically generate labeled data (using a rule-based labeling approach, obviously the recall is very low, ~ 1/8 documents are labeled) Somehow, use this labeled data to identify labels for other documents. I have attempted the following approaches for step 2: Topic modeling on data classified using rules to extract significant terms and using significant terms to label the remaining documents. Finding significant terms using sentence embedding Using sentence embedding as features for my classifier But I haven't been successful in getting good results for my document classifier. Are there any other methods that can be used to classify the documents? All help is greatly appreciated.
