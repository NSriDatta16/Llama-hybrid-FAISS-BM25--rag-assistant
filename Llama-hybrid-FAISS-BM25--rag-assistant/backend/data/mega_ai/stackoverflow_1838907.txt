Paged ldap_search in OpenLDAP to get around size limit?

We are currently in the process of migrating from an aged proprietary directory service to OpenLDAP. Today we ran into the problem that ldap_search_ext_s or ldapsearch in general does not return any results, if the number of entries, which were to be returned by the current search, would hit a certain limit. Unfortunately setting the size limit higher in the LDAP server configuration might just postpone the problem, as we have a really big database and our update mechanism, which runs every morning, has to performe huge queries. In the MSDN documentation I noticed that there is a mechanism to perform a paged search , which would allow me to get around the size limitation. Apparently this is also specified in an RFC draft from 1996 but hasn't been finalized (yet)? Anyway, since I'm not working on a Windows-Box I have to use the OpenLDAP API, which doesn't seem to provide that mechanism (at least I couldn't find it on their search page ) Which brings me to my question: Do you have an idea what I could do, to solve that problem in an elegant manner? Thanks for your help!
