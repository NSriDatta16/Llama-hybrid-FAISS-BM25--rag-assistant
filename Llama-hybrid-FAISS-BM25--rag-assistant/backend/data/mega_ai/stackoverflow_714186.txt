Why do you need to set a price at all? Just allow people to place puts and calls at any price they wish. If you want to show a 'current' price for reference, take the price of the last transaction, or average the last few transactions. To get shares into the market in the first place, you can offer 'baskets'. For $100, sell anyone one share of every possible outcome. They can then sell off the outcomes they don't think will happen. You can even take advantage of market inefficiency by automatically generating and selling baskets any time there are buy orders for each outcome totalling more than $100, or you can leave that to enterprising players.
