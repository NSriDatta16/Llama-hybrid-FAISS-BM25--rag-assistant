If you're interested in version control generally the PragProg guys have a number of books on Subversion and Git ( http://www.pragprog.com ), look at these if you want to set up your own repository. The subversion book is also available as a free download ( http://svnbook.red-bean.com/ ). That will give you the ability to keep your code in a version control system (something I wouldn't be without even for personal projects). If you don't want to create an manage your own version control system then there are hosted options available. As for the database set up. Migrations are the way to go but you might find it easier to use one migration per table (i.e. edit the migration's you have rather than create new ones for each change). That way you can track all the table changes in one place. Not the traditional way to build things in Rails but it has some advantages. One issue you have to still manage is the data in the database. If you go live and decide to rollback your database you will loose all your data, so invest in a backup/restore tool for the database. Once you have version control in place it's generally easy to use and manage. If you are using an IDE it probably has integration into you version control system (especially if you are using SubVersion).
