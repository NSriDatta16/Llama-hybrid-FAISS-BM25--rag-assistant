This is an interesting problem. It is analogous to an example of court case trial - say a person is not guilty until he is proved guilty (your NO label) and will stay guilty when proved (your YES label). Now to guess the chances of a person to converted to guilty following techniques I would have applied: Method 1. Cluster similar persons and find other people's probability. You can cluster similar cases by having similar features of the records which have already labeled as YES . You can use community detection to for unsupervised clustering here. Method 2. Use markov chains. If you can define the possible steps (or stages) of observations which are usually followed before converting to YES. Then based on the chain being followed by that specific record the probability can be guessed
