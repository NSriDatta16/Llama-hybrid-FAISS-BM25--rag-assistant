The ASP.NET AJAX Control Toolkit has a cascading drop down list that uses a web service interface to determine what data will populate the next drop down list of data. I could easily see you leveraging this control so that your web service either returns a specialized subset if a specific item is selected or returns the full set of options if the ANY/ALL item is selected. Is this along the lines of what you seek?
