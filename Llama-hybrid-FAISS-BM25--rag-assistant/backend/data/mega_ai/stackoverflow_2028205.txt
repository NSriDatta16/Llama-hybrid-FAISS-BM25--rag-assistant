Look at “Object storage format” in Git User Manual . It is raw compressed data using zlib . One can use zpipe from the 'zlib1g-dev' package. Compile the example with gcc -o zpipe zpipe.c -lz . It is not a standard .gz or something. ./zpipe -d prints the content of the blob (header+data) If you want to check the SHA-1, you have to put the uncompressed blob in a file ( myblob ) and do sha1sum myblob
