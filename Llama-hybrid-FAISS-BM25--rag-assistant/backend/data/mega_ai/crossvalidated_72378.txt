Performing binary logistic regression with equal number of cases and non-cases

The best way to ask my question is to present an example scenario: Let's say that the outcome of interest is lung cancer (1 = lung cancer; 0 = no lung cancer) and a researcher has 200k records (where 20k patients have lung cancer (cases) and 180k patients do NOT have lung cancer (non-cases)). Since only 10% of patients (20/200k) in the sample data have lung cancer, a researcher uses a random sample of 20k from the patients that do NOT have lung cancer. By doing so, the researcher would have a sample of 20k patients with lung cancer and 20k patients without lung cancer in their sample (the sample is reduced from 200k to 40k records). Are there any benefits to performing binary logistic regression with equal number of cases and non-cases when the actual distribution of the outcome is not equal? Or does this bias model estimates/predictive power? Thanks in advance!
