How can I instantiate a base class and then convert it to a derived class?

I was wondering how to do this, consider the following classes public class Fruit { public string Name { get; set; } public Color Color { get; set; } } public class Apple : Fruit { public Apple() { } } How can I instantiate a new fruit but upcast to Apple, is there a way to instantiate a bunch of Fruit and make them apples with the name & color set. Do I need to manually deep copy? Of course this fails Fruit a = new Fruit(); a.Name = "FirstApple"; a.Color = Color.Red; Apple wa = a as Apple; System.Diagnostics.Debug.Print("Apple name: " + wa.Name); Do I need to pass in a Fruit to the AppleCTor and manually set the name and color( or 1-n properties) Is there an better design to do this?
