There's no indication that there's any mistake here. PCA is a dimension reduction technique, so it will find orthogonal vectors. If you have many correlated variables, it's not surprising that many of them will be strongly loaded onto a single dimension. It might be worth your time to read our most-upvoted thread on CV, which has many great explanations of what PCA is and how it works .
