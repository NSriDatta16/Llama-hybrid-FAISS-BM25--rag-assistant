Since calculating the backward gradients that too in CNN is very math heavy and it's a bit different from normal MLP as in CNN'S we have Tensors not scalar values to multiply so People use Correlation to Calculate the Convolution Operation... Just adding some links which I refer to from time to time thinking that someday I will be able to do this from scratch (seems impossible with deepening of Layers though...) Reference 1 Reference 2 CS231N Slides (Lecture 4-6 specially, the computational graphs construction are very helpful to understand the Back-propagation Algorithm..) It would be great if Someone can transfer the Equations into Latex here So that the question can be answered formally.. Based on the above Links, here's what I got,(Came to know that Convolutions are equivalent to Correlation) Image 1 Image 2 Stack doesn't allow me uploading image so using gdrive..(do rotate one of the images, the first one actually) Hope it will give you an idea...
