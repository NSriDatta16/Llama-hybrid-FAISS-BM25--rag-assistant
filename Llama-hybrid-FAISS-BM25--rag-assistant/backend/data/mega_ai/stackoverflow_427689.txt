How would you build this daily class schedule?

What I want to do is very simple but I'm trying to find the best or most elegant way to do this. The Rails application I'm building now will have a schedule of daily classes. For each class the fields relevant to this question are: Day of the week Starting time Ending time A single entry could be something such as: day of week: Wednesday starting time: 10:00 am ending time: Noon Also I must mention that it's a bi-lingual Rails 2.2 app and I'm using the native i18n Rails feature. I actually have several questions. Regarding the day of the week, should I create an extra table with list of days, or is there a built-in way to create that list on the fly? Keep in mind these days of the week will have to be rendered in English or Spanish in the schedule view depending on the locale variable. While querying the schedule I will need to group and order the results by weekday, from Monday to Sunday, and of course order the classes within each day by starting time. Regarding the starting time and ending time of each class would you use datetime fields or integer fields? If the latter how would you implement this exactly? Looking forward to read the different suggestions you guys will come up with.
