How to calculate percental change of two time series?

I have the two sets of data; $A = $ 1.5010, 1.3118, 1.4219, 1.1650, 1.2720, 1.5421, 1.4211, 1.1832, 1.5378 1.4357, 1.2707, 1.2411, 1.4833, 1.5578 and $B = $ 1.4039, 1.1912, 1.3596, 1.4168, 1.6269, 1.4635, 1.2787, 1.5260, 1.8160, 1.6103, 1.5315, 1.7100, 1.5181, 1.4049 The data is meant to represent the amount of negative words people use on a discussion forum before and after a political election. The higher value, the more negative the forum post is. $A$ is two weeks before the event, and $B$ is two weeks after, where $A_7$ is day 7, for example. So I made a two sampled paired t-test in R where $$H_0: \mu_{A} - \mu_{B} = 0$$ $$H_a: \mu_{A} - \mu_{B} And I get a p-value = $0.04325$, so I reject null with 95% certainty, since $\alpha$ = $.05$ With this, I claim to say that there has been an increase of negative words since the mean is different, and seems to be larger two weeks after the election. How do I calculate the actual percental increase? Would I take the diffrence between $A_i$ and $B_i$ divided by $B_i$ and then cumulative their sum? Any help would be wonderful!
