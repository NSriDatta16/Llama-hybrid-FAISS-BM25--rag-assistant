compare time series data with ODE simulation

The same experiment was performed for 4 different initial conditions $(j=1,2,3,4)$. For each initial condition, there were 3 repetition $(i=1,2,3)$ of the experiment. I have 4 sets of data: $X_{ij} = \big(X_i(t_1), X_i(t_2), X_i(t_3),X_i(t_4) \big)$, where $i = 1,2,3, j = 1,2,3,4$ in each set there is 3 repetition of the experiment. I can simulate the data with ODE, so I will get 4 results for different initial conditions: $Y_j = \big(Y(t_1), Y(t_2), Y(t_3), Y(t_4)\big)$. I would like to compare my simulation with the data. What type of measure I should use in this case? I can compare $Y_j$ with each $X_{ij}$ but in this way I will get as a result 12 different distance. How to combine this together? I need the results to decide if to accept the ODE model with some parameters values or to reject.
