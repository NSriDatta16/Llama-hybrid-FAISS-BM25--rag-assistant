BlackBerry Browser (4.5) refuses to cache CSS. Is there a workaround?

I develop an internal web application for my company. It is used by our field technicians, all of whom carry a BlackBerry 8330 running 4.5. I would consider myself fortunate to have such a consistent target platform, if it wasn't BB 4.5... I've noticed a lot of request overhead in loading the site, and know that if only my CSS resources were cached, the load time would be cut dramatically. The BB always requests a full copy of the CSS file, no matter if the Expires , Cache-Control , or Last-Modified headers are set. It doesn't hit its cache, it doesn't send an If-Modified-Since, nothing. Anyone run into this or know what I can do to workaround it? I'd really like to avoid inlining my CSS if I don't have to. EDIT: I just noticed that it is always requesting the page twice.
