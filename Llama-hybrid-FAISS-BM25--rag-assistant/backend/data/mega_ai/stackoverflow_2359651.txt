Tim Morgan's solution didn't work for me. However I was able to get things working by installing an older version of libodbc-ruby (0.9995) from here: http://mirrors.kernel.org/ubuntu/pool/universe/libo/libodbc-ruby/libodbc-ruby1.8_0.9995-1_i386.deb Additional details are available from Carsten Gehling's blog: http://gehling.dk/2010/02/the-woes-of-libodbc-ruby1-8-and-debian-ubuntu/ Be careful though -- Ubuntu's Update Manager will happily "upgrade" this version of libodbc-ruby to the broken 0.9997-2. I accidentally overwrote the older version this way only to end up back here, trying to figure out how I fixed it last time.
