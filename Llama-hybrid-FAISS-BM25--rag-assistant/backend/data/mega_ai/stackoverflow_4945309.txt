I think this is not really a UI design problem but more of an application design problem. On mobile devices, even counting tablets, you have very very small screen real estate. The statement : "How can I browse large set of xx on a mobile with a 3 inches screen" is antinomical and the answer is : "You shouldn't" :) Give your user a very powerful search engine, organize your content in a tree of categories so that at the end of a branch or after a search there is no more than 10 to 20 results. You can even go the evil root of : "Sorry your request generated more than 50 results, try to be more specific." It will give you the following : -Great usability Your content is now(was) organized and easy to reuse in other projects Low bandwith usage (given this is web service based app) Lower battery comsumption No need to spend three days making your own custom UI component :D
