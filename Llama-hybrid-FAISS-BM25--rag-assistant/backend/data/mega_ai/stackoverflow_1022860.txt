As mentioned in another answer you will need a 3rd party to send your messages through and you will also have to pay something for sending them. I haven't tried it myself but this tutorial on Sending SMS thru HTTP seems like a nice way to go. It'll enable you to Use PHP and the HTTP protocol to send text-messages from your website through an SMS gateway. The tutorial makes use of the SMS API from TM4B which seems really intuitive. TM4B also offers gateway software for a dedicated machine (even though I know you try to avoid that). And as stated in the tutorial about TM4B: They are the only gateway I know that have a simulation mode for tweaking your scripts. They don't have any set-up fees. Their prices are low. They are reliable. I use them. At least that's the way I'd go to begin with. I think that's enough propaganda for tonight : ).
