This kind of task is usually done using Neural Networks. This is your primary direction to look. Also some more specific kind of network for you to look is Kohonen Neural Network. It is the simpliest Image Recognition network, that can be also used in a face recognition tasks. You won't achieve any good results using ONLY this one kind of net, but connecting few of them together. I can't give more detail, as I know this only in theory, but have no practical skills in this area. Btw, I don't think you will find any libraries for that task, as usually if you have such library - why dont make a product and sell it?
