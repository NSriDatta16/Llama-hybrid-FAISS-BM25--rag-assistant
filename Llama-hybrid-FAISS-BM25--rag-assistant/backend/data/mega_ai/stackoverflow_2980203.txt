Note that when the browser interprets the "javascript:" value of an "href", if the return value is not empty then it is interpreted as the document content desired for the tag! Here is a test page for you to enjoy: http://gutfullofbeer.net/jslink.html The source for that page (look at it; it's really short) includes the following link: Click to go there! The function "getLink()" is defined as follows: function getLink() { var sel = document.getElementById('sel'); return sel.options[sel.selectedIndex].value; } As you see, the function grabs the current selected value of the element on the page and returns that. What does the element look like? Redirecting to CNN ... '>CNN Redirecting to Zombocom ... '>Zombocom Redirecting to Reddit ... '>Reddit The values of those options are complete HTML markup for a page with a redirect to the requested site. Because the URL returns a value, that value is understood by the browser to be the new page content. It's pretty mind-blowing. I'm not sure why you'd ever do this.
