Your problem is already here, which is a well-documented problem in mixed modeling with lme4 : boundary (singular) fit: see help('isSingular') When you have a singular model fit, this is a massive problem and renders pretty much all of your regression output useless. Since you also have extremely close-to-zero confidence intervals, you probably have a random variance structure that doesn't match your data. I think this makes sense if you have some participants with one point of estimation, as they wouldn't anyways have a slope that can be estimated, but regardless you probably have other issues going on that you should check with exploratory data analysis (checking grouped scatter plots, making sure you have enough clusters / observations per cluster, etc.). You should in any case consider trying to fit a less complex model and see what the output looks like. I provide some citations below regarding model complexity issues and how cluster effects can influence this. Citations Austin, P. C., & Leckie, G. (2018).
