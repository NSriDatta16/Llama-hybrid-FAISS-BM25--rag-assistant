I was googling for the answer for about 4 days already and finally came up with a step-by-step manual on fixing macports and rubygems: http://oleganza.tumblr.com/post/127709563/snow-leopard-with-legacy-macports-and-rubygems In short: for proper use of macports and rubygems you would have to: Install trunk macports from source (or use 1.8 version when it is released) Add alias for "gem install with 64bit architecture" Reinstall all ports (not automated yet) Reinstall all gems (100% automated) This would take 10-20 minutes of your personal time and another 20 minutes of machine time in order to build and install stuff. I would be glad to get more answers in order to fix other issues we might meet later.
