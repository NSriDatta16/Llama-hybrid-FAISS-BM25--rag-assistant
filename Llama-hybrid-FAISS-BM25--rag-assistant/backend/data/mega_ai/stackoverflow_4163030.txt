We are using the following in production for our sites: We run hosted solr (based on lucene) instances on http://websolr.com and cache the results using the new azure distributed cache feature that is currently in beta. That gives us a worst case 200 ms latency for an initial search request between the Amazon datacenter where websolr.com runs and the Azure Datacenter and an average 6 - 10 ms for all cached searches. We also record common search text fragments and try to keep them fresh in the cache.
