I don't understand how we obtain the model that we test for a unit root in the ADF test. Let me explain better. ADF test is used to test if a time series has a unit-root. We assume that the Data Generating Process of the time series is an AR(p). $$Y_t = \rho_1\cdot Y_{t-1} + \rho_2\cdot Y_{t-2} + \rho_3\cdot Y_{t-3} +...+ \rho_p\cdot Y_{t-p} + \upsilon_t$$ $$ \upsilon_t \sim i.i.d.\text{N} \Big( 0, \sigma^{2}\Big)$$ In order to do so, ADF test the null hypothesis that $\phi = 0 $ on the following model. $$\Delta{Y_t} = \phi\cdot Y_{t-1}+ \gamma_1\cdot \Delta{Y_{t-1}} + \gamma_2\cdot \Delta{Y_{t-2}} + \gamma_3\cdot \Delta{Y_{t-3}} +...+ \gamma_{p-1}\cdot \Delta{Y_{t-p+1}} + \upsilon_t$$ My question is how did we derive the second model from the first one? Which math operations are required? I tried to subtract $ Y_{t-1} $ from both side, some other manipulation and rearrangements but I didn't succeed. Lagged error terms always came up. The book "Applied Time Series Econometrics" from Lütkepohl states that: Any suggestions? Am I misunderstanding or forgetting something?
