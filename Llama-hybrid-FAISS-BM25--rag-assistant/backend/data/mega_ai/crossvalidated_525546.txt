Examples of strongly convex loss functions

This is a reference request. Strong convexity of the loss function is often used in theoretical analyses of convex optimisation for machine learning. My question is, are there important / widely used loss functions (or cost functions) being used in machine learning in practice? I know of the logistic loss for classification, and the square loss for regression. Are there any others?
