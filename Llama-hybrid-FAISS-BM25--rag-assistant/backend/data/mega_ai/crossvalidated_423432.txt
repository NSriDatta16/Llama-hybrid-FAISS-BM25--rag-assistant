T-test for percentages

I have data from 50 different English second language classes. Each class I have a percentage of students that passed Test A before the language program and Test A again after the program concluded. E.g., Class 1 = 50% students passed Test A pre language program and 65% passed Test A post language program. Can I do a paired t-test to see if the language program improved the class average? It seems weird to me use percentages as values for a participant (i.e., in this case a class). Though I don't understand statistics well enough to figure out if my feeling is correct.
