How to store relational POCO's in nosql world?

We' re working on a project that has a relational object model and we would like to use a no/sql solution (couchdb) for some part of data storage. For example, there are users and applications which are related to each other via Applications UserId field (Or User property in DDD world) What is the right way to store "user" data in couchdb in an "Application" document? With id for relation or to put the entire "user" object in "application" document? If i put the entire "user" object in Application document, updating an user will cause to update all Application documents that has an entire user info inside it. We' re little bit confused so i' ll be very happy to hear some ideas about that. Thank you.
