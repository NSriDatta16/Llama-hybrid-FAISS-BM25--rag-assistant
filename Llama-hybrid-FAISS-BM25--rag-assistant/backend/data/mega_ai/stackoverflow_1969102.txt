Peter Norvig's Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach is a good book on general AI and explains a lot about the basics, and there is a section on Back Propagation neural networks. To train your neural network you'll need datasets. There's THE MNIST DATABASE of handwritten digits , or the Pen-Based Recognition of Handwritten Digits Data Set at the UCI Machine Learning Repository The UCI ML repository has lots of great datasets, many of which would be good to train neural networks. Even if you don't know what they're about you can grab some and see if your ML system can do the classification tasks. Look at Classification tasks with a large number of attributes and instances , although you can try smaller ones too when you start out. By the way, there are a lot more techniques besides neural networks, including Support Vector Machines , which are popular.
