How can I stop Visual Studio 2010 from highlighting paragraphs?

I have to manually edit a bunch of HTML and ASP.NET pages that contain primarily content in tags. In VS2010, when I open such a page in the designer it insists on highilighting all the paragraphs; surrounding them with dotted blue rectangles and shading all other paragraphs. I find this annoying, can I turn these behaviours off? EDIT I managed to change the colours by going to Tools, Options, HTML Designer, View and editing the colours for "Layout UI activated border" and "Style application overlay".
