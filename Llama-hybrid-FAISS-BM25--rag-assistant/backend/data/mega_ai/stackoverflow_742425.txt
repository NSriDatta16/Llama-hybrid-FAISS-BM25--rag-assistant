Which .emacs -file would you give for a Vim veteran?

I have used Vim for coding. I want to learn Emacs too. I would like to export at least some of the following customizations in my .vimrc to my .emacs. My .vimrc let Tlist_Auto_Open = 1 " http://stackoverflow.com/questions/165231/vim-dvorak-keybindings-rebinding " Dvorak it! no d h no h j no t k no n l no s : no S : no j d no J D no l n no L N " Added benefits no - $ no _ ^ no N no ; z no T L no P P no p p let Tex_ViewRuleComplete_pdf = '/usr/bin/open -a Skim $*.pdf' set history=1000 set smartindent set autoindent set tabstop=4 set expandtab set shiftwidth=3 set softtabstop=4 set number set hlsearch syntax on set cursorline highlight CursorLine guibg=#400000 set ruler set textwidth=78 set foldcolumn=5 " REQUIRED.
