Imbalanced data to match reality with Random Forest?

I have a medical dataset which I am using select features to predict for 1 of 3 diseases. I have found that Random Forest works best for my dataset after testing out various combinations. The original data set was imbalanced towards one of the diseases, so I balanced the dataset with 33% of the dataset filled with each class. However, I know that in reality, roughly 70% of the population has disease 1, 20% disease 2, 10% disease 3. I was wondering if I should be matching my dataset class frequencies to match the reality distribution of diseases or keep the classes balanced with Random Forest and why?
