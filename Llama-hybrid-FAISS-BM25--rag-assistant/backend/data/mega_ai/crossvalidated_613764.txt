What does standard deviation mean in simple terms?

There are multiple sources to answer the above question. For example here it says Standard deviation tells us about the variability of values in a data set. It is a measure of dispersion, showing how spread out the data points are around the mean. So far so good, but I would like a clearer explanation with an example. For example I have a list of 65 values and when I calculate their average and std I got Average: 8.046153846153846 Std: 3.684557169927145 and I got a plot By looking at the plot we can see that it is almost always the value 10 but sometimes it varies. In this situation what does the data 3.68 (the std) give to understand the situation? And is there a better statistic to understand what is happening to the set?
