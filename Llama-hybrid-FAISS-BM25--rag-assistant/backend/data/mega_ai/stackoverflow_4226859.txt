look in arch/i386/boot and it's included Makefile. It's a bit dirty, but they do it there - sort of. It's for the boot portion, so it may not be in the "kernel proper". Have you concidered doing this inside a giagantic "asm" block in a .c file? The reason this is so uncommon in the kernel, is that the kernel is really meant to be processor independent. So aside for some very select areas, there is little assembly - and when there is - it's all done in "asm" blocks inside .c files.
