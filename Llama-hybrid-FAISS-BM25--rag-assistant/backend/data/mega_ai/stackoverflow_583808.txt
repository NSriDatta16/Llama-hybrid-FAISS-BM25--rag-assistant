Animation inside an adorner (calling OnRender)

I'm using an Adorner in .NET 3.5, and I'm able to draw by overriding OnRender, but I need the ability to redraw the adorner to change its appearance. Essentially I'm looking for a way to clear the drawing context and call OnRender again. What's the best way to do this, or is there a better approach? public class MyAdorner : Adorner { private Brush brush = Brushes.Red; public DragArrowAdorner(UIElement adornedElement) : base(adornedElement) {} public void RedrawWithBrush(Brush newBrush) { brush = newBrush; // redraw..? } protected override void OnRender(System.Windows.Media.DrawingContext drawingContext) { // some drawing code... drawingContext.DrawRectangle( brush, null, new Rect(AdornedElement.DesiredSize)); } }
