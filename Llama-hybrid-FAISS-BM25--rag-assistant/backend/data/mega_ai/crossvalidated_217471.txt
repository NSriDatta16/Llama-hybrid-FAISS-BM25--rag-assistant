Why does including $x\ln(x)$ interaction term in logistic regression model helps to assess linearity assumption?

In Discovering Statistics using SPSS 4th Edition by Andy Field, it was recommend to include the interaction term between the independent variable $x$ and its corresponding natural logarithm transform $\ln(x)$ variable to check for violation of the linearity assumption. What is the statistical theory behind this? This a quote from the book: This assumption can be tested by looking at whether the interaction term between the predictor and its log transformation is significant (Hosmer & Lemeshow, 1989). I've also recently found out that this transformation is called Box-Tidwell transformation.
