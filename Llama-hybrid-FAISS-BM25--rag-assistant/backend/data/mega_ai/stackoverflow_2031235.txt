I've done one major Silverlight app in the past. It has taught me that you shouldn't fight against the system. If I'm not mistaken, Silverlight itself uses the browser network layer to connect to the internet. So you can still leverage--and Silverlight still respects--things with proper cache-control headers and such. So just from my experience, I'd suggest that you try to make the server component (WCF server) do proper output-caching ala ASP.NET style and the network layer in Silverlight and the hosting browser will handle caching automatically for you. You may have better luck with RESTful WCF mode since you can leverage proper HTTP caching throughout, see this blog post: REST in WCF – Part X – Supporting Caching and Conditional GET for a start. This also makes your code less complex, since you don't have to add yet another complex layer to your system and tame it to work with the confusing XAML binding system.
