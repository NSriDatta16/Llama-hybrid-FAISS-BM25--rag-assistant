You seem to be doing it exactly right. In fact, there's a number of built-in / contrib macros which work similarly, say with-out-str or clojure.contrib.sql/with-connection . The latter is a rather key part of present day Clojure infrastructure, so whatever idioms it uses have been scrutinised by a lot of people. The important gotcha to keep in mind is that threads you launch while in scope of a bindings / with-bindings form do not inherit the rebound values for the vars in question; rather, they see the root bindings. If you want to propagate your bindings to worker threads / agents, either pass them on explicitly (as function arguments, say) or use bound-fn .
