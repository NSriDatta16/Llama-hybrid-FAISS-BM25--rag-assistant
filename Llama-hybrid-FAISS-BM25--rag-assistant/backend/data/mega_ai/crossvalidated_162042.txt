Understand order of time series

I am trying to build a time series model. I looked at the ACF/PACF and adf test of the series and thought that an ARMA(p,q) model will be suitable for the data. However when I run auto.arima(), it's showing the best model as ARMA(0,0). I am unable to understand how is this possible considering order 1 auto correlation to be 0.63. Attaching the acf/pacf plots . Appreciate any help on understanding the time series and suggestion on type of forecast model for this data. Thanks in advance ADF Test : Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test Dickey-Fuller = -6.2373, Lag order = 13, p-value = 0.01 alternative hypothesis: stationary > auto.arima(ConvPCT) Series: ConvPCT ARIMA(0,0,0) with non-zero mean Coefficients: intercept 0.0191 sigma^2 estimated as 0.0002188: log likelihood=6467.12 AIC=-12932.24 AICc=-12932.23 BIC=-12920.74 if I run an ARMA(1,1) model, this is what I get > Arima(ConvPCT,order=c(1,0,1)) Series: ConvPCT ARIMA(1,0,1) with non-zero mean Coefficients: ar1 ma1 intercept 0.9633 -0.7048 0.0191 s.e. 0.0076 0.0235 0.0018 sigma^2 estimated as 0.0001133: log likelihood=7227.76 AIC=-14447.52 AICc=-14447.5 BIC=-14424.53 Here are two links for the same data file filesave link and wikiupload link . For model building, we can consider instances > 6% as outliers
