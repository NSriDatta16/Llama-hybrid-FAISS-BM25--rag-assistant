SimpleDB is described as : The data model is simply: Large collections of items organized into domains. Items are little hash tables containing attributes of key, value pairs. Attributes can be searched with various lexicographical queries. MongoDB is a bit simpler : The database manages collections of JSON-like documents which are stored in a binary format referred to as BSON.
