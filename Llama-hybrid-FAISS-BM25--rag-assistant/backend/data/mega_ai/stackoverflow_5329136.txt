Handling click events in Google Maps JS API v3 while ignoring double clicks

With the Google Maps JS API v3, I want to drop a marker where the user clicks on the map, while keeping the default behavior when the user double clicks (and not adding any marker on the map). I thought about defining a timeout on click event. If a double click event is triggered within the next few milliseconds, the timeout is cancelled. If not, the marker is placed on the map when the timeout expires. But it doesn't really look like the best solution ever. Is there a more elegant way to handle this? Thanks.
