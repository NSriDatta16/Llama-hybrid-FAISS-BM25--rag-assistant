Drag and dropping using Raphael js

I'm trying to build a puzzle game in javascript, using raphael to take care of the drag and drop and rotation of the pieces. The problem I'm facing is: Whenever I rotate an image, its coordinate system is rotated as well and the drag and drop doesn't work anymore as expected. Edit2: Here is a simple test case. Drag around the ellipse, rotate it, and then try to drag again: http://www.tiagoserafim.com/tests/dragdrop.html Edit: To clarify, whenever I move 1 pixel with the mouse to the right (x++), the image also moves 1 pixel on the x-coord, but on its own coordinate system, that maybe rotate, as the image below shows. (source: oreilly.com ) As explained on SVG Essentials , this is the expected behavior. My question is: Is there an elegant way to do what I want, or I'll be forced to manually calculate the correct coords by using rotation matrix? Other JS libraries or suggestions will be very welcome, even if they mean losing the IE support.
