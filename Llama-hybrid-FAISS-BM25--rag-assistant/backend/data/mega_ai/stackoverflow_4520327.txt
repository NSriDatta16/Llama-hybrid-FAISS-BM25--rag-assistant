port forwarding with putty (tunneling)

I have a problem with my connection tunneling. So I'm using two ubuntu server virtual machines where the oracle xe (port 1521) is installed, lets call them uvm1 and uvm2. My goal is to create two tunnels for both servers and to map the ports to the host machine and make the connection to both database systems accessable. The port mapping should look like: vm name | vm port | host port ------------------------------- uvm1 | 1521 | 1521 uvm2 | 1521 | 1522 ------------------------------- For tunnel creation I'm using putty on my windows machine: the configuration of putty for connection to the uvm1 looks like: And the configuration of putty for connection to the uvm2 looks like: I'm able to connect via ssh to both of the machines. The strage issue is that my tunneling for uvm1 works and for the uvm2 not. Do anyone know how can I fix this strange issue?! Cheers, Kevin
