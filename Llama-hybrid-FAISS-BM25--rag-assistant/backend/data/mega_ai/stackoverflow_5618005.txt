also, there is 10.3 out there now. best to upgrade to latest version. Also Infragistics has "Version Utility" which allows you to upgrade your solution and projects to newer binaries easily (will update project references for you). but yeah as Slugster mentioned, you have 2 diffirent versions of infragistics dll in your solution and there is class name clashes.
