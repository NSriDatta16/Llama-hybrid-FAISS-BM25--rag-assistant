If $x$ are your independent variables then the output of the logistic regression, let's call it $l(x)$, is the predicted ''conditional'' probability , i.e. the predicted value of the probability conditional on that value of $x$. So if you have a very large number of subjects with the same value for $x$ then it is expected that a fraction $l(x)$ of these will be 'successes' (or 1).
