Not really, no. Though it's worth reading Eric Meyer's thoughts on this. Also, it appears that HTML5 1 includes the capacity for any element to become a link, so it might be worth using that doctype instead of xhtml, if possible. It's worth also adding that html 5 does allow for an element to enclose block-level elements, see: http://www.brucelawson.co.uk/2008/any-element-linking-in-html-5/ , example taken from the linked page: Instead of: Bruce Lawson as Obama's running mate! In answer to McCain's appointment of MILF, Sarah Palin, Obama hires DILF, Bruce Lawson, as his running mate. Read more! you can say: Bruce Lawson as Obama's running mate! In answer to McCain's appointment of MILF, Sarah Palin, Obama hires DILF, Bruce Lawson, as his running mate. Read more! Updated to mention possible inaccuracy 1: I may have misinterpreted part of the document to which I linked, having tried to find support for my claim that '...appears that HTML5...any element to become a link' (in the W3C's html 5 overview ) it doesn't seem to be there. I think I was over-encouraged when I saw Meyer's proposal to include that possibility. I'm too gullible, and naive... =/
