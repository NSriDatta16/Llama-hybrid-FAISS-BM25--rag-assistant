Solved this a couple of weeks ago - I thought that people might appreciate a solution. The problem was actually fairly easy to diagnose with a bit of proper detective work (thanks for the encouragement there, Justin). I went through the sequence of events, disabling all in turn, and found it wasn't anything to do with the ajax call. The problem was actually the jQuery animate function - the opacity fade I set on the content div was messing with the Google maps transparencies in IE. I'm betting money this is a common bug. Thanks to those who replied.
