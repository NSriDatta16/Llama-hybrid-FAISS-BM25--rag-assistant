Creating interaction terms

I am relatively new to statistical analysis and so please forgive me for any cumbersome language/explanations. I'm interested in how sex and race interact to affect the experience of discrimination in low income health care settings. I have two focal independent variables (sex and race/ethnicity) and I would like to create interaction terms for use in binary logistic regression in SPSS. Sex is a 0/1 dummy variable and race/ethnicity has 5 categories: non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic Asian, non-Hispanic "other" and Hispanic. So I would want interaction terms (in dummy variable form?) for each possible combination: white men, white women, Black men, Black women, Asian men....and so on. How should I best go about doing this? I've already constructed a single categorical variable "sex_race" but am not sure how to properly use it in logistic regression.
