R - grouping (clustering) time series data

I have some dummy time series data of transaction of different individuals in 2009: > str(sample_matrix_p) Classes ‘tbl_df’, ‘tbl’ and 'data.frame': 1212 obs. of 3 variables: $ obj_id : chr "aflg182184" "aflg182184" "aflg182184" "aflg182184" ... $ date : chr "2009-01" "2009-02" "2009-03" "2009-04" ... $ transaction: num 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ... obj_id is the individual id date is from 2009 Jan to Dec transaction is the count of transactions in that month Now I want to group or cluster the individuals by their transaction movement(trend, change, etc.) throughout the year 2009, is there any recommended algorithms and sample codes that work for such kind of data?
