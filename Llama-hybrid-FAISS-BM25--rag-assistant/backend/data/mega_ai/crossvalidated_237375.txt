The task of finding missing words in a text sometimes referred to as text imputation, or sentence completion. One paper exploring it with ANN: Solving Text Imputation Using Recurrent Neural Networks. Arathi Mani. CS224D report. 2016. http://cs224d.stanford.edu/reports/ManiArathi.pdf In this paper, we have shown that the bidirectional RNN yields the best Levenshetein and perplexity scores out of the three models tested for our missing data problem where we try to impute a single word into a sentence that is missing exactly one word from an unknown location. One paper comparing several approaches including RNN: Zweig, Geoffrey, John C. Platt, Christopher Meek, Christopher JC Burges, Ainur Yessenalina, and Qiang Liu.
