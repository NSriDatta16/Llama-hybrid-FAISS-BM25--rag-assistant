How to invert differencing in time series data if I am making multiple steps prediction?

I have a time-series that I would like to use for predicting 36 timesteps in advance using LSTM. It is not stationary so I differenced the series by subtracting each point from the next one. My understanding is that after the prediction, I will add each step to the previous one in the original series so I obtain the final prediction inverted and then evaluate it. However, when it comes to production (future forecast), this would only work if I am forecasting 1 time step so I simply add it to the last point in the original data, but with 36 points, there will be 35 points missing, so how do I invert the predicted values in this case?
