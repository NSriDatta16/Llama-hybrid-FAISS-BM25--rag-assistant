There is an auto generated = operator. When you do v1 = v2 that operator is used. At that point one of the "albert" instances becomes "bert". Try adding this function to Foo: Foo& operator = (const Foo& rval) { cout This is the same as the auto generated but prints out a debug message so you can see what is happening.
