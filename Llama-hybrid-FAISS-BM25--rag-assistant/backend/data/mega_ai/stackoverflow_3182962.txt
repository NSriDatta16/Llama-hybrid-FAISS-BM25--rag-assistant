Best Practice for Foreign Key column position in table

This might be a silly question, but here goes: Is there a standard or best practice that describes the order of foreign key column in a mssql table? I for one like the idea of the PK being the very first column in the table followed by all the foreign keys and then all other columns thats relevant to that table. Another way of doing it is having the PK as the very first column then all the supporting columns and then all foreign keys... I guess it really doesn't matter, but I would like to get a standard across my organisation.
