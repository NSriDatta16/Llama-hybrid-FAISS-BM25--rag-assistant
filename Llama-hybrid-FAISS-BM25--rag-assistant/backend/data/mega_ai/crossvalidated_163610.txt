Here is my tentative answer that I have currently. When I read the paper called: Agreement Between Two Independent Groups Of Raters written by Sophie Vanbelle and Adelin Alber (note: behind a paywall), I get the idea that independent raters that do not share any single rated instance together should be viewed as two different entities. They do not say this, but the authors note that there's almost no theory on independent rater groups that do have shared rated instances of data together. So I'm left with the choice of displaying two values and leave it at that or average them out (i.e. divide it by 2). The choice will hinge on brevity versus comprehensiveness.
