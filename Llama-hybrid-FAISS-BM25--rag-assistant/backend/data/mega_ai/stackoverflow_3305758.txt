Glad you were able to solve this. I am guessing that you had to "svn add" the folder again after deleting the ".svn" folder. This has the unfortunate side effect of blowing away the history for those files. In the future, when moving things using Tortoise, you should remember its most forgotten feature : right-click-drag. You should get in the habit of using right-click-drag when moving versioned files and folders around with Tortoise, because right-drag allows you to "svn move", "svn copy", or "svn add" the files/folders you are dragging. The key to working with Tortoise (and all svn clients, for that matter) is to remember that standard file system operations will confuse the hell out of svn. Any operations you do on your files must be done via the corresponding "svn" actions so that svn knows to keep track of the changes and preserve the history of the files/folders. If you work in an IDE, I would suggest using an svn plug-in for the IDE, because they tend to handle these issues very nicely for you. In MS land, there is VisualSVN , and in java land there is Subversive .
