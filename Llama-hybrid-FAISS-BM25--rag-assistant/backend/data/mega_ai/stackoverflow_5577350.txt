PDO : Insert query containing ' is not executing in SQLite3 with PHP 5.3.4 with

I am creating a blogging application using PHP5/SQLite3 . To insert a post in database I am executing query written below. $db=connectToDatabase(); $tempcontent=$db->escapeString($tempcontent); $query = "INSERT INTO posts VALUES (null,$temptitle, $tempcontent, $tempcategory, $tempauthor)"; $db->query($query); $db=disconnectToDatabase(); I am having problem when the text input contain ' or " . when there is ', the query is not getting executed at all . If ' is not there then " is displayed with escape (\") in browser . Sorry, I forgot to mention : connectTodatabase() function is providing very general way to connect to database. as : try { $db1 = new PDO("sqlite:blog.db"); }catch( PDOException $exception ){ die($exception->getMessage()); } return $db1;
