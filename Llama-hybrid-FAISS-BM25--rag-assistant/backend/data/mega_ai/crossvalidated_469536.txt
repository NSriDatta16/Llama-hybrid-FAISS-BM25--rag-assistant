Which algorithm is implemented in sklearn's SVM method?

I'd like to know which exact version of svm is implemented in slearn. The references section on sklearn's svm page cites libsvm package and a paper from 1999 which is about comparing classification error rate and likelihood scores. The libsvm paper talks about the original svm paper by Vapnik. But I couldn't figure out which exact formulation of svm has been implemented. The libsvm paper cites a paper titled Fast Training of Support Vector Machines Using Sequential Minimal Optimization that solves svm using a method called sequential minimal optimization. Is this the algorithm that sklearn actually calls under the hood or is it a different version of this method?
