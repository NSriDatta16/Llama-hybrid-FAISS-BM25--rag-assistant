RNNs generally work best with equally spaced time stamps. For example, the stock prices can be fed into an LSTM model every 2 days, and a Large Language Model takes in every single character. To do what you're suggesting, their are 2 solutions. Solution 1: Make a language model and train it off of your data. Then when you want to predict a date, you can input a date into the model. Ex: After inputting all your previous data, input "Date: '20-08-2021" and the model predicts the rest. This solution can predict multiple data points on the same date, but training a language model like this can be very difficult, and it might be worse at predicting correctly. Solution 2: If it is possible for you to have a single data point for each hour, then you can treat each hour as its own piece of data, but since you don't have data for every hour, leave certain hours empty. Ex: "Data1, Empty, Empty, Empty, Data2, Empty, Empty, Data3" You're going to have to structure your input and output layer to support the variables you want to predict.
