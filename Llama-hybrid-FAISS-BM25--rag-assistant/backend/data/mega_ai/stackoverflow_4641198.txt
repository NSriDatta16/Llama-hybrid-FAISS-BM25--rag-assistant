Infected compiler, or malfunction?

I've encountered something very strange, and things just don't add up. First of all, I posted this here because I'm not sure if this has anything to do with computer virusses at all. And if it does, could you please direct me to a place to find help? So now: I'm having some kind of weird problem here, both my anti virus and malwarebytes flag code* compiled with masm and masm examples as a virus. I've googled and found that this problem has occured before so I didn't take this too seriously and at first thought that it was a false-positive. But I compiled the code you see on the bottom of this post to test some other things of mine out. And I ran it through ollydbg (meanwhile ignoring my comodo anti-virus) and then I saw this: 00401000 > -E9 FBEF6F71 JMP 71B00000 ; this is a weird jump I did not put there 00401005 90 NOP 00401006 8BC0 MOV EAX,EAX 00401008 . 8BD8 MOV EBX,EAX 0040100A . 33D9 XOR EBX,ECX 0040100C . 8BC3 MOV EAX,EBX 0040100E . 03CB ADD ECX,EBX 00401010 . 33C3 XOR EAX,EBX 00401012 . 2BC1 SUB EAX,ECX 00401014 . 8BCB MOV ECX,EBX 00401016 . 33D9 XOR EBX,ECX The code below couldn't possibly compile into that jump, so I was stepping in to the code. And a while later I saw that the strange code began enumerating through api's in the ntdll.dll library. What's happening? If this is indeed a virus where to get help? But I'm still not sure, both comodo and malwarebytes flagg only the examples as viruses, but not the file (test.exe) as a virus Test code I was using to test... *: include \masm32\include\masm32rt.inc .data .code Start: nop nop nop nop nop nop mov eax, eax mov ebx, eax xor ebx, ecx mov eax, ebx add ecx, ebx xor eax, ebx sub eax, ecx mov ecx, ebx xor ebx, ecx invoke ExitProcess, 0h end Start Update: The code isn't on disk, but in memory, so it's probably a library of some sort doing this: Disassembly 00401000 start: 00401000 90 nop 00401001 90 nop 00401002 90 nop 00401003 90 nop 00401004 90 nop 00401005 90 nop And I've removed the invoke exit process and it's still there
