What is the average size of an HTTP request/response header?

I am working with an embedded platform that has 16MB of RAM only. And I need to deep packet filter HTTP streams. To prevent a Denial of Service attack on the device I'd like some statistical averages regarding HTTP stream sizes, specifically the HTTP header in particular.
