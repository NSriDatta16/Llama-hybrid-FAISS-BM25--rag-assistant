The default controller factory uses reflection to find all classes that derive from Controller , so no matter in which folder you put them, as long as they are public and derive from Controller it will work. But IMHO mixing views and controllers into the same folder is not a good idea. If it is a matter of organizing your controllers why not create subfolders in the Controllers folder?
