Need a way to present a prerequisites for an object

I don't really know how to explain this in a understandable way but here goes. The project I'm working on is a web application that revolves around courses, and each course have a set of prerequisites, the problem is that I don't know a good way to present these for the user. Example: To take course4, the person must have sold at least 600 products AND worked at least 90 days. She must also complete (Course1 OR Course2) AND Course 3. Any ideas on how I should present this for the users in a simple way for them to understand. And how would I then go about and save it. The project is being built in php for the back, html/jquery for the front and mysql as the storage. /S
