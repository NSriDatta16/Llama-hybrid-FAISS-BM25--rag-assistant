Best way to remove items from a collection

What is the best way to approach removing items from a collection in C#, once the item is known, but not it's index. This is one way to do it, but it seems inelegant at best. //Remove the existing role assignment for the user. int cnt = 0; int assToDelete = 0; foreach (SPRoleAssignment spAssignment in workspace.RoleAssignments) { if (spAssignment.Member.Name == shortName) { assToDelete = cnt; } cnt++; } workspace.RoleAssignments.Remove(assToDelete); What I would really like to do is find the item to remove by property (in this case, name) without looping through the entire collection and using 2 additional variables.
