Architectures that take inputs of mixed sampling rates

Let's say a model is trained on multiple datasets of 1D time series. These datasets have been gathered with different sampling rates. I plan to use a convolution neural network to process these time series for classification. My question is, in this scenario, are there any tricks I can do to the data or the model itself to make it "aware" of the sampling frequency? I've tried naively just training them together, and I'm getting an ok result. Are there any existing works? I tried googling but found nothing worth noting as of now. I'm hesitant about just resampling the data is I don't want to accidentally remove/introduce important information by making the method of interpolation a hyperparameter.
