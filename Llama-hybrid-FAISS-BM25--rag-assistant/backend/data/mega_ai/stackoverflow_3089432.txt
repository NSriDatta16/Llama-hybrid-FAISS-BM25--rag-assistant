There are some built-in options for this, on your .draggable() , set the revert option to 'invalid' , and it'll go back if it wasn't successfully dropped onto a droppable, like this: $("#draggable").draggable({ revert: 'invalid' }); Then in your .droppable() set what's valid for a drop using the accept option , for example: $("#droppable").droppable({ accept: '#draggable' });​ Anything not matching this selector gets reset when you let go, you can see a full demo here . The accept option also takes a function if you need filtering a selector can't provide, like this: $("#droppable").droppable({ accept: function(dropElem) { //dropElem was the dropped element, return true or false to accept/refuse it } });​
