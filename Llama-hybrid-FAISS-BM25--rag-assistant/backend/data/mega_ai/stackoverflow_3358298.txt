Git confusion - getting git repo on server after switch from svn

I have a 3 year old svn repo I just converted to git using git-svn. Then I cloned the new repo and want to copy it to a our main server (running ssh). The git project is organized like this: ~/server.com/ ~/server.com/.git ~/server.com/htdocs ~/server.com/includes etc. Following the instructions in the gitpro book, it says to use scp -r to copy it to the server, but I'm ending up copying the checked-out/cloned files, not just the git stuff, which I don't want (according to the book it should be "bare"). Do I just do "> scp -r ~/server.com/.git user@other.server:/path/to/git-files"? And then clone via "> git clone user@other.server:/path/to/git-files/server.com/.git"? Also, the repo's they toss around in the gitpro book are like "server.git"; is that just a naming convention?
