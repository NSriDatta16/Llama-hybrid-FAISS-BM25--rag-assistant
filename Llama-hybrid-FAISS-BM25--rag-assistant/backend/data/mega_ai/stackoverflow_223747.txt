See this related thread What is a good CI build process? You are on the right track. If you're using a decent CI tool, you should be able to set each setup up as a separate project that triggers the next step in the chain... i.e. sucessfull build triggers tests which trigger deployment which triggers integration etc This way your ealiest "break" stops the line so to speak. We use CruiseControl to build, unit-test, configure and deploy, run integration tests and code coverage, run acceptance tests, and package for release. This is with a system of 8 or so web services, and a dozen or so databases, all with interralated configuration and deployment dependencies with across multiple environments with different configurations (anythin from single boxes to redundent boxes for each component)
