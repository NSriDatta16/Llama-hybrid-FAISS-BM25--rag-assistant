Configuring a SQL Server (2008) Monitor Server

After having a period of logshipping failures going unnoticed (due to a stopped SQL Agent on the secondary server) I'm looking at configuring some monitoring. Having seen the ability to specify a "Monitor Server instance" on the SQL Server 2008 log shipping setup and the relavant MSDN docs ( http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb510705.aspx ), I'm keen to setup a "Monitor Server". However having trawled MSDN and google I actually can't find any information on how to configure a Monitor Server. At this point I don't even know what a monitor server is (i.e. is it just another SQL Server instance?)! Also, is this separate from the monitoring modules in SQL Server Management Studio? Any guidance or pointers to documentation would be much appreciated.
