It sounds weird, I suggest you to do the following: Try to access the CXML Link using your web browser ( to check the link is broken or not) Did you try to open your pivot CXML with Pivot Desktop Viewer? Maybe the CXML is not a Valid XML file, you can check it if it's valid or not by saving the cxml file.. rename it to .xml drag drop it over a Firefox window. If you get Yellow Screen that means the XML file is not well formed and you'll get the error details. Hope that helps you to solve your issue.
