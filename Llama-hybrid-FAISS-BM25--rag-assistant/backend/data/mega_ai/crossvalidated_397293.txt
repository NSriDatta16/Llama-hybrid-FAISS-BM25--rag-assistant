You already tagged your post with the logistic regression tag. That is precisely the answer. Observations with missing predictors do get dropped from the analysis. Is there something else you need clarification on? Edit: The UCLA website has a good guide to logistic regression in R. Your screenshot looks like the data display from RStudio. The UCLA website also has guides for SAS and Stata.
