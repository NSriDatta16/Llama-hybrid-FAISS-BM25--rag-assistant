DynamicData for asp.net mvc and dynamic data. On webforms I have only used the the asp.net validators approach. This doesn't mean to go copy-pasting all over custom validations you may have i.e. you add your own custom validators as needed and only on very special circumstances you use extra validators hooked to methods+scripts on the page. Depending on how you structure your code, I would expect to be able to leverage some of the infrastructure around DataAnnotations. I can't give it for a fact, you know the usual issues on asp.net something usually tied up to implementation details, worth a shot if there aren't better options. Update 1: a v. quick search gave: http://blogs.microsoft.co.il/blogs/gilf/archive/2010/04/08/building-asp-net-validator-using-data-annotations.aspx , which is rudimentary piece - but shows a way that you can leverage the data annotations on web forms (for the server side). Update 2: another one with the same approach as above, but does both server & client side validation: http://geeks.ms/blogs/rcarreras/archive/2010/04/20/validando-asp-net-web-form-con-dataannotation-en-ambos-lado-cliente-y-servidor.aspx . Again rudimentary, but certainly can be used as the basis to get a more complete automatic validation based on the annotations. Note: depending on what you use you can have the validators automatically added on the appropriate places, although I must warn that it might be tricky to get it to work well if you haven't worked with dynamically added validators before
