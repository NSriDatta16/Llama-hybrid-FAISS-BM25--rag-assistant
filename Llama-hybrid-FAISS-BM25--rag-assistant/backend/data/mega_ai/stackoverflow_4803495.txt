How to sort a collection in Magento?

I'm trying to sort a collection by attribute_id . I thought it would be easy, but I think I'm not using it correctly: $attributes = Mage::getResourceModel('eav/entity_attribute_collection') ->setOrder('attribute_id'); echo $attributes->getSelect(); Result: SELECT `main_table`.* FROM `eav_attribute` AS `main_table` Why isn't there any order by ?
