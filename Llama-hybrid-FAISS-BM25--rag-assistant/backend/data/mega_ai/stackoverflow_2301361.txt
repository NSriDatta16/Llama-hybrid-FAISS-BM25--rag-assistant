xcode build to iphone chooses old invalid provisioning profile

I've just gone through some pain with iphone and xcode upgrades and keychain failures etc and decided to uninstall xcode completely and re-install. This fixed my keychain issues however the project I am working on appears to be linked to an old invalid provisioning profile. I've deleted the profile from "Provisioning Profiles" in organiser, and removed it from Provisioning on the Iphone section of Organiser. However when I build an go with the iphone sdk rather than simulator i get the pop up "codesign wants to sign using key "OldKey" in your keychain". It appears the actual app is associated with the old key and I can't seem to find how to point it to the new valid one. Crazy thing is at some point I managed to get it to work and install but the application crashed and won't open. I've not managed to get it to install again. Any ideas?
