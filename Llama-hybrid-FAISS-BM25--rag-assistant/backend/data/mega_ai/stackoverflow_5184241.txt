Magento, custom product list

I made my own product list page based on Mage_Catalog_Block_Product_List: app/code/local/Mage/Catalog/Block/Product/Special.php: class Mage_Catalog_Block_Product_Special extends Mage_Catalog_Block_Product_List { /* Original contents */ /* Here I call addAttributeToFilter on product collection, and then... */ return $this->_productCollection; } I include this in a CMS page on the center column: The problem is: The product list shows up just fine, but I get no layered navigation in my left column. This is quite strange, since I am using exactly the same template as normal listings. A couple of things I have checked: Mage_Catalog_Block_Product_Special just being a proxy class. This doesn't work. Even if I use block type "catalog/product_list" on my CMS page I will not get a layered navigation. There are no extensions that are overriding crucial core classes. I have also tried to create my own module and list it under for example 'mycatalog'. This results in exactly the same problem. I have a feeling this has to do with trying to include a product listing on a CMS page but I have not been able to track down the exact problem. Any help on this would be very much appreciated.
