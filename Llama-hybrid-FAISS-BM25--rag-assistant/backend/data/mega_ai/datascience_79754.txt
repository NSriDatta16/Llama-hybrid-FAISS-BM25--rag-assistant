specs for professional-grade local machine

What are the expected specs for the local machine that a mid-tier data science professional would expect to find on their desk at work? I'm looking for very solid, but nothing extraordinary. To say a little more: if I were a professional data scientist training NLP and image recognition models locally over decently large (but still locally containable) datasets using Python, what are the minimum specs my machine would have these days? The last time I was doing anything like this, it was a 16GB minimum. Is it now 32, or 64? How many cores? Etc.
