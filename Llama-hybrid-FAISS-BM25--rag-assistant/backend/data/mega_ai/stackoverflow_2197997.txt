Scrum is not a development methodology, it is a project management methodology. Scrum is about managing workload and resources, and removing impediments to progress, and surfacing results at regular intervals to the whole team (including stakeholders). Think to yourself: could your dev/project teams benefit from a daily or bi-daily catchup meeting? when you have design or project meetings, do the wrong people hog all the attention? do you need to draw a distinction between various stake holders in a project? could your team benefit from an iterative process, where "releases" are done frequently (i.e. every 3 or 4 weeks), and bugs and features are carefully prioritised against each other by the product manager?
