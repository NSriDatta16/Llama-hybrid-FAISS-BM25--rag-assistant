Robots.txt: Is this wildcard rule valid?

Simple question. I want to add: Disallow */*details-print/ Basically, blocking rules in the form of /foo/bar/dynamic-details-print --- foo and bar in this example can also be totally dynamic. I thought this would be simple, but then on www.robotstxt.org there is this message: Note also that globbing and regular expression are not supported in either the User-agent or Disallow lines. The '*' in the User-agent field is a special value meaning "any robot". Specifically, you cannot have lines like "User-agent: bot ", "Disallow: /tmp/*" or "Disallow: *.gif". So we can't do that? Do search engines abide by it? But then, there's Quora.com's robots.txt file: Disallow: /ajax/ Disallow: /*/log Disallow: /*/rss Disallow: /*_POST So, who is right -- Or am I misunderstanding the text on robotstxt.org? Thanks!
