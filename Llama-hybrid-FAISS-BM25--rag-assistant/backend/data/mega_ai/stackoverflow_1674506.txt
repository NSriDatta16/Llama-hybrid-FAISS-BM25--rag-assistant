How to teach Design Patterns to a team

I'm a huge fan of the classic Design Patterns book. I very diligently worked to learn most patterns and how they are used (and when they should be avoided). However, I frequently encounter teams where I am the only one touting the book on a regular basis. I was hoping that learning this book would make it easier to explain concepts to other developers, but most have yet to invest the time to learn such topics. These are major systems that need a solid architecture. I don't want to constantly say "read the book". How do I encourage the regular use of design patterns without coming across as pompous? Has anyone been successful in having an entire team learn and use design patterns?
