Transparent pictureboxes flickers when moved with mouse

I have made a card game built of pictureboxes. The empty places a card can be put in is an empty picture box with a transparent background and a 3d border. And then I have a current card which is also a picturebox which is moved by a MouseMove event. As soon as I drag a card over the transparent PictureBoxes there is a card left all over the place where the card has been until I stop the mouse and let the picture refresh. This is also the case when I have the background of the current card set to transparent although a card is set to be the image (so it does not really matter there as it goes away if I set the background to green). Is there any workaround for this? I tried DoubleBuffered but with no success. Thanks!
