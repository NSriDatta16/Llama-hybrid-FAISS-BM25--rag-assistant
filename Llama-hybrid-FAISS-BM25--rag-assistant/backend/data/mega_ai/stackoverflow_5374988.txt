I was also looking for this information. GC stands for garbage-collector, which collects unused objects during runtime of your app. GC_EXTERNAL_ALLOC : Means that the VM is trying to reduce the amount of memory used collectable objects, to make room for non-collectable objects. GC_FOR_MALLOC : Means that the GC was triggered because there wasn't enough memory left on the heap to perform an allocation. Might be triggered when new objects are being created. GC_CONCURRENT : Triggered when the heap has reached a certain amount of objects to collect. I am guessing that the 38% free means that 38% of the heap is unused. 8772K would be the size of the used memory on the heap and 14087K would be the size of the heap. I donÂ´t know, sorry. Please note that all of this information is based on a post from Robert on a similiar question posted here on stackoverflow. All credit (as long as this is correct) goes to Robert.
