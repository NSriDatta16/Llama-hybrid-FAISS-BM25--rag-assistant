Statistical testing a set of test performances

Suppose I have the average test results for 7 topics (A, B, C, D, E, F) as percentages (avg performance on A is 90%, B is 80%, etc...). I'm looking to analyze these results in a number of different ways, and although I've taken a number of statistics courses, I want to be careful applying what I've learned to a new problem. The main questions I'm looking to have answered are: Is there a statistically significant variation between groups? (and thus I'd use a one-way ANOVA test) If so, which group(s) is/are significantly different? (this one is a bit harder... not sure how I would analyze this) I'd like to plot CIs for each group, how should I begin to construct these? Overall, what other methods are at my disposal/am I forgetting?
