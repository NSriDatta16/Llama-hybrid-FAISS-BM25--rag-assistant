You can analyze data like this using logistic regression. The Success variable is the response variable, then you have an indicator (0/1) variable representing country as one of the predictors, then income (and any other variables that you want to adjust for) as an additional predictor. The test on the coefficient for country will be the test comparing proportions between the 2 groups adjusting for the other terms in the model. Do be aware of the Hauk-Donner effect where very strong effects can be seen as not significant due to an overestimate of the standard error.
