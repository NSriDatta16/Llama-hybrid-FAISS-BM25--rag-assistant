Sounds like the outbound message is hitting the timeout. Other users have reported timeouts as low as 10 seconds (see forum link below). The sandbox instance that I use (cs1) is timing out after about 1 minute, from my testing. It's possible that the timeout is an organization or instance level setting that Salesforce controls. Two things you could try: Open a support ticket with Salesforce to see if they can increase the timeout value for outbound messages. From my experience, there are lot of settings that they can modify on the organization level - this might be one of them. Offload processing of your data, so that the ACK is sent immediately back to Salesforce. Then the actual processing of your data will take place asynchronously. ie. Message queue, separate thread, etc. Some other resources that might be helpful: related Salesforce forum discussion Outbound messaging documentation
