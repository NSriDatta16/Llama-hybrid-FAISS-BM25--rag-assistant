An ambiguity in SVM equations about misclassified data

I have encountered an ambiguity in SVM equations. As is stated in Chris Bishop's machine learning book, the optimization goal in SVM is to maximize this function: $$C\sum\limits_{n = 1}^N {{\xi _n}} + {1 \over 2}{\left\| w \right\|^2}$$ Subject to this constraints(*): $${\xi _n} \ge 0$$ $${t_n}y({x_n}) \ge 1 - {\xi _n}$$ where: $$y({x_n}) = {w^T}{x_n} + b$$ so the corresponding Lagrangian function for this problem is: $$L(w,b,a) = C\sum\limits_{n = 1}^N {{\xi _n}} + {1 \over 2}{\left\| w \right\|^2} - \sum\limits_{n = 1}^N {{a_n}\{ {t_n}y({x_n}) - 1 + {\xi _n}\} - } \sum\limits_{n = 1}^N {{\mu _n}{\xi _n}} $$ and the corresponding KKT conditions are given by (**): $${a _n} \ge 0$$ $${{t_n}y({x_n}) - 1 + {\xi _n}} \ge 0$$ $${a_n}({t_n}y({x_n}) - 1 + {\xi _n}) = 0$$ $${\xi _n} \ge 0$$ $${\mu _n} \ge 0$$ $${\mu _n}{\xi _n} = 0$$ And if we set $${{\partial L} \over {\partial {\xi _n}}} = 0$$ we get (***) $${a_n} = C - {\mu _n}$$ As we know, that subset of data points that have $${a_n} = 0$$ are not support vectors. But for this data points we have (from ***): $${\mu_n} = C$$ and therefore (from **) $${\xi _n} = 0$$ So here lies the problem. If a data point from this subset is in the wrong side of the decision boundary, then $${t_n}y({x_n}) \le 0$$ and we will have (from *) $${\xi _n} \ge 1$$ which is in an obvious conflict with $${\xi _n} = 0$$
