Since your dependent variable (W) is Binary, you could consider the Logistic Regression approach . The Logistic Regression coefficients are in terms of log-odds and you can easily derive the odds or probabilities from these coefficients. Logistic Regression allows you to estimate Marginal Effects . These can help you understand the effect of STEM on the probability of W (having wages in the top quartile). For example in Stata software, you can easily accomplish this using " mfx " command after logistic regression. The interpretation of marginal effects is the change in probability of W if the individual has a STEM degree. Suppose the marginal effect of STEM is estimated to be 0.2, it means that the probability of having Wages in the top quartile increases by 0.2 if the individual has a STEM degree. For locations, you could consider including dummy variables for locations. The upside of this is that you can estimate the marginal effects/probabilities and their effects on W for each location separately. The downside is that it will introduce a lot of coefficients in your model and restrict degrees of freedom. You will need a bigger dataset for this.
