Netbeans 6.7.1's Maven support is quite good and comes out of the box with the IDE. The Eclipse addon was frustrating enough that I gave Netbeans another try. A third choice besides ChssPly76's options is to use Ant with the Maven Ant Tasks . I don't know if I'd call any of these solutions particularly "elegant," but they do spare you the need to manage your own lib/ directory and classpath variables.
