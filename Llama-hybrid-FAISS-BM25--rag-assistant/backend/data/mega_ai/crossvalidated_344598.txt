Visualize multiple times series in R

I'm writing a seminar paper about the topic of forecasting NO2 (h=2) data. My dataset includes 130 timeseries (balanced panel) from 2010 to 2012. At the moment I'm struggling to find a suitable way to visualize that large data set in R. My goal at this stage of my paper is to do explorative/descriptive monitoring of those series (ACF/PACF, time series plots and component plost). For example I try to examine if characteritics of the time series change over time. Already, I read the "Forecasting: Principles and Practice" book by Rob J Hyndman and George Athanasopoulos and Roger D. Peng's paper "A Method for Visualizing Multivariate Time Series Data". Unfortunately I still need your advice on the topic.
