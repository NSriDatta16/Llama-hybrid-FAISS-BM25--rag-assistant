There's no really performance differences between a call with GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP and GL_TRIANGLES . Now if you can rearrange your indices for maximizing post-transform vertex cache, you can have huge performance gains. I did so years ago for rendering large terrain patches and observed 10 to 15 times FPS speedups (using some kind of Hilbert curve scheme).
