Machine learning method for predicting years ahead

Let's say I have Antarctic temperature data for 2020-2023, and based on this data I would like to forecast the temperature for the following years. Which machine learning method will allow me to predict years ahead? For what period forward could I generally forecast in order for the results to be satisfactory and probable? Or should I collect data from the year 2000 onward and start building the model then? * it would be great if you could recommend me a library for R with this method.
