Your concerns are legitimate. Scenario 1 is valid, but unless you have a very large number of people in your group, your results won't reflect "real" difference or they might be biased. For example, the first time you take heart rate, the subject are stressed by the procedure and all have a very high heart rate. By taking more than one measurement, you reduce that bias. Scenario 2 is better, altought by making a mean you lose information. You might be more precise in your evaluation of heart rate, but you won't take into consideration all the heart rates possible in the 2 groups. I usually use scenario 3 but the way you describe the analysis is pseudoreplication. I recommend the classic ecological article of Hulbert, to read on the subject : Hurlbert, S. H. 1984. Pseudoreplication and the design of ecological field experiments. â€” Ecol. Monogr. 54: 187-211. Now, there is a way to use all the information and not being pseudoreplicated. You can use a mixed model (so basically, an ANOVA), with in the fixed terms the group and in the random term, the ID of the subject. I hope I used the correct terms, as sometimes I get mixed up. If someone see a mistake, please correct me.
