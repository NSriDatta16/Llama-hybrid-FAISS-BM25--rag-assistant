Any way to extend or modify drag-and-drop in Outlook with VSTO?

I have an add-in I'm working on in Outlook that relies on drag-and-drop to save an Outlook file to a file automagically. The problem is that the default behaviour is to use the email's subject line as the filename, and emails with extremely long subject lines send an error as there's not enough space in 250 characters to store all of it plus the rest of the path. I'd like to change Outlook's drag and drop to Explorer so that the default filename is kept to the subject line cut to say 100 characters. Any pointers on where I'd go about doing this?
