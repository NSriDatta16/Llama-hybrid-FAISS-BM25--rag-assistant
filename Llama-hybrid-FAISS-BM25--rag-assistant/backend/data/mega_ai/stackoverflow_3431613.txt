Defining the global pointer static results in the C++ compiler creating a separate pointer for every translation unit, the definition is included in. I'm pretty sure it's not what you want and it's the cause of your problems. You should declare it extern in a header and define once in one cpp file. I can imagine the confusion came from the way, static keyword works inside a class or a struct definition. Indeed, it works differently there and it creates one variable, common for all instances of the class or struct . Btw. In case you actually want a variable to be visible only in one translation unit the recommended way is to put ii into an anonymous namespace. static works too, but it's use is discouraged as deprecated.
