How do I make a client-side helper class in Silverlight?

In Silverlight, I call my Silverlight-enabled WCF service asynchronously to retrieve, say, a list of values for a combobox. On the server, I cache these values for performance. But I want to cache them on the client to prevent the unnecessary round-trip. Now, I understand how to use local storage to cache them except that I do not want all of the "if in local storage, return local storage values else get values from server asynchronously" stuff in the code-behind of my xaml app. So, I tried moving that code to a helper class but the async calls need a callback which is where I get lost. I tried passing a generic EventHandler into my helper class but the helper class method really needs to be static. So, that is throwing me off. Will my helper method need to be non-static, and, if so, do I need to worry about thread safety? Aaarh! Too many questions! Haha. Anyway, I bet some smart person out there can tell me a better way to approach this almost immediately! Thanks in advance.
