How does sklearn random forest use features in the form of 1D/2D array instead of a single value during splitting at a node?

For the training of random forest model in sklearn, I understand that for features of a single value, a threshold for splitting the data is determined by minimizing the Gini impurity or maximizing information gain. However, how does the split happen when the given feature is an array of values (e.g. an image with calculated edges, etc.). Is it just calculating a thresholding value for each element of that array (i.e., each pixel)? Or are there any considerations of the relationships between different elements across the array like it is with convolutional neural networks?
