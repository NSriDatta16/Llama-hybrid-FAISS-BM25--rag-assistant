How to use a "Rocks" cluster

I've just joined a research lab at my University and been given access to a Cluster to compile and run the c++ code that I write. I use SSH to access it and simply use the cluster like a Linux terminal. I often have to wait a relatively long time while my code runs. I'm trying to figure out if there's a more efficient way use the Cluster. For example, there are different CPUs/Nodes in the cluster, some of which are more in use and others less in use. How do I access a specific CPU? I have access to the "Ganglia" overview page which gives information about the different Nodes. Also, if I run 2 processes in a different SSH windows will it automatically use different processors or nodes, or do I have to manually specify that. I couldn't find any documentation to help me with these issues, so I'd appreciate a little help. Thanks
