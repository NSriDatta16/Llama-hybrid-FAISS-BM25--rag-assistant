I've managed to reproduce this bug. A vimscript which will conduct an entertaining historical reenactment for your debugging pleasure is available at http://gist.github.com/427303 . In case some hooligan decides to revise the gist with Balzac quotations, I'll link to the current revision as well. At this point it seems to be pretty clearly a bug, so I'll go ahead and report it. I'll reference this post in the bug report, so any further information reported here should be useful to the debuggers. I'm running the vim-gnome package, version '2:7.2.330-1ubuntu3'. In case something is totally screwy with my vim install, here's the output from the 'analysis' window that my script creates: change: Initial setup line [foldlevel: contents]: 0: ' first section' 1: ' first subsection' 2: '' 0: 'second section' 0: ' second subsection' change: Indent the empty-line-delimited last section line [foldlevel: contents]: 0: ' first section' 1: ' first subsection' 2: '' 0: ' second section' 1: ' second subsection' change: Delete the empty line line [foldlevel: contents]: 0: ' first section' 1: ' first subsection' 2: ' second section' 1: ' second subsection' change: Fold things in a way that demonstrates the bug line [foldlevel: contents]: 0: ' first section' 1: ' first subsection' 2: ' second section' 1: ' second subsection' edit This is a known issue .
