create linked resource for embedding Google map in mail

I have used Google static map and created linked resource and embedded it in email and sending the mail to all users. I send a request to Google server and convert the response as stream and then created linked resource using that stream.

I want to prevent this, only for the first time the request has to be sent to Google and i have to store that response stream and use it to create linked resource. How to do this?
