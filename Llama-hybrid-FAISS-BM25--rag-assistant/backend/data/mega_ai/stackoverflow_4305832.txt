You can either explicitly call Save() on the settings or wait for the app to close normally and then they will be saved automatically. As a general rule I'd suggest always explicitly saving settings once you change them. (Unless you have a very good reason not to.) What's happening in your situation is that you are pressing the start button which causes your app to tombstone. When you launch a new instance of the app the tombstoned version is destroyed without all the code which normally runs on application close (including auto-saving settings) being executed. Here's and example of using Save: var settings = IsolatedStorageSettings.ApplicationSettings; if (settings.Contains("some-key")) { settings.Remove("some-key"); } settings.Add("some-key", "my-new-value"); settings.Save();
