In Eclipse 3.4 do Drag the jar file in question into a Java project. A copy of the jar file appears. Right click on the jar file, and choose "Build Path" -> "Add to Build Path". Jar file is moved to "Referenced Libraries" node, where it can be opened and navigated in the Project Explorer pane. If seeing source code too is an issue, open a new question. For navigation on Jar-file level (as a zip file) I use 7zip which works very well, and allows seeing and editing entries which is great for trouble shooting.
