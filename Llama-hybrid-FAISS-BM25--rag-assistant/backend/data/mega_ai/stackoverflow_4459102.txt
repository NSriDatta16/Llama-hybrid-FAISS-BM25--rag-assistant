Robert was Right, there is an option called : Enable UTF-8 support for mailto:protocol in Outlook @ Tools > Options > Mail Format > International Options > [x] Enable UTF-8 support for mailto:protocol I enabled that option and it worked in the client's machine, Although I wouldn't expect ppl to change their machine's outlook config to support my web app, but it seems that this is the only way possible right now, I am open to more suggestions though
