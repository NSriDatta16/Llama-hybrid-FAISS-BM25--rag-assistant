How to test statistically whether my network (graph) is a "small-world" network or not?

A small-world network is a type of mathematical graph in which most nodes are not neighbors of one another, but most nodes can be reached from every other by a small number of hops or steps. Specifically, a small-world network is defined to be a network where the typical distance L between two randomly chosen nodes (the number of steps required) grows proportionally to the logarithm of the number of nodes N in the network, that is $$ L \approx \log(N) $$ This relationship between L and N is a "thumb-rule". I'm looking for a more professional determination of small-world graphs for my research. How can I test whether my graph is a small-world graph or not? The small-world experiment comprised several experiments conducted by Stanley Milgram and other researchers examining the average path length for social networks of people in the United States. The research was groundbreaking in that it suggested that human society is a small-world-type network characterized by short path-lengths. The experiments are often associated with the phrase "six degrees of separation", although Milgram did not use this term himself. Thank you in advance.
