mmap and malloc may fail due to lack of physical memory (RAM + swap). In general, the Unix standard speaks of address ranges that are "allowed for the address space of a process". Apart from that, If a function be advertised to return an error code in the event of difficulties, thou shalt check for that code, yea, even though the checks triple the size of thy code and produce aches in thy typing fingers, for if thou thinkest ``it cannot happen to me'', the gods shall surely punish thee for thy arrogance. ( Spencer )
