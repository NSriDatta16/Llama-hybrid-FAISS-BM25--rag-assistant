The local folder is for modules that only you will use. The community folder is for modules that will eventually be packaged and made available (or sold) to the magento community. Any modules you download and install are placed in the community folder. Magento doesn't really care where your module is, the distinction is there mainly to keep modules organized. In any case since it's easy to switch from one to another it shouldn't really bother you all that much. If you don't know which category your module belongs in, you can start in the local folder and if it is to be published, you can move it to the community folder later.
