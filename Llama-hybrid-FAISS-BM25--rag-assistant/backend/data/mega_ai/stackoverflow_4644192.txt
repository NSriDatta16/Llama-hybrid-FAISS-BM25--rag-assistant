How do I access my ComboBoxes inside of a GridViewColumn HeaderTemplate?

I found a way to template the embedding of controls within the column headings of a GridView. However I do not know how to find the controls using my code behind to fill them up with items. I have figured out how to respond to an event raised from the embedded control and determine which column it was in. Otherwise I don't know how to get a reference to the embedded ComboBoxes. Some code to give you an idea: And in the code-behind: GridView grdView = new GridView(); for (int column = 1; column If every ComboBox had the same list of items to choose from using data binding that would be fine as long as I could select unique values for each column.
