The $z$-test vs the $\chi^2$-test for comparing the odds of catching a cold in 2 groups

I just read in a rather well-respected (popular) science magazine (the German PM, 02/2013, p.36) about an interesting experiment (without a source, unfortunately). It caught my attention because intuitively I doubted the significance of the result, but the information provided was sufficient for reproducing the statistical testing. The researchers wondered whether getting cold in cold weather increases the odds of catching a cold. So they randomly split a group of 180 students into two groups. One group had to hold their feet into cold water for 20 minutes. The other kept their shoes on. Kind of a funny manipulation, I think, but on the other hand I am not a doctor and maybe doctors think funny. Ethical issues aside. Anyways, after 5 days, 13 of the students in the treatment group had a cold, but only 5 in the group that kept their shoes on. The odds ratio of this experiment thus is 2.87. Given the rather small sample size, I started wondering if this difference may be significant. So I conducted two tests. First a simple test of equality of proportions using the normal approximation. This test has $z=1.988$ with $p=0.0468$. My guess is that this is what the researchers tested. This is truely just significant. However this z-test is only valid in large samples, if I am not mistaken, due to the normal approximation. Furthermore, the prevalence rates are rather small and I wonder whether this may not affect the coverage rate of the confidence interval of the effect. So my second try was a chi-square test of independence, both with Monte-Carlo simulation and standard Pearson Chi-square. Here I find p-values both about $p=.082$. Now that's all not so reassuring about the results. I wondered if there are more options to test this data and what your thoughts on the two tests are (in particular the assumptions of the first, significant, test)
