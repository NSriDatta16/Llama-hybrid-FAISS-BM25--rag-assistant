How to reorganize the repository after deleting and renaming folders?

I had solution which consisted of two projects - ProjectName and ProjectName v2.0 At the beginning I didn't use the version control so I duplicated everything (copied Project name and named it ProjectName v2.0). After a while I started to use Git and added the folder v2.0 (Git add "ProjectName v2.0"). Later on I deleted the original folder (ProjectName) and renamed ProjectName v2.0 to ProjectName. Now when I run Git it displays notifications: deleted:.... Does anyone know what is the best way to reorganize the repository in order not to display these messages in this case? Thanks!
