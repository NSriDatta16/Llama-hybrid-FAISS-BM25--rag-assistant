Dynamic Time Warping might be a good choice if you are explicitly trying to use one time series to predict another. This method works by means of determining similarity between two sequences which vary, typically in either time or speed. From looking at your time series, it would not appear (at least visually) that there is a lag between the two time series, but this would need to be investigated further. Calculating the cross-correlation between the two time series would also be advised. There is quite an interesting paper in which the author uses DTW to predict US recessions using Treasury term spread data. It may prove useful in informing what you are trying to accomplish. You can find that here: Predicting US Recessions: A Dynamic Time Warping Exercise in Economics
