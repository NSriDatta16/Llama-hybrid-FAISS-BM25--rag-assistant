Toy regression question with latent variables

I originally asked this on a machine learning site, but one of the responses made me think that maybe this site is more suitable. Suppose you have two weighted coins, and every day you flip each one a number of times and record the total number of heads. So on the tenth day you might have flipped coin A 106 times, coin B 381 times, and recorded 137 heads. Supposing your goal is to figure out the weights of each coin, is it reasonable to just regress the number of heads on the number of flips for each coin? E.g, something along the lines of: num_heads ~ num_flips_A + num_flips_B + intercept However,it doesn't seem to make sense to have an intercept term in this scenario (it is negative for my data, which is confusing), so I tried subtracting out -1 from the formula, and it seemed to yield reasonable results. My first question is whether this approach is a good one. Now, suppose that you suspect the existence of a third coin, C, that someone else is flipping unbeknownst to you, and the heads for that coin are getting mixed up in your count. The number of flips for this coin are not recorded, but you do not particularly care about its weight - it's more of a confounding factor. Then would it be reasonable to fit a similar regression, but constrain the intercept to be positive? Thanks for any help
