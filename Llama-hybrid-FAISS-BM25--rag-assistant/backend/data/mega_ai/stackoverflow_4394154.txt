Use rails and push the data (1 row every 10 minutes right?) and let it generate the primary key (slow to load in your historical data). Then you can create another table with date/time - in 10 minute increments and voila you've got part of the structure ;). If you swizzle the data as you load to take advantage of the XXXX_id relationships you can leverage all the rails goodness.
