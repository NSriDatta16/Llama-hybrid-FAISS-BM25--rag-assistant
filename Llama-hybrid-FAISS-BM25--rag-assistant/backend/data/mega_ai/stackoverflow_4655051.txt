You shouldn't literally delete a node in Python. If nothing points to the node (or more precisely in Python, nothing references it) it will be eventually destroyed by the virtual machine anyway. If n is a node and it has a .next field, then: n.next = n.next.next Effectively discards n.next , making the .next field of n point to n.next.next instead. If n is the node before the one you want to delete, this amounts to deleting it in Python. [P.S. the last paragraph may be a bit confusing until you sketch it on paper - it should then become very clear]
