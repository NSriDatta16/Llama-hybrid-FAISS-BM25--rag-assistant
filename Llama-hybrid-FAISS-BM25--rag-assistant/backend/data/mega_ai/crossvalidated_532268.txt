Log convex function is actually log concave (Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning)

In Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning Ch 6.4.6 at the bottom of page 316 the author states that $p(a_N|t_N)$ is log convex. The author states that: $$-\nabla \nabla \Psi(a_N)=W_N+C_N^{-1}$$ is positive definite which I agree with. The negative of a positive definite matrix is negative definite. So the Hessian of $\Psi(a_N)$ is negative definite. Therefore $\Psi(a_N)$ is concave. We have $\Psi(a_N)=log(p(a_N|t_N))$ Therefore $p(a_N|t_N)$ is log concave not log convex, since the logarithm of $p(a_N|t_N)$ is concave. A log convex function is also convex, so if $p(a_N|t_N)$ were log convex it would also be convex which doesn't make sense since it is a probability distribution and it doesn't agree with the next statement in the book that it has a global maximum. I couldn't find this in listed errata online.
