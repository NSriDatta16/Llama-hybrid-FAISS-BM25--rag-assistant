A static class is basically the same as a non-static class, but there is one difference: a static class cannot be instantiated. In other words, you cannot use the new keyword to create a variable of the class type. Because there is no instance variable, you access the members of a static class by using the class name itself. public static class Storage { public static string filePath { get; set; } } in this,the class need not to be instantiate.so same with the filepath ,it will occupy unique value of class Storage for all object. public class Storage { private void Storage {}; public static string filePath { get; set; } } in this,the class is non static,need to be instantiate
