combining two select statements to return one result

I need to combine the results for two select queries from two view tables, from which I am performing calculations. Perhaps there is an easier way to perform a query using if...else - any pointers? Essentially I need to divide everything by 'ar.time_ratio' under the condition in sql query 1, and ignore that for query 2. SELECT gs.traffic_date, gs.domain_group, gs.clicks/ar.time_ratio as 'Scaled_clicks', gs.visitors/ar.time_ratio as 'scaled_visitors', gs.revenue/ar.time_ratio as 'scaled_revenue', (gs.revenue/gs.clicks)/ar.time_ratio as 'scaled_average_cpc', (gs.clicks)/(gs.visitors)/ar.time_ratio as 'scaled_ctr', gs.average_rpm/ar.time_ratio as 'scaled_rpm', (((gs.revenue)/(gs.visitors))/ar.time_ratio)*1000 as "Ecpm" FROM group_stats gs, v_active_ratio ar WHERE ar.group_id=gs.domain_group and SELECT gs.traffic_date, gs.domain_group, gs.clicks, gs.visitors, gs.revenue, (gs.revenue/gs.clicks) as 'average_cpc', (gs.clicks)/(gs.visitors) as 'average_ctr', gs.average_rpm, ((gs.revenue)/(gs.visitors))*1000 as "Ecpm" FROM group_stats gs, v_active_ratio ar where not ar.group_id=gs.domain_group
