Conv or regressions to generate newspapers clips coords

I'm new to this community and to machine learning/deep learning so this question might be very basic or maybe I'm barking to the wrong tree. I'm trying to automate a very manual process which is newspaper clipping . This process requires a person going through a newspaper in .PDF format and marking with some tools where each article is in every page of the newspaper. I end up having a file with ordered coordinates that frame every article's shape, location on the page, etc. I have been studying convolutional neural networks for this since it looks like an image processing problem. However, I have seen that CNN are able to tell what's in the image without saying where it is. I am about to working on the model and start training with all the data I have, however, something tells me that this is not the right approach or there's something missing, I don't see how it will be possible for the CNN to output the coordinates, considering that they need to be: in a certain order to delimit the article's shape accurate enough so it doesn't clip the articles incorrectly If someone could point me in the right direction and give me some guidance + suggestions, that would be very much appreciated.
