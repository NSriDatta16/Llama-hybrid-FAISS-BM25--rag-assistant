I think that by using where (ID = @ID or @ID is null) you are getting a sub optimal plan. Divide this into 2 separate queries so that in the case where @Id is not null it will just look it up directly and you will get a seek rather than a scan appear in the plan. You could maybe create a View with the columns you require to avoid the repetition (i.e. the Query without any where clause) select ID, AppID, AgentID, AgentLogin, Ext, VDN, VDNName, Skill, SkillName, CallFrom, TelNoFrom, ParentCallID, CallStart, ACWStart, CallEnd, Outcome, StageID, TxTo, TxSuccess, ServiceID, DiallerID, CRC, TSCallID, CallDirection, [Manual], CallBackAgent, CallBackDateTime, Notes from P_Call
