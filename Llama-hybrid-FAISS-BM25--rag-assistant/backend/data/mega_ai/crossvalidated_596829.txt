It depends on what you mean by "How many covariates you can add to your model?". Firth logistic regression will run and produce some results with a very large number of covariates. That doesn't mean that the results will make a lot of sense or that the point estimates would be particularly close to what you'd get with much larger sample sizes (of course the confidence intervals you'd get would already suggest that). The paper you cite does not say a lot of covariates would work when you only have 26 cases, the paper says that to some extent more than 2 covariates might well be okay when you use Firth (but that total sample size also matter, which is again very small for you) and that the topic is poorly understood (i.e. we can't totally be sure). That's all before we consider that you seem to be doing model building, which adds even further instability to your results / makes any model "testing"/"validation" on the same data very questionable (in any case, that's not what pilot projects are usually intended for). The best practice here might be to collect a lot more data to assess the model (or to even build a more stable one) with a well-planned and pre-specified validation strategy. I cannot think of a situation where trying one covariate at a time has much of a justification/logic behind it, or would be expected to do something useful.
