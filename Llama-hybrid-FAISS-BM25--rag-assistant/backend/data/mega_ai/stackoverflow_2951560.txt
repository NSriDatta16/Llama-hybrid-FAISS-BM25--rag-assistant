iPhone touch screen events

in iPhone SDK there are touchesBegan, touchesEnded and touchesMoved functions that are called when a touch event appears. My problem is that when I put a finger on the screen and I'm not moving it there is no way to know if there is a finger on the screen or not. Is there a way to get current touch screen state? In any of touchesBegan, touchesEnded and touchesMoved functions I can use fallowing code to know the state for every touch, but outside them I can't:| NSSet *allTouches = [event allTouches]; for(GLuint index = 0; index
