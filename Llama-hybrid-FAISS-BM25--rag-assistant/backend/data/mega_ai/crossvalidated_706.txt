Yet another reason (in addition to the excellent ones above) comes from Fisher himself, who showed that the standard deviation is more "efficient" than the absolute deviation. Here, efficient has to do with how much a statistic will fluctuate in value on different samplings from a population. If your population is normally distributed, the standard deviation of various samples from that population will, on average, tend to give you values that are pretty similar to each other, whereas the absolute deviation will give you numbers that spread out a bit more. Now, obviously this is in ideal circumstances, but this reason convinced a lot of people (along with the math being cleaner), so most people worked with standard deviations.
