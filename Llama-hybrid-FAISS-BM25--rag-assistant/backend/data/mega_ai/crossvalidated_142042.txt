Basically you want to use that sixth class as a junk class, right? Everything that does not look like a heartbeat put it there. I would try to adopt a two stage approach: (1) One-class SVM to separate beats from non-beats (2) For all beats patterns, do one-vs-all SVM classifier (or any other multiclass classifier). By (1) you actually model your class of interest (which are all the five beats classes). This classifier should help you to get rid of those bad patterns. The (2) gets only clean patterns that need to be classified in one of five classes.
