The bulletText argument is actually a constructor to the Paragraph object, not the tag :-) Try this: story.append(Paragraph(text, TEXT_STYLE, bulletText='-')) Have a look at the examples on page 68 (page 74 now, in 2012) of the ReportLab Documentation , though. The convention in ReportLab seems to be to use the tag, and the docs do warn that you can have only one per Paragraph instance. We render our bullets in ReportLab like so: story.append(Paragraph(' The rain in spain ', TEXT_STYLE))
