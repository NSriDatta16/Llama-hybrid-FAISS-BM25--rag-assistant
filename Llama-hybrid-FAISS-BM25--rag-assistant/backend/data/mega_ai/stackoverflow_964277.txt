iPhone User Agent

I'm building an iPhone app, that basically just displays information from an rss feed, and drags in some extra info from a related web site. I'm considering to put in some reporting code, eg the code provided by PinchMedia. I do have some issues with that, because I'll be monitoring users without consent. So, I was wondering if it was possible to just take a look at the requests that are received by the rss provider. In my code, I approach the feed as follows: NSString * path = @"http://feeds.feedburner.com/whatever"; [self parseXMLFileAtURL:path]; Does the iPhone send any User Agent information to the server when opening that URL? If so, can I alter it in such a way, that it would be easy to distinguish a call from my app from regular rss clients? Thank you for your insights!
