How to execute a 3GB SQL file (Microsoft SQL Server)?

I have a big SQL file that does not fit into memory and needs to be executed against Microsoft SQL Server 2008. It seems that the sqlcmd.exe tool always loads it into memory first which is impossible in this case. Any ideas? Unfortunately, I can't split the script because it is generated by Red Gate's excellent SQL Data Compare. The entire script is one big transaction and I want to leave it that way. I had never thought that having a gigantic script is unusual because having a lot of data is common in the database world. The script is 3gb in size.
