Enable drag and drop into Visual Studio 2008 from Windows Explorer

Is there some way to enable Visual Studio 2008 to accept dropped files from Windows explorer? I can't count the number of times I've instinctively dragged a file into VS just to be reminded of this obvious feature than seems to be missing. Surely there has to be some way to do this. EDIT I did find the VS Explorer addin while searching for an answer to this. I like it, but it would still be nice to have drag and drop from explorer. EDIT II To clarify I would like to be able to open projects/solutions and individual files (xml,.c,.cpp,etc) by dropping them. Like right now, I have this XML file I want to take a look at in VS. I have my project open, but I can't drag the XML file into VS to open it. I have to File...Open...
