How can I test possible reasons for the relationship between income and handedness?

For a project, I am trying to determine what accounts for the difference in income between left handed people and right handed people. (For example, whether it is only among males, or only in a certain field, education level etc.) For independent variables, I will be looking at: handedness education level sex job category (jobs will be divided into 3-4 categories) For the dependent variable, I simply have income. My theory is that left handed people tend to pick jobs which are lower paying, which is why they have on average a lower income than right handed people. So what kinds of statistical tests could I use to show the following relationship is statistically likely: left handed --> lower paying job --> lower income
