Count the number of elements returned by

I have the following xsl stylesheet: 1 2 3 (It shouldn't matter what xml you apply it to, it generates its own data). The result of this of this (using xsltproc) is: 1 2 3 1 Given that the called template returns three nodes, I expected "count($elements)" to be 3, but it is one. I suspected maybe the results were being wrapped up in some sort of root node, but any attempt to do count($elements/*) or similar failed, I believe because $elements is a result tree fragment, and not a node-set. I don't have access to any of the goodies of exslt or xslt2.0, surely there's a way to get the count of the nodes stored in a variable? I'd also be happy to count the nodes returned by the call-template without using an intermediate variable, but I can't see how that would be possible.
