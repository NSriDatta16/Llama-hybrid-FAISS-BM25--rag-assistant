There is a simple (also to implement) heuristic to first seed the pool of votes with small number of dummy votes with average voting, and later replace it with incoming votes. So, for instance, new object appears and you give it few votes rating it 2.5/5 (this is the best you can tell about it at the zero-knowledge point). Then the first vote comes, let's say 5/5, but it is somewhat tempered by the rest of the initial pool and the objects mean is slightly above 2.5. Than next votes come and the mean gradually moves from the initial guess to the real average which than has time to stabilize. Finally this algorithm converges to normal vote mean.
