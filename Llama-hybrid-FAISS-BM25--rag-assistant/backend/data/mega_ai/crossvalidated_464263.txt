These are actually apples and oranges if you dig deep enough. The Frequentist vs. Bayesian approach dilemma is actually a philosophical question about what probabilities actually are. Bayes discovered an useful tool to handle probabilities and treated them as primary entities in his mathematical background. Fisher, Pearson, Gosset and others discovered useful tools and framed them within the hypothetic deductive perspective. The frequentists regard probabilities as reflecting outcomes happening most often in deterministic systems, Bayesians consider probabilities to be a more fundamental concept reflecting the distribution of possible configurations in a random system. In practical terms, we call Bayesian models those who are based on Bayes theorem, calculating posterior probabilities based on a prior, a likelihood function and model evidence. Frequentist models are slightly hard to define, because that is a label for many different statistical frameworks. Generally, it means p-values and estimation using exact maximum likelihood solutions via least squares method. One would say Bayesian analysis gives probability distributions instead of testing hypothesis in a classical manner (e.g. null hypothesis) . This is also a misunderstanding, since testing falsifiable scenarios is an epistemological choice and could be done with any tools (including non mathematical ones).
