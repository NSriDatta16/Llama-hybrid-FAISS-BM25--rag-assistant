Don't think there is one right answer; just different degrees of reasoning. I would say you are missing 0.65 probability of making less than 150k. As revenues are positive this means you know this mass lies between 0 and 150k, so call it 75k on average for 0.65 probability. So I'd add $48,750 to your conservative upside estimate. So basically 100k average revenues
