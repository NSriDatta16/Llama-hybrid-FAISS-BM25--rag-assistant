Storing multiple time series in a python pandas dataframe efficiently

I got different time series. Each time series contains different attributes, which have data entries at different points of time (timestamps). Each time series is labeled and has a label attribute. I made a graphic showing the structure of the data. It is important to me to have a structure which is persistable as a csv. I tried this with nested dataframes, but the nested dataframe is not saved correctly. The dataset is about 250 Megabytes, stored in a numpy array of dimension (3, 1200, 2501, 10). I am looking for an efficient approach to create such a dataframe with the given data structure, such that it is persistable with pandas and file size still efficient. Edit: The file format does not necessarily need to be csv.
