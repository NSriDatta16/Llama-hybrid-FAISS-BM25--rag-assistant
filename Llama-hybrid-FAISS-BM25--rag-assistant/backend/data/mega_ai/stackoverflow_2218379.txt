Probably not the answer you want, but the number of files probably won't be your foil here. Since Magento uses strange methods to instantiate objects ( Mage::getModel etc), normal code completion is completely at a loss. On top of that, Magento makes heavy use of PHP's magic functions, which of course are totally exempt from code completion. I've worked with a few IDEs using Magento (Komodo, Zend Studio, Eclipse), and I've never had a very good result. Komodo was the only one that didn't have a coronary trying to guess, so I've been using that for some time now. Hope that helps. Thanks! Joe
