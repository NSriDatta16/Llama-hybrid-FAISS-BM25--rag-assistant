Let's say the problem is predicting whether you will pass or fail in subject C based on your grades in subject A and subject B. Suppose you had a model which takes inputs $x$ and outputs predictions $y$ . For each $x$ , there is a true target $t$ (i.e. what the "correct" prediction is). So $x$ are the grades in course A and course B, and $y$ and $t$ are binary, indicating pass or fail. Suppose you train your model on a dataset $D$ . The output of your model $y$ for any given $x$ will differ based on what $D$ you train it on. (i.e. sampling all the students with student id's ending in 5 vs. all the students with student id's ending in 0). In this sense, $y$ is a random variable, where the randomness comes from the choice of the dataset $D$ . If you overfit , you will memorize the peculiar aspects of the dataset that do not generalize. So if you are provided with different $D$ 's, and trained your model on all of them, for a fixed $x$ , your prediction $y$ will vary a lot depending on which $D$ you trained your model on (since the model remembers all the details about each $D$ ). The variability of $y$ is due to overfitting . Next consider the case where you have a very basic model, that just takes the average of the two courses A and B and if it's above some threshold, predicts the student will pass subject C. Suppose course A was actually English, course B was Differential Geometry, and course C was Linear Algebra, and the optimal prediction given $x$ is to predict $y^*$ . One would expect students did well in course B could also do well in course C. You can think of $y^*$ in this scenario as having lots to do with the grades in course B. But your model, being as simplistic as it is, on average , predicts $E[y|x]$ , since it routinely fails to capture the importance of subject B and the unimportance of subject A for predicting subject C.Your model is biased towards predicting $E[y|x]$ rather than $y^*$ , since it is underfitting (i.e. failing to capture the relevant structure of the data that helps it make good predictions on average).
