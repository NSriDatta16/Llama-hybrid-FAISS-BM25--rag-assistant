Estimation of the mean of a long tailed distribution

I want to calculate the average of a data set in which elements are distributed according to a PDF that seems to have a quite long tail. This means that when I bin elements of this set I get a PDF that is somewhat between Gaussian and Cauchy distribution, falls off quicker than Cauchy and slower than Gauss. The median seems to work quite well for sets that have symmetric distributions, but some of the sets are skewed. The sample mean is too noisy. Is there a fairly cheap and efficient way of estimating the average?
