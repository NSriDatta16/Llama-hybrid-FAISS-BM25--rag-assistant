Fitting a VAR model

I have a data set which is needed to get a multivariate time series model fitted. Possible time series models for now is VAR and VEC models. Assume that the variables are not cointegrated, so we try to fit a VAR model. In that case, the stationarity of data is mandatory. To test the stationarity, I conducted the following test, using R software; kpss.test(variable_1, null = "Trend") as the time series plot of variable_1 showed some trend (not level). As a result of this test, I got variable_1 is stationary. But I know, that variable_1 has a trend (may be a deterministic trend, but not a stochastic trend). My problem here is, since variable_1 is stationary, can I use it directly in fitting a VAR model? Don't I have to detrend it, as I know it has a trend component, though the test says variable_1 is stationary?
