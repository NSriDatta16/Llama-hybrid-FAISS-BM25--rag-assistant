1000’s of target labels is going to cause issues with most standard desktop ML algorithm implementations I suspect. Some of the public DL neural networks might be capable of handling this depending on your data and use case. For a desktop solution, I would suggest breaking your problem down into 1000’s of individual binary classification tasks per target.
