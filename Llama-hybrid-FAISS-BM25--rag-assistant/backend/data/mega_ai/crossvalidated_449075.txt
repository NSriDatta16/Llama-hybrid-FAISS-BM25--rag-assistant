Comparing effect sizes across multiple groups within meta analysis

I have multiple studies on a particular effect, each study tracks certain other criteria, and each has a control group. The units of measurement in each study are not always convertible between each other. For each study I calculated an effect size (bias corrected Hedge's g and its standard error). I'd like to do a comparison of effect size among the different criteria groups, and I'm just not sure where to start. Here is how the data is organized (but with many more studies): I can calculate confidence intervals for the effect size for each study and do a meta analysis for effect size for any combination of the factor criteria using R method metagen . Question: Can I perform a statistical test to compare effect size between factor groups? For example, can I say that based on this meta analysis, the difference in effect sizes between group ACE and group BCF are statistically significant (or not)? Assume I have multiple studies for each combination of factor levels. This is far outside of my statistical knowledge, so any help, advice, references are greatly appreciated.
