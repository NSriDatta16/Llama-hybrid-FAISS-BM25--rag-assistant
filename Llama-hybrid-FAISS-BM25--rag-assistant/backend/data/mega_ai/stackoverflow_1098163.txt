Credit Card - Card on file services?

Does anyone have any experience with card on file services for credit cards, that handle the storage of credit card information for ongoing purchases? We are looking for a solution that can be integrated with a custom ASP.NET app via a web service or similar but removes the storage of the info from our side of the equation in order to reduce risk and meet PCI compliance issues. We need a solution that allows for us to do ongoing billing at different varied amounts for a card pass system, not recurring monthly fixed subscription billings.
