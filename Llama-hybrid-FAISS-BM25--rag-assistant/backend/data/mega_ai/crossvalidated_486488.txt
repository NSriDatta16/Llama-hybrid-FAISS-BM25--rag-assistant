PERMANOVA uses a permutation test for the tests of covariates. The key assumption is that the observations (or residuals) are exchangeable under the NULL hypothesis. It doesn't sound like your data are exchangeable under the NULL model implied by the default permutation scheme, which is simple randomization. You may be able to specify the constraints implied by your design in the permutation test; vegan uses the permute package for permutation schemes so look at the help for permute to see if your design fits within the possibilities. The other way to deal with these issues is to include the experimental design in the model by including extra terms. You don't give enough information on the design etc to speculate further.
