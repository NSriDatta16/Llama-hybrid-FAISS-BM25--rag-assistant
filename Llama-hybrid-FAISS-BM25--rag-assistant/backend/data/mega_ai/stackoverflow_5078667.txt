Reordering table rows on server side

I have a table which contains asp radiobuttonlists (see below) for a survey. Once submitted the results are written to a database. I would like to use this same table for a similar survey, but the trouble is the question order needs to be different. The questions are the same, just in a different order. Is there a way (server side) to change the order of the table rows? &nbsp; &nbsp; EXCELLENT GOOD AVERAGE POOR 1 Question 1 2 Question 2 3 Question 3
