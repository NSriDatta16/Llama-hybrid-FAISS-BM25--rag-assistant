What is the expected value and variance for this variable?

I read about a formula in a textbook called Recursive Macroeconomic Theory and am quite confused about it. In this formula, you observe $y$, which equals $\theta + u$. The distributions of $\theta$ and $u$ are known. $\theta \sim N(\mu,\sigma_0^2)$, $u \sim N(0,\sigma_1^2)$. The goal is to infer the expected value, $m_0$ and variance, $\sigma_1$ of $\theta$ conditional on $y$. The text book gives the formula for $m_0=\mu+\frac{\sigma_0^2}{\sigma_0^2+\sigma_1^2}(y-u)$. It claims that this formula can be derived from Kalman filter. I am quite confused about the claim related to using Kalman filter. Why is this related to Kalman filter? Isn't this a simple bayesian updating problem?
