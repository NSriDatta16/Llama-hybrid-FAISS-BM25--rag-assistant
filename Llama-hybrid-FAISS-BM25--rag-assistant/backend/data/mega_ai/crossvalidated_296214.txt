Greatly reduce the prediction of 1s in my machine learning model in R

I am predicting a binary variable called "response". Using CART, neural network, ,logistic regression, or any other binary classification algorithm, how can I penalize/greatly reduce the prediction of 1s in my machine learning model? No matter what method I use, my learning model on any random training set always predicts over 99% of the time 1 while there is only 59% of 1s in my data.
