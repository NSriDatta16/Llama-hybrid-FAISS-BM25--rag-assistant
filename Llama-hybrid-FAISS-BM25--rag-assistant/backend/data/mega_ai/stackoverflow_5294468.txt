How to determine a website is good in load testing?

I'm a newbie at testing. For now, I'm using JMeter to build a test plan, then run it against my java web application. At the moment I just use (average response time, 90% line, throughput, and estimation of CPU/memory used) to give an approxiate estimation about how the web works. Is there any kind of quality check-list to know that a web application is working fine? I have tried to search the web, but found no clue. UPDATE : About my test-plan, it simulate a case that 200 users access my web application at the same time, and follow a typical work flow: login, check out goods, download documents... I'm trying to make the test as real as it should be, so that I will know if there's any potential problem. I also added "user think-time", to make the test more realistic.
