Read existing PDF file with all format information

I want to read an existing PDF file, get not only the text, but also the format information like: Font (Bold, Italic...), and paragraphs... Is there an code library for doing this, is it open source or commercial? I am on Windows and favor C# libraries, but C/C++ is also acceptable.
