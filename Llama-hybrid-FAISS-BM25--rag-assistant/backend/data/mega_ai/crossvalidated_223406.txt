Inconsistent results with Monte Carlo solutions to similar problems in probability

I am presently going through the book Fifty Challenging Problems in Probability with Solutions and implementing Monte Carlo solutions to most of the problems in R to get familiar with the language, and have come to a puzzling inconsistency in what is effective for getting the right answers. Consider the following problem, #39: In a laboratory, each of a handful of thin 9-inch glass rods had one tip marked with a blue dot and the other with a red. When the laboratory assistant tripped and dropped them onto the concrete floor, many broke into three pieces. For these, what was the average length of the fragment with the blue dot? To solve this problem, I drew three numbers from the continuous uniform distribution offered by R, each on the default interval [0,1]. These were summed and then the quotient of the first of these numbers to the total times nine was returned. The process was then repeated many times in the typical Monte Carlo fashion to give a very nearly correct answer: ~2.99 inches. I then went on to attempt a similar approach with problem #42: (a) If a stick is broken in two at random, what is the average length of the smaller piece? (b) (For calculus students.) What is the average ratio of the smaller length to the larger? In this case, for (a), only two numbers were drawn to represent the lengths of the two pieces and the quotient of the smaller of the two to the total was returned. (No explicit length was ever given and so the idea is to deal with fractions of the original intact stick's length.) A similar procedure was carried out for (b). Both procedures returned incorrect results. The answers given for (a) and (b) respectively were ~0.307 and almost exactly 0.5. What was effective for (a) was generating a single number from the uniform distribution described above, calling it $ \text{split}$, and then, if $\text{split}$ was less than 0.5, returning that number, or else returning $1 - \text{split}$. Such a procedure was also carried out for (b), returning $\frac{\text{split}}{1 - \text{split}}$ if $\text{split}$ was less than 0.5 or else returning $\frac{1 - \text{split}}{\text{split}}$. Both of these returned very nearly correct answers, respectively: ~0.25 and ~0.386. I can't account for this inconsistent behavior. What is the cause? I have a faint inkling some sort of degrees of freedom issue is involved here but that doesn't explain why the solution to the first one was effective.
