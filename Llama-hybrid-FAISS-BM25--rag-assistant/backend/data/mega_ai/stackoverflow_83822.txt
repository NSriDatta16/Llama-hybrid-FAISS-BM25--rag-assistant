I faced the same problem with my college project a few years ago. I responded (in a rather weasel way) by splitting the year and the date(MM:DD) in two separate columns. And before that, my project mate was simply getting all the dates and programatically going through them. We changed that because it was too inefficient - not that my solution was any more elegant either. Also, its probably not possible to do in a database that has been in use for a while by multiple apps.
