A random forest isn't suited very well to this, as each individual tree partitions the space up into disjoint regions of space and thus at some granular level, the target variable always changes discretely. For example, at x=0.8 and x=0.9, y might equal 1, and then at x=1 and x=1.1, y might equal 1.5. How is your derivative then defined, even in terms of finite differences? Analytical models, such as logistic regression and neural networks allow you to differentiate the target variable with respect to any given feature for the current parameter values to calculate such a derivative. I would suggest that if calculating the derivative is key to the problem you're solving, you might try using an analytic classifier. It might be worth investing some time into seeing whether logistic regression/a neural network perform as well as a random forest w.r.t whatever loss condition you're using under cross-validation. If both perform worse than a random forest, you can weigh up whether the ability to differentiate is a worthwhile trade-off for lower accuracy.
