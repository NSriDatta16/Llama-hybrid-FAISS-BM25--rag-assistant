The safest way to have a PDF display instead of download seems to be embedding it using an object or iframe element. There are also 3rd party solutions like Google's PDF viewer. See Best Way to Embed PDF in HTML for an overview. There's also DoPDF , a Java based In-browser PDF viewer. I can't speak to its quality but it looks interesting.
