Using isolated storage seems like you are writing all the data to a file everytime the a user opens the app. Is that how it works? No, IsolatedStorage is storage - you can think of it as "disk" - so everything in it is persisted between application runs. When you first run your application, then you'll need to create your files there, but after that time, then the files will already be in place. If you need to put a large amount of data into IsolatedStorage and then need to search that data later, then "lite" database solutions like http://sterling.codeplex.com/ or SqlLite might help
