What is the distribution of the rounded down average of Poisson random variables?

If I have random variables $X_1,X_2,\ldots,X_n$ that are Poisson distributed with parameters $\lambda_1, \lambda_2,\ldots, \lambda_n$, what is the distribution of $Y=\left\lfloor\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n X_i}{n}\right\rfloor$ (i.e. the integer floor of the average)? A sum of Poissons is also Poisson, but I am not confident enough in statistics to determine if it is the same for the case above.
