I think http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/elements.html#embedding-custom-non-visible-data-with-the-data-attributes answers your question. A custom data attribute is an attribute in no namespace whose name starts with the string "data-", has at least one character after the hyphen, is XML-compatible, and contains no characters in the range U+0041 to U+005A (LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A to LATIN CAPITAL LETTER Z). ... Custom data attributes are intended to store custom data private to the page or application, for which there are no more appropriate attributes or elements.
