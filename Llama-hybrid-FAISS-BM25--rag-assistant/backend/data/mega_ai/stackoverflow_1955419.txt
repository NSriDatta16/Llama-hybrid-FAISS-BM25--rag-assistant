It's entirely up to you. But what I do is put common resource files that get used by lots of pages in central locations, e.g. /js is where the javascript libraries go. My arrows go in /arrows. But if a given resource is specific to only one page, e.g. foo_pic.png is only ever used by foo.php, then I keep the files together and name them so they list together alphabetically. So, as you see, I don't prefer structuring only according to file type. But that's just me. Outside of the DocumentRoot , I put my php include files under one directory and they are all suffixed .inc.php . HTML templates are organized under another dir.
