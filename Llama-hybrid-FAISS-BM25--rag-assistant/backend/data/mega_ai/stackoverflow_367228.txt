Having been programming for nearly 10 years now myself and having worked with others I can say without bias that there is no difference between a good programmer and an average programmers code All programmers at a competent level: Comment Correctly Structure Efficiently Document Cleanly I once overheard a co-worker say " I've always been very logical and rational minded. I think that's why I enjoy developing " That in my opinion, is the mind of an average programmer. One who sees the world in terms of rules and logic and ultimately obeys those rules when designing and writing a program. The expert programmer, understands the rules, but also their context. This ultimately leads to them coming up with new ideas and implementations, the mark of an expert programmer. Programming is ultimately an art form.
