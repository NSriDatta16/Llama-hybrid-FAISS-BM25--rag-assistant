You're passing it as a request parameter with the name pcatid : But you're trying to obtain it as a request parameter with the name p : Align the names out. That said, you tagged this question with servlets , but you aren't using servlets at all. This code is honestly said a disaster. Scriptlets are a poor practice and the JDBC code is leaking resources. Raw Java code belongs in Java classes, not in JSP files. Use taglibs like JSTL to control the page flow and use EL (Expression Language) to access backend data. Go through those tutorials to get it right. Kickoff example: public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) { List projects = projectDAO.list(); request.setAttribute("projects", projects); request.getRequestDispatcher("projects.jsp").forward(request, response); } and ${project.id} ${project.name}
