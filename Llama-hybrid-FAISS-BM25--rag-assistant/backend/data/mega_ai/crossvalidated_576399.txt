How to handle regressors that are interchangeable

I am trying to set up a multinomial logistic regression for which one of the 5 NBA players on the court at a given time end up taking a shot. OFF_P1 OFF_P2 OFF_P3 OFF_P4 OFF_P5 PLAYER_SHOT 0 6.482081 8.199627 7.034929 8.004813 5.830139 5 1 6.482081 8.199627 7.034929 8.004813 5.830139 4 2 3.821826 7.149693 9.934506 8.793994 11.039031 4 3 3.821826 7.149693 9.934506 8.793994 11.039031 4 4 3.821826 7.149693 9.934506 8.793994 11.039031 5 Each row has the 5 players that are playing and their respective shot attempts per 100 possessions. The OFF_P1 - OFF_P5 are the 5 players that were on the court, but for each row any one of the 5 players can be considered as any of OFF_P1-OFF_P5 . Would sorting the row so OFF_P1 would be set to the highest value and OFF_P5 set to the lowest value help mitigate this issue? Is this even an issue in the first place?
