My pragmatic answer would be: yes, you always assume a toString() call is cheap, unless you make an enormous amount of them. On the one hand, it is extremely unlikely that a toString() method would be expensive and on the other hand, it is extremely unlikely that you run into trouble if it isn't. I generally don't worry about issues like these, because there are too many of them and you won't get any code written if you do ;). If you do run into performance issues, everything is open, including the performance of toString() and you should, as Shog9 suggest, simply profile the code. The Java Puzzlers show that even Sun wrote some pretty nasty constructors and toString() methods in their JDK's.
