Lame, I know, but that's all you can do about it. You could always transform it into a while loop and add 'exitLoop' as a condition which must be met. Inside the switch, you can call continue to skip the rest of the current pass and since you would have set exitLoop to false, it'd exit much like break would do. Even though it's not exactly what you're asking, perhaps it's more elegant that way?
