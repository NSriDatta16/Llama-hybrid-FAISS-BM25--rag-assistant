Detect if property is animatable by CSS3 transition?

The list of properties that can be animated with a CSS3 transition is not consistent among browsers and is a subject to change with new browser versions. For example, -moz-transform is not animatable with -moz-transition in FF3.6 but it is in FF4. So, is there a way to detect in JavaScript if a particular property is animatable? I wouldn't like to use user agent sniffing as it's not reliable. Thanks in advance!
