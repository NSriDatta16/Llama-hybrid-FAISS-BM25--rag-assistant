Searchlogic 'OR' conditions on associated records

Rails 2.3.5 Searchlogic 2.3.27 I have the following models; class Outbreak :destroy has_many :bacteria, :through => :bacterial_agents has_many :viral_agents, :dependent => :destroy has_many :viruses, :through => :viral_agents end class BacterialAgent :bacterial_agents end class ViralAgent :viral_agents end I'm currently trying to get Searchlogic to accept an "OR" condition for a search between the models Virus and Bacterium, along these lines; params[:search] = {"bacterial_agents_bacterium_name_like_any" => "VTEC O157", "viral_agents_virus_name_like_any" => "NOROVIRUS"} @search = Outbreak.search(params[:search]) The scope "_or_viral_agents_virus_name_like" isn't recognised although both scopes work without the " or ". The returned output should show all records where the bacteria name is like "VTEC O157" or the virus name is like "NOROVIRUS" (the "any" clause is to allow multiple names for each). Any ideas?
