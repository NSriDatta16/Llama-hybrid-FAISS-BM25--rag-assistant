No, they are not the same. Head First example has 1 drink with Mocha, Whip, Roast added. Your example has 3 beverages. See this Head First code. It works on the same instance of the beverage beverage2 = new Mocha(beverage2); beverage2 = new DarkRoast(beverage2); beverage2 = new Whip(beverage2); Your code creates 3 beverages (which means someone ordered 3 things separately). In real life, it is not beverages, I guess. The beverage is one & flavors added on top of it. The purpose of decorator is - to decorate. .Net has TextWriter and IndentedTextWriter (I guess), which basically takes the normal text of yours and applies indentation to it. It is similar to unix pipes in a way, if you think of it. input -> tweaks -> tweaked input -> further tweaks -> further tweaked input. Output of current operation becomes input for next operation. I don't know if I explained it well.
