How to select the 'best' measurements out of a sample?

I have about 100 water quality parameters for 300 stations, parameters were measured during different years and for each year I have different number of measurements. Not all stations measure the same number of parameters, some measure 3 or 2 parameters, while others may measure 50 or more. The data looks something like this: Station Parameter group Parameter Sampling year sampling count station A Sediments Turbidity 2010 12 station A Sediments Total Suspended Solids 2010 45 station A Sediments Turbidity 2011 18 station A Sediments Total Suspended Solids 2011 28 station A Nutrients Total Phosphorus 2010 2 station A Nutrients Total Nitrogen 2015 45 station A Nutrients Total Dissolved Nitrogen 2020 3 station A Nutrients Total Dissolved Nitrogen 2021 5 station A Nutrients Free Ammonia Nitrogen 1994 35 station A Heavy Metals Arsenic - Total 2000 13 station A Heavy Metals Mercury - Total 2011 53 station B Sediments turbidity 2011 21 station B Heavy Metals Lead - Total 2011 12 ... ... ... ... station Z Heavy Metals Cadmium - Total 2019 142 station Z Heavy Metals Lead - Total 2019 142 station Z Heavy Metals Arsenic - Total 2019 142 station Z Heavy Metals Cadmium - Total 2021 124 station Z Heavy Metals Lead - Total 2021 124 station Z Heavy Metals Arsenic - Total 2021 124 station Z Heavy Metals Cadmium - Total 2020 124 station Z Heavy Metals Lead - Total 2020 124 station Z Heavy Metals Arsenic - Total 2020 124 I need to filter the number of stations by selecting the parameters that have a good number of sampling years and a good number of samples. The goal is to calculate river loads using that table information plus discharge data from other table I have. To simplify it, Load is the product of concentration of each one of the parameters presented in the table above and discharge. The problem is that within the data in the table above there are too many stations that don't really provide much information. For example, stations that have a 20 year recorded period, but only one or two samples each year, or a station with measurements only for one year. Basically, the need to select the "best" data is mainly for two reasons: Some stations are not really useful (too few data) I need to match water quality parameter stations with discharge stations to calculate loads. However, the matching has not been automated, so I have to do it manually consider some other things that are out the scope of this question. This is the approach I thought: Initially, create a column by summing up the number of samples for each parameter for all years and at the same time generate another column with the total number of years that parameter was measured. So the a second table like this one will be generated: Station Parameter Amount of samples Amount of years samples were taken station A Turbidity xxx xxx station A Total Suspended Solids xxx xxx station A Total Nitrogen xxx xxx station B Turbidity xxx xxx station B Total Leal xxx xxx ... ... ... ... station Z Cadmium - Total xxx xxx station Z Lead - Total xxx xxx station Z ARsenic - Total xxx xxx From that table I would get the mean of the 'Number of samples' column and then compare that mean to each row for each parameter and discard the values below that mean. Then do the same with the 'Number of years sampled' column. This would eliminate parameters with few years or few measurements. In the end you would get the 'best' quality parameters for each station. I don't know if there is a better approach, and as @frank pointed out, I am losing information since I did not consider each year individually. However, I was thinking that if I consider each year measured for each parameter of each station, I would not know how to determine the best parameters. if for one year the data are "bad" but for other years the data are good, I would still consider that parameter for that station to be good, regardless of that one "bad" year. Maybe I can also use a weighted average as mentioned by @Tim, I will need to think how to implement it. I would appreciate any thoughts and ideas.
