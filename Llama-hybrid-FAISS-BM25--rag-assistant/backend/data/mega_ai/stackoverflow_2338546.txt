Several UIAlertViews for a delegate

Currently I've got a class popping up UIAlertView s here and there. Currently, the same class is the delegate for these (it's very logical that it would be). Unfortunately, these UIAlertView s will call the same delegate methods of the class. Now, the question is - how do you know from which alert view a delegate method is invoked? I was thinking of just checking the title of the alert view, but that isn't so elegant. What's the most elegant way to handle several UIAlertView s?
