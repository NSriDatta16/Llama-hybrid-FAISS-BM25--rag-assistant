Why does Xcode 4 not add / create / modify any build directory when I do a build?

I recently upgraded to Xcode4 and noticed that my build/Release-iphoneos folder no longer gets populated with a .app or .dSYM file after I do a build. **note - any build that is (build for running/testing/profiling). Also why is the build for archiving option gray'd out? in Xcode3 I was able to archive and build my .ipa w/ organizer Am I doing something wrong or does the new IDE put a release build some place else? Thank you in advance
