Bounded distributions. We have linear probability model that comes with a drawback of producing fitted probabilities that are outside of the [0,1] interval for some values of the regressor $X$ . We have a generalized linear model – logistic regression – that fixes that. Suppose we want to model the quantiles of a bounded distribution such as $\text{Uniform}(0,1)$ . By using a linear model, we would face the same type of problem as described above. It would be nice to have the fitted quantiles inside of the [0,1] interval. This is where generalized quantile regression of the logistic type (but not only) would come in handy. I have no thoughts about maximum likelihood estimation as of now.
