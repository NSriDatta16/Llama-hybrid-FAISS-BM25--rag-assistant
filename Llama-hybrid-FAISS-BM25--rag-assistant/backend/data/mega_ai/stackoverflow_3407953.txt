I think the most elegant solution to this problem is probably to ignore it. The existence of code-behind files in your project costs you next to nothing. And coming up with some special scheme to make them go away just creates something that you have to document and manage. (And figure out how to disable, when the day comes when you do need a code-behind file for a user control. Because sooner or later you will - for instance, you can't implement drag and drop in your view model.) Why would you do this to yourself?
