The actual logic that gets executed in either case is determined by the implementation of the type that is implementing the ISessionStateItemCollection interface located in the System.Web.SessionState namespace. The concrete type implementing that interface is determined by the configured session store provider. The built-in providers (In-Proc, State Server, and SQL Server) all utilize the SessionStateItemCollection class located in the System.Web.SessionState namespace, so this is the implementation that will be used in the great majority of cases, since most people don't implement a custom session store provider. As others have pointed out, if the value is really being removed from session because it doesn't need to be referenced anymore, at least for the time being, then you should probably call the Remove method just for the sake of cleaning up the internal storage mechanisms of the Session object. Neither of the methods explicitly dispose of the object that was previously stored with that key.
