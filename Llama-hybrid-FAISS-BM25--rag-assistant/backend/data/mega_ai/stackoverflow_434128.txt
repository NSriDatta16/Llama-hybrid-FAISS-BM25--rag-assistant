How to find the value of a neuron in a neural network

Since a lot of these sites found on google use mathematical notation and I have no idea what any of it means I want to make a feedforward neural network like this: n1 i1 n3 n2 o1 i2 n4 n3 Now can someone explain to me how to find the value of o1? How is it possible to make a neuron active when none of its inputs are active?
