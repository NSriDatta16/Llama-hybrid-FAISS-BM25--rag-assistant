You can perform individual image classification using as input the whole set of related images as well. In order to do this, your initial input will be some 3d array of stacked 256x256 matrices and the first layer could be either a 3d convolution or multiple 2d convolutions with some combination function at some point of the structure. Another way would be having a first network structure that processes each image and outputs a dense vector of dimension D and stacking (or averaging) those vectors and using this as inputs to a sequential structure. This way you would be training the process as a whole instead of performing two separated tasks.
