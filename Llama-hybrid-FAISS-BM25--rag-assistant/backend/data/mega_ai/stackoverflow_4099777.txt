Magento - call static block when php BodyClass == ‘whatever’

in my 2col-inside.phtml file i can successfully call a block using: getLayout()->createBlock('cms/block')->setBlockId('blue-banner')->toHtml() ?> however i would like to serve up a unique banner based on the URI or body class. so something like: getLayout()->createBlock('cms/block')->setBlockId('blue-banner')->toHtml() ?> getLayout()->createBlock('cms/block')->setBlockId('red-banner')->toHtml() ?> getLayout()->createBlock('cms/block')->setBlockId('yellow-banner')->toHtml() ?> Setting the BlockId to the page url would work too (i'd just have to go back and rename all the blocks to exactly match the page url), but i don't know how to extract JUST the page url either. Any suggestions?
