Reasons why I think they're convenient, working in a field that's still somewhat dominated by frequentist statistics, but where a "Bayesian" analysis carry some cachet: Credible intervals are awesome, in that they can be interpreted the way people really want to interpret confidence intervals from frequentist analysis. This is generally a benefit of Bayesian methods, they're easier to translate into "plain English" statements. By "Bayesian" sometimes people mean "MCMC". It's pretty easy to argue that this is incorrect, but a "Bayesian" analysis using MCMC and uninformative priors can occasionally plow through computational problems that likelihood based methods will struggle with. A properly done analysis with a very carefully considered set of priors can already set the stage for "How this finding changes the field's understanding of $TOPIC" with no additional input of effort. That being said, I don't know that I'd actually consider them more convenient than conventional frequentist statistics from an analysis/coding point of view, though well written packages, and things like the BAYES statement in SAS help a great deal.
