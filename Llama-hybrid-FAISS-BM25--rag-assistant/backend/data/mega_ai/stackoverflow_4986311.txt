The Google Maps JavaScript API Version 3 is now the official JavaScript API. Version 2 of the API has been officially deprecated as per Google's deprecation policy. Version 3 of the API is designed to be faster and more applicable to mobile devices, as well as traditional desktop browser applications. For support questions unrelated to programming as defined in the Stack Overflow usage guidelines, there is a Maps API Google Group . Google has established two licensing models for use of the Google Maps JavaScript API v3: The Google Maps API Standard Plan requires an API key and is free up to 25K Map Loads per day. If you need more than 25K Map Loads per day you need to enable billing on your project. After exceeding the free usage limits, billing at $0.50 USD / 1000 additional requests, up to 100,000 per 24 hours is enforced. You can find more info about Google Maps API JavaScript quotas in the developer docs . When using the Google Maps API Services in JavaScript (Directions, GeoCoding, etc.) and Places API quota restrictions also apply, please check this document for more info on Services usage limits. If you need more than 100,000 daily Map Loads you should switch to the Google Maps API Premium Plan . To use the Standard Plan you need to provide public accessibility to your Google Maps API implementation. Note: Quota exceptions may apply. Learn more here . The Google Maps API Premium Plan provides higher quotas , enhanced features, reporting and analytics and added support to organizations that wish to add maps to their fee-based websites, mobile apps, or to their internal websites. To learn more about this option, contact Google Maps API Premium Plan Sales . Check out the showcase site to see examples of what is possible with the Google Maps APIs.
