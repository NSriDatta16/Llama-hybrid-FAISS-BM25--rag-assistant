One method you can recommend which achievements to go for is to see how many of your users already have those achievements and recommend those popular ones. When they have achieved those you go down the list and recommend slightly less popular ones. However, this has a naive assumption that everyone wants to go for popular achievements. It might cause popular achievements to be even more popular and less popular ones, well... A consolation is that this doesn't take up much resources and is likely to run very fast. (Just keep a list of achievements + number of times it's achieved) Another method (which attempts to guess which achievements the user is likely to go after based on what achievements he already had) is to use some machine learning algorithms. I think the k-nearest neighbor algorithm will perform quite well here. Select a threshold and just output everything that is above this threshold. Now, I don't know if this will run faster than what you already have, but you should just run the recommendation engine once every time the user has made a new achievement, store the top (let's say) five, and just output it back to the user whenever a recommendation is needed. I hope this helps. =)
