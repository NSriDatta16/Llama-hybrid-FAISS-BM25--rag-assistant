It depends what question you are trying to answer. You are looking at the rate of change of a time series, and it sounds like you are trying to show how that changed over time. The mean gives the reader one intuitive insight: they can trivially estimate the number of followers at any date $d$ days since the start by multiplying by the mean rate of change. The downside to this single metric is that it doesn't illustrate something which is very common in series such as this: the rate of change is not fixed over time. One reasonable metric for giving readers an idea of whether the rate of change is static is giving them the median. If they know the minimum of the series (presumably zero in your case), the current value, the mean and the median, they can in many cases get a "feel for" how close to linear the increase has been. There is a great cautionary tale in Anscombe's quartet - four completely different time series which all share several important statistical measures. Basically it always comes back to what you are trying to answer. Are you trying to find users which are likely to become prominent soon? Users which are steadily accruing followers year by year? One hit wonders? Botnets? As you've probably guessed, this means it's not possible to universally call mean or median "better" than the other.
