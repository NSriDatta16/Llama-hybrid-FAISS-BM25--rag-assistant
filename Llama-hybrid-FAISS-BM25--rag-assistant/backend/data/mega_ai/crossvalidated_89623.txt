Can more features decrease the performance

I am running different algorithms (SVM, Random Forest, other tree-based decision algos). I noticed that my performance went down (error went up) after adding new features. performance(Feature_family_1 + Feature_family_2) Is this possible, and how can I make sure I don't lose information? Should I use PCA?
