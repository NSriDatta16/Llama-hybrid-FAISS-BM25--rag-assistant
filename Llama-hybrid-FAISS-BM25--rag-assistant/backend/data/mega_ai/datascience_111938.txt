Reshape using array_reshape

I'm new to CNN and I was trying to reshape a few images for image recognition but I keep getting an error message which I'm not sure how to fix. library(keras) reticulate::install_miniconda() for (i in 1:10) {mypic[[i]] I get the error message as below. Error in py_call_impl(callable, dots $args, dots$ keywords) : ValueError: cannot reshape array of size 784 into shape (28,28,3) Is there something I'm missing?
