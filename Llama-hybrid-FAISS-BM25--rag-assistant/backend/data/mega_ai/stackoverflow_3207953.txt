From a perfomance point of view I'm pretty sure DOM would be worse than your usage of StringTemplate. Using StringBuilder might be a bit faster and maybe even cleaner looking (if used implicitly): public CharBuffer generate() { String content = inner == null ? "" : inner.array(); return CharBuffer.wrap( " " + content + " " ); } The fastest way to do this would probably be to avoid the creation of temporary strings entirely, i.e. to write directly into a BufferedOutputWriter or PrintWriter. But in general I'd suggest to use one of the dedicated Stream Writer APIs for the creation of XML documents. There are several non obvious pitfalls when you put vanilla strings directly into a XML documents without awareness for proper escaping of special characters. These APIs usually offer also a failry efficient implementation that beats most naive approaches. Examples for such APIs are: StAX, Apache XMLIO and SAX Transformer.
