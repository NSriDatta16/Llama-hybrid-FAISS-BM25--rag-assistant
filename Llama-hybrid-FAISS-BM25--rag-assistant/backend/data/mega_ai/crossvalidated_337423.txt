This question is related to (if not a duplicate of) one XV question I answered a few days ago on the various definitions of Bayes risk. It is correct to note that the frequentist risk $\mathrm{R}(\theta,\delta)$ is dependent on the value of the parameter $\theta$ for most models and most estimators $\delta(\cdot)$. While the integrated Bayes risk $$\mathrm{R}(p,\delta)=\int_{\cal{X}}\int_\Theta \mathrm{L}(\Theta,\delta(x))f(x|\theta)p(\theta)\,\text{d}\theta\,\text{d} x$$ is a constant real number for a given prior $p(\cdot)$ and a given estimator $\delta(\cdot)$. However it does depend on the choice of the prior $p(\cdot)$, which is unacceptable for non-Bayesians. For instance, F. Samaniego examines the frequentist properties of Bayesian estimators in his 2010 book, A comparison of the Bayesian and frequentist approaches to estimation , by using several priors. Which is not an approach I particularly recommend . The "objective" Bayes solution of relying on a flat prior is similarly rejected by non-Bayesians (and some Bayesians), for reasons ranging from the issue of the choice of the dominating measure (lack of invariance by change of parameterisation), to the flat prior being outside probability distributions, to the possibility of an infinite Bayes risk. However, the Bayesian framework does account for the frequentist distribution of the data, through the posterior, which means that most Bayes estimators are (a) admissible and (b) consistent ("in the long run"). See for instance complete class theorems (mentioned on XV here and here and there ).
