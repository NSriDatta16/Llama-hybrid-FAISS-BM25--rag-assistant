Read up on ciphertext stealing . It's arguably much more elegant than plaintext padding. Also, I'd suggest using a block size larger than 4 bytes -- 64 bits is probably the bare minimum. Strictly speaking, do-it-yourself cryptography is a dangerous idea; it's hard to beat algorithms that the entire crypto community has tried and failed to break. Have fun, and consider reading this , or at least something from Schneier's "related reading" section.
