In my opinion mean(X/Y) is more meaningful because your experimental unit (not sure this is the correct term) is the individual, not the aggregate. Let's try to see this with a contrived example. Consider this data set: individual cons act ratio A 5 2 2.5 B 5 2 2.5 C 5 2 2.5 D 5 2 2.5 E 5 2 2.5 F 5 2 2.5 G 5 2 2.5 H 5 2 2.5 I 5 2 2.5 J 5 2 2.5 K 1000 2000 0.5 I would say that in this dataset the average ratio is just below 2.5 (~2.3 in fact) because you observe 10 individuals with ratio 2.5 and only one individual with ratio 0.5. However, if you calculate mean(cons) / mean(act) you get an overall average ratio of ~0.52 because individual K dominates the dataset by having much higher values, but individual K is just one out 11 individuals. On the other hand, you may want to give more weight to K if you think its values are more reliable than the other individuals'.
