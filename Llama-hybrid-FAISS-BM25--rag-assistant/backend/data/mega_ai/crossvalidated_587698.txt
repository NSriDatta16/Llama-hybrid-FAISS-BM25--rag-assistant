Can I use logistic regression to check if my groups are comparable?

I want to compare if my participants are similar in some categorical variables (e.g., sex, race) and continuous variables (age and some cognitive measures). It is a 2x2 design, language group (bilingual vs. monolingual) and diagnostic group (desease vs. healthy). Ideally, the above-mentioned factors should be controlled that's why I need to compare. While normal ways are to run ANOVAs and Chi-Square tests, can I do 2 logistic regressions with (1) language group as DV and put all the other as IVs and (2) diagnostic group as DV? That seems not to solve the question of whether there are interactions between groups, so I have to do subsequent ANOVAs putting continuous variables as IVs? I am finding the most efficient and correct way to doit. Thanks !
