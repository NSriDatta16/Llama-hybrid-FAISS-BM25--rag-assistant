I think you should pass the data directly as DMatrix() , XGBoosts internal data type. As stated in the official documentation : DMatrix is an internal data structure that is used by XGBoost, which is optimized for both memory efficiency and training speed . You can construct DMatrix from multiple different sources of data. I think this also answers your question, since XGBoost is optimized for DMatrix() , the impact of changes like yours will be small at best.
