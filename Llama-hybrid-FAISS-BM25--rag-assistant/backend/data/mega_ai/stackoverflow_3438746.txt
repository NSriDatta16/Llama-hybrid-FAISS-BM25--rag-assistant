How can I attach some jQuery to a function that already exists?

I have the following mark-up: Check / Money order Credit Card (saved) I need to snag some jQuery onto the click (or change) events. After lots of debugging, I've found that the inline onclick event is over-ruling and jQuery selectors that I try to use. Is there any way I can plug some jQuery to run whenever that method (payment.switchMethod) is run? I thought about using preventDefault() to stop the click event on document ready, but I'm not sure if this is a good idea, or the best way of going about things. I CANNOT edit the mark up in any way, unfortunately. Any advice is massively appreciated. I've attached the jQuery below for reference: // Check for payment selection. Upon selection mark it as 'hitpayment' in db jQuery("input[name=payment\\[method\\]]:radio").change(function(){ alert('hello'); var cartPalPayment = {}; cartPalPayment['user_id'] = ' '; cartPalPayment['referer'] = ' '; cartPalPayment['license_key'] = cartPalLicenseKey; jQuery.ajax({ url: 'integration/magento1.4/set_payment.php', cache: false, dataType: 'jsonp', data: cartPalPayment }); });
