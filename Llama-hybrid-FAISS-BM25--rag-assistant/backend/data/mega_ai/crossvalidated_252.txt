For me personally, I use the following three packages the most, all available from the awesome Omega Project for Statistical Computing (I do not claim to be an expert, but for my purposes they are very easy to use): RCurl : It has lots of options which allows access to websites that the default functions in base R would have difficulty with I think it's fair to say. It is an R-interface to the libcurl library, which has the added benefit of a whole community outside of R developing it. Also available on CRAN . XML : It is very forgiving of parsing malformed XML/HTML. It is an R-interface to the libxml2 library and again has the added benefit of a whole community outside of R developing it Also available on CRAN . RJSONIO : It allows one to parse the text returned from a json call and organise it into a list structure for further analysis.The competitor to this package is rjson but this one has the advantage of being vectorised, readily extensible through S3/S4, fast and scalable to large data.
