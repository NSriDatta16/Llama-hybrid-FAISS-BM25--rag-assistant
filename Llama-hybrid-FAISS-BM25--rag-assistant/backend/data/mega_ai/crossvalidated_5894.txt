Number of tried for a favorable result

I am new to statistics so I apologize for the simplicity of my question. I have a bag with 27 numbers inside; I will pull one number out until I get number 17. THe numbers will be returned to the bag after every try so the prob of success will always be 1/27. I am trying to determine on average how many pulls I will need.
