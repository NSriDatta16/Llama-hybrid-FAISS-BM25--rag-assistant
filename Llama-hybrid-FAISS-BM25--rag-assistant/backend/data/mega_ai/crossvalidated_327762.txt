3-way interaction or seperate models

I am looking at doctor’s visits in a specific region over a 10 year period. My response variable is the number of visits. I have three predictors/effect modifiers: Year (2007-2016) Priority: two levels (urgent visit, non-urgent visit) Type (location of the doctor’s office): five levels (large city, medium-sized city, large town, small town, rural community) My table looks like that I am trying to determine whether and to what extent Year affects the number of visits. In particular, I want to know whether the effect is different in different location types and for urgent and non-urgent visits. I am working in R using the MASS package, and ended up fitting a GLM with negative binomial distribution and an offset to account for population size. I first ran separate models for urgent and non-urgent visits, and included year, type and an interaction term (year $\times$ type) to test whether location type modifies the effect of year: glm.nb(VISITSURGENT~Year+Type+YearxType+offset(log(Pop/1000)),data=TREND) glm.nb(VISITSNONURGENT~Year+Type+YearxType+offset(log(Pop/1000)),data=TREND) I derived the average annual percent change for each location type, and I am able to determine whether there are significant differences in comparison to my reference level. My problem with the separate models is that I think I cannot compare coefficients between the models anymore. I can for example conclude that, in average, non-urgent visits in rural areas change by X% per year, which is significantly different from the change in non-urgent visits in large cities. But I cannot conclude that the average change in non-urgent visits in rural areas is different from the change of urgent visits in rural areas. Is that correct? I restructured the table and tried to fit one model with a three-way interaction. glm.nb(VISITS~Year+Type+Priority +YearxType + YearxPriority + TypexPriority+YearxPriorityxType + +offset(log(Pop/1000)), data=TREND) I got similar estimates, but different significance levels and confidence intervals. I do not understand why. This model is also a bit hard to interpret. What I want is to compare the annual change in visits per 1000 population between the combinations of type and priority. Is my last approach appropriate to do this? Is there a simpler way?
