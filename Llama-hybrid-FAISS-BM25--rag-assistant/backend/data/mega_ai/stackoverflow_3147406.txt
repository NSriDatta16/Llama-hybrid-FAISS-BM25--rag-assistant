Robert, it does work for me as long as you don't try to build an Eclipse application. I have integrated it into CruiseControl and I am quite happy with building and testing plugins. The main trick for me was to ignore all the P2/target stuff. I couldn't get it to work at all. Instead I call maven with an parameter that points to the Eclipse installation like this: mvn -Dtycho.targetPlatform=C:\Programmer\eclipse These are the necessary Plugin definitions: org.eclipse.tycho tycho-maven-plugin ${tycho-version} true org.eclipse.tycho tycho-compiler-plugin ${tycho-version} 1.6 1.6 Current Tycho Version is 0.13.0. I would like to build Eclipse Applications but need support myself for that. I hope that helps. Cheers, Klaus
