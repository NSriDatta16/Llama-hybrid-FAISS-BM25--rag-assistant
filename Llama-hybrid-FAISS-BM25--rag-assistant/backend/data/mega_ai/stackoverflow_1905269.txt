Relational database systems will be the best thing since sliced bread... ... when we (hopefully) get them, that is. SQL databases suck so hard it's not funny. What I find amusing (if sad) is certified DBAs who think an SQL database system is a relational one. Speaks volumes for the quality of said certification. Confused? Read C. J. Date's books. edit Why is it called Relational and what does that word mean? These days, a programmer (or a certified DBA, wink ) with a strong (heck, any ) mathematical background is an exception rather than the common case (I'm an instance of the common case as well). SQL with its tables , columns and rows , as well as the joke called Entity/Relationship Modelling just add insult to the injury. No wonder the misconception that Relational Database Systems are called that because of some Relationships (Foreign Keys?) between Entities (tables) is so pervasive. In fact, Relational derives from the mathematical concept of relations, and as such is intimately related to set theory and functions (in the mathematical, not any programming, sense). [ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finitary_relation][2] : In mathematics (more specifically, in set theory and logic), a relation is a property that assigns truth values to combinations ( k -tuples) of k individuals. Typically, the property describes a possible connection between the components of a k -tuple. For a given set of k -tuples, a truth value is assigned to each k -tuple according to whether the property does or does not hold. An example of a ternary relation (i.e., between three individuals) is: " X was-introduced-to Y by Z ", where (X,Y,Z) is a 3-tuple of persons; for example, "Beatrice Wood was introduced to Henri-Pierre Roché by Marcel Duchamp" is true, while "Karl Marx was introduced to Friedrich Engels by Queen Victoria" is false. Wikipedia makes it perfectly clear: in a SQL DBMS, such a ternary relation would be a " table ", not a " foreign key " (I'm taking the liberty to rename the "columns" of the relation: X = who, Y = to, Z = by): CREATE TABLE introduction ( who INDIVIDUAL NOT NULL , to INDIVIDUAL NOT NULL , by INDIVIDUAL NOT NULL , PRIMARY KEY (who, to, by) ); Also, it would contain (among others, possibly), this " row ": INSERT INTO introduction ( who , to , by ) VALUES ( 'Beatrice Wood' , 'Henri-Pierre Roché' , 'Marcel Duchamp' ); but not this one: INSERT INTO introduction ( who , to , by ) VALUES ( 'Karl Marx' , 'Friedrich Engels' , 'Queen Victoria' ); Relational Database Dictionary: relation (mathematics) Given sets s1 , s2 , ..., sn , not necessarily distinct, r is a relation on those sets if and only if it's a set of n -tuples each of which has its first element from s1 , its second element from s2 , and so on. (Equivalently, r is a subset of the Cartesian product s1 x s2 x ... x sn .) Set si is the i th domain of r ( i = 1, ..., n ). Note : There are several important logical differences between relations in mathematics and their relational model counterparts. Here are some of them: Mathematical relations have a left-to-right ordering to their attributes. Actually, mathematical relations have, at best, only a very rudimentary concept of attributes anyway. Certainly their attributes aren't named, other than by their ordinal position. As a consequence, mathematical relations don't really have either a heading or a type in the relational model sense. Mathematical relations are usually either binary or, just occasionally, unary. By contrast, relations in the relational model are of degree n , where n can be any nonnegative integer. Relational operators such as JOIN, EXTEND, and the rest were first defined in the context of the relational model specifically; the mathematical theory of relations includes few such operators. And so on (the foregoing isn't meant to be an exhaustive list).
