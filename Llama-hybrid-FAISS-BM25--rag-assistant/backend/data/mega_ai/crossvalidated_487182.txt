Significance Testing of Difference in Variances of Autocorrelated Time Series Data

I have two consecutive time series of different length that both vary around some common mean, but exhibit different variances, see exemplary figures below. Both show quite substantial autocorrelation. There is a large gap between the end of the first and the beginning of the second, so we can ignore correlations between the two series. How can I test if the variation in the second time series is significantly smaller than the variation in the first time series? Since the autocorrelation is quite large and, hence, samples are not independent, I cannot apply an F-test. Which statistical test can I use? Thanks! edit: To avoid confusion, I am interested in volatility overall, not in the (Gaussian) noise that remains in case I fit some function (like prophet, or some sinusoids, some MLP) to both time series to remove the autocorrelation. First Time Series: Second Time Series:
