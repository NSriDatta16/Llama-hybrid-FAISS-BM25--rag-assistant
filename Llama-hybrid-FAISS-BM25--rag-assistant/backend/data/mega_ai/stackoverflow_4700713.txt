Is ApplicationSettings working properly on emulator?

I have this simple xaml page to collect user information: My code behind is like this: //Set and display user a set of default values if user is accessing page for first time else retrieve data from the settings private void PhoneApplicationPage_Loaded(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e) { var settings = IsolatedStorageSettings.ApplicationSettings; if (settings.Contains("birthyear")) birthyear.Text = settings["birthyear"].ToString(); else { birthyear.Text = (DateTime.Now.Year - 25).ToString(); settings.Add("birthyear", birthyear.Text); } if (settings.Contains("postcode")) birthyear.Text = settings["postcode"].ToString(); else { postcode.Text = "10044"; settings.Add("postcode", postcode.Text); } } private void save_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e) { var settings = IsolatedStorageSettings.ApplicationSettings; //ignore error conditions for the time being! settings.Remove("birthyear"); settings.Add("birthyear", birthyear.Text); settings.Remove("postcode"); settings.Add("postcode", postcode.Text); settings.Save(); //Navigate to the same page to validate values entered by user is saved NavigationService.Navigate(new Uri("/MainPage.xaml", UriKind.Relative)); } Now coming to the problem. When the user navigates for the first time, the default values of 1986 and 10044 are shown. Now I edit the values, say 1999 and 65222 and select Save. What happens now is that the birthyear is showing 65222 and postcode is showing blank. What is the problem? Update: When I try to retrieve the values in the Intermediate Window in VS, the new values are displayed properly. I am guessing it is saving properly but is having problems while retrieving/displaying it
