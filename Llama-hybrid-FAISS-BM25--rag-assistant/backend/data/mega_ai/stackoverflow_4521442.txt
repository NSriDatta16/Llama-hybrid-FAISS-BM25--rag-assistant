You have to open a second file, write all non blank lines to it, delete the original file and rename the second file to the original name. EDIT: a real blank line will be like '\n': for line in f1.readlines(): if line.strip() == '': continue f2.write(line) a line with all blank fields would look like ',,,,,\n'. If you consider this a blank line: for line in f1.readlines(): if ''.join(line.split(',')).strip() == '': continue f2.write(line) openning, closing, deleting and renaming the files is left as an exercise for you. (hint: import os, help(open), help(os.rename), help(os.unlink)) EDIT2: Laurence Gonsalves brought to my attention that a valid csv file could have blank lines embedded in quoted csv fields, like 1, 'this\n\nis tricky',123.45 . In this case the csv module will take care of that for you. I'm sorry Laurence, your answer deserved to be accepted. The csv module will also address the concerns about a line like "","",""\n .
