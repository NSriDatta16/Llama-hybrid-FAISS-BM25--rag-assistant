The way I understand conditional expectation and teach my students is the following: conditional expectation $E[Y|\sigma(X)]$ is a picture taken by a camera with resolution $\sigma(X)$ As mentioned by Alecos Papadopoulos, the notation $E[Y|\sigma(X)]$ is more precise than $E[Y|X]$. Along the line of camera, one can think of $Y$ as the original object, e.g., a landscape, scenery. $E[Y|\sigma(X,Z)]$ is a picture taken by a camera with resolution $\sigma(X,Z)$. Expectation is an averaging operator ("blurring" operator?). The scenary may contain a lot of stuff, but the picture you took using a camera with low resolution will certainly make some detail go away, e.g., there may be an UFO in the sky that can be seen by your naked eye but it does not appear in your picture taken by (iphone 3?) If the resolution is so high such that $\sigma(X,Z)=\sigma(Y)$, then this picture is able to capture every detail of the real scenery. In this case, we have $E[Y|\sigma(Y)]=Y$. Now, $E[E[Y|\sigma(X,Z)]|\sigma(X)]$ can be viewed as: using another camera with resolution $\sigma(X)$ (e.g., iphone 1) which is lower than $\sigma(X,Z)$ (e.g., iphone 3) and take a picture on that picture generated by camera with resolution $\sigma(X,Z)$ , then it should be clear that this picture on a picture should be the same as if you originally just use a camera with low resolution $\sigma(X)$ on the scenery. This provides intuition on $E[E[Y|X,Z]|X]=E[Y|X]$. In fact this same intuition tells us that $E[E[Y|X]|X,Z]=E[Y|X]$ still. This is because: if your first picture is taken by iphone 1 (i.e., low resolution), and now you want to use a better camera (e.g., iphone 3) to generate another photo on the first photo, then there is no way you can improve the quality of the first photo.
