VSTS Code Coverage bug?

Has anyone experienced this VSTS Code Coverage "bug? " Do you have any suggestions? I am doing code coverage analysis with Visual Studio, which is generally an easy task now with the tools that are included. However, I have an issue that I can't overcome. Let's say I have assemblies A, B, C, and D and have marked them all for coverage analysis. I run the tests and look at the results and find a report that contains A, B, and C - but not D. I investigate and find that no tests actually execute any code in D (let's say it's the asp.net front end and I don't leverage UI testing yet). Because there are no tests for D causing D to be missing from the report the total code coverage percentage and "blocks not covered" are incorrect. Does anyone know how I can do either of the following? Calculate the total "number of blocks" in D so that I can manually adjust the coverage report to be correct? Get the Coverage report to automatically show the number of blocks not covered for assemblies that are instrumented for coverage but are not tested at all? While I do want test coverage to improve I am analyzing coverage reports saved at historic points in time in the code base. Thus I don't want to create a test that simply executes at least 1 block of code in each assembly and the re-calculate test coverage by running the tests. That would be a pretty time consuming work-around to something that seems like a simple problem.
