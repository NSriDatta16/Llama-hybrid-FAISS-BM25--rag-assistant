Would you use standard regression techniques like OLS and Logistic regression to estimated the nodes of a Bayes Net? If I understand your question correctly, you would like to model $P({\rm outcome} | {\rm features})$, where features are random variables in the continuous domain and outcome is probability of 0 or 1. Assume you are given training samples $(x_i, y_i)$, where $x_i$ are your features (real valued) and $y_i$ are the outcomes (binary valued, 0 or 1). You can model $P(Y|X)$ using a family of approaches. Logistic Regression (a single-layer neural network) basically models $P(Y|X) = sigmoid(A \cdot X + b)$, where $A, b$ are your parameters (feature weights and bias, respectively). That is, it assumes that the log-odds ($\log(p/(1-p))$) is a linear function of your features. You can read up more on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression . If you train the above function with a specific loss function (the cross-entropy loss, which you can read on the Wiki page), the minimiser will approximate the true posterior probability $P(Y|X)$.
