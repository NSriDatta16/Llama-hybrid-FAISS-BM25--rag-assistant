a question about leverage and variance of the predictor variable

In a simple linear regression: Assume that the leverage of a specific data point equals 1 (maximum leverage), from my understanding, it also means that the variance of the estimated error (e) of that particular data point equals to 0. does it also mean that the value of e must equal to zero (the prediction matches perfectly the true y value)? or not necessarily?
