It sounds like jQuery UI Selectable is what you're after, you can try it out here . To stay with OS conventions, they key it uses is Ctrl and not Shift , this isn't an option you can change without changing the jQuery UI code itself. It also has the feature of click and drag over elements to get a rectangular selection as well...if that's of any use.
