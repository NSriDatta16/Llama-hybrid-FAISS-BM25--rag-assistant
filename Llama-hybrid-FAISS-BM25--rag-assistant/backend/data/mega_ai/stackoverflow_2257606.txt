Making checkbox and radio labels clickable

A large number of (dare I say most?) sites do not make the labels clickable for their checkbox and radio inputs. It seems to be a huge usability gain for very little effort. Are there any compatibility/functionality/usability issues with using that would discourage developers from using this tag? Even Stack Overflow seems guilty of this, e.g., when asking a question, the Notify daily of any new answers checkbox label is not clickable.
