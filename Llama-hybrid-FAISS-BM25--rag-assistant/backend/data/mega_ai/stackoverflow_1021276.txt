Real Media is not bad at compression; but there are other codecs that better, and Real Media has patent and licensing issues, as well as being a poorly documented and supported protocol. Xiph (the people behind Ogg Vorbis) have published a comparison between the leading codecs (rm, mp3, wma, aac, and ogg) - you can listen and compare each of the codecs. If your data is already in mp3 (a lossy format) it would not be advisible to convert it, particularly to another lossy format. You won't gain anything much in storage, and you will automatically lose quality.
