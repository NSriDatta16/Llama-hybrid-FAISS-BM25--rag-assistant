Which classification techniques perform efficiently under homomorphic encryption

I am reading a paper ( pdf ) on homomorphic encryption and its use in machine learning. This paper explores classification methods like Fisher Linear Discriminant Classifier (FLD) and the Linear Means Classifier (LM), however I am curious if homomorphic encryption allows SVMs (with kernels) and Neural Networks to work efficiently. Is there performance evaluation or comparative study that exists ? EDIT: I did find some early adoption of polynomial approximation of Neural networks in a research paper. Unfortunately, I cannot link it here as it is yet to be published.
