Whether to use linear regression or not

Effects of growth hormone (GH) replacement with recombinant human GH on bone and mineral metabolism were studied in 36 GH-deficient children. Several outcomes, including serum ionized calcium levels, were assessed at pretherapy (zero months) and 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after the beginning of therapy. Simple linear regression was used to determine if changes in ionized calcium levels could be predicted from length of therapy. Each patientâ€™s ionized calcium level was employed in the analysis. Is the use of simple linear regression appropriate? a. Yes b. No c. The investigators should have used logistic regression instead
