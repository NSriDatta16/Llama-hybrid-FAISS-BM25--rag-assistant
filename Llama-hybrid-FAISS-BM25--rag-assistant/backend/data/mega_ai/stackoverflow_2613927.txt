As far as I can tell , an action will call render prior to executing any filters. Since render_to_string works by running render, saving the result to a string and essentially undoing the render, the "Can only render or redirect once per action" comes up because the temporary call to render comes after the "real" call to render. I fixed this, by simply calling my after method at the end of my action rather than using after_filter or around_filter. I also ended up moving my filters into a Mix-in, to more elegantly avoid the protection level issue.
