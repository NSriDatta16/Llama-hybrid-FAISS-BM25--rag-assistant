I've found a way to do this, not by closing but by disposing: IsolatedStreamWriter.Dispose(); IsolatedStorageFile.DeleteFile("log.log"); IsolatedStorageFileStream = new IsolatedStorageFileStream(logfilename, FileMode.Create, FileAccess.Write, FileShare.ReadWrite, _storageFile); Didn't get the 'truncate' approach to work, but no need now.
