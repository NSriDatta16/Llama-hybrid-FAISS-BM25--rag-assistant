It is hard to describe in short what you have to do in order to create an I/O stream for the new source or sink. Luckily, Jonathan Turkanis and CodeRage, LLC have created very nice building blocks with exceptional documentation that can help you save hundreds of hours of research and development of new streams. The library is called Boost.Iostreams . The second example in documentation exactly shows how to solve your problem. Also, note that they already have an output stream with zip compression. So maybe you don't even need to write a single line of code. Good luck!
