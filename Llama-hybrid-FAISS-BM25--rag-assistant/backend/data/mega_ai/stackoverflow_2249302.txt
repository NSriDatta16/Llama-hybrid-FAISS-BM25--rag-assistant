If you are on Windows and need to query data in a simple way, consider the built-in ESENT database engine ( http://blogs.msdn.com/windowssdk/archive/2008/10/23/esent-extensible-storage-engine-api-in-the-windows-sdk.aspx ). CodePlex has a .NET wrapper which includes a PersistentDictionary class ( http://managedesent.codeplex.com/ ) which works like a .NET dictionary, but is backed by a database file on disk.
