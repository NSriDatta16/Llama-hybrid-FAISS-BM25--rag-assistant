Just to add on the above I would also favour spliting before imputing or any type of pre-processing. Nothing you do with the training data should be informed by the test data (the analogy is that the future should not affect the past). You can then remember what you did to your training set if your test set also needs pre-processing or imputing, so that you do it the same way on both sets (the analogy is that you can use the past to help predict the future). If you use the test data to affect the training data in any way, then the test data is being used to build your model, so it ceases to be test data and will not provide a fair test of your model. You risk over fitting, and it was to discourage this that you separated out the test data in the first place! I think the caret package in r is very useful in that setting. I found in specific that post to be extremely helpful https://topepo.github.io/caret/model-training-and-tuning.html
