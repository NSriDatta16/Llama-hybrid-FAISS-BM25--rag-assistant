Personally, I find it very annoying to have to specify the access qualifier for every symbol. It makes things harder to read, not easier, and encourages the very bad habit of freely mixing private and public stuff throughout the class definition. I see this kind of mess all the time. In C#, I try to mitigate this with #region private , etc, which hopefully encourages future maintainers to keep things clean.
