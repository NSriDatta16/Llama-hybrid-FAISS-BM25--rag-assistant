I'm uncertain what your question is. Are you trying to decide how to build the widget itself? Or the widget system? The "desktop" part should probably be a canvas. The Widget itself is probably a canvas with your content in it. (Or perhaps just your content.) Don't forget to implement the dragging functionality. (There's a bit about that here: http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/quickstart/adding_drag_and_drop/ )
