My recommendation is to retain the significant though uninteresting factors as it's likely that your interesting parameters would be biased without them Use the raw data without aggregation. Aggregating would almost certainly wash out any interesting variance When you say 5 or 6 data points, do you really mean 5 or 6 observations? Are you a Bayesian? Then you can fit a model to those 5 or 6 observations and analyze the posterior. A frequentist wouldn't do that though...not for multiple regression.
