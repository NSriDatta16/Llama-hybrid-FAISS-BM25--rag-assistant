What is the defintion of variation in a box plot?

Variation is a term I have always been confused with. The first time I heard it, it was defined as "the different between the max and min values in a distribution". Lately, I've been hearing that variation is actually either the difference between the first and third quartiles or the average of the square of the deviations of each number. The question that I'm trying to do gives us a set of box plots and asks us to locate the day with the highest variation. If the first definition was correct, then Friday would be the clear winner (because of the outlier who got barely any sleep at all). If the second definition was correct, then Saturday would be the winner. I'm not sure if I'm making a mistake or confusing different terms, so can somebody please point me in the right direction?
