How to get the URL to a configurable item in Magento?

I am using magento and creating a product finder. Is there a way I can link to a configurable item example: mystore.com/bedding-sheets lets say I want to send a friend a link to the sheet that is 250*250cm i would think the link was maybe: mystore.com/bedding-sheets?attribute496=1 (except this is not the case) Size * Choose option... 200*200cm 200*230cm 200*250cm 250*250cm Anyone know if it's possible to create such a link? EDIT: So i was able to find out how to add an item to my cart using /checkout/cart/add?product=47&qty=1&super_attribute[496]=4 however I want the user to get a preview of the item they will receive, instead of just dumping it into the cart.
