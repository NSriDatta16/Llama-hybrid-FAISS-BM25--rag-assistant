I've worked in both and in terms of richness and development time WinForms blows Web out of the water, especially since technologies like ClickOnce greatly reduce deployment headaches. With winforms you only have to code against the platform and not take into consideration a huge number of other factors. The whole request/response is usually, IMO cumbersome and sometimes unreliable, not to mention the growing number of browsers to support, varying standards to development and the learning curve of the page lifecycle, oh and of course the increasing trend of advertising splashed all over the place. However, what web apps have brought us is beyond what WinForms could hope to achieve, so although there's a learning curve and increased development time there are obvious rewards to reap. We (and I imagine most organistions) tend to use windows applications for administration purposes where a rich user interface is desirable in the minimal amount of time, after all, why would you want to waste a web servers resources when there's probably 99% available CPU on each users PC...?
