Is there an elegant way to upgrade jQuery slowly?

We are wanting to upgrade from one version of jQuery to another. We use various online plug-in's and have written many of our own. The challenge now comes in the form of trying to SLOWLY MIGRATE all your scripted objects SLOWLY without a complete re-write. I have an idea on HOW to handle this: BUT I HAVE QUESTIONS: Is the idea below even a good idea? Can I (directly) tell each jQuery object where dependencies live? If this is a bad idea...how do YOU handle it? Do I simply re-write EVERY object that happens to break upon upgrading? (sux!) EXPLAINING THE ISSUE: If all your plug-in's live ONLY within the scope of a single page, then different versions are easily addressed: simply do your file-includes at the page level instead of the master-page level (duh!). However, objects that live in the master-page or in user-controls are a bit tougher...as they need specific versions to run correctly. HERE'S MY IDEA: The definition of a plug-in starts with an anonymous function. (function ($){ })(jQuery); All of the dependencies I've seen use this as a starting point. EXAMPLES: jQuery dependencies include plug-ins like: ui.widget, ui.position, ui.core, etc. So what if I reference each version of jQuery (and its dependencies) using a JavaScript object and pass THAT OBJECT INTO the various in-house and online plug-ins? THE OBJECT REFERENCES MIGHT GO LIKE THIS: var jQueryVersion1_3_2 = function(){ }; var jQueryVersion1_4_4 = function(){ }; THE PLUG-INS: My in-house and online plug-ins could still be included as (normal) file-links, but with the following changes GO FROM THIS: // Plug-in X (function ($){ })(jQuery); // Plug-in Y (function ($){ })(jQuery); // Plug-in Z (function ($){ })(jQuery); ...versioning sucks here! TO THIS... // Plug-in X (function ($){ })(jQueryVersion1_3_2); // Plug-in Y (function ($){ })(jQueryVersion1_3_2); // Plug-in Z (function ($){ })(jQueryVersion1_4_4); ...now we can upgrade our objects SLOWLY. THE ONLY ISSUE I SEE: The challenge becomes the plug-in dependencies (between versions). In a test upgrade the following began to break across various plug-ins, things like: ui.widget, ui.position, ui.core, etc. (all broke upon upgrading). THE ONLY ANSWER I SEE IS: Wrapping jQuery and all the various references into a single function and saving THAT into the variable above. Then pass THAT intermediary object into each plug-in AS jQuery. Help me Obi-Wan Kenobi...you're my only hope!
