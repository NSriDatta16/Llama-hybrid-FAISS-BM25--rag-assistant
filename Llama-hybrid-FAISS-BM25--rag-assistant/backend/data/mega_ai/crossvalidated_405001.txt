I think the Wilson score confidence interval can be applied directly to your problem. The score used in the blog was a lower bound of the confidence interval instead of an expected value. Another method for such problem is to correct (bias) our estimation towards some prior knowledge we have, for example the overall view/rep ratio. Say the number of views per reputation follows a normal distribution $v \sim N(\mu,\sigma) $ , then the view/rep ratio can be interpreted as the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of the distribution mean $\mu$ . The problem is, as you mentioned, when there is insufficient data, the MLE result is of high variance (overfitting). A simple solution for this is to introduce a prior distribution of $\mu$ and do maximum a posteriori estimation (MAP). The prior distribution $p(\mu)$ can be another normal distribution estimated from all the samples we have. In practice, this is essentially a weighted average of the overall view/rep ratio and the user view/rep ratio, $$Î¼_{MAP}=\frac{n\mu_{MLE}+c\mu_0}{n+c}$$ where $n$ is the number of reps a user have, $c$ is a constant, $\mu_{MLE}$ is the view/rep ratio of the user and $\mu_0$ the overall view/rep ratio. To compare the two methods (Wilson score confidence interval lower bound and MAP), they both give an accurate estimation when there are sufficient data (reps), when the number of reps is small, Wilson lower bound method will bias towards zero and MAP will bias towards the mean.
