I interpret this question as asking about the situation that @mdewey described in the comments, that is, half of the units are sampled each time and then replaced , so that units can and will be sampled multiple times. In that case, you can calculate this probability using the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a Geometric distribution with parameter $p=0.5$. This shows that, for example, in order to cover at least 95% of the population on average , you'd need to take 5 samples . If you want more refined probabilistic statements about the chances of including X% of the population in one of the samples (e.g., you want to know whether you have a 90% chance of covering 95% of the population, not just whether the expected proportion of sampled units exceeds 95%), then you can use the Geometric CDF value from above as the parameter $p$ of a Binomial distribution .
