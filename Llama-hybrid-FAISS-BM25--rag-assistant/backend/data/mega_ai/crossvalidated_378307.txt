Random forest regressor has a negative score

I am using a RandomForestRegressor. When I check the score for the model with the training data, it's Rregressor.score(X_train,y_train) 0.8357837327169805 but when I check the score using the test set, it's negative Rregressor.score(X_validate,y_validate) -0.5022815681820925 Is this overfitting? Is this the right way to check how good a model is? What are the ways to improve the performance?
