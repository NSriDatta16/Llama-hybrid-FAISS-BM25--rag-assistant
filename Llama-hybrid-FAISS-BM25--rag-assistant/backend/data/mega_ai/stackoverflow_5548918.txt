Transferring GetBitmapBits() over the network, safe?

I'm doing GetBitmapBits() over an HBITMAP and storing the pixels in a plain char* buffer and sending that buffer over network. The client is then "reconstructing" the bitmap using SetBitmapBits() in its window. My question is pretty simple: Is there any probable or possible situation when reconstruction might not be possible? Maybe for the internal byte storage format of these pixel data? Client and server are not guaranteed to use the same version of Windows. Server may use XP whereas the client may use Vista or Windows 7, for instance.
