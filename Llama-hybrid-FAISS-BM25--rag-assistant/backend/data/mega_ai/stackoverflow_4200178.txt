How to create Eclipse project from existing git repo

I have an existing project utilizing git and have just installed eclipse along with egit. I pointed to the git repository with egit and can see all my files, my existing branches and can switch between branches. When I open a file from the view of the git repository it does not seem to recognize that it is a php file, doesn't show me the classes within it and doesn't do code completion. If I just drag a file in from explorer it at least recognizes that file as php, but doesn't understand the project well enough to show me code completion from installed libraries. I think I need to configure eclipse to understand the projects home directory, but am a bit lost. Any help would be appreciated.
