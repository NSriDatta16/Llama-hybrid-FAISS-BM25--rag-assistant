To generate a forecast more accurately for the next year given past 3 years of history, you will need more granular data. At least monthly sales, so that the forecast can capture trend and/seasonality. With three data points, you will at best be able to generate a moving average forecast. Which isn't very good. If you have more granular data, use the forecast package in R. The forecast() function will pick the best method based on the time series pattern. You don't need to worry about stationarity or heteroscedasticity either. For new products, you have two options. Explore diffusion curves such as Bass. Or, base the forecast curve on previous new product launches if there are shared attributes with existing products. If it's a brand new product line, evaluate market trends to generate the forecast. New product forecasting is a very difficult problem as such.
