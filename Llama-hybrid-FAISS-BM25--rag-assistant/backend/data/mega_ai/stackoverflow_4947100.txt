JQuery 1.5 Data Api Changes Impacting JQuery UI

I've just upgraded to jQ 1.5 and jQUI 1.8.9 and my sortables have started behaving very oddly. I've got linked sortables and when I drag items across they randomly seem to stop and it generally seems flaky. Are there any changes required by the upgrade? UPDATE -- Getting a number of errors in the JQuery UI js file Cannot read property 'sortables' of undefined on line 1504 Cannot read property options of undefined on line 1585 and 1627 Cannot read property 'element' of undefined on 1461 UPDATE -- Here's a minimal example Instructions: Drag an item from the red box (draggables) over the first blue sortable box and into the second blue sortable box. The drag should terminate when trying to mouse into the second box. It seems jquery ui is not necessarily at fault here, changing the jquery reference to 1.4.4 fixes the issue so I think this may be a problem in jquery itself, specifically with some changes to the data api. $(function () { $('.sortable').sortable({ connectWith: '.sortable' }).disableSelection(); $('.draggable>div').draggable({ connectToSortable: '.sortable' }); }); .draggable { border: 1px solid red; margin-bottom: 15px; width: 50%; padding: 5px;} .sortable { border: 1px solid blue; margin-bottom: 15px; width: 50%; padding: 5px;} Drag 1 Drag 2 Drag 3 Sort 1 Sort 2 Sort 3 Sort 4 Sort 5 Sort 6
