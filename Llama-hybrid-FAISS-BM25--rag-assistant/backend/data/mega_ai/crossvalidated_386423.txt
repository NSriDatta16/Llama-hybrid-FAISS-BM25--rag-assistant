Quadratic model of data?

Is it possible to fit a quadratic or polynomial model with this type of data? Two inputs, input one is a temperature sensor: Input two is a valve opening on a scale from 0-100: This is a scatter plot of the relationship between the two: Ultimately I am hoping to fit the data to a model about the relationship and then create some sort of a function (using Python) to create some simulated results.. Can someone give me a few tips on how to go about this maybe from a statistics standpoint? I understand regression but I have yet to venture onto logistic regression and beyond to fit data like this. (not a lot of wisdom here) Anything related to a Python package would be helpful too.
