The best route to achieve what you want ("cron job creates data for use by javascript") is to go via JSON. This involves: Create a cron job that a) fetches the data, and b) writes it to a file formatted using JSON conventions which is accessible from your web server, Amend your html to include the file created by the cron job. For simplicity you could create the javascript file using contents similar to the following: var agentValues = [ "excel", "msword", "ppt", ]; You can easily create this with a static first and last line, and simply add the quoted values from your query in between. You can then load this file into your html document like any other javascript: When you populate the autocomplete values, simply use a for loop over this array: for (var i = 0; i " + agentValues[i] + " ").appendTo($values); } The above would be the most basic version of achieving your aims, and you can improve on it, e.g. by: Adding error checking Structuring your namespace so that you don't have many top-level variables Adding the data values to your existing javascript, rather than a separate file etc.
