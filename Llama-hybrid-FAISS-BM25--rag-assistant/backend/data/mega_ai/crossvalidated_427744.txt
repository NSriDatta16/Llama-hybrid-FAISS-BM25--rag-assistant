The procedure that you had following is recommended for specify an ARMA model. Your results show that the series in difference is like a white noise process. Actually this mean that no ARMA model can make prediction better than a long run mean. For example, results like yours was historically used to achieve conclusion of unpredictability for stock returns. However this conclusion is exaggerated because the results above can lead us to exclude linear auto-predictability but not predictability at all. Firstly is possible to have better result using others predictor, not only lag values; think about Granger causality (predictability). Secondly you can try to predict your variable with ARMA tool after some transformation of original data. Otherwise you can to use model that involve non linear relations among predicted variable and predictors; an example is Artificial Neural Networks. If your objective is prediction your work is not ending, its starting.
