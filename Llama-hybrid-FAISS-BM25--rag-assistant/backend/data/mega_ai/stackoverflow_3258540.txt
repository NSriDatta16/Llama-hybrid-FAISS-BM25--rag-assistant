You could use OpenCV for video processing, it's a cross platform image/video processing library: http://opencv.willowgarage.com Your code would look something like this: CvCapture* capture = NULL; if ((capture = cvCaptureFromCAM(-1)) == NULL) { std::cerr imageData cvShowImage("webcam", &src); char key_pressed = cvWaitKey(2); if (key_pressed == 27) break; } cvReleaseCapture(&camera); I had success using OpenCV on Mac OS X using cvCaptureFromCAM(0) instead of passing it -1. On linux, -1 seems to do Ok.
