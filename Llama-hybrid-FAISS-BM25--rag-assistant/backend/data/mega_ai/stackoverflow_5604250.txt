The private key must be added to ssh and not mercurial / hgrc. You have to configure your ssh client to use your private key, but this depends greatly on the system you're using. If you're on linux or mac os x, google some informations about using ssh-agent on your distribution. If you're on Windows, you can use pageant for example.
