The algorithm remained vague to me until I dove into the code. See my blogpost to walk through the mathematics of cᵥ step-by-step. In words, I would describe it as follows: In cᵥ coherence, each topic word is compared with the set of all topics. A boolean sliding window of size 110 is used to assess whether two words co-occur. Then, the confirmation measure consists of a direct- and indirect confirmation. That is, for all N most probable words per topic, a ‘word vector’ of size N is created in which each cell contains the Normalized Pointwise Mutual Information (NPMI) between that word and word i, i in{1,2,…,N}. Then, all the word vectors in a topic are aggregated into one big topic vector. The average of all the cosine similarities between each topic word and its topic vector (this is the segmentation) is used to calculate the Cᵥ score.
