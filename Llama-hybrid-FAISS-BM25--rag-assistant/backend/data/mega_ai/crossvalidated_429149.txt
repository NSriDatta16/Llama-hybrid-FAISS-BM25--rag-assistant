Probability Distribution with random variable

This is a question from my textbook, there is no answers at the back and I am fairly new to statistics, my answers for questions a-c are below, can anyone check if I answered them correctly? This is a weighted average question: Mean: E(X)= ∑〖xp(x)〗= 7(0.05)+8(0.08)+9(0.10)+10(0.14)+11(0.28)+12(0.21)+13(0.14)= 10.71 Variance: X values: 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 X^2 values: 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144, 169, 196 E(X^2) = 49(0.05)+64(0.08)+81(0.10)+100(0.14)+121(0.28)+144(0.21)+196(0.14)=121.23 Variance= E(X^2) –E(X)2=121.23-(10.71)2= 6.53 Standard deviation= √6.53 = 2.56 b) mean + one standard deviation = 10.71+2.56= 13.27 p(x>13.27)= 0 % c) Exactly two buy size 11: (0.28)(0.28)(0.72)= 5.64%
