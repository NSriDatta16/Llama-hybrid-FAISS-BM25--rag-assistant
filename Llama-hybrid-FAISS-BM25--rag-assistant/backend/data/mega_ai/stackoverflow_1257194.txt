DomainUpDown (spinner) control is cutting off the bottom pixel of displayed text

I'm using winforms and the DomainUpDown control's height is locked at 20 pixels, which results in "y"'s and other characters with descenders cut off on the bottom. My initial thought about how to fix the problem was to change the controls height, but I couldn't do so. In the designer I only have controls to drag it's size by width. The property page immediately reverts any change to height I make. Attempts to change the value in code silently fail; no error, no exception, but no change to the value either. In this sample form the "g" in the DomainUpDown will be cut. public partial class Form1 : System.Windows.Forms.Form { private System.Windows.Forms.DomainUpDown domainUpDown1 = new System.Windows.Forms.DomainUpDown(); public Form1() { this.domainUpDown1.Location = new System.Drawing.Point(16, 8); this.domainUpDown1.Size = new System.Drawing.Size(212, 20); this.domainUpDown1.Text = "why are descenders like g cut?"; this.ClientSize = new System.Drawing.Size(328, 64); this.Controls.Add(this.domainUpDown1); } }
