solution for large contingency table

I have performed logistic regression using SPSS on my data with a dichotomous variable as the dependent variable with three independent variables and three covariates (they are mostly categorical) The problem is that my sample size is really small (88). The categorical variable has two or three categories within in, so it results in a huge contingency table.. I have tried to combine categories together, but the contingency table is still huge.. How do I know if I have enough sample to fill all the cells? What can I do differently to overcome this problem?
