As you probably know, naive here implies that the "fields" are independent. So your question boils down to does correlation imply dependence. Yes, it does. See here. https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/113417/does-non-zero-correlation-imply-dependence So, if your features show correlation then this will have an adverse effect on the naive assumption. Despite this fact, Naive Bayes has been shown to be robust against this assumption. If your model still suffers from this, however, you could consider transforming the space to be independent with methods such as PCA.
