Would installing Perl 5.8.x or 5.10.x make a big impact on how my code runs if it was developed in 5.6.x?

What are the impacts (If any) by developing code in Perl 5.6.1 but running the code in Perl 5.8.x or 5.10.x? I'm using these modules: (For Linux) HTTP::Request HTTP::Response LWP::UserAgent Unicode::String XML::DOM DateTime::Format::DateManip (For Windows) Unicode-String XML-DOM DateTime-Format-DateManip (Haven't installed this yet on Windows, still looking for package)
