Your requirements are way to general. For MS SQL server 100k (more or less "normal") records per days should not be a problem, if you have decent hardware. Obviously you want to write fast to the database, but you ask for optimization for retrieval performance. That does not match very well! ;-) Tuning a database is a special skill on its own. So you will never get the general answer you would like to have.
