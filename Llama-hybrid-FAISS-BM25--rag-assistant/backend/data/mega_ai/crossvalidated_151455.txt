Robinson's Geometric Mean Test

I am reading this book : Ending Spam: Bayesian Content Filtering and the Art of Statistical Language Classification by Jonathan A. Zdziarski page 78 is about the Robinsons Geometric Mean Test. This is how it looks, but I don't know what $P1,\ldots,PN$ and $N$ are. I think this is word probability, but is it counted like this: A = number of word in spam messages / number of spam messages B = number of word in ham messages / number of ham messages P(N) = A / (A + B) or..?
