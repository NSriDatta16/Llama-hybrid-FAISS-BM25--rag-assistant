How can I visualise the memory (SRAM) usage of an AVR program?

I have encountered a problem in a C program running on an AVR microcontroller (ATMega328P). I believe it is due to a stack/heap collision but I'd like to be able to confirm this. Is there any way I can visualise SRAM usage by the stack and the heap? Note: the program is compiled with avr-gcc and uses avr-libc. Update: The actual problem I am having is that the malloc implementation is failing (returning NULL ). All malloc ing happens on startup and all free ing happens at the end of the application (which in practice is never since the main part of the application is in an infinite loop). So I'm sure fragmentation is not the issue.
