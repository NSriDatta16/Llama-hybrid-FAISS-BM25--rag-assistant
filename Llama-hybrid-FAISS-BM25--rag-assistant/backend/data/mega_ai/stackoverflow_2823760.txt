I suggest trashing your code and starting over. Here are suggestions: 1. Use standard library functions and structures. Don't write wrappers around them. For example, there is no need for an OpenFile method. It just makes the program harder to read, wastes your time and annoys the pig . 2. Use angle brackets, , around standard headers. The angle brackets tell the compiler to search first in "system" or compiler directories first. 3. Read data then sort. Read all of your data into a { standard } container, then sort the container. Sorting after every line wastes computer time and annoys the pig . 4. Prefer to prefix std functions with std . For example, std::cout instead of cout . Ah but you say "I can just include using namespace std; ". Yes, but this opens the doors wide open to everything in the std namespace. Another mitigated solution is to identify each std function with namespace: using std::cout . Keep the namespace identities small. 5. Prefer EXIT_SUCCESS and EXIT_FAILURE. Standard values to return from main are EXIT_SUCCESS and EXIT_FAILURE . These are defined in . 6. Pass streams to your object's Print methods This will allow you to send the output to a file or the console without changing the object's code. A good example is tracing the output. Direct the output to a file so it doesn't disappear (like writing to a console). 7. Learn to use iterators and algorithms Standard containers support iterators. You can easily print the contents of a std::list or std::vector by using std::copy and iterators. The std::sort algorithm can be applied to containers by using iterators (except those containers that already have sort methods). 8. Keep it simple Keep your program as simple as possible, but no simpler. Simple programs have fewer errors and run faster than large and complex programs (and they have less chance of annoying the pig). "Never teach a pig to sing, it wastes your time and annoys the pig." -- Old joke "Everything should be as simple as possible, but no simpler." -- paraphrasing Albert Einstein.
