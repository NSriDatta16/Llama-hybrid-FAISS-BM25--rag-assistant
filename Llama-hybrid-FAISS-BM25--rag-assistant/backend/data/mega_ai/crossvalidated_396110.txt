Time series with multiple variables and different start date

I have a dataset where sales values of multiple products are available. Some products have data starting from Jan 2014, but some products have data starting later than that and its varying for various products. I have tried to convert the series into a pivot table with each product Id as the colummn name and then converted the dataframe to a TS startig from Jan 2014. But, the products which start later than Jan 14, for example July 14 have the first 6 values as NA. The forecast code which uses a for loop and forecast function from the forecast package is unable to forecast all the product's sales because of NA and I get NaN or 0s as the output for these products. My questions: Is there some other method which can be used in my case? I am thinking of dealing with individual product's data seperately and convert it to a TS based on its start date. But I am not sure how to do that. Sample code: library(dplyr) library(tidyverse) library(reshape2) library(tidyr) library(forecast) set.seed(354) df % select(Product_Id, Date, Sales) %>% spread(Product_Id, Sales) #Convert to a time series df_new2 fcast2 is unable to produce the output of all the products. The language I am using is R. Any idea or suggestion would be appreciated.
