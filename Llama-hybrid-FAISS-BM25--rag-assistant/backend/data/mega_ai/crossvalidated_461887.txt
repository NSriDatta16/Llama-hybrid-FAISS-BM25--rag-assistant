This is roughly the deal if I've transcribed these correctly. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantile_regression for $\rho_p$ . Logistic Regression: $$ p(y_{thresh}) = \arg \min_{p} \sum_i J^{logistic}(p, y_i Quantile Regression $$ y(p_{thresh}) = \arg \min_{y} \sum_i \rho_p(y_i - y) $$ Question is (I can't remember) are the score functions for these variational problems the only ones possible for MLE? If not, is there a pairing that guarantees equivalence in the sense the the same pairings $(p, y)$ are generated?
