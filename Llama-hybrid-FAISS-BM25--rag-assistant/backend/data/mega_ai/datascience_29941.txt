Reinforcement Learning with static state

Can Q Learning work with a static state for each step? What I mean by that is that the actions do not influence the following state at all. The episodes just iterate over the same data over and over again. Of course the different actions lead to different rewards, but is Q Learning the right concept to use in this case? What other types could you suggest?
