a gem for handling accounts?

Just wondering my question maybe a little vague but perhaps there's a more elegant solution. Imagine you have a team-based application and multiple users shares one account. One team will have one account id, so everytime you fetch data for a particular user, you always fetch their data according to their account id, like so: articles = Wiki.find_all_by_account_id(1) files = File.find_all_by_account_id(1) tasks = Task.find_all_by_account(1) Basically every time you pull data out of a db should always be for a particular account This is how I handle it right now but perhaps just wondering if there's any elegant solution? Thanks.
