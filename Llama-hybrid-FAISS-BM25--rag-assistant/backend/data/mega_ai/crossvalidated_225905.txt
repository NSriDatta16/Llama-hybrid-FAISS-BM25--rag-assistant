How to test differences in means in a population that is not normally distributed, heteroskedastic and differs in variance?

I want to test if the means of two populations are different from each other. There are 12 poulations, all with different sample size, ranging from 48.000 to 300. Here is a 20.000 rows sample . The data is the result of quantitative content analysis. str(data) data.frame: 75627 obs. of 2 variables: $ A: Factor w/ 12 levels "1", "2", "3" ... $ B: num 10 98 56 72 98.3 .... mean F) group 10 9.9826 The Breusch-Pagan test gives me a value of 0.0005622, so it seems the data is heteroskedastic My question: how can i test under these circumstances, if a mean of one group is statistically different from another? The Central Limit Theorem says that I could use a t.test, but the shapiro.test indicates, that it is far from normally distributed. Furthermore the variance seem to be different from each other and heteroskedastic.
