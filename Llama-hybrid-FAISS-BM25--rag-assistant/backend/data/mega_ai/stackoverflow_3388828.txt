This would take a bit more infrastructure to set up and is more for multiple people working together, but the best approach is to start thinking of Software as a Service. For commonly used functions, wrap them as a web service with good documentation. For instance, if you have a phone validator that seems to be constantly used across projects, it would become part of your validator service. With few exceptions, most shops don't seem to organize/share code effectively with static document type code libraries. This would also force you to refactor the code snippets into reusable methods instead of just random code that is copied/pasted in. It also gives you a clean seperation between the public interface and private implementation.
