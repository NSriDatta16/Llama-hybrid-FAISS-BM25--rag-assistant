Is there a legal way for me to embed the Calibri font into a website for non Windows Vista/7 visitors?

I would like to use Calibri for my website. I would like to use the Calibri font for my website even when the visitor does not have the font installed (ie. non Windows Vista/7 visitors). Does Microsoft allow embedding of the Calibri font into a Web Site? If so, what technology do they allow this? EOT? Thanks.
