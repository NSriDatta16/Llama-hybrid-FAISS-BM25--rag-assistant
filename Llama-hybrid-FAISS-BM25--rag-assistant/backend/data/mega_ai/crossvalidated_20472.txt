In completion of both earlier answers, mixing is only one aspect of MCMC convergence. It is indeed directly connected with the speed of forgetting the initial value or distribution of the Markov chain $(X_n)$. For instance,the mathematical notion of $\alpha$-mixing is defined by the measure $$ \alpha(n) = \sup_{A,B} \left\{\,|P(X_0\in A,X_n\in\cap B) - P(X_0\in A)P(X_n\in B)\right\}\,, n\in \mathbb{N}\,, $$ whose speed of convergence to zero is characteristic of the mixing. However, this measure is not directly related to the speed with which $(X_n)$ converges to the target distribution $\pi$. One may get very fast convergence to the target and still keep high correlation between the elements of the chain. Furthermore, independence between the $X_n$'s is only relevant in some settings. When aiming at integration, negative correlation (a.k.a. antithetic simulation ) is superior to independence. About your specific comment that ...the accepted candidate draws should and will concentrated in the high density part of the posterior distribution. If what I understand is true, then do we still want the chain to move through the support ( which includes the low density part) ? the MCMC chain explores the target in exact proportion to its height (in its stationary regime) so indeed spends more time in the higher density region(s). That the chain must cross lower density regions is relevant when the target has several high density components separated by low density regions. (This is also called a multimodal setting.) Slow mixing may prevent the chain from crossing such low density regions. The only regions $(X_n)$ the chain should never visit are the regions with zero probability under the target distribution.
