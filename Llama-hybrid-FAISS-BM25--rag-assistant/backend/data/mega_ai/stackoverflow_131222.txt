I initially tried to model what I thought organic systems were like. Ultimately decided that was no good, and went more aggressive, with 10% kept, 20% mutated, 60% crossbred, and 10% random. Then I noticed my top 10% were all roughly identical. So I increased the random to 30%. That helped some, but not much. I did try multiple island, and generation-skipping, and reseeding, which gave better results, but still highly unsatisfactory, very little variation in the top 10%, crazy-long numbers of generations to get any results. Mostly the code learned how to hack my fitness evaluation. It's really easy to get top performers, so don't worry about keeping too many of them around. Crossbreeds help to pare down positive and negative traits, so they're useful, but really what you want to get is a lot of good random bred in. Focus on mutations and new randoms to bring in features, and let the crossbreeds and top performers just keep track of the best and refine them more slowly. IE: stuff based on the last generation is just finding a better local maxima, randoms find better global maxima. I still believe optimal answers to your question can be found by observing natural phenomena, such as in a recent article regarding randomness of fruit-fly flight paths, so that may pan out. Probably the best answer is to just run it and tweak it, don't be afraid to tweak it pretty heavily, the populations are robust. Make sure you implement a way to save and continue.
