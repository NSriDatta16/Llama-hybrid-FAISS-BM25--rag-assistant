From Code Complete (1st Edition, page 188) "Gorla, Benander and Benander found that the effort required to debug a COBOL program was minimized when variables had names that averaged 10 to 16 characters (1990). Programs with names averaging 8 to 20 characters were almost as easy to debug." This constitutes the only empirical discussion of a reasonable guideline for variable name length I've ever seen. Everything else is down to opinion and comfort.
