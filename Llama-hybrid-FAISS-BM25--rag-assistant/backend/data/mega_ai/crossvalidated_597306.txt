Accuracy score of my KNN model is constant as k increases?

This is my first time using a machine learning algorithm. It is for a school project. My model is attempting to predict from inputs: Weight, Height, and Age whether an Olympic athlete (100-meter dash) wins a medal or not. Here is the relevant code: #Normalize the data train_athletics_m = min_max_normalization(train_athletics_m) test_athletics_m = min_max_normalization(test_athletics_m) X = train_athletics_m[['Age', 'Weight', 'Height']] y = train_athletics_m['Medal'] test = test_athletics_m[['Age', 'Weight', 'Height']] test_labels = test_athletics_m['Medal'] classifier = KNeighborsClassifier() classifier.score(test, test_labels) I tested various k values. The worst accuracy is when k=1 (88%), but for k > 3, the accuracy stays constant (94%). I was under the impression that the usual behavior would be for accuracy to reach a peak and then decrease until it stabilizes as k goes onward. Also, my accuracy scores are higher than I expected. I am wondering if this is normal, and if not, where would my error most likely be in?
