What is the benefit of using Max pooling in convnets as opposed to just using convolution layers? (from Francois Chollet's Deep Learning with Python)

I am reading Francois Chollet's Deep learning with python , and I came across a section about max pooling that's really giving me trouble. I simply don't understand what he means when he talks about "What's wrong with this setup?". How does removing the max pooling layers "reduce" the amount of the initial image that we're looking at?
