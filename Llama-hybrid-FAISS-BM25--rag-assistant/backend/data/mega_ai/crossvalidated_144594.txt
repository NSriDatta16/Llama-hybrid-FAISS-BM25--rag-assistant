In a Poisson model, $$E[y \vert x]=\exp(\alpha + \beta x + \gamma x \cdot b).$$ The derivative would be $$\frac{\partial E[y \vert x]}{\partial x}=\frac{\partial \exp(\alpha + \beta x + \gamma x \cdot b )}{\partial x}=\exp(\alpha + \beta x + \gamma x \cdot b)\cdot(\beta+\gamma b).$$ This is a function of $x$ and $b$ , and folks create many types of marginal effects. One option is to use the means, but that might be weird for binary variables since you might evaluate the derivative for someone who is .75 female. It might be strange for continuous variables if $x$ has a weird distribution. Another option is to set all the dummies to their modes or to zero, the base. Another option is to use own values of the covariates for each observation and then average the derivatives. Personally, I like this one the most. mfx allows you to easily do the first with atmean=TRUE and the last with atmean=FALSE . However, I am not sure if it will handle interactions on the fly, so it may omit the $\gamma b$ term.
