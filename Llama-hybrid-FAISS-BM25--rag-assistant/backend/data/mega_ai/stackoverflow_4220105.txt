I'm not sure exactly what you mean by data content type for an application. Applications are released as APKs. When you wish to open up a pdf or other type of file a broadcast is sent to the system. In this broadcast is an intent and that intent stores the action and the data type of its content (including the content or path to it). The system then looks through all the IntentFilters for an application that claims it can perform the given action on the given data type. If there are several it than asks you to store the preference. On the other hand, if you are trying to find all the pdf files, than you don't you scan the storage to all files ending in .pdf Does this answer your questions?
