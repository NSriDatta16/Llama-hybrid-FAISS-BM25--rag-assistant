just created a brand new project with nothing inside it other than a UIView and a button and it is still happening This makes me think that you are not quite setting things up properly. If this is the application nib file, and it contains nothing but a UIView , then the File's Owner will be your application delegate, regardless of what you set the type of file's owner to be in IB. Try the following: Create an instance of Contact in your nib file: drag in a UIViewController object, and set its class to Contact . Wire up the view and the button up to your Contact instance. Let us know if that works :)
