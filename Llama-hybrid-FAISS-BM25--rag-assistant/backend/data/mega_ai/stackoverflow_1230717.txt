The ProcessModel key is only used for ASP.NET, and even then, on Windows Server 2003 it's pretty much useless because you have the Application Pool configuration. The /3GB switch does not apply to 64-bit Windows. As I understand it, you CAN get OutOfMemoryExceptions if you have objects pinned in memory preventing the GC from effectively defragmenting the memory stack when a collection occurs. You should strongly consider moving your service to a 64-bit application if you know you are jamming gigabytes of data into it. IMO you're playing with fire if you are coming this close to the limit.
