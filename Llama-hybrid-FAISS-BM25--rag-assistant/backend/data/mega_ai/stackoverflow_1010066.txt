In Intellij IDEA you can set your preferences on Settings->Code Style->Imports and then optimize imports for the project by pointing to the directory in the project view and choosing Code->Optimize Imports. To the cletus who asks why you want to do this, a look at imports can give you a first approximation of dependencies of a given class, especially regarding third party jars (you can pick up that they are used, and then follow their documented dependencies). Sometimes that is useful, so you may want to keep them organized. But in general I agree, it is not usually necessary to care.
