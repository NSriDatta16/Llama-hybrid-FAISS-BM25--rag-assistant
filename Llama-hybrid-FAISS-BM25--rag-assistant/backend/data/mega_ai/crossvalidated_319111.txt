Here's my "Bayesian" slant on your question. I think you have described a situation where two people with different prior information should get a different answer/conclusion when given the same dataset. A more blunt/extreme example is suppose that we have a "researcher 1b" who just happens to guess the regression model parameters and conclusions from whatever hypothesis. Running $1000$ regressions is not conceptually too far away from guessing. What I think is happening...what do we learn about the researchers prior information from the above question? - researcher 1 probably has a flat prior for the models $P (M_k|I_1)=\frac {1}{1000} $ - researcher 2 has a sharp prior for the model of interest $P (M_1|I_2) =1$ (assume $M_1$ is the model they both fit) This is obviously a simplification, but you can see here, we already place a lot more weight on researcher 2's inferences without any data. But you see, once they both take account of the data, researcher 1's posterior probability for $M_1$ will increase... $P (M_1|DI)>>P (M_1|I) $ (...we know this because it was "better" than $999$ other models...). Researcher 2's posterior can't concentrate anymore, it is already equal to $1$. What we don't know is how much the data supported $M_1$ over the alternatives. What we also don't know is how the different models alter the substantive conclusions of researcher 1. For example, suppose all $1000$ models contain a common term, and all $1000$ regression parameters for that variable are significantly greater than $0$ (eg $p-value You also don't say how big the dataset is, and this matters! If you're talking about a dataset with $100$ observations and $10$ covariates/predictors/independent variables, then researcher 1 will probably still be quite uncertain about the model. However, if researcher 1 is using $2,000,000$ observations, this may conclusively determine the model. There is nothing fundamentally wrong with two people that start with different information, and continue to have different conclusions after seeing the same data. However...seeing the same data will bring them closer together, provided their "model space" overlaps and the data supports this "overlapping region".
