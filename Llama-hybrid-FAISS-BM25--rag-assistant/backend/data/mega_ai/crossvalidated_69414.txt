Various comments: Your discussion is free with technical words such as "significance" and "confidence", but note that the relationship with the formal senses of those terms is tenuous. In particular, you have no formally defined generating process and your use of multipliers based on standard normal distributions includes no adjustments for dependence structure, either in your raw data or as smoothed. I don't have concrete suggestions for alternative inference procedures, not least because it seems that you are much better off regarding what you do as just exploratory or heuristic. But it's best in any report to put " " around those terms at least once, or even to avoid them altogether. Note that in my view exploratory and heuristic are not dirty words. Finding structure in data is one of the most vital parts of statistical science. A heuristic of smoothing the data a little and then looking for jumps in the smoothed series sounds a good idea, although what you are doing already sounds a bit too complicated. Much depends on the sociology of your situation, i.e. who you have to explain this to and what they will understand or expect. Your method of presenting the data and your general pitch implies to me that you are looking at temperature changes with depth e.g. below the land surface. If so, beware anyone trying to sell you anything based on time series analysis, as if these data are spatial, heat can (presumably) be propagated in both directions, unlike a time series in which past and future are quite unequal. A simple exploratory plot of one-step temperature changes (temperature $-$ previous temperature) in your sample series suggests that most of the biggest temperature changes are short ramps over 2-3 or so intervals. You may be able to relate that to the physics of your problem. This may have implications for your degree of smoothing, for example implying that Savitzky-Golay smoothing smooths too much. Much depends on your relative emphasis on (a) detecting jumps as compared with say (b) detecting zones or epochs within which temperature (or temperature change) is approximately constant. There are literatures on both. For example, a previous thread at How can I group numerical data into naturally forming "brackets"? (e.g. income) describes procedures for dividing series into subseries. You get to choose on the trade-off between number of subseries and internal homogeneity. Here is an arbitrary sample result from such a procedure. The criterion was to look for subseries with minimum internal variability in temperature, as defined by a sum of squared deviations from the mean. The numerals 1, ..., 7 indicate subseries identified. You could apply the same method to temperature change, or any other series.
