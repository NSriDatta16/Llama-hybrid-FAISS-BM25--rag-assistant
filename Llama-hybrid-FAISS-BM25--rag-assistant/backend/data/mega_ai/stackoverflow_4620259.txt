People have already said how to do this, using a CASE ... WHEN ... THEN style statement, but I'd just like to offer the opinion that this amounts to having business logic in the database. Typically I aim to keep the database purely for storage, and have business logic in a higher layer of my application. I think this way because if you consider an application to have a layered architecture, you'd put your business logic in one layer, and one or more layers deeper would be your database. One or more layers higher would be your UI. "Business logic in the database" is bad in the same way it'd be bad to put business logic in the handler for a button_Click event on a form. I appreciate this might not be appropriate for your particular circumstances on this day in 2011, but for future readers of this question, I hope it's of some use.
