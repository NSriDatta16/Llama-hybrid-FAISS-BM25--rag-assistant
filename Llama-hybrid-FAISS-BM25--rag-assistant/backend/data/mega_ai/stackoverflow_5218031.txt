While it seems to be a good idea at first glance to create a UI with drag and drop, I always found that the UI editors made me much less productive than writing the code by hand: The property editor for UI elements always shows 150 properties which I don't need and I have to scroll every time to get the one I always change. Changing properties needs too many clicks with the mouse (and sometimes the aim of a world class StarCraft player) There is no way to reuse common things like colors, texts, initialization The resulting code it a large, unreadable mess without structure There is no code completion
