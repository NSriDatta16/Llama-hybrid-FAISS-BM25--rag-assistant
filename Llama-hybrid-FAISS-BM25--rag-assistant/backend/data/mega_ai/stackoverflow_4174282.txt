releasing problems

Yes, I know that my problem is not the unique, but I have analysed many source codes but nothing works well. I am creating an array of 100 images which will be used for UIImageView animation and after finishing animation I want to free the memory. .h IBOutlet UIImageView* 1mage; .m NSMutableArray* 1mageArray = [[NSMutableArray alloc]initWithCapacity:99]; for (int i=1; i 1mage.animationImages = 1mageArray; 1mage.animationDuration = 8.0; 1mage.animationRepeatCount = 0; [1mage startAnimating]; [1mageArray release]; I have read Memory Management Guide, and seems, like I am doing everything okay, but debugger does not agree with me, and after playing the animation I still have 60 MB used. Thanks in advance! copy/paste , and I shorted variables by replacing the long text with 1. do not pay attention on this!
