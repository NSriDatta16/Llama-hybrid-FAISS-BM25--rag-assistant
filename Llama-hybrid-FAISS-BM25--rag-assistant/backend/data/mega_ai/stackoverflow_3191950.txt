Download files with Perl

I have updated my code to look like this. When I run it though it says it cannot find the specified link. Also what is a good way to test that it is indeed connecting to the page? #!/usr/bin/perl -w use strict; use LWP; use WWW::Mechanize; my $mech = WWW::Mechanize->new(); my $browser = LWP::UserAgent->new; $browser->credentials( 'Apache/2.2.3 (CentOS):80', 'datawww2.wxc.com', '************' => '*************' ); my $response = $browser->get( 'http://datawww2.wxc.com/kml/echo/MESH_Max_180min/' ); $mech->follow_link( n => 8); (Original Post) What is the best way to download small files with Perl? I looked on CPAN and found lwp-download, but it seems to only download from the link. I have a page with links that change every thirty minutes with the date and time in the name so they are never the same. Is there a built-in function I can use? Everyone on Google keeps saying to use Wget, but I was kind of wanting to stick with Perl if possible just to help me learn it better while I program with it. Also there is a user name and password to log into the site. I know how to access the site using Perl still, but I thought that might change what I can use to download with.
