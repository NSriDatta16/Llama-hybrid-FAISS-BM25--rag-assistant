Deploy python application

I am developing an application for managers that might be used in a large organisation. The app is improved and extended step by step on a frequent (irregular) basis. The app will have SQL connections to several databases and has a complex GUI. What would you advise to deploy the app ? Based on my current (limited) knowledge of apps in lager organisations I prefer a setup where the app runs on a server and the user uses a thin client via the web. I prefer not to use a webbrowser because of (possible)limitations of the user GUI. The user experience should be as if the app was running on his own laptop/pc/tablet(?) What opensource solution would you advise ? Thanks !
