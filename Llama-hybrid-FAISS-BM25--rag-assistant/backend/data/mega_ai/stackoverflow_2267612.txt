Consider leveraging the TextBox's Render() method. That'll get you the HTML that would be output from that TextBox. You can then use that string to be the replacement text to replace the ## portion of your string. TextBox Render() on MSDN var myTxtBox = new TextBox(); myTxtBox.Text = "Hello World"; //implement the Render code in here string myRenderedTextBoxHTML = RenderIt(myTxtBox); string myString = "This is a textbox: " + myRenderedTextBoxHTML; I'm unsure ViewState would be available for this control or not.
