Expression blend behavior Mix 09 pack gallery

I'm a designer so not to knowledgable at coding :( I'm trying to install a behavior from the gallery on Expression. I've tried this way http://social.expression.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/blend/thread/b32dd55e-c592-4378-8153-744ccf0526ac/ but it doesn't seem to work. Basicly I downloaded http://gallery.expression.microsoft.com/en-us/MIXBehaviorPack ran the project in Blend, dragged the dll files into C:\Program Files\Microsoft Expression\Blend 3\Libraries\Silverlight\v3.0 and C:\Program Files\Microsoft Expression\Blend 3\Libraries\WPF\v3.5 I then opened up Blend again, rebuilt project and the behaviors didn't appear, I even tried adding them as a reference by right clicking my project in the projects panel. Is there an easier way to install these behaviors. What am I missing out? Thanks Judi
