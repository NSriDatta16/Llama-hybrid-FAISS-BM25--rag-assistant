Based on the goals of your research you can use the imputeTS package https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/imputeTS/imputeTS.pdf . For example, with the function: na.interpolation(time_series, option = "stine") , you will obtain the time series with Stineman interpolation where there are missing values. If you want something more immediate you can use the function: na.mean(x, option = "median") , so that the missing value are replaced with the median one. I all depends on how many missing value are present in the time series and what you want to describe with your statistical model.
