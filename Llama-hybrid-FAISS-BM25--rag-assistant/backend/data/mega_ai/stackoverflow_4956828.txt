deploying Azure webrole to the cloud, but dont understand dataconnection string (for queues)

I have written and successfully deployed a test app to the azure cloud, but I am lost now that I have added a queue to the application. Currently I using a configuration string: Setting name="DataConnectionString" value="UseDevelopmentStorage=true" then create/open the queue with the following code: var storageAccount = CloudStorageAccount.FromConfigurationSetting("DataConnectionString"); var queueClient = storageAccount.CreateCloudQueueClient(); var queue = queueClient.GetQueueReference("messagequeue"); queue.CreateIfNotExist(); This works fine in local mode, however, I do not undertsand how to change the DataConnectionString to use the cloud! I have tried: Setting name="DataConnectionString" value="DefaultEndpointsProtocol=http;AccountName=*XXXXX*;AccountKey=*YYYYY*" but this does not work - it wont run locally. Help is certainly appreciated! Thanks
