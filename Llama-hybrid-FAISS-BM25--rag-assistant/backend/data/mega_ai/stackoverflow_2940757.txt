This information is still under NDA and therefore cannot be discussed here, except what was mentioned at th keynote and is thus public. That said... I can see the announced multitasking as a gotcha in terms of memory, performance and application state. Testing on OS 4 seems like a good idea in light of that. However, I your friend's device is not a latest-gen hardware device (iPhone 3GS or iPod touch 3rd generation), you will not get test results that deal with multitasking. Also, remember that when installing the iPhone OS beta, you will need to add your friends UDID to your list of testing devices in your devloper portal or else the device will lock up when you upgrade. In case you or someone reading this needs to know: To upgrade, you can either use XCode's Organizer or simply use iTunes. Hold the "option" key and click on the "restore" button. A window will pop up asking you what firmware to use. Again, thes kind of questions are not yet really legal outside of Apple's develope forum. I hope this helps. Good luck and happy developing!!
