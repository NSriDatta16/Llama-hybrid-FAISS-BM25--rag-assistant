Let x be the number of balls that have been removed and y be the number of balls remaining. After each cycle y=9x. As x>0, y>0. There will be infinitely many balls in the urn at 12PM. The reason that solutions based on probabilities lead to difficulties is that the probabilities from infinite series are tricky. ET Jaynes wrote about a few different apparent paradoxes of probability, like this one, in his book Probability Theory: The Logic of Science . I do not have my copy at hand, but the first part of the book is available online from Larry Bretthorst here . The following quote is from the preface. Yet when all is said and done we find, to our own surprise, that little more than a loose philosophical agreement remains; on many technical issues we disagree strongly with de Finetti. It appears to us that his way of treating infinite sets has opened up a Pandora’s box of useless and unnecessary paradoxes; nonconglomerability and finite additivity are examples discussed in Chapter 15. Infinite set paradoxing has become a morbid infection that is today spreading in a way that threatens the very life of probability theory, and requires immediate surgical removal. In our system, after this surgery, such paradoxes are avoided automatically; they cannot arise from correct application of our basic rules, because those rules admit only finite sets and infinite sets that arise as well-defined and well-behaved limits of finite sets. The paradoxing was caused by (1) jumping directly into an infinite set without specifying any limiting process to define its properties; and then (2) asking questions whose answers depend on how the limit was approached. For example, the question: “What is the probability that an integer is even?” can have any answer we please in (0, 1), depending on what limiting process is to define the “set of all integers” (just as a conditionally convergent series can be made to converge to any number we please, depending on the order in which we arrange the terms). In our view, an infinite set cannot be said to possess any “existence” and mathematical prop- erties at all—at least, in probability theory—until we have specified the limiting process that is to generate it from a finite set. In other words, we sail under the banner of Gauss, Kronecker, and Poincar ́e rather than Cantor, Hilbert, and Bourbaki. We hope that readers who are shocked by this will study the indictment of Bourbakism by the mathematician Morris Kline (1980), and then bear with us long enough to see the advantages of our approach. Examples appear in almost every Chapter. The use of limits in the answer of @enumaris (+1) provides a way around the trickiness of infinities in probability.
