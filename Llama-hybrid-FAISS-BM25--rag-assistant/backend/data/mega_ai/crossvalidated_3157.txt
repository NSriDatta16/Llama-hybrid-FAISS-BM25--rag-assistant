I am afraid that there is something you are missing. The documentation says, p is p-value (which is definitely a probability under the null, but the probability of observing extreme observations if the null holds) and h=1 means you are rejecting the null in favor of the alternative hypothesis. Here is a good quote from Bert Gunter borrowed from R mailing list. If you are willing to trust p-values which are as low as yours, I have a bridge to sell. Also, going by the value of your mean, its better that you look at the data and see what distribution your data follows and check if the assumptions of 1 sample t-test hold. I have a feeling that probably you can't use ttest here. I say this because your p-values are unbelievably small. (I understand your means are large ... etc ..., but still ttest can't be applied without verifying assumptions etc.) Thanks, S.
