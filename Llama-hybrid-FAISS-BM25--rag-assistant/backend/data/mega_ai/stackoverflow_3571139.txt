What to do if I have a CGI that runs for several minutes before outputting data, and Apache times it out?

I have a CGI script that takes a really long time to execute. Long story short, it needs to process a lot of data, run a bunch of slow commands, and make some slow web queries, during which time it doesn't output anything, and when it's done, it finally prints its results out in JSON format. It takes several minutes to run, which is longer than the Timeout directive set in my Apache web server's httpd.conf. I am not at liberty to change that Timeout value globally for everyone on the entire server. I thought of maybe overriding that in a per-directory basis using a .htaccess file, but it looks like the Timeout directive is not in .htaccess context, so that cannot be done. From what I understand, my script must continually output data, and if it doesn't output data for the Timeout number of seconds, Apache gives up. I am getting the following error in Apache: (70007)The timeout specified has expired: ap_content_length_filter: apr_bucket_read() failed What can I do?
