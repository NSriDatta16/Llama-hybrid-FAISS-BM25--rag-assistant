It is not necessarily true that the ordering of Spearman's rank coefficient will be the same as the ordering of the betas returned by a multiple regression model fit. There can be several reasons for this, here are a few that I can think of quickly (there may well be more): Range restrictions: A restricted range will not affect (on average--i.e., the expected value of) the estimated slope of a variable (although it will its significance), but it will strongly affect the correlation (either Spearman's or Pearson's). Thus, by adjusting the ranges of $X_1$ and $X_2$, it is possible to flip the orderings back and forth. Here's an example where $X_1$ ranges from 0 to 10, and $X_2$ ranges from 0 to 3: x1 0 5 10 0 5 10 0 5 10 x2 0 0 0 1.50 1.5 1.5 3 3 3 y -48.09667 -12.12629 17.93941 -57.59159 12.30414 6.521197 4.300887 58.36051 -55.91287 rho(x1,y) = 0.3689324; rho(x2,y) = 0.05270463 beta_x1 = 2.331171; beta_x2 = 5.448008 Multicollinearity: If your covariates are correlated with each other ($r(X_1, X_2)\ne0$) all kinds of counter-intuitive results can occur. Perhaps one of the most counter-intuitive is the suppressor effect (you can read about it at the bottom of this page --but read the whole page, it's worth your time). Here's an example where $X_1$ acts as a suppressor: x1 -0.029557 0.606060 1.8436 -1.20882 0.46996 0.22534 0.23217 -1.35094 -0.787902 x2 0.165287 0.086891 2.2664 -0.69033 0.23273 0.18010 -0.32480 -1.36021 -0.556156 y 0.432622 0.223160 1.1213 0.42582 -0.94566 -1.00691 0.15683 -0.54717 0.056125 rho(x1,y) = 0.2333333; rho(x2,y) = 0.1 beta_x1 = -0.593140024; beta_x2 = 0.874374951 MR betas are linear relationships, Spearman's rho isn't necessarily: The rectilinear line of best fit can have a very shallow slope (i.e., small beta weight) if the true function is curvilinear , whereas Spearman's correlation coefficient is completely unaffected by this. Here's an example of a situation where $Y$ is related to the log of $X_2$: x1 3 6 9 3 6 9 3 6 9 x2 3 3 3 6 6 6 9 9 9 y 1.942158 4.222256 4.672984 4.85704 5.061267 5.381291 4.154654 5.875549 7.183006 rho(x1,y) = 0.6324555; rho(x2,y) = 0.5797509 beta_x1 = 0.3490794; beta_x2 = 0.3542117 (I don't know if the latter two examples are 'fair', in that they rely on a misspecification of the multiple regression model--that is, the model that was fit was not the true data generating process--but we probably never fit the model that exactly mirrors the true data generating process in real life, and these are cases where the orderings flip.) Thus, the answers to your two questions are: No, having a higher Spearman rank coefficient does not mean that it will have the highest beta weight; and we cannot interpret orderings of beta weights in terms of orderings of monotonicity between the IV and DV.
