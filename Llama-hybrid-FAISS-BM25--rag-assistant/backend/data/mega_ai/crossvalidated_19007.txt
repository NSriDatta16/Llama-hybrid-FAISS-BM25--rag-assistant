Assuming your survival curve is the basic Kaplan-Meier type survival curve, this is a way to obtain the median survival time. From Machin et al. Survival Analysis: A Practical Approach : If there are no censored observations (...) the median survival time, $M$, is estimated by the middle observation of the ranked survival times $t_{(1)}, t_{(2)},\ldots,t_{(n)}$ if the number of observations, $n$, is odd, and by the average of $t_{(\frac{n}{2})}$ and $t_{(\frac{n}{2}+1)}$ if $n$ is even, that is, $$ M = \left\{\begin{array}{ll} {t_{(\frac{n + 1}{2})}} & \text{if}\ n\ \text{odd}; \\ \frac{1}{2}\left[{t_{(\frac{n}{2})}} + {t_{(\frac{n}{2} + 1)}}\right] & \text{otherwise}. \end{array}\right. $$ In the presence of censored survival times the median survival is estimated by first calculating the Kaplan-Meier survival curve, then finding the value of $M$ that satisfies the equation $S(M) = 0.5$. This can either be done, as you suggested, using a graphical technique with your curve, or using the survival function estimates used to construct said curve.
