Coefficient of variation is effectively a normalized or relative measure of the variation in a data set, (e.g. a time series) in that it is a proportion (and therefore can be expressed as a percentage). Intuitively, if the mean is the expected value, then the coefficient of variation is the expected variability of a measurement, relative to the mean. This is useful when comparing measurements across multiple heterogeneous data sets or across multiple measurements taken on the same data set - the coefficient of variation between two data sets, or calculated for two sets of measurements can be directly compared, even if the data in each are measured on very different scales, sampling rates or resolutions. In contrast, standard deviation is specific to the measurement/sample it is obtained from, i.e. it is an absolute rather than a relative measure of variation.
