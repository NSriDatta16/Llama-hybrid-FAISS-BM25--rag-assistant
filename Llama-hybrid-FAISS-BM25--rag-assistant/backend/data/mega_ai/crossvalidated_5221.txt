You need to model the observations as a mixture model. Define: $p$ as the probability that a sample belongs to the first data generating process. Thus, the density function of $y_i$ is given by: $f(y_i|-) \sim p f_1(y_i|-) + (1-p) f_2(y_i|-)$ where $f_1(.)$ is the density that arises because of the first data generating process and $f_2(.)$ is the density that arises because of the second data generating process. You can then either use maximum likelihood (see for example the EM algorithm ) or bayesian approaches to estimate the model.
