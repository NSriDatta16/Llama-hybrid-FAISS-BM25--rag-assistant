A quick solution is to move the logic out of Page_Load and into it's own function. Add an to where you want the chart to be displayed and add an control to your page. For the timer's On_Tick event, call the code that generates and displays the chart, disable the timer (so it doesn't tick again) and call Update() on your UpdatePanel. This will cause the page to load with the basic output, then the timer will kick off an AJAX call to generate and display your charts. It's not the most elegant solutions, but it's probably the quickest to implement.
