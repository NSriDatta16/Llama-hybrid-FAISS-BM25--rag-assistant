How to measure sensitivity, speficity, PPV and NPV from confusion matrix for multiclass classification

I want to calculate sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV from a confusion matrix for multiclass classification. My objective is to learn the basic concept of constructing a confusion matrix for multiclass classification and how to calculate sensitivity and specificity from a confusion matrix manually without using machine learning or other programs. My Confusion matrix: First, I wanted to know whether my confusion matrix looks okay Second, how can I calculate sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV for different levels for the predicted class without using any program? Third, I want to learn what's the best way to present sensitivity and specificity in a confusion matrix.
