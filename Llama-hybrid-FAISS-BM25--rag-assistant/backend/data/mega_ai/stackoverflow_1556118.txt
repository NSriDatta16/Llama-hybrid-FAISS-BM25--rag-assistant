This entry from the SQLite's FAQ might help you : Can multiple applications or multiple instances of the same application access a single database file at the same time? Multiple processes can have the same database open at the same time. Multiple processes can be doing a SELECT at the same time. But only one process can be making changes to the database at any moment in time, however. So, I'd say only one process/thread/whatever can write to your DB at a given instant. (there's more to read on the FAQ page ; you should read it : I didn't quote everything) And, about the multithreading thing : Is SQLite threadsafe? SQLite is threadsafe. We make this concession since many users choose to ignore the advice given in the previous paragraph. But in order to be thread-safe, SQLite must be compiled with the SQLITE_THREADSAFE preprocessor macro set to 1. Both the Windows and Linux precompiled binaries in the distribution are compiled this way. (same note)
