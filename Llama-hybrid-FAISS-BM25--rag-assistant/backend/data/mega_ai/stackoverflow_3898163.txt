php, javascript and mysql live data problem

I'm very new to web programming, but I have some data that I would really like to present in a constantly updated time series graph on my website. So I have been trying to prototype some code that will display the latest integer value that has been added to a database. The database table I want to reference is being constantly inserted with integer values. My question is this; I'm trying to use a combination of JavaScript and php to display the latest entry into the database when a button on the website is pressed. However the only integer I can get back is the last integer that was present in the database when the page originally loaded. It appears the php function I am using to grab data from the database is run as soon as the page is loaded and does not update after each button press. Is this a limitation of php (or my knowledge of php). Any help would be much appreciated. (the php function) function getData() { include "config.php"; $db = mysql_connect($dbhost,$uname,$pass); mysql_select_db ($dbname) or die ("Cannot connect"); $query = "SELECT numCalls FROM $tname ORDER by claatime DESC LIMIT 1"; $result = mysql_query($query); while($r=mysql_fetch_array($result)) { $numCalls = $r["numCalls"]; } return $numCalls; } (javascript function) function getNum() { var x = ; alert('the latest number is ' +x); }
