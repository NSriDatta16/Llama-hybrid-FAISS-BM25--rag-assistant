I'm not so sure that your final suggestion of creating a dedicated module dependent on all others is so ugly. After all, it is leveraging Maven's dependency management. You can name it in a very obvious manner to make it clear to maintainers what is going on and it will fit in nicely with the overall build process of the project. Why not put it in place and see how well it works for you? Remember that working code beats beautiful but non-working code every time.
