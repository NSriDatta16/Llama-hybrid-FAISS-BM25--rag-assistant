First, note that the "q-value" has gathered two distinct meanings along time. The first being: the minimal FDR level for which hypothesis $i$ is rejected (1). The second being: the estimated pFDR of a rejection region which starts at hypothesis i'th test statistic (2). In both cases, the motivation comes multiple hypothesis testing, as using the nominal p-values will lead to an inflation of false findings. Particularly, the ratio of false findings within all findings (FDR) will not be controlled. Denoting by $R$ the total number of findings, and by $V$ the amount of false findings, you can define the false detection proportion $FDP=V/R$. Accepting the convention that no findings means no error, i.e., $R=0 \Rightarrow FDP:=0$, you can define: $FDR=E(FDP)$ and $pFDR=E(FDP;R>0)$. We can now return to the question at hand... "The q-value is defined to be the FDR analogue of the p-value" refers to the first definition of the q-value, and provides the means to control the FDR. "... directly estimate q-values rather than fixing a level at which to control the FDR" refers to the second definition of q-value, and provides means to control the pFDR.
