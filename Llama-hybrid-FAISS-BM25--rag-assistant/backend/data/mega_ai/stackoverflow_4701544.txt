Backup Eclipse settings

I have had to re/install Eclipse across different platforms (windows and linux) several times this year. I have not found an effective single solution way to share settings/preferences across different versions of Eclipse. This is what I currently do: Export Software Update Sites (Bookmarks) XML file. Export Java->Code Style->Code templates Export Java->Code Style->Formatter Export Java->Code Style->Organize Imports Export Java->Templates Configure Project Specific Settings for all your projects then copy the .settings directory from the base directory of your project. Take a screenshot of Java->Editor->Content Assist->Favorites (there is no export) Export preferences ( this does not work well across different versions hence above ) Surely there is an easier way?
