Error Analysis on two different sized data sets

Here the situation. I have a model plane that records velocity in the x, y, and z axis at 16hz. I have a small data recorder attached to the underbelly of the plane that is also recording the same velocity at 1hz. I "flew" the plane in simulated turbulence for 3 hours and collected data. I want to validate the error of the data recorder by plotting the error using the formula: $$ \epsilon = \frac{|Ax_n-Dx_n|}{Ax_n} * 100\% $$ Where $Ax = \text{Aircraft Velocity} \ and \ Dx = \text{Recorder Velocity} $ At every second $n$ . The problem is I have 16hz of data for the airplane and 1hz for the data recorder so there is a huge discrepancy between the amount of data points I have. I am not sure what to do if I average all the data points I have for every second for the airplane there are huge errors. I know these errors don't exist because if I plot them ontop of each other there's only very small discrepancies. My research professor wants me to use error though so I am not sure what to do. BONUS if anyone know show to do this in python pandas or numpy.
