One possible approach I can see is as follows: Amazon considers (until now and based on its historic data, and checked every X time) a possible number of frequent categories (i.e. labels in a classification context) In the product you send, you can see the considered categories: and the most frequent terms users have writen on their reviews, used as filters: by applying some techniques like word embeddings , you can build a classifier to find which categories those terms belong to, based on some predefined category labels new ones categories could be found with unsupervised clustering techniques
