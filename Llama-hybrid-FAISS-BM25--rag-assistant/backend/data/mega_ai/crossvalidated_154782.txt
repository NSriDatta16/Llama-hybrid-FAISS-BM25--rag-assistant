4 specific questions about Logistic Regression with Categorical Predictors in R

I'm attempting logistic regression in R for a survey for 613 students. I'm looking to see if there is an association between my Dependent Variable (called 'BinaryShelter', coded as 0 or 1, signifying whether students took shelter during a tornado warning) and my 5 independent/predictor variables . My categorical IV's have anywhere from 3 to 11 distinct levels/categories within them. The other two IV's are binary coded as 0 or 1. The first 10 surveys and R output are given below: Survey KSCat WSCat PlanHome PlanWork KLNKVulCat BinaryShelter 1 J B 1 1 A 1 2 A B 1 0 NA 1 3 B B 1 1 C 1 4 B D 1 1 A 0 5 B D 1 1 A 1 6 G E 1 1 A 0 7 A A 1 1 B 1 8 C F NA 1 C 0 9 B B 1 1 A 1 10 C B 0 0 NA 1 Call: glm(formula = BinaryShelter ~ KSCat + WSCat + PlanHome + PlanWork + KLNKVulCat, family = binomial("logit"), data = mydata) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -2.0583 -1.3564 0.7654 0.8475 1.6161 Coefficients: Estimate St. Error z val Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 0.98471 0.43416 2.268 0.0233 * KSCatB -0.63288 0.34599 -1.829 0.0674 .

The ones that had such large St. Deviations were from small groups. Should I not include data from very small groups? For instance if only 2 or 3 people picked category 'E' for KSCat, should I exclude that data? 2) When using factors for my categorical data, or when adding in more than one IV, sometimes my beta coefficients flip signs. Does this mean I should test for interaction and then try to conduct some form of a PCA or jump straight to doing a PCA? These next questions may be better asked on stack overflow, but I figured I'd give it a shot here: 3) I do not want a particular level of the categorical variables to be the reference level. I know that R automatically picks the reference level (A if letters, and the first one if numbers). As in the answer to this question ( Significance of categorical predictor in logistic regression ), I tried fitting the model without an intercept by adding - 1 to the formula to see all coefficients directly. But when I do this, the results only show the 'A' level of the first variable and none of the others. For example, I can see results for 'KSCatA' but not 'WSCatA' or 'KLNKVulCatA'. 4) How does R handle missing observations for logistic regression? For example survey #10 was missing the 'KLNKVulCat' Variable, but not any of the other IV's. Would R or any other statistical languages not use any of the information for this particular person, or just that particular variable? Any help is greatly appreciated, thank you.
