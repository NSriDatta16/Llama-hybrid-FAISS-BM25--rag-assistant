What is the formula for AICc for least square fitting with multiple data types and variables?

If I have a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations \begin{align} x' &= f(x,y,Q),\\ y' &= g(x,y,Q), \end{align} where $Q$ is the vector containing model parameters. And I fit it to time series data: $\{x_i\}_{i=1...N}$ and $\{y_j\}_{j=1...M}$ using least square with $$RSS = \sum_{i=1}^N (x(t_i) - x_i)^2+ \sum_{j=1}^M(y(t_j)-y_j)^2.$$ My AIC is given by $$AIC = 2k + (N+M)\ln(RSS),$$ where $k$ is the number of model parameters. My questions are : With the given assumption of the model fitting, is the AIC formula appropriate? If I want to correct for small sample size, is the following AICc formula correct? $$AICc = AIC + \frac{2k^2 + 2k}{n-k-1}.$$ In particular, I am concerned about what would happen if $\{x_i\}_{i=1...N}$ and $\{y_j\}_{j=1...M}$ are correlated nonlinearly. Is this nonlinear correlation accounted for by the nonlinear ode model without having to modify the AIC and AICc equations? If you can provide some references, that would be much appreciated.
