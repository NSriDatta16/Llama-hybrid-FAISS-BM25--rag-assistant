Google Maps V3 custom controls problem

I have a Google map into which I add some custom tooltips using custom overlays: http://goo.gl/M6in However, sometimes the map will work and sometimes it will appear to be "frozen". I can't drag it, I can't click any of the buttons, etc. The only clue that I've found is that, if I use setTimeout() to wait for ~ 5 seconds, things work. If I don't, it's a crapshoot. I'm trying to figure out how I can know when the map is ready to accept these custom overlays, and it doesn't seem to follow any of the typical events. I add these overlays AFTER "bounds_changed" and "tilesloaded" events, but a change must occur even later than that that determines whether the map will be broken or functional. The problem is, I don't know what that change is and how to detect it. Any ideas?
