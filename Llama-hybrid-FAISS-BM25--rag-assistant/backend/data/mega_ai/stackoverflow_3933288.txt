Embedding Flash on Master Page

My client request a flash header for his website. I'm using asp.net and a master page (where the code for the flash header is). My problem is that whenever I go to a page that's not in the website's root, the flash doesn't appear. I've had the same issue with pure css menus on this site... Here's the code: --> As you can see, I'm not calling the path to the flash object relative to the website root (in case this isn't clear... if it were an asp.net control, I'd use ~/App_Themes/Default/banner1.swf" ) The flash object is being loaded relative to the location of the current page that's being viewed on the website. Assuming an indeterminate folder depth from root, how can I change the code to load the flash relative to the root, rather than the current page? I have considered changing the path that's being used by perpending / or ~/ to it, but this only results in the flash not loading on any page at all. Looking at the source code, the server modifies /App_Themes/Default/banner1.swf to ~/App_Themes/Default/banner1.swf
