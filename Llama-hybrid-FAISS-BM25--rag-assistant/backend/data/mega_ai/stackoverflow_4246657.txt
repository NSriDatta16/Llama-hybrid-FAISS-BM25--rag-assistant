The simplest way to achieve what you want (and the only way I know how) would be: Create a new slave in Hudson, and point it to the Hudson server (your master system will also now be a new slave); have it log in using SSH, but with the user credentials that you want to use for the build (lets say 'hudson'). Point your project to build on the slave. This way, your job does not depend on Tomcat (or its user), but on the slave login. In steps: 1) Click on 'Build Executor Status' 2) On the left sidebar, click on New Node 3) Give the slave a name, click "Dumb Slave", and "OK" 4) Number of executors = 1 5) remote FS root = /home/ 6) Launch method = UNIX SSH or JNLP 7) If launch = SSH: host = ip address of master, username = hudson, password = hatever_password 8) If launch = JNLP, log in as the hudson user, go to hudson and start the web service from your hudson site 9) Configure your job to use your slave (restrict where this project can be run) 9a) Possibly, under configuration, turn off all executors on your master, and use the new slave for anything you need to build. I know it sounds a bit convoluted, but if you need any more explanation or have any questions, let me know.
