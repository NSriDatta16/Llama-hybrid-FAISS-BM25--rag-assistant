You can use a bloom filter before looking up in the hashset.This can fasten things up.The bloom filter has a problem of false +ve's.So for all true the bloom filter returns you will have to look up in the hashset once again to make sure but all false you can be sure.Also you could replace your hashset with a radix tree/patricia trie for more compact storage. Implementations: Patricia-trie Bloom filter
