dropping trailing '.0' from floats

I'm looking for a way to convert numbers to string format, dropping any redundant '.0' The input data is a mix of floats and strings. Desired output: 0 --> '0' 0.0 --> '0' 0.1 --> '0.1' 1.0 --> '1' I've come up with the following generator expression, but I wonder if there's a faster way: (str(i).rstrip('.0') if i else '0' for i in lst) The truth check is there to prevent 0 from becoming an empty string. EDIT: The more or less acceptable solution I have for now is this: ('%d'%i if i == int(i) else '%s'%i for i in lst) It just seems strange that there is no elegant way to handle this (fairly straightforward) case in python.
