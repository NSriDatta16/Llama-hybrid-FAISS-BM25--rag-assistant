List of time series characteristics

Is there a source (paper, book, presentation, lecture) that gives an overview of all or most of the different attributes by which we can characterise time series signals along with definitions and examples (e.g., (non-)cyclic seasonality, trend, (dis-)continuous, stationary, and so on)?
