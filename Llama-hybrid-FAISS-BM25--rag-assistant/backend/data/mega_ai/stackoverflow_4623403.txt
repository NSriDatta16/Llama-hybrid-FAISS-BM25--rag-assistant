Are the images compiled into your project as "Embedded Resources" or placed in a .resx file? Is the code that you've written accessing them from your project's Resources folder? If so, then everything will work just fine when you copy the application to another computer and run it. If you're hard-coding a path to your file system, then no; your application won't work on another computer because those files won't be distributed along with the bare executable. There's really no reason to ever do this. It's difficult to tell from the information provided in your question what exactly you're doing. For more information about embedding resources into your application itself, so all you have to do is distribute the executable, see this simple how-to guide: Using Resources in Visual Studio .NET
