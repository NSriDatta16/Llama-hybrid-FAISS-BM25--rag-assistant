The real kicker with porting apps to 64-bit is that every OS seems to treat the primitive types as they please. For example, under most linux environments a long is 4 bytes on a 32 bit system and 8 bytes on a 64 bit system (32bit=4bytes 64bit=8bytes.) Meanwhile, the int stays 4 bytes across 64bit and 32 bit systems. Under windows, the opposite seems to be true, the long stays consistently 4 bytes while the int switches between 32 and 64 bit. That said, I have ported a medium sized project at work before from 32 bit to 64 bit linux (about 25,000 lines of code) only having to make changes in the the assembly code (GASM) which made several faulty assumptions about datatypes being 4 bytes long. Other than this, I had no problems, which suggests that provided you payed strict attention to your data types when you were first developing, porting should be seemless, perhaps only requiring certain compile switches be changed (like -fpic.) There were a few really bizzare corner cases that came up in my porting experience but I think they were mostly due to undefined behaviour of some GASM more than the porting itself.
