I would say just take the average of the values around it. So if you need X=3.5 and Y=15 (3.5,15), you average (3,10), (3,20), (4,10) and (4,20). Since I have no idea what the data is you are dealing with, I am not sure if the exact proximity would matter - in which case you can just stick w/the average - or if you need to do some sort of inverse distance weighting.
