Rank-ordered logit model: question

I have a dataset in which each individual ranks four attributes of a product. This task (with the same attributes) is repeated three times under different conditions. The product is still the same, so I have only individualsâ€™ characteristics as variables. The rank-ordinal logit model seems to be the natural method. However, I was wondering if there are some statistical methods that allows to determine if the individuals ranking is consistent across the three different situations. Moreover, which method suits the most? I was thinking to: if exists a sort of panel data rank-ordered logit estimates three different rank-ordered logit and then test for equality of parameters across the three estimations use the three ranking to obtain one unique ranking for each individuals, and then applied the rank-ordered logit Thank you for your attention
