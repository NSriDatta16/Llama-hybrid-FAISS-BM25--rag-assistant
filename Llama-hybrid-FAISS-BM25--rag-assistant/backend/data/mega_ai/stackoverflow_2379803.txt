IMHO, the best way of doing it not to store the key and generate it when you need it using a seed or a private key. Or use a MD5 digest kind of logic to use specific user params like, generate a string "username-email-id" and hash it and send it in the email when the user clicks it again, try to generate the key and match it against the user key. No need to storage and not possible to regenerate.
