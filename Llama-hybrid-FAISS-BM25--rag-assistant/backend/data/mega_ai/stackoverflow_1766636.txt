MySQL, just as almost any computer implementation that uses floating point arithmetic, employs the IEEE-754 standard . This is binary floating point. Just as it is impossible to write 1/3 in decimal, it's impossible to write infinitely many digits in binary floating point (given that computers are restricted in time and space). A float uses 32 bits, a double uses 64 bits, mathematically, that's very little space for infinite many fractions. The Wikipedia article above is a good read about floating point. In general, when dealing with computer match, it is imperative to know a bit how computers use limited storage for unlimited fractions. Exact decimals also exist, but are limited to a fixed range (i.e. no high exponent). In MySQL you can use DECIMAL for fixed point numbers.
