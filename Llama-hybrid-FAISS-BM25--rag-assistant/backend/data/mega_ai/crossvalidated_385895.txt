Analyzing multiple repeated measurements from same individuals under different conditions

I have 4 participants who are exposed to two different environments A and B and their skin temperature is measured every 10 minutes for 1 h. Hence there is 7 measurements per one experiment (0min, 10min, 20min, 30min, 40min, 50min, 60min). During the exposure the temperature decreases. Participant 1 is measured once in both environment totaling 2 time series Participant 2 is measured twice in both environments totaling 4 time series Participant 3 is measured once in both environments totaling 2 time series Participant 4 is measured three times in both environments totaling 6 time series I wish to examine whether there is a difference in the two environments. In a simpler setting I would construct a linear model, include the environment as covariate (A=0, B=1) and calcuate the coefficient and its CI as evidence for treatment effect. Linear mixed model would seem the best for this one I canÂ´t come up with right model spesification. I could also just compare the groups in the final time point but the measurements are dependent due to multiple measurement from single participants. What would be the best way to assess the difference between A and B?
