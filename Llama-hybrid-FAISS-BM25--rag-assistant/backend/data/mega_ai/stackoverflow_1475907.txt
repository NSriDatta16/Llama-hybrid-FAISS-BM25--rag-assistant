You need to use the inbuilt NUnit runner. If you look in a build agent's directory, just search for *.exe. There should be one called NUnit-Runner.exe or something like that. You then need to use that instead. Have a look at the article Building .NET Solution with Rake and TeamCity . About 3/4 of the way down he shows what I mean: To achieve the above I did something similar in Ruby. I set up a $NUnit variable, if the property ENV['AGENT_WORKING_DIR'] exists then I use the TeamCity NUnit runner, else I use the normal NUnit (that is, so developers can run the Rake script).
