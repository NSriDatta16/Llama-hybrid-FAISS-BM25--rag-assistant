Another possibility is to use a Random Forest. There are two ways to measure the "importance" of a variable under a Random Forest: Permutation : the importance of input variable $X_j$ is proportional to the average increase in error rate cause by randomly shuffling that variable. Randomly shuffling $X_j$ destroys the relationship between $X_j$ and $Y$, as well as all the other $X$s. Node impurity : the importance of input variable $X_j$ is proportional to the total decrease in node impurity due to splitting on $X_j$ across all trees. Random Forests are also amenable to a type of data visualization called a "partial dependence plot". See this in-depth tutorial for more detail. Partial dependence and permutation importance are not specific to Random Forest models, but their popularity grew along with the popularity of Random Forests because of how efficient it is to compute them for Random Forest models.
