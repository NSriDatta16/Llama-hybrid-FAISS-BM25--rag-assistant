How to compute weighted means and SDs?

I want to calculate volume weighted average price and standard deviation for the following dataset: Jan Product A: q= 100 p=23 Jan Prodouct B: q=11 p=45 Feb Prodouct B: q= 55.7 p=60 What formulas should I use? If you know Stata: Should I use pweights or fweights ?
