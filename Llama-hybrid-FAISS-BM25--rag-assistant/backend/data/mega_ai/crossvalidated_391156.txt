Gibbs sampler for ARIMA AR(1) parameters: division by zero

Suppose the following AR(1) model: $$ y_t = \mu + \phi (y_{t-1} - \mu) + \epsilon_t $$ with $\epsilon_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2)$ . Following issue arises when sampling from $P(\mu_i \;|\; \phi_{i-1}, \sigma^2_{i-1}, \bf{y})$ using a Gibbs procedure. Assuming uniform $\mu$ -prior: $$ \mu_i \sim \mathcal{N} \left(\frac{(1-\phi_{i-1})\Sigma_{t=2}^T (y_t - \phi_{i-1} y_{t-1})}{\Sigma_{t=2}^T (1-\phi_{i-1})}, \frac{\sigma^2_{i-1}}{\Sigma_{t=2}^T (1-\phi_{i-1})}\right)$$ The obvious problem is when $\phi_{i-1} = 1$ . In such case $1-\phi_{i-1} = 0$ resulting in a division by zero. Is my approach sane? I feel like I am missing something, since if it was, I should't be having this issue. Can someone elaborate? Note: I am aware of non-stationary and the fact that I could centralize $\bf{y}$ to omit $\mu$ . Still, that doesn't seem to me to explain the fundamental question above. I also went through some Bayesian econometrics literature, but have not found any mention of the above issue.
