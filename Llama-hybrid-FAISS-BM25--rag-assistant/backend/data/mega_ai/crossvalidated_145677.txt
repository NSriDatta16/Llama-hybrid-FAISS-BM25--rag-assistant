Averaging effect sizes?

Suppose I need an estimate of effect size for a power analysis. I read the relevant literature and calculated Cohen's $d$ from some number (3) of studies. If the Cohen's $d$s are, for example, $d_{1} = 0.2$, $d_{2} = 0.4$, and $d_{3} = 0.3$, is the best estimate of effect size now $\frac{0.2 + 0.4 + 0.3}{3} = 0.3$? How would I go about combining the data from several different studies?
