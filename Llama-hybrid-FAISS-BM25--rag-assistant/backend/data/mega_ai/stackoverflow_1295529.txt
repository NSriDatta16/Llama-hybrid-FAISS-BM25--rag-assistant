I'd remove the read only flag if you don't want to customise the maint plan. Why are you shrinking DBs too? If the database grows to a given size, then this is probably it's natural current size. Also remember that an index rebuild (rule of thumb) require free space of 120% of target table size. Eg 500 MB table needs 600 MB free space. It's pointless to shrink then rebuild... and you'll have horrendous file fragmentation too
