There are a number of modelling options to account for a non-constant variance, for example ARCH (and GARCH, and their many extensions) or stochastic volatility models. An ARCH model extend ARMA models with an additional time series equation for the square error term. They tend to be pretty easy to estimate (the fGRACH R package for example). SV models extend ARMA models with an additional time series equation (usually a AR(1)) for the log of the time-dependent variance. I have found these models are best estimated using Bayesian methods (OpenBUGS has worked well for me in the past).
