It's rather hard to say what's wrong without having the full context. I'd first suggest inspecting your content in a DOM/JS debugger, e.g Opera Dragonfly , Webkit Web Inspector or Mozilla Firebug. Verify that all your elements are created correctly, and that it looks like you expect in the DOM tree.
