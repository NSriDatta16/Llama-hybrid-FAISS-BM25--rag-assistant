AUC estimated by leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV); how to estimate confidence interval for it?

I use logistic regression with a set of predictors X and a binary dependent variable y. I use LOOCV to produce "out-of-sample" model predictions y^_i for each x_i, where the model is estimated without (x_i, y_i). I use y^ and y to produce an ROC-curve and calculate the area under it (the AUC). I believe this is the preferred method for estimating an unbiased AUC of a predictive model. (If the LOOCV was used to choose the predictor set I know it's not perfectly unbiased, but let's disregard that for now.) My question is: How do I create a valid confidence interval for my LOOCV-based AUC estimate? An AUC may be interpreted as the probability that my model orders a random positive and negative case pair correctly. Does this mean that the naiive approach of AUC +- 1.96 * sqrt(AUC*(1-AUC)/n) is meaningful? Should I run a bootstrap procedure on top of it all? (I.e. generate a sequence of resampled data sets with replacement, run the LOOCV procedure to produce an AUC for each data set, order the AUCs and use the 0.025 and 0.975 tails)? Something else?
