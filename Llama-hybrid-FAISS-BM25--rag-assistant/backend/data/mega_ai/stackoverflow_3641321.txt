Drag/Swipe to scroll the screen

What would be the best way to have a vertical scrolling screen? My game will consume two screens high, the user should be able to move between the two screens by a simple drag or swipe action. The background is not tiled and sprites will be placed on it. What would be the best way to go about such screen management?
