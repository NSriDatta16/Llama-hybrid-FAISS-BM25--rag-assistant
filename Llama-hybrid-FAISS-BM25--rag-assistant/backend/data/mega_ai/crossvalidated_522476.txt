How does SVM deal with the case of multiple perfect separators?

I couldn't find a specific answer to this. It's a general query I have, no specific code attached. Is it possible for there to be more than one perfect line/hyperplane separating two (or more) classes in support vector machines? If there is, the best dividing line randomly chosen? Or is it unlikely there would be more than one?
