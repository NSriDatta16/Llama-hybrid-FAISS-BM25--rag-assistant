Combining results of z-test after multiple imputation

I work with multiple imputed data and want to compare two proportions of successes/failures using a z-test (one-tailed). Unfortunately, I don't know how to poole the results. I created 50 complete (imputed) datasets and ran the comparisons resulting in 50 z-scores and p-values. I suppose that I cannot simply average these results but rather have to take the uncertainty of the imputation procedure into account. What do I have to do to poole my results correctly?
