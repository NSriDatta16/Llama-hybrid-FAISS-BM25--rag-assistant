Perceptron Learning Rule

I am new to Machine Learning and Data Science. By spending some time online, I was able to understand the perceptron learning rule fairly well. But I am still clueless about how to apply it to a set of data. For example we may have the following values of $x_1$ , $x_2$ and $d$ respectively:- \begin{align}&(0.6 , 0.9 , 0)\\ &(-0.9 , 1.7 , 1)\\ &(0.1 , 1.4 , 1)\\ &(1.2 , 0.9 , 0)\end{align} I can't think of how to begin. I think we need to follow these rules. $$W_i = W_i + \Delta W_i$$ $$\Delta W_i = \eta(d_i - y_i)$$ $$\text{ If} y_i = \sum w_ix_i \ge 0, y = 1$ \text{ else} y=0$$ $$x_0 (\text{Bias}) = 0 $$ Where $d_i$ is the target value, $y_i$ is the output value $\eta$ is the learning rate and $x_i$ is the input value Any help is appreciated. Thanks!
