When looking at something like this, I like to think of it this way: You're not retrieving a hundred users, you're retrieving a single arbitrary user a hundred times. I would look to break the retrieval of the data you're looking at (stepping away from the example in question) into a simple function, then call that function via Javascript (whether the JS is doing it itself, or if you have the JS call a PHP page which returns the results is up to you), and then update the results on the page as they come in. In this way, you don't need to set a huge timeout, and you can update the page as the results propagate, instead of trying to do it all in one big chunk.
