Map a simplex of ordered probabilities to a scalar

Suppose there is an ordinal factor with three levels: low, medium, and high. A model has been trained on historical data to estimate the probabilities of the three categories. For each example, it outputs a simplex $(p_1, p_2, p_3)$ where the tree entries correspond to the three levels, respectively. I am looking for an elegant way to map these three numbers to the unit interval so that the level of concern, from low to high, is properly reflected. I am not sure how to formulate it more precisely and would be grateful for any suggestions on how to think about this problem. In the case of ordinal regression, there are a latent variable and a number of cut points, and the former solves this problem automatically. However, in my case, the starting point a multiclass classifier that is unaware of the ordering. I wonder if one can create some artificial but sound latent dimension starting from labels and probabilities.
