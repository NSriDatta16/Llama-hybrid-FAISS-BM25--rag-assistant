For some time I have wanted to educate myself more on Bayesian approaches to modeling to get past my cursory understanding (I have coded Gibbs samplers in graduate course work, but have never done anything real). Along the way though I have thought some of Brian Dennis' papers have been though-provoking and have wished I could find a Bayesian friend (the ones who weren't in the closet) to read the papers and hear their counterpoints. So, here are the papers I am referring to, but the quote I always remember is Being Bayesian means never having to say you're wrong. http://faculty.washington.edu/skalski/classes/QERM597/papers/Dennis_1996.pdf http://classes.warnercnr.colostate.edu/nr575/files/2011/01/Lele-and-Dennis-2009.pdf
