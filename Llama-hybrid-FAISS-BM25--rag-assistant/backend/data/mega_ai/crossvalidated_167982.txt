Threshold 0.5 is arbitrary, as is every threshold. Logistic regression produces probabilities and these can be used to make an decision for classification purposes if that is needed. For practical purposes in telemarketing campaign I recently analyzed it was decided that cutoff at 0.2 would suffice when at sample level response rate for our offer was at 0.09. At that decile lift was over 2 and we got enough target population for this to be profitable.
