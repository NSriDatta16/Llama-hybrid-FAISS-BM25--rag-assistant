Cygwin and PHPUnit: Could not open input file: /cygdrive/c/xampp/php/phpunit

Is there a way to run PHPUnit from Cygwin? Everytime I run PHPUnit I get this error: Could not open input file: /cygdrive/c/xampp/php/phpunit I am trying to run my unit tests in my Zend Framework App. I am trying to use Cygwin because I am more familiar with *Nix commands (I'm no expert though) rather than Windows. Thanks, Wenbert
