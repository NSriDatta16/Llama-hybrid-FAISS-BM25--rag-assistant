Help Needed on re ordering and resequencing a list of rules in Java server side

Guys I am currently developing a web application, in which rules, which are basically sql queries are obtained from the DB and showed using Jquery sortable. These queries are running based upon a command Sequence (1,2,3) and Status (0,1,2 ..20 ). The command sequence tells you, in which order you have to run . Also the status field is helpful in knowing , whenever an error occurred. It saves the value 1 or 2 ... or 20 , to help identify at which step it stopped. Below I have given a UI representation , my problem is that, when the user drags the rules, the cmdSequence and the Status have to updated in DB. Ref Id RuleNo CmdSequence Status 1 1 1 0 2 2 2 0 3 3 1 1 4 4 1 1 5 5 2 2 6 6 2 2 if i am moving refId 6 before refId 1 then the CmdSequence and Status should be changed. as below ,simillarly drag and dropping in the middle and last Ref Id RuleNo CmdSequence Status 6 6 1 0 1 1 2 0 2 2 1 1 3 3 2 1 4 4 1 2 5 5 2 2 i want to know how to implement in the server side , while data from browser comes from json.
