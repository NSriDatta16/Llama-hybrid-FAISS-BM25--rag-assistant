From the question it sounds like the fastest they could possibly try passwords is 50 per minute. Based on that and using random 6 digit passwords: all lower case: 26^6 = 308,915,776 possible passwords = worst case 12 years , 6 years on average lower case and numbers: 36^6 = 82 years max , 41 years on average Of course, dictionary attacks would be much faster, but I don't have the numbers for that. EDIT: I tried to link Google calculator results backing this up, but ^ seems to mess up links on here. EDIT2: Dictionary attacks (from http://www.outpost9.com/files/WordLists.html ): all listed words (75,000): ~1 day list of 816 common passwords: ~16 minutes really long word list: ~12 days (I looked at this and I'm guessing it contains most non-technical people's passwords) The last one is scary, but 12 days is still a long time. If you're really worried, you could track every incorrect password until the user gets a correct password, then if the list gets to over like 100 different attempts, just ban the IP address and send an email to the user.
