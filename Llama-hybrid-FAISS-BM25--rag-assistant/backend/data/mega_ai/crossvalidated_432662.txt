class-specific neural networks vs overall network

Let's say I am working in a classification setting, like MNIST for instance, and imagine that I have 10 neural networks which are all slightly different and each perform very well on one unique class. How would you go about using these networks and putting them into one meta neural network which would take advantage of the specialisation of the other 10?
