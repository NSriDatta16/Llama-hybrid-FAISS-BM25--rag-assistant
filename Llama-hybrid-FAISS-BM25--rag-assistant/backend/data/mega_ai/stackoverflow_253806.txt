Todd's answer is correct. Often you will see this implemented throughout the .NET framework as OnXXX(EventArgs) methods: public class Foo { public event EventHandler Click; protected virtual void OnClick(EventArgs e) { var click = Click; if (click != null) click(this, e); } } I strongly encourage you to consider the EventArgs / EventHandler pattern before you find yourself making all manner of CustomEventArgs / CustomEventHandler for raising events.
