The algorithm is on page 59 of "Statistical analysis of spherical data" by N. I. Fisher, T. Lewis and B. J. J. Embleton. I highly recommend that book -- it will help you understand the mathematics. The following will produce random Fisher distribution locations centered on the North pole. If you want them randomly centered, then you produce additional uniform random locations on the sphere and rotate these locations to be centered on those locations. If you are not sure of those steps, consult the aforementioned book. This Fortran code fragment uses a random number generator that produces uniform deviates from 0 to 1. lambda = exp (-2.0 * kappa) term1 = get_uniform_random () * (1.0 - lambda) + lambda CoLat = 2.0 * asin ( sqrt ( -log (term1) / (2.0 * kappa) ) ) Long = 2.0 * PI * get_uniform_random ()
