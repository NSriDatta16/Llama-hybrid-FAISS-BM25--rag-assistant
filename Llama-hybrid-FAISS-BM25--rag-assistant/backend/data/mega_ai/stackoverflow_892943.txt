Is there a concise list of .NET 3.0 to 4.0 BCL deltas?

Does anybody know of or have a detailed list of how the BCL in .NET 4.0 has changed from 3.0? In other words, what types have been added or deprecated (or how have they changed)? All I have been able to find is the list of new features, such as the Wikipedia article , any of the endless MSDN blogs entries about it, or some questions here on SO ( #1 , #2 ). Knowing about those is important, but I am also interested in what new types we have to use. Taking a gander using VS2010 Beta 1, I noticed a few new ones that looked interesting and fun: BigInteger Lazy The whole System.Collections.Concurrent namespace. Additions to Threading such as Parallel types and Tasks namespace Charting namespace Etc... I know that it is still in beta and things could change, but I think it's worth trying to get a leg up on learning about all the new classes now (not just the hyped-up ones). I don't really feel like writing my own reflect-and-diff tool to generate this list, so I'm hoping the list (or the tool to generate it) already exists. By the way, I already checked Reflector 's add-ins and the Diff one (while being great) doesn't feel quite right. I think it would be great for getting down to the dirty details, but seems like overkill for just getting the list of the high-level deltas. EDIT: Using bdukes answer, I have created a Google Docs spreadsheet that lists all the new types in 4.0 as of Beta 1. It also contains links to the MSDN online documentation (or a Google Search for generic types since their URI is not as easy to autogenerate).
