Building a model shouldn't be driven solely on maximizing the R squared. You can include as many predictors as you can, square all the predictors and include them, cube them and add them, and so on... until you have as many predictors as you have samples and you can get a R square of 1.0. Obviously, you should never do this. What you should do (most often) is include predictors you think are important, even before you look at the data. Make sure you plot the data. Take particular attention to the residual plot. It may tell you that you should transform your dependent variable, there is a curvilinear relationship, or that an outlier is reducing (or increasing) your R squared. You can then alter the model accordingly. Scaling binary predictor variables (dummy variables are binary) will not explain additional variance. Meaning, the R sq will not change and the new variable is the same as the previous. Only thing different will be the slope.
