For your first problem - yes, you need to RDP into the server in order to use SSMS to start the package. When you start it using SSMS on your client, it's attempting to launch the DTExec process on your client machine. It's not running DTExec on the server. Your second problem is likely a permissions issue. Possibility #1: The connections you have set up on your package require your authentication information, and they don't have it because they're running as the Agent account. You can fix that by creating a Proxy for your account and using that to run your job step. Possibility #2: The connections you have set up on your package are having their sensitive information stripped out due to the default encryption on the packages that prevents anyone but "you" from seeing it - including a SQL Agent job that isn't running "as you". The same resolution as above can help that (as well as others).
