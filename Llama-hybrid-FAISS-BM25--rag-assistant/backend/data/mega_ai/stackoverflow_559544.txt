One thing I like about Resharper is that you can use Ctrl-Shift-Alt-Up or Down to move a method/field/property etc up or down in the file (directly above or below the method/field/property adjacent to it), or you can use the file structure browser to both view and rearrange the structure of your file through drag and drop.
