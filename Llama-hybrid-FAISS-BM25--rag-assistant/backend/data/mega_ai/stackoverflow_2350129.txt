Replacement for C style struct in OOP

I am a student with a mainly electronics background getting into programing. The more I get into it, the more I realize how bad I am at it. I am trying to get better at OO design. One thing I have been reading about is the use of Getters and Setters. http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-09-2003/jw-0905-toolbox.html?page=1 http://typicalprogrammer.com/?p=23 Now I can see the point they are making here but I am still unable to see away around some simple problems. And this brings me to my question (finally). I am setting up a simple tower defense game in AS3 as a learning exercise. I want enemies to follow way points so I was going to make an array of way points, and make that a property of a map object. And a way point was to be an object with an x and a y property (more like a struct). Now I can see that this is exactly the sort of bad practice that the articles are discouraging but I can't seem to think of a better way to do this. Any help from some of you guys with a bit more experience would be much appreciated.
