Thank you very much for your ideas & specially BalusC (much kudos to you). My final solution was a slight mutation and i would like to share with you all. Since I am using richfaces 3.3.3, it is like using jsf1.2, hence no In a conventional situation, you are expected to click on a link with a href pointing to an internal link . I am using many prepackaged components where not every clickable item is a link . It can be any html element. It was very useful to use Ben Alman's Bookmarkable jQuery plugin ( http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-bbq-plugin/ ) Please note below that, onclick I can programmatically set the value of the fragment as key/value and in the following code I replace the old value with a new value jQuery.bbq.pushState(state,2) (or I could have simply added behind the old value jQuery.bbq.pushState(state) ). In my case, ws->md->nd is a hierarchical data where it is enough to have one of them and its parents are calculated on server, so i replace the parent value with child value. In richfaces, this is a cool way to call the setter methods from browser with a parameter. Note that sendURLFragment is treated as a JS method with 5 parameters and the values are passed to the server (which is very cool). Do the thing, when you copy-paste the new url and load the page. window.onload = function(){ if(window.location.hash != ""){ //Parse the fragment (hash) from a URL, deserializing it into an object var deparamObj = jQuery.deparam.fragment(); var ws= '', md= '', nd= '', ld= '', ln = ''; jQuery.each(deparamObj, function(key, value) { switch(key){ case 'ws': ws = value; break; case 'md': md = value; break; case 'nd': nd = value; break; case 'ld': ld = value; break; case 'ln': ln = value; break; default: break; } }); sendURLFragment(ws,md,nd,ld,ln); } };
