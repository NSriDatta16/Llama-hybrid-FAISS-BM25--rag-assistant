Statistical properties of parameters estimated by method of Lagrange multipliers in R

I have time series data that can be fitted by a constrained non-linear function (non-linear in the parameters to be estimated). I'd like to use the method of Lagrange Multipliers ( link ), specifically R's Rsolnp package ( link ), because the Lagrange Multiplier itself has economic meaning. I would like the statistical properties (p values or confidence intervals) of the parameters estimated by solnp in Rsolnp . If my problem didn't involve constraints, I could use R's nls class ( link ) and the summary.nls method ( link ) to retrieve the statistical properties of the fitted parameters. Questions: Is there an equivalent to summary.nls for solnp ? If not, how can I obtain the statistical properties of the parameters estimated by the method of Lagrange Multipliers? A reference to a paper or textbook here will be sufficient. Here are some details of my function (a CES production function from economics) and constraints: Function: iGDP ~ ((1-zeta) * (exp(lambda_L*iYear) * iCapStk^(alpha) * iLabor^beta)^phi + zeta*(exp(lambda_E*iYear) * iQ)^phi)^(1/phi) Constraints: alpha + beta = 1 (Note that I don't want to substitute 1-beta for alpha, because the numerical value of the Lagrange Multiplier has a valuable economic interpretation. I want to use the both the constraint equation and the method of Lagrange Multipliers.) Known data (on an annual basis): iGDP, iYear, iLabor, iCapStk, iQ Parameters to be estimated (these are the parameters for which I would like statistical properties: p values, confidence intervals, etc.): zeta, lambda_E, lambda_L, alpha, beta, phi
