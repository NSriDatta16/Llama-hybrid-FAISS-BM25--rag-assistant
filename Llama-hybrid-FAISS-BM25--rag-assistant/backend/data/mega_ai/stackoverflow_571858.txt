Better is to insert a tag where you want paragraph breaks. It's pretty ugly to put a line break everywhere you want a line break -- that works badly when someone uses a window much wider or much narrower than what you break at. NOTE: If you have preformatted text that you want to include in a JavaDoc, then you can use the tag around this content and your text will not be reformatted into one huge blob. In fact, if you want to explicitly decide where each line break goes, you can use the tag around your entire JavaDoc, although this is an abuse of the intent of this tag.
