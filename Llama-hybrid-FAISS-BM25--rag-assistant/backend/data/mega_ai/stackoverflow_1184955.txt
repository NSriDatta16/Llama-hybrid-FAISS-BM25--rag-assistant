JQuery event.stopPropagation() not working

In my html I have a span of class dragHandle embedded within a li. Item 1 Item 2 link I attach event handlers using jQuery as follows: $(".tree li").click(function(event) { alert("click"); event.stopPropagation(); }); $(".dragHandle").mousedown(function(event) { alert("down"); event.stopPropagation(); }); $(".dragHandle").mouseup(function(event) { alert("Up"); event.stopPropagation(); }); When I mousedown and mouse up over the element I get the down and up alerts, however I also get the click alert of the li's event handler too. I thought that this should be prevented from by the call to event.stopPropagation in the mousedown and mouseup handlers. How do I stop the click event being called for mousedown/up events on the dragHandle? TIA, Adam
