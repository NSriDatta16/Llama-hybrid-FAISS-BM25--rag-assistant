What's the Name of the Python Module that Formats arbitrary Text to nicely looking HTML?

A while ago I came across a Python library that formats regular text to HTML similar to Markdown, reStructuredText and Textile, just that it had no syntax at all. It detected indentatations, quotes, links and newlines/paragraphs only. Unfortunately I lost the name of the library and was unable to Google it. Anyone any ideas? Edit: reStructuredText aka rst == docutils. That's not what I'm looking for :)
