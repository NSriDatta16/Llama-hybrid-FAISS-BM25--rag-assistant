Reasons for NOT scaling-up vs. -out?

As a programmer I make revolutionary findings every few years. I'm either ahead of the curve, or behind it by about Ï€ in the phase. One hard lesson I learned was that scaling OUT is not always better, quite often the biggest performance gains are when we regrouped and scaled up. What reasons to you have for scaling out vs. up? Price, performance, vision, projected usage? If so, how did this work for you? We once scaled out to several hundred nodes that would serialize and cache necessary data out to each node and run maths processes on the records. Many, many billions of records needed to be (cross-)analyzed. It was the perfect business and technical case to employ scale-out. We kept optimizing until we processed about 24 hours of data in 26 hours wallclock . Really long story short, we leased a gigantic (for the time) IBM pSeries, put Oracle Enterprise on it, indexed our data and ended up processing the same 24 hours of data in about 6 hours . Revolution for me. So many enterprise systems are OLTP and the data are not shard'd, but the desire by many is to cluster or scale-out. Is this a reaction to new techniques or perceived performance? Do applications in general today or our programming matras lend themselves better for scale-out? Do we/should we take this trend always into account in the future?
