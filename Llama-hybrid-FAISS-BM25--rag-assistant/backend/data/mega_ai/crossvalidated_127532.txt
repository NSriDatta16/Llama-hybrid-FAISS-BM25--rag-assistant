Most of the time, people deal with nonstationarity by first finding the nature of the nonstationarity and then taking a transformation that makes the new data stationary. For example, stock prices are nonstationary, but daily returns are typically stationary. Another example, trending data are nonstationary, so people will de-trend the data. Check out Elements of Forecasting by FX Diebold. EDIT: Additionally, the commenter is right, your situation doesn't necessarily imply nonstationarity, it could just be a negative shock. You might consider looking up ARIMA processes and learn more about the technical definition of nonstationary in time series.
