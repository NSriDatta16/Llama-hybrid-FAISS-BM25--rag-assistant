If you want to avoid the math but do AI like stuff, you can always stick to simpler models. In 90% of the time, the simpler models will be good enough for real world problems. I don't know of a track of AI that is completely decoupled from math though. Probability theory is the tool for handling uncertainty which plays a major role in AI. So even if there was not-so-mathematical subfield, math techniques would most be a way to improve on those methods. And thus the mathematics would be back in game. Even simple techniques like the naive Bayes and decision trees can be used without a lot of math, but the real understanding comes only through it. Machine learning is very math heavy. It is sometimes said to be close to "computational statistics", with a little more focus on the computational side. You might want to check out "Collective Intelligence" by O'Reilly, though. I hear they have a good collection of ML techniques without math too hard.
