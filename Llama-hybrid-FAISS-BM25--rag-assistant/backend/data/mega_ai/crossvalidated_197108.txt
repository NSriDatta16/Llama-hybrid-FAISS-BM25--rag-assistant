The Monte Carlo simulation suggested by dsaxton is a great solution of the "non-parametric" kind. A (possible) parametric solution would be the following. Suppose you are willing to assume that the amount of points $S_i$ done in week $i$ is $N(\mu,\sigma^2)$, that is, normally distributed with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$. Assume also that all $S_i$, $i=1,2,3,\ldots$ are jointly independent, i.e. the number of points done in one week has no bearing on the number of points done in any of the other weeks. Then, it is known that $$ \sum_{i=1}^t S_i \sim N(t\mu,t\sigma^2) $$ so the amount of points done in $t$ weeks is also normally distributed. Then standardisation yields \begin{align*} \text{Prob}[\text{100 points get done in } t \text{ weeks}] & = 1-\text{Prob}[\sum_{i=1}^t S_i \leqslant 100]\\ & = 1-\text{Prob}[\frac{(\sum_{i=1}^t S_i) - t\mu }{\sqrt{t}\sigma} \leqslant \frac{100-t\mu}{\sqrt{t}\sigma}]\\ & = 1-\Phi\big(\frac{100-t\mu}{\sqrt{t}\sigma}\big) \end{align*} Here, $\Phi(\cdot)$ is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution which even Excel knows (NORM.S.DIST). The values of $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ can be estimated from the observed "points per week" (10,8,10,10,6,12,7,10,12,12) by calculating their sample mean (AVERAGE) and sample variance (VAR.S). The nice thing about the formula is that you can also use it for a noninteger number of weeks $t$ in the future, say for example after $t=2.7$ weeks.
