How to analyze difference in answers between groups across multiple Likert questions? Categorical PCA and Chi Sq?

I'm analyzing this dataset from UCI ML Repo. It's on the perception of Wikipedia amongst university professors/instructors. I'm looking to test the differences between departments in their answers to 5 "Use" questions, mostly pertaining to whether they would have their students use Wikipedia in their classes. At the end of this post is the code to the analysis I've done so far. I first visualized the distribution of each Likert question without and with regards to the departments. Then I conducted a Chi Sq test to see if departments answered one of the questions differently (at least one did). Then I did a post hoc test to see which departments differed (Law and Politics stands out). My question is how can I test for a difference across all 5 questions at once? I thought a Categorical PCA might help, or at least affirm that the 5 questions indeed represent a single over-arching question on Wikipedia perception. The CATPCA's first pc captures 66.2% of the variation, with the next largest capturing only 14.5%, so I think the questions map to the same thing. I'm not sure where to go from here. library(tidyverse); library(likert); library(fifer); library(Gifi) # Preprocessing.
