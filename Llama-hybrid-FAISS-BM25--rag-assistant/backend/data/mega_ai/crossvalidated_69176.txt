Whether you want a) MANOVA b) Multivariate regression or c) several OLS regressions d) something else depends on what you want to test and the nature of the data. If you are interested in relationships among the three dependent variables (DV) as well as between the DVs and the single independent variable (IV) you want either MANOVA or multivariate regression (the latter not to be confused with multiple regression, which has one DV and more than one IV). ANOVA and regression are really the same model, but the ANOVA/MANOVA terminology is usually used when your independent variable is categorical and the regression/multivariate regression when the IV is numeric/continuous. You also have to consider the nature of the DV: All the above assume it is continuous. If it is not, then you probably want some form of logistic regression.
