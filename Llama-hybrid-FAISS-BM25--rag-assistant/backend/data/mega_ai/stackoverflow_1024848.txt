By using a slightly different α that is equal to (1-α the one from the question ), the basic formula to add a new value Y to an existing average of S 0 looks like this: S(Y,S 0 ) = (1-α)Y + αS 0 = Y - αY + αS 0 = Y + α(S 0 -Y) If we now add the length of the time interval t and assume that just α depends on that t, that formula looks like this: S(Y,t,S 0 ) = Y + α t (S 0 -Y) Now assume that t = t 1 + t 2 . If the average is created by adding two values of Y for time time intervals t 1 and t 2 , the resulting average looks like this: S(Y,t 2 , S(Y,t 1 ,S 0 )) = Y + α t 2 (S(Y,t 1 ,S 0 ) - Y) = Y + α t 2 ((Y + α t 1 (S 0 -Y)) - Y) = Y + α t 2 α t 1 (S 0 -Y) If this average should be the same as if the whole t interval would have been added at once, it follows that α t = α t 1 α t 2 . A definition of α that fulfills this requirement would be: α x := A x (for some constant A) Because: α t = A t = A t 1 + t 2 = A t 1 A t 2 = α t 1 α t 2 This results in the following averaging function: S(Y,t,S 0 ) = Y + A t (S 0 -Y) I haven't really tested this, but if the assumptions I made fit your scenario this looks like an averaging function that can handle variations in the sampling intervals quite well.
