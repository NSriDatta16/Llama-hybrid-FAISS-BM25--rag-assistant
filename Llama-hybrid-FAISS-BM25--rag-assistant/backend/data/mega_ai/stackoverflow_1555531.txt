Any existing C# code (OSS) that will calculate diff between two strings and output html?

I need to compare two strings and output the diff in HTML (similar to MS Word "track changes"). Language is C#, this is (not surprisingly) a .NET web app. There are a few similar questions (like this one for PHP/Python ), but no existing question on SO. I don't need a finished project, just anything that will cut out the extra work. I know this problem has been solved at least once. I'm looking to leverage from that starting place (source for an object, just a method, just an algorithm in C#, anything will be useful). Output for the diff needs to be in HTML.
