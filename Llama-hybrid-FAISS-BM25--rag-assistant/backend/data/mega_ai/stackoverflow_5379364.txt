I don't know about your Spring/JAXB combination, but the average REST webservice won't return a response body on POST/PUT, just a response status . You'd like to determine it instead of the body. Replace InputStream response = con.getInputStream(); by int status = con.getResponseCode(); All available status codes and their meaning are available in the HTTP spec, as linked before. The webservice itself should also come along with some documentation which overviews all status codes supported by the webservice and their special meaning, if any. If the status starts with 4nn or 5nn , you'd like to use getErrorStream() instead to read the response body which may contain the error details. InputStream error = con.getErrorStream();
