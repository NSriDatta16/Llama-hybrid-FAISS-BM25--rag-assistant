Advantage of using interrupted time series over t-test/ANOVA

I would like to conduct a study to look at the effect COVID-19 pandemic lockdown has on the following: number of cases at the hospital emergency department (broken down into the different triages and different complaints/diagnoses waiting time to consultation returns to hospital emergency department within 24 hours (percentage data) subsequent admission to general ward or ICU The pre-period (i.e. before lockdown) and the post-period (i.e. after implementation of lockdown) are not consecutive. We are looking at the same months both in pre- and post-periods, each having a total of 60 days. Would it be okay if I use t-test to compare pre- and post-period data? But that would mean aggregating the data into 1 data point pre and 1 data point for post. Would we lose resolution here? Or should I do an interrupted time series, aggregating by day? Appreciate any advice!
