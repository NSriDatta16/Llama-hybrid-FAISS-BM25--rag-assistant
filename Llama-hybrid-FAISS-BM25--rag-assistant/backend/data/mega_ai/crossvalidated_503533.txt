How to find the average distance between randomly distributed points in a rectangle?

Assume there are n points randomly distributed in a rectangle (x being the height y being the width) shown below in the figure. I would like to calculate the average distance between 2 random red points, but my constraints are that these red points are cannot be distributed in the blue and grey colored area. (Areas are 3a * a, 7a * a for blue and grey respectively.) There are 6 grey colored areas and 4 blue colored areas. Assuming that the red points are randomly distributed in this rectangle expect for the blue& grey colored areas, what is the average distance between these red points?? I know that this is quite narrow cased, but what would be the mathematical calculations for this? I would appreciate some help.
