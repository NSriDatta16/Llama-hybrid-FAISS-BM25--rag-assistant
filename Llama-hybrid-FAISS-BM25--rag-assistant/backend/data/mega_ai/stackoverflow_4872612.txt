My guess is, either: A) invalid somehow is declared or defined elsewhere. B) the enum is defined in a header included twice (without header guards). Because you get the same error for this code: enum SomeEnumType { invalid = -1, first, second, }; enum SomeEnumType { invalid = -1, // Does your code compile with GCC? UPDATE: Yes, this seems like a cppcheck bug - #pragma once is not working. If you replace it with #ifndef A_H / #define A_H / #endif header wrapping, cppcheck does not complain anymore. This also seems like a recognized problem .
