others have answered your concern about the best android device for development, this post is going to focus about the best practice with dealing with different hardwares. The typical problem when dealing with different hardware is you have different screen sizes and different hardware capability. For screen size, you can easily handle them by externalizing your UI as much as possible to the XML based layout description language. Android will automatically choose the correct XML file when you provide different UI layout resource files. Android Market also supports filtering of applications based in hardware capability, if your device needs accelerometer you can set in your application so that your application will not be shown to users that don't have an accelerometer, etc. Android makes it relatively easy to handle fragmentation, as long as you take some care.
