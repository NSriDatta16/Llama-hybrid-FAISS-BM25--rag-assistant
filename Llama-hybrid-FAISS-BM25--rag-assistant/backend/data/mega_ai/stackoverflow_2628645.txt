How to Detect IE Version on Vista and Above

I would like to detect what version IE is running on Vista and above (I am developing on 7). I currently use WMI on XP, but it appears that this is no more. I have searched for an answer and so far I have found the following solutions: Using System.Windows.Forms WebBrowser wb = new WebBrowser; wb.Version; SELECT path,filename,extension,version FROM CIM_DataFile WHERE path="\\Program Files\\Internet Explorer\\" AND filename="iexplore" AND extension="exe" AND version>"8.0" And there is probably a way of looking up in the registry. Is there must a more elegant solution to this?
