XML Parsing error not well formed. The problem is in the variable content, workaround?

Working on an API but I've run into a problem. This specific part of the response (in XML) returns a URL. Here's the error I'm getting: XML Parsing Error: not well-formed http://cnn.com/.../?hpt=C2&replytocom=11119#respond First off, I added an ellipses to shorten the length of that for viewing purposes here on the forum. Now, The error tracker line thing, that I didn't include above, points to the second equals = character in that URL. So. I can't help that this URL is showing up in the XML response. Is there some sort of workaround? Surely there's some way to tell XML that it's CONTENT, not and make it ignore this.. Thanks --EDIT for comment below -- same error as before, different label, different character.
