Your intuition is good, yet it is clearer to work with a smooth probability distribution $p(x)$ rather than an histogram or an empirical distribution. I will assume for simplicity that the distribution is unimodal. The problem of finding intervals for a one-dimensional distribution may also be generalised to that of finding domains for the probability density $p(\mathbf{x})$ of a random vector $\mathbf{X}$ in dimension $d$. Given a probability level $1-\alpha$ (e.g., $1-\alpha = 0.95$), many domains exist with this probability. Among these, is is natural to choose one having minimal volume (minimal interval length for $d=1$). It can be shown that such a domain is the inside of a probability contour $p(\mathbf{x}) = \mathrm{Cst}$. When $d=1$, the domain is an interval and the probability density takes the same value $\mathrm{Cst}$ on both end-points say $x_{\mathrm{left}}$ and $x_{\mathrm{right}}$. This is your horizontal line. If the distribution is strongly skewed, the two probabilities $\mathrm{Pr}[X x_{\mathrm{right}} ]$ can be very different, their sum being $\alpha$. Finding $\mathrm{Cst}$ given $1-\alpha$ can be done using a numerical routine or simply a table. The problem is a special case of the determination of a probabilty contour , cf. Box and Tiao Bayesian Inference in Statistical Analysis .
