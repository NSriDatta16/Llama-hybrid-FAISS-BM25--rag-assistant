Recall means to bring back or remember. The terminology comes from information retrieval where it's usually being applied to a result set from a query. I suppose the sense of it is, how much of the set of right answers was retrieved by the query? how much of it was recalled? I don't know if "coverage" is better or not. The word "sensitivity" is also used to mean the same thing as "recall". In any event, these are just the standard words for these ideas.
