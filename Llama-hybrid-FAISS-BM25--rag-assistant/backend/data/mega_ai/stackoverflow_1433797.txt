You'll need an EJB deployment descriptor in test.jar/META-INF/ejb-jar.xml and the EAR deployment descriptor has to go to your.ear/META-INF/application.xml ( NOT inside the EJB jar!). The ejb-jar.xml will contain something like the following XML fragment for your EJBs: MyCoolEJB test.TestHome test.Test test.TestEJB or entries ... --> I worked with EJB3 myself, where things are a little bit different and you don't have the home interfaces any longer. So take my example with a grain of salt. Inside the web.xml you'll have to have a corresponding reference to the EJB: TheJNDINameOfYourEJB Session MyCoolEJB above --> The points to the corresponding of your EJB, if your reference is in the same JAR as your EJB. Otherwise, you'll have to preprend the name of the JAR such as test.jar#MyCoolEJB . Then, in your servlet you can do a JNDI lookup for "java:comp/env/TheJNDINameOfYourEJB" to access the home interface of your EJB. I hope, that gave you a few pointers to delve deeper yourself. BTW: If EJB 2.x is not a fixed requirement, then have a look at EJB 3.x. A lot of things got easier to use in that version!
