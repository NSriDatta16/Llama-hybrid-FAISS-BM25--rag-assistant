Also a co-author here. Being "from the horse's mouth" it's probably by far the most complete write-up out there for Mahout itself. There are some good blog posts out there, and certainly plenty of good books on more generally machine learning (I like Collective Intelligence in Action as a broad light intro). user@mahout.apache.org has a few people that say they like the book FWIW, as do the book forums (http://www.manning-sandbox.com/forum.jspa?forumID=623) I think you can return the e-book if it's not quite what you wanted. It definitely has 6 chapters on clustering.
