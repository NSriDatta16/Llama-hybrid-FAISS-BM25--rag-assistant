How can I use GloVe for text spinning?

Hello I am building a python program for text spinning. I have read about GloVe, word2vec, doc2vec or text2vec. I understand that what they do is to represent each word as a semantic vector. So I guess that if I train a GloVe I could use it just for finding synonyms, or something more? EDIT: I have come up with one strategy: First I train a doc2vec model. The goal would be to build semantic vectors of phrases Then I use my original paragraph input. Word by word I change it randomly with a synonym (provided by nltk or other synonym db). Before finally spinning one word I compute the doc2vec for the changed paragraph and compute the distance with the original paragraph vectorized. I only change the synonym if the distance is small. How does that sound to you?
