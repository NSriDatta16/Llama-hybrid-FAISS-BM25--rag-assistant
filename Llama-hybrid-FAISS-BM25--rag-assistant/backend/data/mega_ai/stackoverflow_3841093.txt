From the docs for StringTokenizer StringTokenizer is a legacy class that is retained for compatibility reasons although its use is discouraged in new code. It is recommended that anyone seeking this functionality use the split method of String or the java.util.regex package instead. what happens if you uses something like String.split() it should return a list of Strings in an array and you can work when them? Sorry without showing any code its difficult to suggest an improvement. PS: Whats a keyboard?
