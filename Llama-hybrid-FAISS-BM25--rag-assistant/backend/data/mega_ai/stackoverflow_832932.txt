How is the organization of the 12 Bit RGB color format?

I know that the 12 bit RGB color pallette format , has 4 bit for each color R,G,B. But how is the structure of the raw data i.e. 1.) Does each color have a byte corresponding to it which in turn has 4 padding bits , and 4 data bits for color data or 2.) Its a packed format , i.e. Byte-1= (padding bits + 4-Rbits) Byte-2 = (4-Gbits+4Bits) How is the packing done? Thank You. -AD
