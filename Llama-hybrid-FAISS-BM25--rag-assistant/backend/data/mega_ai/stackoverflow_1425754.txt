iPhone-SDK:Remove white spaces from a paragraph string?

I have two paragraph in a string. But the contents are having many spaces in between the paragraph string. I want to remove the spaces from this big paragraph string. I tried using NSString *outPutStr = [outPutStr stringByTrimmingCharactersInSet:[NSCharacterSet whitespaceCharacterSet]]; But it doesn't remove empty spaces that are there in the paragraph string. It does nothing. Can someone please guide me with sample? thanks. Clave/
