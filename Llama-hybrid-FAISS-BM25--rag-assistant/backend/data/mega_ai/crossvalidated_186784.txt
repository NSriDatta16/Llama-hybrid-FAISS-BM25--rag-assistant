Personally, I think it is very difficult for people to grasp what does it mean by certain amount of change in odds... But it is more clear to directly compare the difference of interest: the p's In your case. At the current value of your predictors, increase 1 unit (can be any change you specify) in the first predictor means increase of $logit^{-1}(−14.27+3.32(4)+0.88(7)) - logit^{-1}(−14.27+3.32(3)+0.88(7))$ $\approx0.99-0.86 = 0.13$, i.e., it is a 0.13 increase in probability of being 1. But of course, this varies as the current values of the predictor changes, a common practice (if you are not interested in this specific predictor value) is to let the current predictor value be at the average, which corresponds the biggest change in probability, then you can say, as the predictor values move towards the end, changes in probability are expected to slow down.
