A Markov chain process and a time series process are two completely different kinds of stochastic processes, though all methods behind stochastic processes have similar features. You should distinguish different stochastic processes first by looking at the following table, which is taken from juan2013integrating . [2] You can try to convert a Markov chain process to a time series process by normalising, which makes the state space relatively continuous. But I don't see the point of any conversion. Usually, time series analysis focuses on dynamics regarding many lags, while the main idea behind Markov chains is to omit the history and focus on the current state. Also, time series analysis has been applied widely, while theoretical approaches for other three kinds are emphasised most of the time.
