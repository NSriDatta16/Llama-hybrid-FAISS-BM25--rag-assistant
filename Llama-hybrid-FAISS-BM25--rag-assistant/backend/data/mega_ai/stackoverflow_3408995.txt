Organize Project Solution w/ Interfaces for Repository

VS 2010 / C# Trying to organize a solution and looking for options for naming the project that will host the interfaces for the repository. I have: MyProject.Domain MyProject.WebUI MyProject.Repositories MyProject.Interfaces?? So far "Interfaces" is the best name i've come up with, but I don't like it. Any ideas/suggestions?
