Reinforcement Learning : Agents make a sequence of decisions through reward/penalty for the action performed To answer your question yes RL can be used for classification Though reinforcement learning can be utilized to solve classification problems it is not recommended. Reinforcement Learning takes long time to train Accuracy of Supervised Classification > Accuracy of Reinforcement Learning This paper can help you get started on the Reinforcement learning algorithms that can be used for solving classification problems Video explanation of why not to go for RL for classification
