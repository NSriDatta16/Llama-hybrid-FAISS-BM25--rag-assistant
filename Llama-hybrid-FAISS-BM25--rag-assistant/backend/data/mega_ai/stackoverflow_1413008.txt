How can I avoid a picturebox to disappear when I move and place it on another picturebox in runtime?

I tested the code in this webpage that is for moving a picturebox in runtime: http://www.davidsuarez.es/2007/11/mover-y-soltar-controles-con-drag-drop-visual-basic/ I created a Form with two pictureboxex: Picture1 and Picture2 (the page is in Spanish, so I copy the modified code here): Dim DY As Single Dim DX As Single Dim Flag_MouseMove As Boolean Private Sub CancelarDrag(Source As Control) Source.Visible = True Source.Drag vbCancel End Sub Private Sub FinalizarDrag(Source As Control, Button As Integer) If Button = vbLeftButton Then Source.Visible = True Source.ZOrder Source.Drag vbEndDrag End If End Sub Private Sub IniciarDrag(Source As Control, Button As Integer, X As Single, Y As Single) If Button = vbLeftButton Then DX = X DY = Y Source.Drag vbBeginDrag Source.Visible = False Source.Drag End If End Sub Private Sub Form_DragDrop(Source As Control, X As Single, Y As Single) Dim ejeY, ejeX As Single ejeX = X - 60 ejeY = Y - 60 ejeX = ejeX - DX ejeY = ejeY - DY Source.Visible = True Source.Move ejeX, ejeY Source.Drag vbEndDrag Source.ZOrder End Sub Private Sub Picture1_DragDrop(Source As Control, X As Single, Y As Single) CancelarDrag Picture1 End Sub Private Sub Picture1_MouseDown(Button As Integer, Shift As Integer, X As Single, Y As Single) IniciarDrag Picture1, Button, X, Y Flag_MouseMove = True End Sub Private Sub Picture1_MouseUp(Button As Integer, Shift As Integer, X As Single, Y As Single) FinalizarDrag Picture1, Button Flag_MouseMove = False End Sub Private Sub Picture2_DragDrop(Source As Control, X As Single, Y As Single) CancelarDrag Picture2 End Sub Private Sub Picture2_MouseDown(Button As Integer, Shift As Integer, X As Single, Y As Single) IniciarDrag Picture2, Button, X, Y Flag_MouseMove = True End Sub Private Sub Picture2_MouseUp(Button As Integer, Shift As Integer, X As Single, Y As Single) FinalizarDrag Picture2, Button Flag_MouseMove = False End Sub The code works nicely, except if the cursor is inside the area of the other picturebox and I drop my moving picturebox there. The moving picturebox disappears and never comes back until I reload the form. How can I avoid this "picturebox disappearing"?.
