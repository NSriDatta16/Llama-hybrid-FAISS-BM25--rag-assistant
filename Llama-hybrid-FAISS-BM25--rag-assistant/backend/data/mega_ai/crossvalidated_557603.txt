The "dangerous" part of the ratio is the inverted denominator If you have a ratio term involving two explanatory variables in a regression model, this can be written as the interaction term : $$\frac{x_{1,i}}{x_{2,i}} = x_{1,i} \times \frac{1}{x_{2,i}}.$$ Now, there is nothing inherently problematic or dangerous about having an interaction term involving the explanatory variable $x_{1,i}$ , and indeed, we have interaction terms like this in many regression models. However, it is arguably quite "dangerous" to have a model term that inverts the explanatory variable $x_{2,i}$ --- if this value is small for some data points then this explanatory term will "explode" at those data points, which will generally cause them to have large positive or negative values yielding high leverage points in the regression (i.e., they will affect the OLS fit a lot). Be careful painting this situation with too broad a brush, because terms of this kind are not always dangerous. Indeed, if the explanatory variable $x_{2,i}$ was already "explosive" (say, because it was already the inverse of a stable random variable with a mean near zero) then inversion may actually make it more stable instead of more explosive. As a general rule, if we invert a random variable with relatively low kurtosis, and a mean near zero, we will tend to get a random variable with high kurtosis (i.e., high probability of extreme values), and vice versa . Here we have concentrated on the term involving an inverted explanatory variable. Of course, it is possible that the interaction with $x_{1,i}$ could aggravate the explosive nature of this term, particularly if large values of $x_{1,i}$ tend to go with small values of $x_{2,i}$ . But as you can see, it is really the inversion that is the "dangerous" part. Whether or not the ratio term is "dangerous" largely comes down to whether or not the inverted term $1/x_{2,i}$ is "dangerous" in its own right. If $x_{2,i}$ has some small values then this term will be quite explosive and yield high-leverage data points.
