Better to use wald test or likelihood ratio test to make pairwise comparisons after omnibus test in this scenario

I am testing the association between a gene and a binary disease. The gene has many different "versions". These versions are called alleles.I am also including covariates for sex, age, etc. Right now I am doing a logistic regression-based omnibus test for the gene like this (pseudocode): full I think I realize I could follow omnibus with the wald test to determine how significant each allele is, but I am wondering if this is best done with the LR test, which would allow me to account for the covariates on each allele comparisons, like this: full1 , etc. My gut feeling is that the LR approach would be better for by allele comparisons, because of the inclusion of covariates. Is this the case?
