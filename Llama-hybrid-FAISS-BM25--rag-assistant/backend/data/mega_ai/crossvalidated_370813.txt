Consistency of the estimator of the variance of the error

In the classical linear regression model, the estimator of the variance of the regression error is $s^2 = \frac{e'e}{n-k} = \frac{u'Mu}{n-k}$ where u is the error vector, e is the residual vector, and M is the projection matrix of X. It can be shown that $\mathrm{plim} \: s^2 = \sigma^2$ because $\mathrm{plim} \: (\frac{u'u}{n}) = \sigma^2$ . The last expression is part of the proof of the consistency of the $s^2$ . An econometrics textbook presents this derivation. But just after this, it says the following: This last step requires a little attention. If $\mathrm{E}[u] = 0$ and $\mathrm{Var}[u] = \sigma^2I_n$ as we always assume, then $\mathrm{E}[\frac{u'u}{n}] = \sigma^2$ . This is not sufficient to prove that $\mathrm{plim} \: (\frac{u'u}{n}) = \sigma^2$ . We need an additional assumption, for example that the errors are normal. Under normality we have $\frac{u'u}{\sigma^2} \sim \chi^2(n)$ , so that $\mathrm{Var[u'u] = 2n\sigma^4}$ and hence $\mathrm{Var}[\frac{u'u}{n}] = \frac{2\sigma^4}{n} \rightarrow 0$ . (A somewhat weaker additional condition would be that the errors are not just uncorrelated but i.i.d, un which case a stronger theorem, due to Khintchine, can be invoked.) Why is showing $\mathrm{plim} \: (\frac{u'u}{n}) = \mathrm{plim} \: \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^{n} u_i^2 = \sigma^2$ not sufficient? When showing the consistency of a statistic, is not the probability limit argument enough? Do I also need to show that the variance collapses to $\mathrm{E}[\frac{u'u}{n}]$ ? I thought that either the probability limit or the variance argument is enough to prove consistency. But the excerpt seems to suggest otherwise. What is the point of this excerpt?
