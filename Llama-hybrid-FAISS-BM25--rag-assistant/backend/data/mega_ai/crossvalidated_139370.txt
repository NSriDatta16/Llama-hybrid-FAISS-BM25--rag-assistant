what should be the null hypothesis?

conduct a test hypothesis to show that it takes longer for people with average fitness to successfully complete physical therapy as compared to those with above average physical fitness. Test at $\alpha$=0.01 level of significance. here $\mu_2$=average fitness,$\mu_3$=above average physical fitness. in my view null hypothesis $H_0$:$\mu_2$>$\mu_3$ alternative hypothesis $H_1$:$\mu_2$$\ngtr$$\mu_3$ am i right?
