tchar safe functions -- count parameter for UTF-8 constants

I'm porting a library from char to TCHAR. the count parameter of this fragment, according to MSDN, is the number of multibyte characters, not the number of bytes. so, did I get this right? My project properties in VC9 say 'use unicode character set' and I think that's correct, but I'm not how that impacts my count parameter. _tcsncmp(access, TEXT("ftp"), 3); //or do i want _tcsnccmp? "Supported on Windows platforms only, _mbsncmp and _mbsnbcmp are multibyte versions of strncmp. _mbsncmp will compare at most count multibyte characters and _mbsnbcmp will compare at most count bytes. They both use the current multibyte code page. _tcsnccmp and _tcsncmp are the corresponding Generic functions for _mbsncmp and _mbsnbcmp, respectively. _tccmp is equivalent to _tcsnccmp." A similar question is _tcslen vs _tcsclen.
