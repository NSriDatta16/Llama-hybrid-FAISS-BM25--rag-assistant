B-VAE, how to fit the prior with passed latent encoding?

I'm reading a RL article that is using a B-VAE to encode states. Here is the original article presenting reinforcement learning with imagined goals (RIG) Ashvin Nair et al., " Visual Reinforcement Learning with Imagined Goals " 2018. In the presented algorithm, the authors put a step (page 6, Algorithm 1, line 3) that is : "Fit prior $p(z)$ to latent encodings $\{\mu_{\phi}(s^{(i)})\}$ I understand what $p(z)$ and $\{\mu_{\phi}(s^{(i)})\}$ are (or at least I think I do ...) but I have no idea about how to fit one to another. Any idea or helpful references?
