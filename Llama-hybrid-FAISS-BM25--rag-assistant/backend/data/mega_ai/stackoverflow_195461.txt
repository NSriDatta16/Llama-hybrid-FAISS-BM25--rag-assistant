I've only used it from a user perspective, I've never plugged anything into it. I consider the My namespace to be some highly reliable, platform-provided, global helper mechanisms. Officially sanctioned shortcuts, really. I might be surprised to see external user or third-party code in there. As such, I'd encourage a vb framework to define its own appropriately-named namespace instead of latching on to the existing My namespace. Such a framework shouldn't have that "global" feel to it.
