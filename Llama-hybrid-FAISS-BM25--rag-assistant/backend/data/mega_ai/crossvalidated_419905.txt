The appropriate statistical model for categorical/binary DV + mixed design

What R function should I use to build the appropriate logistic regression model if I have the following structure? Independent variables A categorical variable that varies between-subjects A categorical variable that varies within-subjects Another categorical variable that varies within-subjects Dependent variable Categorical variable with 2 possible outcomes: TRUE vs. FALSE ======================================== In addition to these, participants and test items will be treated as random effects. I'm lost and I would really appreciate some help.
