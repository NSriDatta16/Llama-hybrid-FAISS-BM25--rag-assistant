There isn't a dimension missing because PC1 and PC2 are "summaries" of all your variable. Infact, PC1 is a linear combination of your feature, calculate like: PC1 = v1*feature1 + v2*feature2 + v3*feature3 + ... where v1,v2 and v3 are scalar number calculated directly by PCA model. PCA calculed n PC, where n is equal to your number of feature and are selected the first and the second PC because are those that explain the greatest variability in the system.
