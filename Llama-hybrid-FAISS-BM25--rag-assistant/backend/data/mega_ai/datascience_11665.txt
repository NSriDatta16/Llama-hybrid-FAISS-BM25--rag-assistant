Obtain a model where each feature vector is past few samples and labels are future few samples?

So, I have this data set where each instance is made of past 20 samples of 2 variables. Labels are next five samples. So every instance looks like this: Instance1_feature = [s1_var1 s2_var1 ... s20_var1 s1_var2 s2_var2 ... s20_var2] Instance1_label = [s21_var1 s22_var2 ... s25_var5 s21_var2 s22_var2 ... s25_var2] Instance2_feature = [s2_var1 s3_var1 ... s21_var1 s2_var2 s3_var2... s21_var2] Instance2_label = [s22_var1 s23_var2 ... s26_var5 s22_var2 s23_var2 ... s26_var2] All the data are categorical. var1 takes value in {1,2,3,4,5}; var2 takes value in {6,7,8,9,10} I am familiar with machine learning. Hence I am looking for a way to develop a model to predict labels for a new instance. I have reasons to believe that by looking at the past samples, it is possible to predict future samples. Its like stock prices. Any help, links to code samples will be highly appreciated. EDIT This is a dataset I collected while driving. I want to see if I can predict next 5 seconds of my driving, given I have past 20 seconds of data. That's why I created the feature vectors and labels like this. The values {1,2,3,4,5} and {6,7,8,9,10} are categorical, as in the variables are split into segments.
