How should I build a Knowledge Graph for a custom dataset?

I'm new to machine learning and I'm trying to create a small Knowledge Graph for search purposes similar to Google for a class project. Okay, so I have been searching on this topic for few days and this is what I have found from the web and research papers. Create RDF triples or use already existing databases like Freebase, Wikidata, etc. Then train the model using some algorithms like ComplEx, TransE, etc. And finally use it for the queries. My problem is that I don't want to use an already existing database. I have a set of documents with me. Is there any good library for making triples from custom data? Also after training my model, which database should I use to store my model and how to query it back for answers.
