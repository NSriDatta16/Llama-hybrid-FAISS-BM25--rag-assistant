Preventing cache on back-button in Safari 5

As of recent safari 5 was released, and it turns out to cause some problems for my website.

For instance, you can be on a page that lists products, then go to details about a product and change the product (admin-view). When you click save on the product the information is sent to the server via AJAX, and a history.back() is issued. This works great in all browsers (including safari Dim pStr pStr = "private, no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate" Response.AddHeader "pragma","no-cache" '? Response.AddHeader "cache-control", pStr '? Er ikke sikker på om disse 3 siste er nødvendige. Response.AddHeader "cache-control", "post-check=0, pre-check=0" '? Er ikke sikker på om disse 3 siste er nødvendige. Response.AddHeader "Expires", "Mon, 26 Jul 1997 05:00:00 GMT" '? Response.AddHeader "Last-Modified", Now()
