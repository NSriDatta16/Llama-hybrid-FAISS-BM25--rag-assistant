Spurious regression for large T small N logistic regression?

My question is - Will there be problem of spurious regression for large T small N panel logistic regression (with individual fixed effects), if the dependent variable is binary (0 or 1), and independent variables are non-stataionary? T is time dimension, N is individual dimension, and the panel data sample size is N*T Can nonlinear model (like logit and probit models) have the problem of spurious regression? Thanks for any advice!
