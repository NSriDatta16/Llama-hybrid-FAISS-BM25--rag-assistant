NSPoint/NSRect from character in NSTextView

So I am trying to get either an NSPoint or NSRect corresponding with the location of a specific character in an NSTextView. This is what I have so far (that isn't working very well, the results seem kind of unpredictable. NSRange theTextRange = [[theTextView layoutManager] glyphRangeForCharacterRange:[theTextStorage editedRange] actualCharacterRange:NULL]; NSRect theTextRect = [[theTextView layoutManager] boundingRectForGlyphRange:theTextRange inTextContainer:[theTextView textContainer]];
