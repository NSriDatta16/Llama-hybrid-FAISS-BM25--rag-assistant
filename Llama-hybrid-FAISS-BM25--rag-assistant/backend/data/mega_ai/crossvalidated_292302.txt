Look at my answer to my own question (same as the one you posted). You can make use of the pacf function in R, extending it to a matrix with 2 or more time series. I have checked results between the multivariate acf and ccf functions and they yield the same results, so the same can be concluded about the multivariate pacf and the non-existing pccf .
