Maybe you chose this design for a specific reason that you did not illustrate in your question, but - just in case this is not the case - let me point out how you could leverage the built-in functionalities of Drupal and known API's to achieve what you want in less steps. Use the Blog API module (shipped with Drupal Core) to expose widely known and well documented API's to the outside world, via the built-in XML-RPC interface. Blog API exposes various blog-oriented API's, which are documented here , here and here . Use code available online to implement the webservice consumer. I know nothing about C#, but from a quick google search, it seems such code is not difficult at all to be found. For example, here's some code from microsoft for metaweblog API's. If for some reason you need or want to implement your own API with SOAP, then you should specify what your difficulties are . I assume you already created the SOAP services by following the documentation available online, and in particular this comment and this series of screencasts . If this is the case, what is the difficult on the C# side? As stated before, I do not develop in C#, but - at least by googling it - it does seem like there is plenty of documentation and sample code available for this.
