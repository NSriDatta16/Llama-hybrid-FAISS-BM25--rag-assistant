The soft margin SVM has a maximum, provided that the feasibility region is not empty. By Weierstrass' I and II theorems, continuous functions have minima and maxima over compact sets, such as the feasibility region of the soft margin problem. As it comes to hard margins, one can construct examples without a max value. Take the data matrix $X$ as the zero matrix and\or $y^{(i)} = 0$ for $1\le i \le n$ . Your problem is reduced to: $$ \max_{\alpha} \Big(\sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i \Big)\:\text{such that } \alpha_i \ge 0 \qquad \forall 1\le i\le n $$ which is unbounded.
