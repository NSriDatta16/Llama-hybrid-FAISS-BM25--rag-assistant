Learning CSS selectors for jQuery

I want to learn jQuery. In my opinion jQuery just select the element you want and then do something on it. However the select manner is close to CSS selector. And I am not familiar CSS css selector since I always think it is rather unsystematic, I can not find any rules. All I know about the CSS selector is the following: #id .class So I wonder there is any rule when using CSS/jQuery selector? UPDATE: can you guys give me an explaination,I can not understand this: In CSS 2.1, style is normally attached to an element based on its position in the document tree. This simple model is sufficient for many cases, but some common publishing scenarios may not be possible due to the structure of the document tree. For instance, in HTML 4 (see [HTML4]), no element refers to the first line of a paragraph, and therefore no simple CSS selector may refer to it. Seems like it is the reason for "Pseudo-elements and pseudo-classes" imported,but what is the exactly meaning? How to understand " no element refers to the first line of a paragraph, and therefore no simple CSS selector may refer to it "?
