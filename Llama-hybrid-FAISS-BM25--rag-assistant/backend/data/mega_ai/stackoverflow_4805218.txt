Prevent users from manually entering dates in input boxen

I am using the jQuery datepick plugin on two input boxes, and would like to prevent users of my Web site from manually entering dates in those input boxes. How could I do that? I think I could cancel the onkeydown and onkeypress events, but it doesn't strike me as particularly elegant to do the same thing on two event handlers. Is there any other means to achieve the same thing?
