Apparrently Glassfish requires a "User-Agent" header. It's working with anything, just as long as it is set. This works (ripped from Chrome's resource panel): httparty -v -H "User-Agent":"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_5_8; en-US) AppleWebKit/533.4 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/5.0.375.125 Safari/533.4" http://localhost:8080/parakeet/tickets/34 As does this httparty -v -H "User-Agent":"Commander Cool" http://localhost:8080/parakeet/tickets/34
