Oracle have done some work and IBM have done some research too . I studied the semantic web at university a couple of years ago and I wasn't convinced then. It doesn't seem to have made much progress beyond academia since then. The basic problem is that needs to get a critical mass of ontologies to be widely used, but creating that critical mass is too difficult so it just isn't going to happen. Some other questions that are related: Is there any killer application for Ontology/semantics/OWL/RDF yet? Do you leverage Semantic Web technologies? Why or why not?
