You should use a Partial Mutual Information algorithm for input variable (feature) selection. It is based on MI concepts and probability density estimation. For example in: Kernel based PMI : (+) has a stopping criteria (Akaike Information Criteria) (-) higher complexity kNN based PMI : (-) does not have a stopping criteria (+) lower complexity I used PMI to reduce the number of neural network inputs as they increase complexity and introduce other problems. You can find a complete overview of Input Variable Selection (IVS) algorithms in Review of Input Variable Selection Methods for Artificial Neural Networks paper. You can use IVS for SVM and other. To make things short, use PMI.
