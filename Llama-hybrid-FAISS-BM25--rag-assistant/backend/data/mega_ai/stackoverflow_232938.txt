RCDATA terminator

I have a .rc file which is used to include some text data in my executable, like this: 1234 RCDATA myfile.txt This works fine: the content of the 'myfile.txt' is included in my executable. The problem is that no 0-terminator is added to the string, and I cannot add it to the file. Is there any way of adding a 0-terminator from within the .rc file? Something like this: 1234 RCDATA { myfile.txt, "\0" } // error RC2104 Note that I already found this solution, but I am looking for something more elegant. 1234 RCDATA myfile.txt 1235 RCDATA { "\0" } Thanks alot, eli
