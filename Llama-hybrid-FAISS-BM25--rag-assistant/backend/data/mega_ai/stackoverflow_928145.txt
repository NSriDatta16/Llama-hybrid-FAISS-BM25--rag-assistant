If you code your own solution, you will probably benefit from reading larger chunks of data from the file and processing them in batches (rather than using, say, readline() ) and looking for the newline marking the end of each row. With this approach, you need to be mindful that you may not have retrieved the entirety of the last line, so some logic would be required to handle that. I don't know what performance benefits you'd realize, since I haven't tested it, but I've leveraged similar techniques with success.
