Cross correlations

I have a question about cross correlations and multivariate time series. I've read several articles and posts on SE about how to properly prewhiten data for cross correlation of two time series, and I'm seeking some clarification. This is a summary of what I have read: Approach 1: make data stationary through first differencing for x and y, then compute cross correlations. Approach 2: run arima on x and arima on y, save residuals for each, run cross correlations on residuals. Approach 3: run arima on y, save residuals. Run cross correlation on stationary x and residuals of y. Approach 4: run arima on x, save residuals. Running cross correlation between residuals of x and stationary y. For obvious reasons, each approach yields very different results. I'm looking for the best approach for selecting potential exogenous variables for a forecast model. Any thoughts are appreciated.
