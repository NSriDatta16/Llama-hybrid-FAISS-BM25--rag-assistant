What sort of data are you collecting ? You're talking about crowd-sourcing, and thus (I assume) aggregating of data across this crowd. As they're talking about products they buy, I suspect you're going to be athering product attributes and prices. Some possible approaches. If you users are entering non-numerical data (e.g. colours), just record the most common entries, or the mode (the most commonly entered). If they're entering numeric data, discard outliers. i.e. bin the lowest and highest results, and average the rest (you could do this for prices, say. This is the approach that electronic exchanges use for resolving closing prices out of many trades). Depending on your application, you may want to have a historical bias towards the most recent entries. But this all depends on your application, and how much storage and crunching of data you're prepared to do.
