If you're willing to do manual string parsing, then you only need to rewrite the remainder of the file contents that occur after the value, assuming you change the length of the string. If you don't change the length of the string, you can edit in place. Unless this file of serialized data is very large though, I really doubt you will do anything but make it slower. I wouldn't bother though. If this is causing a performance issue for you, I would seriously consider a different storage format.
