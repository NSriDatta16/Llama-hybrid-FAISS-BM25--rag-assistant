I would keep the referenced third party dlls in TFS within your project. Structured similar to: /ProjectSolution /ProjectA /ProjectB /lib /3rdPartyLibA /3rdPartyLibB Now edit your build definition, in the Workspace tab, in the Working folders section, make a reference to you /lib folder in your project. The build agent will retrieve the 3rd party libs and use it for compilation.
