Dropout value - increase, decrease, keep the same across layers

I'm confused about dropout values that people set. Sometimes it's the same value, say 0.4. Sometimes they increase them gradually from 0.2 to 0.5. For example after maxpooling in CNNs. Sometimes I see that numbers go up and down and then up again. Is there a rule for this kind of decisions?
