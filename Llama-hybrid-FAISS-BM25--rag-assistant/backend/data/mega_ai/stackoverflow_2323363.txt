SSL Solves this problem. For the record, passwords should never be "encrypted" or "encoded", this employs that there is a method of "Decoding" or "Decrypting" which is a clear violation if CWE-257 . Passwords must be hashed, SHA-256 is a great choice, but this is not meant for transmission, only storage. When you transit secrets there is a long list of things that can go wrong, SSL is by far the best choice for solving these issues. If the attacker can sniff the traffic then they will be able to see the session id and use it immediately, so its a moot point. You have to use SSL to protect the authenticated session anyway.
