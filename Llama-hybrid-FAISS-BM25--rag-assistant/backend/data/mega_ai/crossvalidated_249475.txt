Your sampling scheme should depend on what you would like to get from your inferential methods and how your sample data were collected or are intended to be collected. I immediately see two types of inference you might want to make: (a) inference across plants regardless of type, and (b) inference for each type of plant. For (a), if you have a target population to which you would like to make inference and know or have estimates for the distribution of plant type in your population, you can construct sampling weights for your data and weight a ccordingly (this might be your 2,714 data points, I'm not sure I understand whether these describe your population or your sample that you have already collected). In this way, the weighted inferences would reflect the makeup of the population and you wouldn't need to worry too much about the makeup of your sample. If you wanted to make inferences conditioned on plant type as in (b), you would want to pay more attention to the representation of the plant type in your sample because you would want enough data to perform estimaton with standard errors of reasonable size. Note that both of these can be accomplished if you use sampling weights. If you want to include the same number of plants of each type, this can produce valid estimates conditioned on plant type, but estimates made across plant type will likely be biased unless you weight.
