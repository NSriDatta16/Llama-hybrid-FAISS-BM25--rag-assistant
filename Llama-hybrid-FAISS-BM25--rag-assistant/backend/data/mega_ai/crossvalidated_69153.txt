Basically, any sort of hypothesis test based on very small samples requires strong assumptions . In the frequentist framework these are basically made in regards to the distribution of your data (properties like normality, homoscedasticity, etc.) which you can't check in small samples and also because the robustness properties that many tests thankfully possess are not yet in force. Note that with check I mean more things like visually inspecting the distribution instead of formal hypothesis testing for assumption which is not generally useful as John states. In the bayesian framework some of these assumptions can also be in the form of prior information. As a very general advise it is often necessary and even useful to make strong assumption like these above but they should a) be stated clearly, b) discussed whether they are reliable (e.g. give references) and c) ideally some indication of how much your results depend on these assumptions. More specific for your question I am surprised that the shapiro-test is actually able to find deviations given your small sample size of 3 samples per group. Are you sure you used it correctly? It is within-group normality that is required not overall normalness which is a common mistake for beginner's to make. For example, from your given organic carbon content data I would say that it's impossible to say whether this data is from a normal distribution or not. One starting point before doing an analysis is always to try to get an impression of what distribution you can expect from your data based on previous samples by other peoples.
