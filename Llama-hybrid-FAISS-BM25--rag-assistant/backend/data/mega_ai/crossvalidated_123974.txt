You should treat each bin as if it were generating random points uniformly within its bounds. Therefore calculate a weighted average for each bin $(x_l, x_h]$ of $E(x) = \frac{x_h + x_l}{2}$ and $E(x^2) = \frac{x_h^2 + x_lx_h + x_l^2}{3}$. This weighted average determines a Gaussian. You can incorporate a prior by treating this Gaussian as a likelihood.
