Will WPF be the savior for our lack luster UI’s?

I was reading Pro WPF in C# 2008 yesterday (in anonymous bookstore) and in chapter 2 they mention that XAML allows for the graphic design and the programmer to be completely independent. It got me wondering if most companies are moving toward having dedicated design specialists for implementing there UI’s? I know at our company we have had less than encouraging comments about our displays/UI's and we have even considered bringing in consultants . All of our UI development is done by the developer. Should we have/hire a graphic design specialist, or hire a consultant to look at our work, or will WPF be the savior for our lack luster UI’s?
