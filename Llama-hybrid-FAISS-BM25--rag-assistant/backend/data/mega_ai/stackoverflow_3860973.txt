the Text in flex with System Fonts can not be rotated, go for embedded fonts, You have to do something in CSS file as well, and that is this : /* CSS file */ @font-face { src:url("Arbeka.swf"); fontFamily: "Arbeka"; } But here you need this Arbeka.swf file which i have created in Flash, this is actually we r embedding fonts. this also helps, if the client side doesn;t have supported fonts, then your flex application won't be facing font problem. I don't know , how to to attach this file here, if you need this one, give me ur mail address, i'll send u, i checked it it's working , take care, hav a gr8 time i m still using flex3. Wade is right above. flex4 has lot more as compare to 3
