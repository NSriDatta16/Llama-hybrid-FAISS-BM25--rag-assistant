I don't really agree with you on the "are expected to know" part. There is really no authority to decide what's expected of graphic artists, other than being good graphic artists. But since Flash comes with extensive graphics functionality, it is probably most important for graphic artists working in a Flash/Flex-related production process to know how to use these. Also, they should be instructed on how to prepare bitmap or video content for embedding in Flash, and to have some idea of the object model used in Flash, so they are able to create and manage library items in a way that can be effectively used and/or extended by ActionScript programmers. Apart from that, for anyone working with more than "just" graphics, i.e. graphic artists who do active programming on UI components in Flash/Flex, it is handy to know: MXML: The Flex xml dialect used to create views. HTML: Flash allows for a limited number of HTML tags (a, b, p, font, span, br, img, i, ul, li, u, plus the generic "textformat") when using styled text. CSS: Flash can use CSS to style text. As with HTML, this is not a complete implementation, but restricted to font and character formats Also, the Flash player is often embedded in an HTML page - for this, some JavaScript and whatever other languages used on the web server will also come in handy. It is also good to have a firm knowledge of XML and JSON when working with ActionScript, but on the graphics end of the production process, these will probably not be as important.
