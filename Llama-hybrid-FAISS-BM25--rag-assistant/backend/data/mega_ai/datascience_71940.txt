HashingVectorizer and CountVectorizer (note not Tfidfvectorizer) are meant to do the same thing. Which is to convert a collection of text documents to a matrix of token occurrences. If your are looking to get term frequencies weighted by their relative importance (IDF) then Tfidfvectorizer is what you should use. If you need the raw counts or normalized counts (term frequency), then you should use CountVectorizer or HashingVectorizer. To learn about HashingVectorizer, see this article on HashingVectorizer vs. CountVectorizer . For more information about Tfidfvectorizer, see this article on How to Use Tfidftransformer and Tfidfvectorizer .
