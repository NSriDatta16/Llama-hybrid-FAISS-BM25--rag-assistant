Why does Cobertura fail to report assert branch path was covered?

In Cobertura , I can not get it to report that the conditional path of an assert statement was taken. Is this a known limitation? I have a JUnit test that expects and AssertionError to be thrown, and it passes correctly. The problem is that Cobertura reports that the assert branch was not covered. After more investigation, I see that part of the branch coverage is being detected. The line is question is: assert data != null; and Cobertura reports the coverages as: Conditional coverage 75% (3/4) [each condition 50%, 100%]. What are the different branch conditions Cobertura is expecting?
