Comparison of normality + similarity distribution of time series datas

I have a training time series data , whose last 20% is kept as validation data. I want to check whether the distribution of training and validation features are similiar and normal, so that we can say that model can be fitted on validation data and is representative of training data. How can I do this...also the size of training and validation data differ widely since validation data is only 20% of training data. Any suggestion would be helpful !
