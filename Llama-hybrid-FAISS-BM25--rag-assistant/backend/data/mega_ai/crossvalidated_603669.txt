Quantifying diversity of bird species

I’m wondering if anyone could recommend a diversity index to look at the differences in breeding bird territories between two sites. These are my data - the numbers represent the number of breeding pairs of each species: c(4L, 3L, 14L, 1L, 4L, 11L, 2L, 1L, 2L, 7L, 1L, 5L, 7L, 3L, 1L, 2L, 1L, 1L, 4L, 1L, 1L, 4L, 2L, 4L, 3L, 3L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 14L, 3L, 14L) -> site1 c(27L, 25L, 21L, 23L, 1L, 2L, 26L, 3L, 1L, 16L, 3L, 12L, 29L, 2L, 5L, 1L, 17L, 2L, 6L, 19L, 6L, 3L, 3L, 5L, 1L, 1L, 8L, 7L, 1L, 2L, 5L, 2L, 6L, 2L, 8L, 1L, 5L, 1L, 25L, 1L, 1L, 4L, 1L, 26L, 7L, 1L, 1L, 13L, 1L, 30L, 34L, 13L, 2L) -> site2 I’ve tried Simpson’s index in R: library(vegan) diversity(site1, index = "simpson") diversity(site2, index = "simpson") But the diversity index is very similar for both sites (0.94 and 0.96 respectively) and I would say site2 is considerably more diverse than site1 . Are there any functions that are more sensitive when quantifying diversity?
