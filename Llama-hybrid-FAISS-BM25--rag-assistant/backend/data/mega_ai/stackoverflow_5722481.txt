You want to look for a space-filling-curve or a spatial index (database). A sfc reduce the 2d complexity to a 1d complexity. You want to look for Nick's hilbert curve quadtree spatial index blog. BTW. I've implemented a php class to use a hilbert curve to search for postcodes. It's using a table non-recursive approach and can use all 4 hilbert-curves. You can find my class at phpclasses.org (hilbert-curve).
