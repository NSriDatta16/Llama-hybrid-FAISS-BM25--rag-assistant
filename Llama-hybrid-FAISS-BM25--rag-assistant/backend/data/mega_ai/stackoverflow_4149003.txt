how to do this using correct OOP?

I extended a JPanel for using it as a canvas for drawing. In the Handler class (the handler for the canvas) I have this code:- public void mouseDragged(MouseEvent e) { endingPoint = e.getPoint(); repaint(); } public void mousePressed(MouseEvent e) { startingPoint = e.getPoint(); } And in the canvas class itself I have something like this (MainFrame is a class extending JFrame and having Handler as an inner class):- if (MainFrame.paintingShape.equalsIgnoreCase("line")) { g.drawLine(MainFrame.startingPoint.x, MainFrame.startingPoint.y, ..., ...); } But I read somewhere that I should declare all a class`s variables private and all work on variables should be done using methods in the same class. But I couldn't do that here, how could I?
