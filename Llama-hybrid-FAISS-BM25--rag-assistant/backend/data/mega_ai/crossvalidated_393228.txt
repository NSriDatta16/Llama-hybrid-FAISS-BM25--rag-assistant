Is it possible to compare probabilities of 2 logistic different models with same data set?

I have two logistic regression models (A&B), one gives probability of "person A" buying "Product X" and other model gives probability of person A buying "product Y". The training data for both these models are same but the features are different (as characteristics of product X & Y are different). So if i get probability of 0.9 in Model 1 and 0.6 in Model 2, can i conclude person A is most likely to purchase product X than Y?
