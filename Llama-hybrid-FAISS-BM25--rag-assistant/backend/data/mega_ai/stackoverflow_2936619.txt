Azure : The process cannot access the file "" because it is being used by another process

I am trying to get a matlab-compiled exe running on Azure cloud, and for that purpose need to get a v78.zip onto the local storage of the cloud and unzip it, before I can try to run an exe on the cloud. The program works fine when executed locally, but on deployment gives an error at line marked below in the code. The error is : The process cannot access the file 'C:\Resources\directory\cc0a20f5c1314f299ade4973ff1f4cad.WebRole.LocalStorage1\v78.zip' because it is being used by another process. Exception Details: System.IO.IOException: The process cannot access the file 'C:\Resources\directory\cc0a20f5c1314f299ade4973ff1f4cad.WebRole.LocalStorage1\v78.zip' because it is being used by another process. The code is given below: string localPath = RoleEnvironment.GetLocalResource("LocalStorage1").RootPath; Response.Write(localPath + " \n"); Directory.SetCurrentDirectory(localPath); CloudBlob mblob = GetProgramContainer().GetBlobReference("v78.zip"); CloudBlockBlob mbblob = mblob.ToBlockBlob; CloudBlob zipblob = GetProgramContainer().GetBlobReference("7z.exe"); string zipPath = Path.Combine(localPath, "7z.exe"); string matlabPath = Path.Combine(localPath, "v78.zip"); IEnumerable blocklist = mbblob.DownloadBlockList(); BlobStream stream = mbblob.OpenRead(); >> FileStream fs = File.Create(matlabPath); (Exception occurs here) It'll be great help if someone could tell me where I'm going wrong.
