Sentiment Analysis with a Continuos Output Labels

Problem Setting/Context: I have feedback(each feedback has multiple sentences) associated with different products(you can safely assume that a feedback talks about one single product), I need to assign a continuous score for each feedback, for simplicity lets assume that this score can lie between 0 and 1(on a continuous scale) where 0 is negative, 0.5 is neutral and 1 indicates positive. Note that none of the feedback has any labels associated with it, so I will have to build a model for any sort of predictions. This makes it challenging since assigning continuous scores to a feedback is difficult even if I were to label some data for fine tuning/ training a model to output continuous scores Need: The reason for moving towards a continuous score is to make the scoring more granular instead of just saying positive, negative or neutral additionally this also opens up options towards adding your own threshold to categorize the feedback if needed at a later point or use these scores to identify how sentiments are trending over time Some Ideas I have explored: One possible way is to train a model to categorize each sentence in the feedback discretely as positive(2),negative(0) or neutral(1) and then average it out to get a continuous value for a feedback. Sample Feedback: This Product is amazing. This product is not so good in some areas. Then the score for the feedback would be (2+0)/2 = 1 Another possible approach which extends from the above approach could be using Prediction Probability and then taking the mean. Sample Feedback: This Product is amazing but under performs in some areas . The durability of the product is okay. The scoring would be as follows: Question : Are there any ways to directly get continuous scoring out of models on Hugging Face or any other machine learning libraries. I already know that VADER does provide continuous score but it is dictionary based which comes with its own set of problems. Please provide you inputs on the approaches above, specifically from a conceptual standpoint(machine learning concepts) do these make sense or is this incorrect? Feel free to list out any drawbacks/problems you see FYI:I understand that for most systems a 5 point rating system works fine and moving to a continuous scale might also raise a few questions about the interpretations of these scores but this is where we are at. Please feel free to add any suggestions you might have on this.
