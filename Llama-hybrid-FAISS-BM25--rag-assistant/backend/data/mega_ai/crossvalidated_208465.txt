That depends on the purpose of your presentaton. The purpose determines the "best" way to present the data, and how you should define "typical". Generally, for numerical variables, median is better than average. For categorical variables like gender, unless vast majority (say, >75%) is in one category, you might want to say something like "60% of our customers are males, 40% are females", or "70% are white, 20% are black, 10% are other races". But you can say "our typical customer is American" if 90% are Americans.
