Louie, I encourage you to take a look at Localytics, our app analytics service. Our service is real-time, we don't sell data to third parties and we release the source code to our libraries. We also have an updated library that works better with the multitasking or fast-user switching in iOS 4: http://www.localytics.com/blog/
