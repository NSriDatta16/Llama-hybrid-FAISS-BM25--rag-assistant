Can we make bagging equivalent to random forest if we take max features in our own defined decision tree and pass it as estimator?

If in bagging we defined our own tuned decision tree as estimator with max features as parameter in that estimator rather than taking by default decision tree estimator available in BaggingClassifer in sckit learn? Will this bagging be equivalent to Random forest then? dct= DecisionTreeClassifier(max_features=4,random_state=2021) model_bg=BaggingRegressor(base_estimator=dct,random_state=2021,oob_score=True,max_features = X_train.shape[1],n_estimators=15,max_samples=X_train.shape[0])
