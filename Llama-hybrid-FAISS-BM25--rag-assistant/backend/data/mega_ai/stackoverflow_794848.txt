Also note that you could use named parameters as of Cake 1.2. Named parameters are in key:value order, so the url http://somesite.com/controller/action/key1:value1/key2:value2 would give a a $this->params['named'] array( 'key1' => 'value1', 'key2' => 'value2' ) from within any controller. If you use a CNN.com style GET request ( http://www.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/books/04/27/ayn.rand.atlas.shrugged/index.html ), the parameters are in order of appearance (2009, SHOWBIZ, books, etc.) in the $this->params['pass'] array, indexed starting at 0. I strongly recommend named paramters, as you can later add features by passing get params, without having to worry about the order. I believe you can also change the named parameter separation key (by default, it's ':'). So it's a slightly different paradigm than the "traditional" GET parameters (page.php?key1=value1&key2=value2). However, you could easily add some logic in the application to automatically parse traditional parameters into an array by tying into how the application parses requests.
