The following will work in case your subroutines don't contain any blank lines, like the one in your example: #!/usr/bin/perl -w use strict; $^I = ".bkp"; # to create a backup file { local $/ = ""; # one paragraph constitutes one record while (<>) { unless (/^sub routine_one \{.+\}\s+$/s) { # 's' => '.' will also match "\n" print; } } }
