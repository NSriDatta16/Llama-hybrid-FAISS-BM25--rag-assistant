Swapping values around in the view with information taken from a DAO

To respect requirements, I've temporarily used a hack to swap around a numerical id with a String representing a corresponding username in the view. To do this I've called a DAO directly from a TableModel. Obviously, this isn't very elegant and is probably inappropriate from a design point of view. What would be the proper approach to achieve this?
