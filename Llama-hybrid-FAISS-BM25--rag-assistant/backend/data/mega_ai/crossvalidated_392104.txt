I tried to use denoising autoencoder with triplet loss to generate document's embeddings and apply cosine similarity on it. I tested both approach (tfidf and embeddings) on a news articles dataset. And embeddings approach gives better result in finding new articles of same category (i.e. Internalional, Sports, etc). While tfidf gives better result in finding new articles of same event (i.e. USA president selection, etc) So you may take different approach depends on what you need.
