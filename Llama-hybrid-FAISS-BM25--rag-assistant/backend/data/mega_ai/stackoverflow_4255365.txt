In froyo, you have some secure storage management (called secure containers) but i don't know exactly how it work and if it's directly accessible. An other solution is to encrypt all your file from your application. I don't think there is an easy way to set "unix like" permissions, since all app run with the same permission and a rooted user can access anywhere.
