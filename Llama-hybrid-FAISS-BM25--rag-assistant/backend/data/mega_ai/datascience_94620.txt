PyTorch has a state_dict which stores the state of the model (in this case, the neural network) at any point in time. Saving it would involve dumping those states into a file which is easily done with: torch.save(model.state_dict(), PATH) When reloading the model, remember to first create the model class with its default weights and load the state dict from the file. Here's a link to saving/loading pytorch modules ( https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/saving_loading_models.html ).
