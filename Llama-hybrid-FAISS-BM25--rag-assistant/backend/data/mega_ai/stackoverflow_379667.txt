Short Answer: You need to provide absolute URLs for the source of the images in your page. Longer Answer: Microsoft Word will open an HTML document if you rename it with a *.doc extension. This is what the code that you provided is doing. In this case, the images are not embedded in the document like they would be if you created a document in actual Word format. If your images are using relative URLs then Word will not know where to look for them, hence the need for absolute URLs. NOTE: This means that anyone viewing the document without an internet connection will not see the images, as they are requested from the server every time the document is opened. A more elegant solution would be to create the document in the real Word format. A great library for this is Aspose.Words . Using this library you would be able to embed the images directly into the document so that they do not rely on the server.
