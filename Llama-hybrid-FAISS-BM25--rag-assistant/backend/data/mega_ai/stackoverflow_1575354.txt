The problem with what you ask is that you don't know what you're looking for. If you had some sort of weighted list of terms that you cared about, then you'd be in good shape. Semantically, the problem is twofold: Generally the most-used words are the least relevant. Even if you use a stop-words file, a lot of chaff remains Generally, the least-used words are the most relevant. For example, "bluewater inn" is probably infrequent. Let's suppose that you had something that did what you ask, and produced a clean list of all the keywords that appear in your texts. There would be thousands of such keywords. Finding "bluewater inn" in a list of 1000s of terms is actually harder than finding it in the paragraph (assuming you don't know what you're looking for) because you can skim the texts and you'll find the paragraph that contains "bluewater inn" because of its context, but you can't find it in a list because the list has no context. Why don't you talk more about your application and process and then perhaps we can help you better??
