What is an ATB file?

I'm trying to understand a legacy VB6 application. It seems that some of the GUI toolbars are defined by a binary file with the suffix "atb". I think (but I'm not 100% sure) that this file has been generated by an application called "Infragistics UltraToolBars 4". (I also think that "atb" is an abbreviation for "Active ToolBars".) I want to track down the "source code" for the .atb file. So do you know more details about how you create an .atb file and how it is used?
