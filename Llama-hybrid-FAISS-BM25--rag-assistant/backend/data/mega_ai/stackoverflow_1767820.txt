To the best of my knowledge, SQL Server 2008 Express does not come with the SQL Agent service; although the service is installed, it doesn’t work as intended and you can’t interact with it like a regular SQL Server (nor create maintenance tasks, jobs, etc.). In any case, open the SQL Server Configuration Manager (if you have the tools installed), and go to SQL Server Network Configuration -> Protocols for and right click TCP/IP and select Properties. On that dialog, make sure that the protocol is enabled and then check the IP Addresses tab. That’s where/how you restrict SQL Server to listen to certain IP/Subnets/Protocols/Ports/etc. TCP/IP Properties http://img94.imageshack.us/img94/7633/screenshot20091120at242.png
