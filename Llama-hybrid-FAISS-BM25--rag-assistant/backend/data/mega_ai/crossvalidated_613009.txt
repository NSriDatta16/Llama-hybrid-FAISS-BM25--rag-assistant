Why does GMDH work better than a random forest?

I did a little experiment and saw that the gmdh algorithm works very well for these toy data, much better than random forest . X I'm interested in: Why does gmdh work better? Is it possible to make random forest work better? For which data is it better to use the first algorithm and for which the second?
