Simple example of gang scheduling of processes in Python?

I have a pool of processes that need to be executed. I would like to fully utilize the machine, so that all CPUs are executing processes. I do not want to over-subscribe the system, so what i really want is #executing_processes=#cpus at any given moment. I also need to store the stdout,stderr and return code of each completed processes. How can this be achieved in Python? EDIT: by 'process' i mean a shell process.
