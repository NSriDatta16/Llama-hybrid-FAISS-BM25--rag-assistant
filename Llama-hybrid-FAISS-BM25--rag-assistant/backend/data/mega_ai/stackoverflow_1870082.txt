Really complex LINQ (to SQL) query example

We're thinking about adding more LINQ tests for ORMBattle.NET, but have no more ideas. All LINQ tests there are checking common LINQ functionality: Any test must pass on LINQ to IEnumerable For any test, there must be at least one ORM, on it passes (actually it doesn't matter if it is listed @ ORMBattle or not). Currently the goal of LINQ test sequence is to automatically compute LINQ implementation coverage score. Prerequisites: Code of tests for LINQ to SQL is here . This must give some imagination of what's already covered. Tests for other tools (actually they're generated by this T4 template ) are here . If you have any ideas on what can be added there, please share them. I'll definitely accept any example of LINQ query that satisfies above requirements, and possibly - some good idea related to improvement of test suite, that can be implemented (so e.g. if you'd suggest us to manually study the quality of translation, this won't work, because we can't automate this).
