Updating different parts of an MVC page at once?

i want to update different areas of my MVC page after one action (say a click) occurs. how, i use ajax, and wrapping the entire area where all these parts need to be updated is counter intuitive as the ajax data being sent back would be close to the entire page. so, i have a few partial views, - but the problem is, each action only returns one view! how can i return multiple views from this one action? i know a popular solution is to just hammer the server with multiple async javascript ajax requests for each "part" of the view, but this really is unnecessary and inefficient, reconstructing and destroying the page (say) 5 times for just one action, when it should just occur once, and once it does, the server should manage all the partial views then and there. anyone any ideas? im desperate. although a beginner to the mvc framework, im sure an elegant solution must exist, as i ahve faith in the MVC guys, surely we aren't expected to DDoS the server for something like this?
