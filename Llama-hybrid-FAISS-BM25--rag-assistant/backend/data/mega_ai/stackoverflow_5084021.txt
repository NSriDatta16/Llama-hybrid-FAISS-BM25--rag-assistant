I'm not so sure I buy the whole security angle, but I do think it is wise to limit/eliminate direct chatter between the presentation tier (web app) and the data tier (database) to clearly delineate the separation of concerns. For one thing, it encourages code re-use and encapsulating business logic rather than spreading it out throughout the application. For example, if you ever had multiple front ends (desktop, web, mobile) the duplication of logic would be minimized. Secondly, it helps to future proof your application somewhat. For example, if you went from PHP to ASP.NET or a Mobile OS front end it would minimize the work involved to the relevant parts to display the data. All in all, it is probably a good idea anyway. If there are some benefits in terms of the security architecture. Bonus.
