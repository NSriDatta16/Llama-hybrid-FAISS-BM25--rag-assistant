How can I share memory between processes in MATLAB?

Is there any way to share memory between MATLAB processes on the same computer? I am running several MATLAB processes on a multi-core computer (running Windows, if it matters). They all use the same gigantic input data. It would be nice to only have a single copy of it in memory. Edit: Unfortunately each process needs access to the whole gigantic input data, so there is no way to divide the data and conquer the problem.
