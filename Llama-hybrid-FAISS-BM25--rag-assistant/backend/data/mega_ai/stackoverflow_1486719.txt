I think that you have at least 3 problems here. First, you are referencing full_name as if it were a variable. I believe this is causing a javascript error which aborts the function and allows the default action (post) to proceed. Second, you probably need to encode ALL of the form parameters, including act . This is may be causing an invalid URL to be sent and thus the action appears not to have been invoked -- you can check this by looking at the request that is sent with Firefox/Firebug. Third, you are attempting to replace the contents of a list with a paragraph element. This is invalid HTML. I'd replace the entire list with the paragraph (and I don't get what appending an empty string does at the end so I've omitted it). Note I've changed this to work on the submit event of the form -- so it won't matter how it's submitted. Also allows me a little jQuery niceness in not having to look up the form again. $('#commentform').submit(function() { var $this = $(this); $.ajax({ url: "query.php", data: { 'act': 'contact', 'full_name', $('input[name="full_name"]').val() }, success: function() { $('#contact-form').remove(); $this.hide().html(" thanks! ").fadeIn(1500); } }); return false; }
