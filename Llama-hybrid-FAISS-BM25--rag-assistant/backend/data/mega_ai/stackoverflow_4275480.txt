Ok, well I don't know about BlitzMax, so I can't go into much detail regarding implementation, but to give you some pointers: For applying shaders to specific parts of the image only, you will probably want to use multiple rendering passes to compose your scene. If you have pixel access, doing the same things that fragment shaders do is, of course, possible "the oldskool way" in 2D, ie. something like getpixel/setpixel. However, you'll have much poorer performance this way. If you have a texture with an alpha channel intact, saving in PNG with an alpha channel should Just Work (sorry, once again no idea how to do this in BlitzMax specifically). Just make sure you're using RGBA modes all along.
