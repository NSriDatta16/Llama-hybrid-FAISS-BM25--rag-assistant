Editor core buffer type and syntax highlighting

I've been thinking a lot about making an editor core functionality wise compatible to vim, similar to yzis. The biggest questions are what buffer type to use. Requirement are: possibility to implement fast syntax highlighting, regex on top of it. possibility to implement multiple syntax highlightings in a single file. similar to textmates scopes proper moving marks on delete inserts. so that they properly adjust in column. unlike in vim. handle and highlight at least 100 mb files without too big issues and memory overhead. Possible buffer types: gap buffers line based editing I read that gap buffers can cause rather big memory fragmentation at longer runs. Also the emacs syntax highlighting engine is very slow.(dunno why, maybe not really related to the buffer type) So the questions: what buffer type would be best for a fast programming editor? what's a fast/complete regex engine? (maybe this includes the next point). TextMate uses oniguruma, is that a wise choice? what's fast syntax highlighting engine? About the mark and syntax highlighting. How do emacs overlays work, would they help? Thanks, Reza
