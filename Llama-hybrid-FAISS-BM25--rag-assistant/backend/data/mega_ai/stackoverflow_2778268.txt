I believe you're asking how to style UITextView, not how to setup a UITableView, so what I would do is create a .PNG image that's mostly white with two little rounded corners up top. Flip the image vertically and you have the one for the bottom. Drag both to your resources folder in XCode, then open up Interface Builder with the .xib. Set the background color to your blue. Click on the text field, go to Inspector and select the image you just created in the Background field. Do it again for the other field. You can use the Placeholder field to create the gray "Email" and "Password" placeholder text.
