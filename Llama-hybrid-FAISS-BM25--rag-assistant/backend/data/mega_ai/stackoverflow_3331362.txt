Instead of using display you could store the element 'off-screen' until you needed it, and then set its position to where you want it and transform it at the same time. This brings up a whole host of other design issues though, so your mileage may vary. You probably wouldn't want to use display anyway, as you'd want the content to be accessible to screen readers, which for the most part try to obey rules for visibility - i.e., if it shouldn't be visible to the eye, it won't show up as content to the agent.
