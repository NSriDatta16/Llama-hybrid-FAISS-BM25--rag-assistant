Why use Core data for storage?

What is the meaning of it? What is Core Data? What is so special about it? When I went to create a navigation based application it has a check box for Core Data. If I use this option then what will it work well for my project? Also, when i choose View Controller Based Application while creating a new project the Core Data check box is not available. Why is this?
