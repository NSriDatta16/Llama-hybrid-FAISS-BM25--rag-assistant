The problem with misspellings is usually less that they exist than that they make it unclear how specific entries should be classified. It depends somewhat on how bad the misspellings are-- someone typing StackExchaneg probably meant StackExchange , and I would be comfortable classifying the former as an alias for the latter. If the spelling mistakes are mostly like that, then you could hand-craft a list of aliases by reviewing similar spellings (a fuzzy matching algorithm, as suggested by @Peter, would be a good way to identify potential misspellings without too much upfront work). Even starting with fuzzy matching this could be tedious, but there is often little valid way to avoid tedium in data science (especially with what is currently an unsupervised classification problem). If there are more extreme misspellings, or there is potential confusion about which "true" category a misspelled entry should belong to, the most sound approach is probably to have multiple people review those edge cases for classification. Then compute inter-rater reliability (Cohen's Kappa) on specific cases to indicate how certain (and uncertain) you are about when a misspelled entry belongs to a particular category.
