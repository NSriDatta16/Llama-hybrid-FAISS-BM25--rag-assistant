MSE relevance as a metric when errors < 1

I'm trying to build my first models for regression after taking MOOCs on deep learning. I'm currently working on a dataset whose labels are between 0 and 2. Again, this is a regression task, not classification. The low y values imply that the loss for each sample is quite low, always 1. I found this nice article about regression metrics, but didn't find the answer in it. Thanks for your help.
