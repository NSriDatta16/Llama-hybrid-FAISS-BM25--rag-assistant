Can VAR models handle time series with different lengths?

I'm trying to better understand how Vector Auto-Regression models work in practice. It seems to me that a real world time series data set is likely to have time series of different lengths, but I can't figure out how a VAR model would handle this situation. If we shorten the time series in order to bring them all to the same length, we loose a lot of valuable information. Zero padding the shorter time series to be the same length as the longest time series would mess with the quality of the coefficients that model the time series. Imputation might work for single missing values here and there, but I don't see how it could work when an entire leading chunk is missing from the time series. Is there a way to use VAR on groups of time series with different lengths?
