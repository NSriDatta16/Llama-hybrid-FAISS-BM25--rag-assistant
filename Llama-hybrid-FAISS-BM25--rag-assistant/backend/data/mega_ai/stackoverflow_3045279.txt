I have found the most fool-proof method of making something printable is by providing a print button that links to a PDF version of the document. Generating the PDF is the major task there but that can be quite simple with the right tool. I use http://www.xhtml2pdf.com/ which is a Python app to take a page and generate a PDF version. It might need some tweaking so you might need a special stylesheet to fix some things. Other than that, you're left fixing IE. It might help to add a print stylesheet: And overriding some of your more extravagant positioning methods. If you're centring, pull it back to the left, cut out extraneous margins and padding (remember background-images won't render with standard print settings so you can cut out a lot of padding). You might find there's some crossover (ie you use some of the print styles in your PDF version) so you might be able to generate a hybrid solution to allow people to grab PDF versions and print straight from HTML.
