Regression models in general model the conditional expectations. It's not an expectation , but a specific form of expectation $$ E[y|X] = f(X) $$ where $f$ is the regression function that can be different things: linear function as in linear regression, or many other functional forms, including non-linear as in non-linear regression, regression forests, or neural networks, etc. It's unclear what kind of special relationship with the law of total variance you are looking to find. The law applies to any conditional variances, so there is nothing special for linear regression here. Additionally, variance is defined in terms of squared deviations, while mean and linear regression both minimize squared error (as many other models) so there are similarities due to using squared deviations.
