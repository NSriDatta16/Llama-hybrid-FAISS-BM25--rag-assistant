I think there are at least four main sources of instruments: Theory combined with clever data collection (Example: distance from job training center varies the cost of participation in training, and we're interested in the effect of training on wages) Exogenous variation in policies or program implementation, over time or across space (Example: Vietnam draft lottery, interested in the effect of military service on wages) Nature (stormy weather varies the supply of fish, which allows us to learn how price sensitive demand for fish sticks really is) Roll Your Own (Example: an experiment, or randomized encouragement to take up treatment if experiment is infeasible/unethical)
