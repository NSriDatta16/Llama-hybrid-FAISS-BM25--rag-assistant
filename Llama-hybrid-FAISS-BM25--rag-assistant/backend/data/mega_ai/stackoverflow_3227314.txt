how to stop "cannot stop" builds on TeamCity

I get "cannot stop" status once in a while after trying to stop builds on TeamCity. I would expect that killing my build process on build agent would do the trick, but it doesn't work. Stopping TeamCity agent process on the build machine doesn't help either. Restarting build agent (i.e. computer) does the trick, but it takes plus 2-3min after the machine has started. It looks like TeamCity server itself thinks that my build is still running. Is there a better way to stop those builds? Or maybe there is some info somewhere that could explain this logic?
