I think SSIS is easier to read and maintain than "pure" SQL, and it supports scripting (only in VB, but at least that's a start), so you can take leverage the CLR. Also, it's much nicer than DTS, which was the old way of maintaining those types of tasks in MS-Land. The tradeoff is that you have to learn all the stupid Microsoft jargon, instead of just writing SQL... Which is more fun. If you maintain a lot of servers, and you've made the investment in MS SQL server, why not take advantage of it?
