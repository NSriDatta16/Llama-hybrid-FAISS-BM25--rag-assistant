Prevent asp:ImageButton Default inline Style

Unfortunately the asp:ImageButton control renders an inline style attribute of "border-width:0px;" This is frustrating for a variety of reasons. In the past I have worked around the problem by creating my own custom image button control which doesn't render the inline style attribute. I am looking for a more elegant solution to the problem. Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.
