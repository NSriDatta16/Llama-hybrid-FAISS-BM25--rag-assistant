In time series econometrics, an important task is to determine the most appropriate form of the trend in the data, not merely whether a trend exists. There are two common trend removal procedures: taking say the first difference and performing the time-trend regression (or a non-parametric alternative e.g. moving averages). The former is appropriate for I(1) (read integrated of order one) time series and the latter is appropriate for trend stationary I(0) time series. Unit root tests can be used to determine the nature of the trend (stochastic or deterministic), which will suggests the appropriate way to remove it. As stated, your question is limited to non-parametric estimation of the deterministic component of a trend-stationary process. It is quite often, in e.g. business and economics, that the observed trend is stochastic in nature. Unit root tests (and corresponding stationarity tests) are tools for determining the presence of a stochastic trend in an observed series. Tests like Phillips-Perron test can accommodate models with a fitted drift and a time trend so they may be used to discriminate between the unit root non-stationarity (stochastic trend) and stationary about a deterministic trend (of a non-stationary process). There are many good sources for further reading, but probably take a look at this theory and this practice first.
