How to label target dataset based on reduced dimensions of a source dataset?

I have a high-dimensional data matrix with K observations and N variables. To predict the label for each observation, I use some dimensionality reduction method (let's say PCA). Now I have K observations and M reduced dims. Observations are then clustered and labeled based on PCs (10 first PCs or so). I also have a target data matrix with P observations and N variables (same variables as in the source dataset). Is it possible to predict the label of each observation in the target dataset based on PCs from the source dataset?
