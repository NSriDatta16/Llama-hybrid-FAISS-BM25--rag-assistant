How to Prevent Anemone from Storing Certain Information?

I'm using Anemone for some web spidering. I'm storing the results of the spidering in MongoDB. Anemone makes it very easy to do this with: Anemone.crawl("http://www.example.com/") do |anemone| anemone.storage = Anemone::Storage.MongoDB end as specified here . However, using the code above, Anemone collects and stores a lot of information that I don't need, including each page's response. I only need to store URLs. And, despite spending time with the documentation , I can't figure out how to tell Anemone not to store certain pieces of info. Can anyone advise?
