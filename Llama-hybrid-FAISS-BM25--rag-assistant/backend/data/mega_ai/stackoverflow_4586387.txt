Using Dragon (MacSpeech) Dictate with XCode?

I am sure there are a lot of people who code and who, for one reason or another, are temporarily or permanently unable to use a keyboard to do so. I am trying to find out if it is worthwhile to get Dragon Dictate (or any other speech recognition software) to be able to keep on coding while my arm is in a cast. Do any of you have any experience with this? (How well)does it work?
