Fisher's exact test vs kappa analysis

I was reading a paper where the authors assessed the association between two different diagnostics tests intended to diagnose the same disease and they performed the analysis with Fisher's exact test. While I find this statistically appropriate I began to wounder if they could have used Chohen's Kappa. After a bit of reading I can find no recommendations of when to use either analysis. Both are tabular analysis and I know while Cohen's is used to measure "agreement", I think it is mostly measuring the same thing as Fisher's? Am I correct in this? Can anyone give me any guidelines or insight for when one test is more appropriate than the other?
