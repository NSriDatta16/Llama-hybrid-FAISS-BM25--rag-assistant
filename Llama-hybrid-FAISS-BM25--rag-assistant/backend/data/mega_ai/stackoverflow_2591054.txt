Assuming you are using the built-in drag and drop functionality, you can use the return value of the DoDragDrop method. If the drop target does not accept the dragged object, then DoDragDrop returns DragDropEffects.None. This of course assumes that the other controls on your form do not allow the dropping of your list items.
