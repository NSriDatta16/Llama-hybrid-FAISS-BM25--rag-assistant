One approach would be to hand-engineer feature(s) that represents the characteristics that you care about. In this case you could try computing the moving median over maybe 5 steps, then for each time-step compute the difference to this median, and take the max of these differences across the entire series. Another approach would be to use an Anomaly Detection algorithm. This has the benefit that it can also detect new kinds of abnormalities. Autoencoders are usually the best for time-series. For this you'd need to prepare a dataset with only "normal" data, to train on.
