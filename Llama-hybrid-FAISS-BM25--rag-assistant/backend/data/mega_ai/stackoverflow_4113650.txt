You could use Ruby's URI class like this to get the fragment of the URI (i.e. the relative path of the file) and split it at the last occurrence of a dot (this will also work if the URL contains a query part): require 'uri' your_url = 'http://www.example.com/asdf123.gif' fragment = URI.split(your_url)[5] extension = fragment.match(/\.([\w+-]+)$/)
