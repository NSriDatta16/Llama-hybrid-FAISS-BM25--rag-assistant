Can iPhone Application Archives be exported and imported on another Computer?

I have an iPhone application that is not yet released but I wanted to make sure that when I create an Archive that I can symbolicate crash reports. For now that works on the Computer that created the archive / IPA. But in order to be sure that I can symbolicate crash reports on another box or by another user I wanted to figure out how an Archive can be exported and be imported on another computer. As of now I can find the ".xcarchive" directory but when I put this on another computer and double click it then it says The archive could not be installed and "The archive may be corrupt or unreadable". If I put the file manually at the right place it will be listed in XCode's Organizer but my crash reports are not symbolicated. Any ideas what I do wrong or is there a way to do something with the .dSYM file.
