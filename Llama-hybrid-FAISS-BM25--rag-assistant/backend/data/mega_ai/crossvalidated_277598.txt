Comparing moderate & small groups with binomial data

I have two groups: A (sample size = 20) and B (sample size = 6). Each of the 26 subjects takes a test with 25 items on it. The response for each item is binary (pass/fail). Thus, the data for each subject follows a binomial distribution(p, 25). I want to see if there is a difference in the two groups in terms of the proportion of items passed. The only method I can think of is to fit a logistic regression: group ~ p . However, the sample size in group B is too small in my opinion. Another way would be compare the mean proportion in group A to the mean proportion in group B. However, the empirical distribution of p is heavily skewed right in both groups and there are many ties, so t-tests and Wilcoxon rank sum tests are off the table.
