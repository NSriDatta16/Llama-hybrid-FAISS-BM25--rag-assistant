Your use of TEdit is troublesome, for a couple of reasons: It looks like you're using the TEdit as a place for data transfer from the thread (the reliance on the OnChange event handler makes me think some more processing is required, the TEdit isn't used as a simple "output area"). GUI elements should never be used for data storage, for countless reasons ranging from performance to OOP encapsulation and relying on algorithms outside your control. Relying on the OnChange event handler to fire when you programatically change the text is relying on implementation details of TEdit . What if Microsoft decides not to fire the OnChange event if the change was made programatically? Or Embarcadero decides to conditionally not surface it since the programmer doesn't need to be notified he just changed that value? Other then that, your use of Syncronize() will probably work, ie "you can use it", but I'd say it's not a good idea. I'd like to suggest a better solution but can't do that, because I don't know exactly what you're trying to do. If all you want to do is force OnChange to be fired, then keep your code.
