Summary: Yes, a balanced block design have to be connected . You say you get different answers from different sources. If we are to discuss this, you must give references to those different sources with conflicting answers! Your reference is Theory of Block Designs by Aloke Dey. I do not have access to that, but to the newer INCOMPLETE BLOCK DESIGNS here by the same author, which seem to have been written as a modernized replacement. The reason for the answer is almost by definition: For a design to be balanced, first, all contrasts must be estimable , and that is basically the definition of connected . Below a short summary, with some definitions. Notation is the same as used in the question. Definition 2.2.2 A block design is said to be connected if all treatment contrasts are estimable. This is in fact equivalent to the graph theory definition used in Examples of connected designs in DOE . This is discussed (among other things) in the very interesting paper at arXiv . Definition of *estimable contrast (not given in that book, assumed) A contrast $l^T\theta$ with $l\not= 0$ is estimable if an unbiased estimator of it exists. Lemma 2.2.4 A linear parametric function $p^T \tau$ (with $p\not= 0$ ) is estimable for a block design $d$ iff $p\in \mathcal{C}(C)$ , that is, $p$ is in the column space of the designs C-matrix. Theorem 2.2.1 A block design with $\nu$ treatments is connected iff (if and only if) $\DeclareMathOperator{\Rank}{Rank} \Rank(C)=\nu-1$ , where $C$ is its C-matrix or characteristic matrix. Definition 2.3.1 A connected block design is said to be variance-balanced if it permits the estimation of every normalized treatment contrast with the same variance. So we can see that the conclusion is built into the definition, but even without that, the result is clear, since the requirement to be estimable with the same variance obviously presupposes to be estimable . Then there is the concept of efficiency balance , where much the same can be repeated. Your example is $b=2$ blocks with $\nu=4$ treatments, block 1 with treatments 1,4 and block 2 with treatments 2,3. Write the treatment effects as $\tau_1,\tau_2,\tau_3, \tau_4$ . Then, for example, the treatment contrast $\tau_2 -\tau_1$ is not estimable, so the design is not connected. You can write out a linear model with a general mean, treatment effects and block effects, and see what happens. We can also use lemma 2.2.4 above. $\tau_2-\tau_1 = p^T\tau$ with $p=(-1,1,0,0)^T$ . The C-matrix of the design is $$ C=\frac12\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0& 0& -1 \\ 0&1&-1&0\\ 0&-1&1&0\\ -1&0&0&1 \end{pmatrix} $$ and it is clear that $p$ cannot be written as a linear combination of the columns of $C$ . But the intuitive idea of estimation of treatment contrasts in block designs, is to use really only within-block contrasts , and so average them. That is called the intra-block analysis. In the example, there is no blocks where both treatments 1 and 2 are used, so no within-block contrasts.
