How can I find all text nodes between two element nodes with JavaScript/jQuery?

Given the following HTML-Fragment: abc [ def ghi jkl ] mno I need an algorithm to fetch all nodes of type Text between #x and #y with Javascript. Or is there a JQuery function that does exactly that? The resulting Text nodes (whitespace nodes ignored) for the example above would then be: ['def', 'ghi', 'jkl']
