If your null hypothesis is that the two slopes are equal, then you expect z to be zero on average, with random sampling giving it a value away from zero. If the null is false, you expect z to be far from zero. So you need to compute the appropriate p-value from the z ratio. That can be done with lots of programs. Here is one: https://www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/statratio1/ And here is the Excel formula for a two-sided p-value: =2*(1.0-NORM.S.DIST(z,TRUE)) The p-value answers the question: If the null hypothesis were true (and all other assumptions of the analysis are true), what is the chance of getting a z ratio as far from zero (or further) than observed?
