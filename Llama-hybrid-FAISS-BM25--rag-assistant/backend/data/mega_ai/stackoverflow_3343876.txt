When did they stop lying in ads? Did I miss something? ;-) The major performance advantage is that in 64bit systems, you can allocate more than 4GB of RAM (actually on most systems that's more 2GB) without swapping. That's a huge speed advantage if you need it . So 64bit gives an advantage if you have applications that need lots of RAM (image/video/audio processing, world/universe simulations). On top of that, the 64bit CPUs also have commands that operate on 64bit data types (so you don't need to emulate those with 32bit types). That's also an advantage but it's a) not that big because you the algorithms need to use those types and most don't b) they are still slower then 32bit types (but faster than the emulation). To give you an idea, here is an old joke from a supercomputer guy: "It takes one day to load the data from disks, then the program takes five minutes to process the data and then we need another day to save the result to disk". Reading data from RAM is between 1000 and 1000000 times faster than an access to disk. So all in all, for the average user, a 64bit system has little to no advantage.
