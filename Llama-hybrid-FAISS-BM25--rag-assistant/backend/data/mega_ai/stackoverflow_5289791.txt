SSRS & web services

I have a tricky set of requirements and I am not 100% sure on the best solution. I need a web based reporting solution (this is an absolute requirement) The data for the reports is provided via web services. These web services are hosted and provided by a 3rd party organization. The web services implementation requires a call to a “login” method that returns a token object and all subsequent calls to any other method requires this token to be passed in as a parameter. The reports will almost certainly require a call to more than one web service method (aside from the login method). Changes to the web services methods or the underlying SQL database is not possible. After spending some time looking at how this would work (a SSRS report pulling data from a web service), it does not seem like this is a good fit, overcomplicated at best and possibly even unworkable at worst. My initial investigation has led me to believe that a SSRS Custom Data Extension would be required for this to work. Can anyone with relevant experience offer me some advice\guidance? Basically I need to know if a SSRS solution is possible and\or is there a better way to achieve this, possibly using other technologies.
