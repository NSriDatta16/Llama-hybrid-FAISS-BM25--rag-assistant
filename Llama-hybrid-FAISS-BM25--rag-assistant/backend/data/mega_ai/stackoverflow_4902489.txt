"websites" vs. "Web sites" in Windows Internet Settings

I noticed that once you customize the settings of a zone in Internet Explorer, the " Description " registry value in HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\Zones\2 changes from: "This zone contains all Web sites that are on your organization's intranet." to "This zone contains all websites that are on your organization's intranet." Is this a bug or a feature? If the latter, what's the purpose of that seemingly almost unnoticeable difference? To further clarify the question, could this difference be used as a test to tell whether the zone has been changed from default to customized?
