Proper stack and heap usage in C++?

I've been programming for a while but It's been mostly Java and C#. I've never actually had to manage memory on my own. I recently began programming in C++ and I'm a little confused as to when I should store things on the stack and when to store them on the heap. My understanding is that variables which are accessed very frequently should be stored on the stack and objects, rarely used variables, and large data structures should all be stored on the heap. Is this correct or am I incorrect?
