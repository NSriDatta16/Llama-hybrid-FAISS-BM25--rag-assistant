You are requesting all columns (*) over a non-covering index (created). On a large data set you are guaranteed to hit the Index Tipping Point where the clustered index scan is more efficient than an nonclustered index range seek and bookmark lookup. Do you need * always? If yes, and if the typical access pattern is like this, then you must organize the table accordingly and make Created the leftmost clustered key. If not, then consider changing your query to a coverable query, eg. select only HistoryRequestID and Created, which are covered by the non clustered index. If more fields are needed, add them as included columns to the non-clustered index, but take into account that this will add extra strorage space and IO log write time.
