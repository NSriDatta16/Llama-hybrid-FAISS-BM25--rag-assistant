Which MA(q) to use for hourly data in Time Series decomposition?

I am trying to do a Time Series decomposition manually (I don't wanna use one of those R packages that give you all already done). I have already removed the mean from my TS by dividing the TS by its mean, so now it's centered around 1. I'd like to divide it by the Moving Average to remove the seasonality. The fact is that I guess it has to be 24 lags, as it is 24 hours data. However, when I try to get a more precise estimation of the seasonality by using the following: library(TSA) p I obtain that seasonality is around 21 hours. So what should I use? Stick with 24h seasonality or use the obtained seasonality?
