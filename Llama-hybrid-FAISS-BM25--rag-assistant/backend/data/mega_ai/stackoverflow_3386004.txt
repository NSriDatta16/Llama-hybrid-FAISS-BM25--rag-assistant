gcov does not generate coverage files

I am cross compiliing my executable for coverage using -fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage flags on a 32 bit machine . And the resulting executable I am running it on target machine which is 64-bit. When I run the executable it does not generate .bb .bbg and .da files. What can be the reason for it.
