jQuery prevAll displaying text in backward ordering

I'm trying to use jQuery to get all the paragraphs before the first h2 tag in my content. Here's the code I'm using: $(".content").find("h2:first").prevAll().text() Which is grabbing the content, although it's displaying it in backwards order. Example content: paragraph 1 paragraph 2 paragraph 3 First h2 tag paragraph 4 paragraph 5 paragraph 6 Second h2 tag The above code is outputting: paragraph 3 paragraph 2 paragraph 1 Is there any way of reversing this, so it's in the correct order? I have tried using nextAll using different codes, but it seems to grab all of my content, or not work at all lol
