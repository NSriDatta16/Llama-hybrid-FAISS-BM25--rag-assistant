If you pin the VSLauncher.exe to the taskbar (drag it in) you will get recent projects and solutions on the right click menu. You can find this exe in your program files / common files directory. Mine is in C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\MSENV\VSLauncher.exe You can also do this by dragging a solution into the task bar (which does the same as the above). If you do this rightclicking it will show recent projects and solutions. Hope this helps.
