Your question is too vague for a definitive answer, so this is really a long comment. Your first paragraph is a very general Q. When should we be surprised? Well, we are surprised when what we see occurring is far from expected! For events, we generally expect to observe events of moderate to large probability, so surprise is anti-monotone with probability. For continuous outcomes, mutatis mutandi with probabiliy density in place of probability. For an discussion see Statistical interpretation of Maximum Entropy Distribution For statistical models, this translates to log-likelihood (some machine learners seems to have renamed log-likelihood to surprise, quite surprising!). See Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) in layman terms But probably, just start search this site for outliers or anomaly-detection and edit your post to give more details and context!
