How do i find the total number of records created on a given day using T-SQL?

I need to find out the total number of records that were created on a given day. e.g. ID CreatedDate 1 17/07/2009 2 12/07/2009 3 17/07/2009 4 05/07/2009 5 12/07/2009 6 17/07/2009 Output: 3 Records were created on 17/07/2009 2 Records were created on 12/07/2009 1 Record was created on 05/07/2009 EDIT Upon testing the second suggestion made by Chris Roberts of including the formatting in the SQL i get this error: Syntax error converting the varchar value ' Records were created on ' to a column of data type int. Does anyone know how to rework the solution so that it works?
