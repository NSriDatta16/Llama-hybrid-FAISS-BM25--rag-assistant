You attempt to check whether data is (nearly) constant, and for me, it appears unclear and ambiguous. I came up with an idea that you could try to inverse your task and try to detect phenomena that cause that data to be not constant . I think that you could establish such issues and it would tell you not only that your series is not constant, but also what is happening. The list of issues that came to my mind causing that the series is not constant (and how to detect it): outliers (e.g. isolation forest) changepoints (e.g. Bayesian ChangePoint Detection ) trends (e.g. statistical testing of a local regression coefficient) turning points (e.g. Bry-Boschan routine or I can recommend the algorithm I worked on) It seems to me that such a way of thinking will be more robust in your problem.
