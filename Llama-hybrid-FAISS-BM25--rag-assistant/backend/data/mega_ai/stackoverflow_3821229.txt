oEmbed with Mobile devices

I've just found out about oEmbed and was wondering if there is a way to get a mobile link/embed code by sending the user-agent (or preferred format, like 3gp)? I've might have missed something, but I can't find those options on the oEmbed website. For example (Youtube), I would like to get the 3gp rtsp link for devices that supports that and flash embed for devices that supports that. I know those links exists on youtube, because when I go to www.youtube.com with my mobile phone i get links to rtsp. Thanks.
