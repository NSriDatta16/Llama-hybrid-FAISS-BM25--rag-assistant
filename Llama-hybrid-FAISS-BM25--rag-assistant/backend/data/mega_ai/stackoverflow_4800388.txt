Cannot Place User Control on Form

I've created a C# WinForms application using VS2010. I'm new to creating user controls so I created a new user control (as part of the same project). When I rebuild the project, the new control appears in the toolbox. And when I drag the control from the toolbox onto a form, I get the following error. Failed to load toolbox item 'TagGroup'. It will be removed from the toolbox. This happened the only other time I created a user control as well. I've searched the web but most answers I found seemed related to having the control in a separate assembly. (Note that I found plenty of questions with the same problem I'm having.) Can anyone suggest where I should look next?
