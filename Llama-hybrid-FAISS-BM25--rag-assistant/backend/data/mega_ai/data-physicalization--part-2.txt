aced nails and vertical slats at the bottom of the board. After a large number of marbles are released, they will settle down at the bottom, forming the contour of a Bell Curve. Most marbles will agglomerate at the center (smaller deviation) with few on the edge of the board. In 1935, three different electricity companies (e.g. Pacific Gas and Electric Company, Commonwealth Edison Company) created an electricity data physicalization model to visualize the power consumption of their customers so that the company can better forecast the upcoming power demand. The model has one short axis and one long axis. The short axis indicates "day", whereas the long axis spans the whole year. The viewers can gain perspective on when customers consume electricity the most during the day and how does the consumption change across different seasons. The model was built manually by cutting wooden sheets and stacked all pieces together. Researchers began to realize that data physicalization models can not only help agents manage/plan certain tasks, but also can greatly simplify very complex problems by letting users manipulate data in the real world. Therefore, from an epistemic perspective, physical manipulation enables users to uncover hidden patterns that cannot be easily detected. Max Perutz received Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1962 for his distinguished work in discovering the structure of the globular protein. When a narrow X-ray passes through the haemoglobin molecule, the diffraction pattern can review the inner structure of the atomic arrangements. One of Perutz's works within this research involved creating a physicalized haemoglobin molecule which enables him to manipulate and inspect the structure in a tangible way. In the book, Bertin designed a matrices visualization device called Domino which let users manipulate row and column data. The combination of row and column can be considered as a two-dimensional data space. In Semiology of Graphics, Bertain defined what variables can be reordered and what variables cannot. For example, time can be considered as a one direction variable. We should keep it in a natural order. Compared with the aforementioned work, this model emphasized the visual thinking aspect of data physicalization and supports a variety of data types such as maps, matrices, and timelines. By adjusting the data entries, an analyst can find patterns inside the datasets and repeatedly use Domino on different datasets. More recent physicalization examples include using LEGO bricks to keep track of project progress. For example, people used LEGO to record their thesis writing progress. Users can use the LEGO board to set concrete steps before pushing to real publications such as data analysis, data collection, development, etc. Another application involves using LEGO in bug tracking. For software engineers, keeping track of the issue of the code base is a crucial task and LEGO simplify this progress by physicalize the issues. A specific application of data physicalization involves building tactile maps for visually impaired people. Past example include using microcapsule paper to build tactile maps. With the help of digital fabrication tool such as laser cutter, researchers in Fab Lab at RWTH Aachen University has used it to produce relief-based a tactile map to support visually impaired users. Some tangible user interface researchers combined TUI with tactile maps to render dynamic rendering and enhance collaboration between vision impaired people (e.g. FluxMarkers). == References ==
