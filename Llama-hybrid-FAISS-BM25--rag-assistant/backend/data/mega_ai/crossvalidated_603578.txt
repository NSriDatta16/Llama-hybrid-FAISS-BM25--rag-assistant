What is "critical slowing down" using MCMC for a Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution?

When sampling from a probability density function of the form $$p(x)=e^{-\beta E(x)},$$ where $E$ is considered to be the energy of a system and $\beta=1/T$ is the inverse of a temperature parameter $T$ , using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method (like the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm) there is a phenomenon called "critical slowing down". It is described, for example, in section 4.6.2 of the book The Theory of Critical Phenomena: An Introduction to the Renormalization Group or in the paper Multigrid Monte Carlo method. Conceptual foundations . Unfortunately, I don't really understand what this "critical slowing down" really is and why it is occuring when we run, for example, the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm with target density $p$ . From what I read it has something to do with a "critical temperature" (while I don't understand how this temperature is exactly defined) and the autocorrelation function. I'm not a physicist and hence would like to obtain a mathematical understanding of this problem and how it is solved.
