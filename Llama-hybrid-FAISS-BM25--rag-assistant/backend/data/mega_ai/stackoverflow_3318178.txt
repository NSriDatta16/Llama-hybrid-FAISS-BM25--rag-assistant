how to load content in tiny mce?

I'm loading content to a textarea, which is then initialized as an instance of tiny mce. It works perfect until the textarea has only paragraph. When I try to load a paragraph with an image inside it, it works strange. All the content inside the original paragraph is moved to a new paragraph and the original is added empty. Why this is happening. Thanks in advance. I'm trying to load following :- Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum. After loading it gets changed to : &nbsp; Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
