How to react when an externally played FLV reaches Nth frame or percentage?

I have this custom video player I'm making. I need some way to react when the externally played flv file reaches a certain point in the movie without embedding some extra data on the flv file. I am looking for this because I want to react at the 90%-99% point of the movie because I didn't like the behavior I'm getting when I react when the stream completes playing (I want a bit earlier). How do I achieve this? I'm surprised Adobe didn't document what is the object structure passed on things like onMetaData and onCuePoint...
