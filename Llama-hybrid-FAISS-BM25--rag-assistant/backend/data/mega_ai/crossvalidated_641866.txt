On my first attempts I got "wrong" results, like our revenue having a negative (but significant) correlation to the GDP, which doesn't make sense as it usually follows the GDP but the general trend of the revenue is negative and the trend of the GDP is positive > therefore I probably need to find other/better variables This is not wrong. With time series you can find all kinds of correlations. What is wrong is to draw strong conclusions with these type of data. See also: Why do these time series appear to be dependent? and Udny Yule's "Why do we Sometimes get Nonsense-Correlations between Time-Series?--A Study in Sampling and the Nature of Time-Series" . Is it correctly done, if I let SPSS analyze autocorrelation and then create lagged variables for significant and reasonable lags, which I include as a new independant variable? You could do something like that. You could do a Granger causality test which analyses whether changes in one series can be predicted by changes in the other series, and this will take autocorrelation into consideration. With only 6x24 points you may probably not have much significance, and also the interpretation remains difficult (the relationship found can be spurious).
