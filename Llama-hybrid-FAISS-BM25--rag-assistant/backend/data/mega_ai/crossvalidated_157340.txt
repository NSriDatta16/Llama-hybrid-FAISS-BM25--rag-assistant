In this youtube video , Jeremy Howard explains his technique to deal with this problem in r , he separates the variables in two sets according the number of observations for each level : Set 1 : levels for $N_{obs}>100$ or ( $25 + predictive value) Set 2 : all the rest. I should mention that I'm new to Random Forest and the luck has just made that I looked at this video two days ago. And even if this technique makes sense to me (separate in two sets with different importance) I can't explain the choice of these thresholds (which are obviously a bit arbitrary and dataset dependent), and at what point one can consider that a level has a honorable predictive value.
