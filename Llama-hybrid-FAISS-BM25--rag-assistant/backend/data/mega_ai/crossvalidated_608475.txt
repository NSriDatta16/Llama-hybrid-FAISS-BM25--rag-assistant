I highly recommend reading Midway et al., 2020 , which is probably the best article I have ever read that summarizes pairwise comparisons for ANOVA. Along with the guidelines they provide for how to properly utilize these post-hoc tests, one of the opening paragraphs states this: The classic ANOVA (ANalysis Of Variance) is a general linear model that has been in use for over 100 years (Fisher, 1918) and is often used when categorical or factor data need to be analyzed. However, an ANOVA will only produce an F -statistic (and associated p-value) for the whole model. In other words, an ANOVA reports whether one or more significant differences among group levels exist, but it does not provide any information about specific group means compared to each other. Additionally, it is possible that group differences exist that ANOVA does not detect. For both of these reasons, a strong and defensible statistical method to compare groups is nearly a requirement for anyone analyzing data. For this reason, it is useful to explore differences between groups even if there is no significant ANOVA. Remember that the f value derived from an ANOVA simply tests the overall variance between groups. How some groups compare to each other cannot be understood without exploring further.
