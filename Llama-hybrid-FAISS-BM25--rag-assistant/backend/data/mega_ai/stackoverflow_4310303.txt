New to NLP, Question about annotation

I am new to NLP and I am looking for a starting point, in terms of some tutorials, documentation or example code. I have been told to research the possibilities of processing natural text to extract some structured data from it. For example I want to extract(annotate) height and weight from following statements. "He is 6 feet tall and weighs 200 pounds" or "His height is 6 feet and weight is 200" etc. I have looked into UIMA but it seems like a self created REGEX dictionary with no training capabilities. So in a nutshell, what Java framework can I use to create an annotation engine that can be trained as well! Any help(pointers) on this will be heavily appreciated. Thanks
