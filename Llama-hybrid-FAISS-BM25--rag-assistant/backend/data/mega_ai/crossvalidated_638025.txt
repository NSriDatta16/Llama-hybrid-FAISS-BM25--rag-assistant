It is important understand why certain data points are labelled as outliers. Are they true anomalies, or do they represent a valid, albeit extreme, variation within the data? Investigating the nature of these outliers can provide insights into the data's structure and the phenomena being studied. While p-values indicate whether the test statistic you obtained is likely if the null hypothesis is true, they do not convey the magnitude of the effect. Calculating and reporting effect sizes can offer a more nuanced understanding of your results. In R , packages like lme4 for linear mixed models can be used to compute effect sizes. Consider Cohen's d or other relevant effect size measures appropriate for your data. Examining confidence intervals around your estimates can be more informative than solely relying on p-values. Confidence intervals provide a range of plausible values for the effect size and can offer insights into the precision of your estimates. Wide intervals might suggest more data is needed for precise estimates. Comparing models with and without outliers using information criteria like AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) or BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion) can provide insights into model fit and complexity. A significant change in these criteria might suggest the outliers have a substantial impact on the model. Beyond just removing outliers, conducting a sensitivity analysis where you systematically vary your inclusion criteria or model specifications can reveal how robust your findings are to different assumptions and data manipulations. Bayesian methods can offer a different perspective, especially in understanding the probability of a hypothesis given the data. This approach might provide a more intuitive interpretation of your results than frequentist p-values. In the absence of clear statistical guidance, a qualitative discussion about the nature and impact of the outliers, the context of the study, and potential theoretical implications can be valuable. This can include speculating about why outliers might be influencing the results and what this means for your field of study. Complex models and situations like yours often benefit from collaboration with a statistician who can provide tailored advice based on the specifics of your data and research questions.
