Twitter Oauth login in a cron agent executing PHP file evenry 2 minutes

I'm using Twitter Basic authentification in a CRON agent to get et savelist of tweets in SQL db of 5 of my twitter account. Because we have to use Oauth after June 30th I'm searching to know how can I use oauth without connecting me manually. In fact I don't have user interface in my PHP file executed every 2 minutes. Thanks in advance for your help. Joel.
