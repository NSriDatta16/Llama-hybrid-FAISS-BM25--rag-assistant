For so called location models, such as your linear regression, anovas etc., basically for models where the outcome depends linearly on the estimated parameters, the confidence interval will be the same as the credible interval with flat prior. If you want to know how would that credible interval look like with a different prior, then you add that prior information to your results as you would do normally as a Bayesian. This is not the case for models where the outcome depends non-linearly on parameters, such as for logistic regression. I think this is because likelihood is invariant to reparametrizations, but priors are not, so you cannot really have a non-informative prior in this case. There are also invariant priors, and probability matching priors, but unfortunately I don't know how they fit into the picture. Sorry How much will confidence and credible intervals differ, depends on the data. The more data you have, the less will they differ. With a lot of data (infinite) they will be the same again. If they are different, credible intervals won't have the proper coverage, which might not be something you want. If you want a more mathy treatment of this topic look at Fraser, D. A. S. “Is Bayes Posterior Just Quick and Dirty Confidence?” Statistical Science, vol. 26, no. 3, 2011, pp. 299–316. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/23059129 . Accessed 3 June 2021. (there is also an arxiv version https://arxiv.org/abs/1112.5582 ) There you will also find a formula to how much will they differ and also how to get from a confidence quantile to Bayesian quantile. The math in the paper should be good, but the sentiment of the paper is not something that is generally accepted.
