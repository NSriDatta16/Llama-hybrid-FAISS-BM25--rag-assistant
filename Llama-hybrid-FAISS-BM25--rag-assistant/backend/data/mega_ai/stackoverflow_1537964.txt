Visual C++ equivalent of GCC's __attribute__ ((__packed__))

For some compilers, there is a packing specifier for structs, for example :: RealView ARM compiler has "__packed" Gnu C Compiler has "__attribute__ ((__packed__))" Visual C++ has no equivalent, it only has the "#pragma pack(1)" I need something that I can put into the struct definition. Any info/hack/suggestion ? TIA...
