If you want to add a new feature to the class, write a test that fails because the feature has not been implemented, then implement the feature and see the test pass. Or... Run code-coverage metrics as part of the build. They will indicate if code gas been added without being covered by the tests. Or... Run mutation tests as part of the build. They will indicate if any tests that cover the code are just running through it and not actually testing anything. Or all of the above.
