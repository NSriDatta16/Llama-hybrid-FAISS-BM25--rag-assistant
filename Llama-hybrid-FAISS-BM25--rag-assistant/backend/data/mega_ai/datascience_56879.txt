The second option is wrong. If you label Male , Female , Undefined as [0, 1, 2] you are treating categories as numbers. That is not correct. The Network in this way would learn something such as Undefined > Female , which doesn't make sense. You need one hot encoding to treat those variables: they are not a numerical values that you can put on a scale. About the Age question: if that's a numerical variable (expressed in years, I guess?) then you can feed it directly into the Neural Network without problems.
