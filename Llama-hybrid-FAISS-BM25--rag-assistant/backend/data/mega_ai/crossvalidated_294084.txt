Because your response variable is composed of counts of a binary response (0 or 1), logistic regression would be an appropriate model to use. I suspect you don't want to use traditional OLS regression (e.g. proc anova , or proc glm ) with this kind of data. I'm no longer a SAS person, but I remember proc logistic being pretty straight-forward to use. I think you will not need to change the format of your data; I believe the freq statement can be used with your Count variable to let SAS know, e.g. how many M , A , outcome 0 observations you had. For example, try the following, with the caveat that I'm not a SAS person: proc logistic data=D1; freq Count; class Gender Group; model Outcome = Gender Group Gender*Group; run;
