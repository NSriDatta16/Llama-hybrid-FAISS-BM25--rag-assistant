The 80/20 rule is a catchy slogan, commonly repeated in many places, but do not take it literally. There are examples where it holds, there are also many counterexamples where the numbers are not exactly this. In Wikipedia, and other sources, you can easily find multiple examples where the numbers are not exactly 80/20, e.g. the 1% rule . The TL;DR about the rule is that for many phenomena, the majority of outcomes is generated by the minority of events, but the actual numbers would vary on case-by-case basis.
