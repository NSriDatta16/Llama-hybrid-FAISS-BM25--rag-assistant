Why is Eigenvalue different from Variance.percent?

I am conducting PCA analysis on results from a Likert-scale (10-point base) survey on user preferences. When using the code below, I obtain the list of variables with their respective eigenvalues. However these eigenvalues are different from the adjacent column which shows variance.percent (in the reference guide, it's one-tenth of the eigenvalue. Could anyone explain why this might be or if there is anything off with my approach? res.pca
