Ada - does pragma Attach_Handler() can attach handler with System.Priority'Last priority?

The next two declarations are equivalent: protected type prot_Type is .... pragma Priority(System.Priority'Last); end; protected type prot_Type is .... end; One way of attaching interrupt handler is: protected type prot_Type is procedure Handler; pragma Attach_Handler(Handler, ...); end; --//Attach is made at the creation of the next object: Object : prot_Type; it's a legal attachment (It works). How is it possible that the handler has ceiling priority of System.Priority Last ? (As far as I know the legal priority is in range Priority'Last+1 .. Any_Priority'Last). Another thing: if I add the pragma Priority(System.Priority'Last); to the protected declaration, a program_error exception is raised at the elaboration (when attaching the handler). Someone can please spread the fog?
