MASTER - This keeps all server-level information, and meta-data about all databases on the server. Don't lose this :) MSDB - Holds information about SQL Agent jobs and job run history TEMPDB - Used as a temporary "work space" for temporary tables and lots of other stuff (like sorting and grouping) MODEL - When you create a new, blank database, it makes a copy of MODEL as a template DISTRIBUTION - (You will only see this on servers where you have set up replication) Holds records pending for replication.
