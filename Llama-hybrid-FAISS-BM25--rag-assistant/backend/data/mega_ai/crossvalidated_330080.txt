For TDA, you have a free parameter of persistence, which will unambiguously fix your clusters when you set it to a given value. However, TDA does not return centroids. Much in the same way that tSNE returns an embedding, it's up to you to specify centroids. You could run k-means on your TDA result, using graph distance as your metric, to then fix clusters. Then silhouette analysis should be applicable.
