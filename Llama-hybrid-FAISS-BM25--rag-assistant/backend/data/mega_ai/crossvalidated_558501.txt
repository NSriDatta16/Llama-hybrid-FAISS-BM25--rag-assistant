In finance the quantiles are used to calculate the metric called value-at-risk (VaR). A common technique for backing testing VaR is coverage tests, such as Kupiec test. They use estimates of confidence intervals of quantiles, which you can apply to your problem. The simplest formulas are based on binomial distribution, see the simple description here https://www.value-at-risk.net/backtesting-coverage-tests/
