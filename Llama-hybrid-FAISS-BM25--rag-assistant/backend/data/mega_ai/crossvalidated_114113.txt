One simple way would be to compute gain scores - post1 - pre, post2 - pre, and post3 - pre and do your analysis in terms of treatment and period (1st, 2nd, or 3rd post meas) -- or average the 3 gain scores so that you just have 1 value for each subject. A lot depends on what exactly those pot-treatment measures are. There must be a reason for 3 of them rather than just 1. Can you say more about that, and I may add to my answer.
