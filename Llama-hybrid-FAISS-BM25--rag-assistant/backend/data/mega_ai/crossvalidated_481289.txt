Here's the way I would do it (check it's correct!) If you have more than one symptom you apply the Bayesian theorem recursively using the previous result as the new prior probability. Here's an example (works in R) - I made up some starting values without too much thinking about them: p_fever_C19 = 0.83 # P of fever given you have C19 p_fever_noC19 = 0.01 # P of fever given you DO NOT have C19 p_C19 = 0.0001 # P of C19 without any information about symptoms (i.e. P of C19 in the general population) If you have fever your probability of having C19 is: p_C19_given_fever = (p_C19 * p_fever_C19) / ((p_C19 * p_fever_C19) + ((1-p_C19) * p_fever_noC19)) Let's say now you also have cough, instead of p_C19 use the previous p_C19_given_fever p_cough_C19 = 0.82 p_cough_noC19 = 0.1 p_C19_given_fever_cough = (p_C19_given_fever * p_cough_C19) / ((p_C19_given_fever * p_cough_C19) + ((1-p_C19_given_fever) * p_cough_noC19)) You also have short breath: p_short_C19 = 0.31 p_short_noC19 = 0.2 p_C19_given_fever_cough_short = (p_C19_given_fever_cough * p_short_C19) / ((p_C19_given_fever_cough * p_short_C19) + ((1-p_C19_given_fever_cough) * p_short_noC19)) .. and so on for other symptoms. For this example the results are: p_C19_given_fever 0.008232494 p_C19_given_fever_cough 0.06372898 p_C19_given_fever_cough_short 0.09543484
