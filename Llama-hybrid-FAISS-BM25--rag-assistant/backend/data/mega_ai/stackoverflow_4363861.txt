Returning Google Search To Python

I am trying to get the first 20 results from a Google search. When I use urllib2.urlopen() it gives me an error and says I am forbidden. I heard that it has something to do with faking you user agent string, but i have next to no urllib2 experience and would be very grateful if anyone could help. Thanks, giodamelio
