Intuitively, I'd like to get some estimate of how much the performance of these models varies depending on the sample I take. Take a look at cross validation schemes. There are a couple interpretations of error in Elements of statistical learning which I think would be beneficial for you to know. The first is Generalization or Test Error . This is the expected error your model would make conditioned on training on the data you have presently. Again, to be clear, this is the error your model would make when fit on this training set . Let's call this $\operatorname{Err}_{\mathcal{T}}$ . Contrast this to the Expected Test Error , which is the error you would make averaging over new test and training data. Call this, $\operatorname{Err}$ . To me, it sounds like you are interested in $\operatorname{Err}$ rather than $\operatorname{Err}_{\mathcal{T}}$ . The authors of ESL write in chapter 7 "Estimation of $\operatorname{Err}_{\mathcal{T}}$ [through cross validation] will be our goal, although we will see that $\operatorname{Err}$ is more amenable to statistical analysis", and so I think chapter 7 is really what you need and I would recommend you read that chapter.
