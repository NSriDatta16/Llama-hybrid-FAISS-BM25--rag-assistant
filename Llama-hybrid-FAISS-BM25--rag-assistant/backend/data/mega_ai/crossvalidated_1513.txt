if you decide to generate your distribution from the data you have observed, your model will never spit out a "tail value", ie, something outside the range of what you have observed. your example data: average 5.3 yards per carry with a SD of 1.7 yards will have a max and a min, say 10 and 2. in that case, your calculated distribution will not have any weight in the tails, and will be unable to generate a value of 11 or 1. maybe this is ok, but it prevents you from ever generating one of those super-human events that everyone loves to watch. the functional form for the standard normal has tails that go to infinity, so if you assume the distribution is normal, you will be able to generate simulated values (at very small probabilities) that are higher or lower than your observed data.
