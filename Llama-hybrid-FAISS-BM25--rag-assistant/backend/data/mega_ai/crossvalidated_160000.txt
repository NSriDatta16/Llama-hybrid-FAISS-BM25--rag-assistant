Are fixed bias neurons or biased neurons better?

When building an artificial neural network, there seems to be two differing philosophies in usage of biases. There are those groups that propose neural networks with a fixed bias neuron with a variable weight, and those who propose variable bias values for each neuron in the hidden and output layers. Which one is better? Is one really better? (Advantages, disadvantages...) Also see the examples below.
