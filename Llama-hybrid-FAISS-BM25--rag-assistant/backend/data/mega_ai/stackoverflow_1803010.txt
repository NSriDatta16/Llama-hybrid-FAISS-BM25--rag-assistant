How to release attribute which is protocol?

I have working for iPhone development for a while. First time, I so surprised with memory-management in objective-c :). but now I got it a little bit. The question is, sometime, I use protocol as an attribute of a class, because I think its definition very similar to 'interface' in C# or Java. like below. @protocol Shield ... @end // Interface @interface Dragon { id shield NSString * name; } @property (nonatomic,retain) id shield; @property (nonatomic,retain) NSString * name; @end but I alway release any attribute object in dealloc() method. like below. -(void)dealloc { [name release]; [shield release]; // As you see, I couldn't release the protocol. So would this cause me future memory issue? Do you have another way to handle this solution to advice me?
