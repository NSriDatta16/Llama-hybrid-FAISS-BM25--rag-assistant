C# console app: reference file without ..\..\filename

I need to read data from a file in a c# console application. What works: new StreamReader(@"..\\..\myData.csv"); Problem: the ..\\..\ work because my exe file is in the bin/Debug directory When I deploy my project the path doesn't work any longer Question: How can I reference myData.csv regardless of the location of the exe file? I had hoped to find a method that returns the 'root' of my console application So far I tried the following: Process.GetCurrentProcess().MainModule.FileName Path.GetDirectoryName(Assembly.GetEntryAssembly().Location Path.GetFullPath("bp.csv") AppDomain.CurrentDomain.BaseDirectory Directory.GetCurrentDirectory() All of these expressions lead me to the directory of the exe file not the root. I just started to read about isolated storage but it would be nice to have something simpler. Any suggestions / recommendations?
