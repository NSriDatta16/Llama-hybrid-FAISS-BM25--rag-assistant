Test cases for a Singly Linked list

What are some good testcases for a Linked list problem in general? for example test cases for a function which finds and eliminates duplicates and returns the pointer to the first node. Some core cases could be: the function is in c# or Java and not c, c++. Assume all positive integers as nodes of the list. Null Empty List Linked list with a loop List with all dups List with one node or 2 nodes (2 dups) No duplicates The list could encounter integer over flow, incase low memory (depending on 32 bit machine, 64 bit machine) Security testing, language automation, memory issues, performance and stress What else? expecting outrageous test cases..any experts out there?
