How to do weighted pair hierarchical clustering in R?

Here is an example of hierarchical clustering of genes in the microarray data using the weighted pair gene method in Spotfire . I am not sure how to do this in R . In the hclust function, I see ward", "single", "complete", "average", "mcquitty", "median" or "centroid" as the methods. Also, lets say I have performed hierarchical clustering and found groups of genes using cuttree method. I wanted to plot the expression of genes in a group across columns (which may represent treatment, time, etc.). And I want to do this for all the groups separately. In a way similar to the Mfuzz package's way of showing clusters. Can any one please help me? TIA for any pointers.
