Plotting the accuracy of cutpoints in a logistic regression model

I would like to perform a simple logistic regression and draw a plot showing how the accuracy (that is "(Σ True positive + Σ True negative) / Σ Total population") change through different cutpoints, that is, the X axis should be the cutpoint for the value of the explanatory variable (between its minimum and maximum values) and the Y axis should be the accuracy (between 0 and 1). I use R and the package "Epi" does something sort of similar (see its function called "ROC") but I would like to do it on my own to easily tweak the plot to fit my study needs (I am not interested in the AUROC of the model). For example. imagine my logistic regression is: status Theoretically, how can I draw the plot?
