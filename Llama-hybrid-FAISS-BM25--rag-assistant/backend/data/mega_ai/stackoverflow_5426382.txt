I think the FM-index by Paolo Ferragina and Giovanni Manzini is really cool. Especially in bioinformatics. It's essentially a compressed full text index that utilizes a combination of a suffix array and a burrows-wheeler transform of the reference text. The index can be searched without decompressing the whole index.
