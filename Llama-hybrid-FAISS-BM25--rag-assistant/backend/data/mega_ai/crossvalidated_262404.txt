The "$n$" factor is implicit already in $\boldsymbol{X}^T\boldsymbol{X}$. This is easiest to see in the case where $\boldsymbol{X}$ has been whitened , so $\boldsymbol{X}^T\boldsymbol{X}=n\boldsymbol{I}$. More generally we have $\boldsymbol{X}=[\boldsymbol{x}_1,\ldots\boldsymbol{x}_p]$, where $\boldsymbol{x}_p\in\mathbb{R}^n$. Then the entries of the matrix are $$\left(\boldsymbol{X}^T\boldsymbol{X}\right)_{ij}=\boldsymbol{x}_i^T\boldsymbol{x}_j$$ Now choose a pair of columns, $\boldsymbol{a}=\boldsymbol{x}_i$ and $\boldsymbol{b}=\boldsymbol{x}_j$. Then we have $$\boldsymbol{a}^T\boldsymbol{b}=\sum_{k=1}^na_kb_k=\overline{(ab)}\,n$$ So each entry of the matrix is a dot product, which can be seen as $n$ times an average. In the case where $\boldsymbol{X}$ has been centered so the columns have zero means, the product-matrix entries are covariances . For an overview of the general case, see here .
