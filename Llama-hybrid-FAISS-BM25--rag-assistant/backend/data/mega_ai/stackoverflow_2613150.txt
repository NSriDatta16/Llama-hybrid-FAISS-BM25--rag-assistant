Others have said it is a way to change the way your program looks and feel. To demonstrate, go to http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/desktop/javawebstart/demos-nojavascript.html and launch "The SwingSet Demo" (requires Java installed). In the menu under "Look & Feel" several options exist that allows you to choose between different Look and Feels included with the default Java installation. You can also bring your own if you want to. See http://www.jgoodies.com/freeware/metamorphosis/index.html for a demonstration about how to tweak your Look and Feel. You can launch the demo directly from http://www.jgoodies.com/download/demos/metamorphosis/metamorphosis.jnlp
