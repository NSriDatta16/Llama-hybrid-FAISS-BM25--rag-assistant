Although beguiling the idea of "correlating" last years data with a particular year in the past to determine a good predictor is flawed at a number of levels. The correlation statistic , although contunued to be applied, is flawed when trying to characterize time series data http://www.math.mcgill.ca/~dstephens/OldCourses/204-2008/Handouts/Yule1926.pdf . Time Series was once approached ( and still is today ) as a way to use the history of the series as a predictor "ARIMA models". Others have attempted to force a specification of one trend and a set of seasonal coefficients, perhaps adapting in a presumed way and have employed Holt-Winters approaches. Modern time series suggests that there may be an ARIMA structure ( and it may have changed over time) AND there may have been 1 or more trends , 1 or more levels(intercepts), 1 or more points of change of the seasonal dummies and some 1 time anomalies http://www.unc.edu/~jbhill/tsay.pdf . Additionally the variance of the errors may have changed over time or there may be a relationship between the dispersion in the errors and the level of the series(Box-Cox). Packages like SAS, STATA, AUTOBOX ( which I am involved with as a developer ) to name a few provide implementations of some of the ideas I have laid out here.
