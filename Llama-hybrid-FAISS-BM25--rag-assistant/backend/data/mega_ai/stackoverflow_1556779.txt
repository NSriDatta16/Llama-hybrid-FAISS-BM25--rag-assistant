How do I share user settings or files using the UserAppDataPath across builds?

Right now when I release a new build of my .NET app, the UserAppDataPath path points to a new folder that includes the build number. Documents and Settings\UserName\Application Data\Company\AssemblyName\1.0.0.0 I use this path as a convenient storage place for extended user UI setting files. Every time I release the user looses their previous UI settings. Is it safe to trim off the \1.0.0.0 version number and use its root path? or is there a better way to store settings in a place that is always has write privileges?
