Maybe not a direct answer, but there are stemmers in many NLP toolkits - see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing_toolkits . There's a related question here Tokenizer, Stop Word Removal, Stemming in Java with several answers that might be useful. We use OpenNLP which is written in Java and may provide the functionality. I wouldn't expect the variation between stemmers to be critical if you are working in English.
