No -- it can be applied to a variable that's qualified as const . Note, however, that doing so (generally) means that the compiler has to actually assign that variable an address -- if you only use it in ways that don't need an address, a const variable often won't need to be assigned any storage at all (i.e., the code generated using a const variable will often be almost like you'd use a literal directly, but your source code gets to use a meaningful name instead).
