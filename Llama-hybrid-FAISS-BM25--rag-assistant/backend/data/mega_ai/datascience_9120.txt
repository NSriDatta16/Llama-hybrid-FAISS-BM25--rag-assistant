Excellent question. In chapter 4 of "Illuminating the Path, The Research and Development Agenda for Visual Analytics" by James J. Thomas and Kristin A. Cook is a discussion on data representations and data transformations. In my research I have approached this question in the context of PCA and factor analysis. My brief answer is that the visualizations are useful if one has the data transformation to move from the visualization space to the original data space. This would additionally be conducted within a visual analytics framework.
