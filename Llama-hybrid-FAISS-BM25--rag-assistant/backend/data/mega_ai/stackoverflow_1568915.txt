This will accomplish what you want, but I am not sure its the best solution. I think its something that short and elegant, but might be more confusing and difficult to follow than its worth. System.Threading.Timer timer = null; timer = new System.Threading.Timer( (object state) => { DoSomething(); timer.Dispose(); } , null // no state required ,TimeSpan.FromSeconds(x) // Do it in x seconds ,TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(-1)); // don't repeat
