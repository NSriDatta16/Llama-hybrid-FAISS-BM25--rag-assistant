Ordinal regression with categorical covariates and predictors

I am trying to do an ordinal logistic regression (ordinal outcome variables with more than 2 categories) with nominal (more than 2 categories for some) predictor variables, as well as nominal (more than 2 categories for some) covariates/moderators. First of all, I would like to test for effect interaction to see which of my covariates/moderators are indeed moderators so that I can treat them as such. Second of all, I would like to know what's the best way to come up with the optimal model? Do I need to do dummy variables for the covariates? Can I do a stepwise for ordinal regression?
