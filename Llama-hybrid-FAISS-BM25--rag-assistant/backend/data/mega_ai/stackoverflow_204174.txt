Don't understand how Axis works if I haven't installed it?

Forgive my ignorance - still learning here. I am using Eclipse Ganymede (Java 1.5) and have been experimenting with web services - I have mangaged to get a simple web service up and running and the nice wizard you get in Eclipse generates all the necessary bits and pieces e.g. wsdl file etc - and you can test the service and everthing else. Now it seems to use axis.jar and all other axis related stuff and when I run the web service, everything is good - but how is this even working in Tomcat, if I haven't even installed Axis? I can't find anything in my Apache installation or Ganymede about anything to do with Axis??
