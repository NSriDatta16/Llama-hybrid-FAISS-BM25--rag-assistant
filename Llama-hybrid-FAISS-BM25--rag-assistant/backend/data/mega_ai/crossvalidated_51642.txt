Advice needed for time series correlation

I have two time series data sets that I wish to compare. One is from an automated process of laboratory generated medical test results. The positive test results occur every day over N years. The second is from manual collection of clinical information about the patients from on which the medical tests were performed. My null hypothesis is that there is no correlation between the aggregated monthly counts of positive tests results over time and the aggregated monthly number of clinical follow-ups on those patients during the same period. So, I am not looking for validation of laboratory test results. I am looking for correlation between two data generating processes over time. Can someone advise if this sounds feasible / appropriate and suggest a strategy to undertake the analysis. Any point me in the direction of a useful resource. Thanks.
