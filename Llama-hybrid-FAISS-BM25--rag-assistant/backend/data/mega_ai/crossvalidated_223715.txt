Plotting a frequency distribution with count and score (precision) for the frequenct

I have a dataset of a million documents. I took the frequency distribution of the documents based on the number of words in it. I also have the precision results for each document. Now I want to show the average precision per frequency. How do I plot this? What kind of diagram can incorporate boht the frequncy and the precision for each count My dataset sample name, number of words,precision doc1, 3, 0.3 dco2,4,0.2 doc3,3,0.1 doc4,3,0.2 doc5,5,0.5 Now what I need to plot is freq., count, mean prec. 3, 3,0.2 4,1,0.2 5,1,0.5
