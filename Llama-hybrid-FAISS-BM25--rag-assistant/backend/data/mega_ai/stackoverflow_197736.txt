You need a wrapper library to be able to use the class from C#. The best bet would be to create the wrapper using C++/CLI, which can directly call the unmanaged function and expose the details with a managed class. This will eliminate the need to use P/Invoke for anything. (Well, technically if you know the class layout you could mess around with pointer arithmetic to access the fields, but this would be very fragile and messy, and trying to call virtual functions in this way would be extremely ugly).
