Yes. Here is the completed CSS the article uses. It is well worth reading the entire article , as the author goes step by step into what you need to make this work. #container3 { float:left; width:100%; background:green; overflow:hidden; position:relative; } #container2 { float:left; width:100%; background:yellow; position:relative; right:30%; } #container1 { float:left; width:100%; background:red; position:relative; right:40%; } #col1 { float:left; width:26%; position:relative; left:72%; overflow:hidden; } #col2 { float:left; width:36%; position:relative; left:76%; overflow:hidden; } #col3 { float:left; width:26%; position:relative; left:80%; overflow:hidden; } This isn't the only method for doing it, but this is probably the most elegant method I've encountered. There is another site that is done completely in this manner, viewing the source will allow you to see how they did it .
