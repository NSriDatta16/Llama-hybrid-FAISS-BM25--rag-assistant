I don't really follow how and why would you want to use bootstrap in here, or how would it help, but this is a clear case for using survey-weights (see other questions tagged like this for more details). For example, if you know that values from some are were sampled three times more often then they appear in reality, you would weight them by 1/3 weight. Such weights can be used for calculating weighed means, but also can be used in many statistical models, e.g. regression, but also in machine learning, where you would just used weighted loss function.
