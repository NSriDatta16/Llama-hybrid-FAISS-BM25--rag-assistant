Why does my Netbeans Xdebug session timeout after period of inactivity

I love the way the Netbeans helps me to debug my Magento applications (in XAMPP on Win 7 64-bit), but I've noticed that the connection seems to timeout after a period. The breakpoints no longer get hit and I have to restart the debugging session which is annoying. Any suggestions for how to extend or disable the debug timeout? I can't see any options in the IDE or Xdebug php.ini config. The Xdebug documentation states: When the URL variable XDEBUG_SESSION_START=name is appended to an URL, Xdebug emits a cookie with the name "XDEBUG_SESSION" and as value the value of the XDEBUG_SESSION_START URL parameter. The expiry of the cookie is one hour.cookie is one hour. but doesn't suggest how to change the expiry time.
