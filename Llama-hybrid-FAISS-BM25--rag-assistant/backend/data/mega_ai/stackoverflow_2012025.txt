Specific question about RegEx repeats

I'm not a RegEx expert so I'm using the following borrowed RegEx to validate email addresses: ^[\w\.=-]+@[\w\.-]+\.[\w]{2,3}$ A user has reported it's rejecting their email address of frank@brownlie.info. It's the "info" that's being rejected as "inf" works. So I did a bit of reading and learnt what the [\w]{2,3} syntax means and yes, that's why info is getting rejected as it's four characters. Changing it to [\w]{2,4} worked. I like to understand my problems so dwelled upon this fragment. My question is why is the \w inside square brackets? Would not \w{2,4} also work? Cheers, Rob.
