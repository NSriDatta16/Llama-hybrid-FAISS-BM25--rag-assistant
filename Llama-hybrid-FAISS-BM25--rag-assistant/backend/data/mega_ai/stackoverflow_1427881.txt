why are you importing from XWinInfos ? you should be importing from SomeUtils . Not to mention that * -style imports are discouraged. Edit : your error ImportError: cannot import name MyClass1 basically tells you that there is no MyClass1 defined in the SomeUtils . It could be because you have another SomeUtils.py file somewhere on the system path and it being imported instead. If that file doesn't have MyClass1 , you'd get this error. Again: it's irrelevant whether you class MyClass1 exist. What might be the case is that you have another XWinInfos.p(y|o|w) somewhere on your system and it's being imported. Otherwise: norepro .
