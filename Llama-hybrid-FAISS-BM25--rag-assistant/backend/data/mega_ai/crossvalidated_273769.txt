Is there any reason why one cannot create a time series from variables calculated from regressions on cross sections?

I am asking this question as the textbooks that I have don't specifically address the topic of creating a time series. If you have an answer, or even links to articles that I can research myself, it would be much appreciated. Suppose you had thirty cross sections of data that are large enough for the asymptotic properties of OLS to apply. The cross sections are random samples of data collected each year for thirty years. As an example, let's say you want to analyse the income gap between men and women in a VAR or ECM model through time with a couple of other factors. Is there any reason why one could not run OLS regressions on each cross section to calculate estimates for the income gap (I am using the term "gap" to refer to male wage as a proportion of female wage), and then use then form a time series variable with these estimates for VAR or ECM analysis? This is assuming that I am able to correctly specify the relevant functional form in the cross section regressions.
