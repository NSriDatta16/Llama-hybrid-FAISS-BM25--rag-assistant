there are some javascript-frameworks (e.g. persistjs and dojo storage ) which allow to do cross-browser persistent storage of variables (using a variety of backends such as html5 localstorage, ie userbehavior, google gears, flash). better then native localstorage (as that is not supported by all browsers) and better then cookies (as they get sent back and fro with every request and response). hope this helps
