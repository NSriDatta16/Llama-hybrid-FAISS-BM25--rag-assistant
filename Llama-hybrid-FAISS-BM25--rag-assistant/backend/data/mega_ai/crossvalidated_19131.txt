I think that using a MAP/Bayesian criterion of in combination with a mixture of Gaussians is a sensible choice. Points You will of course object that MOGs require Euclidean input data . The answer is to find a set of points that give rise to the distance matrix you are given. An example technique for this is multidimensional scaling: $\text{argmin}_{\lbrace x_i \rbrace} \sum_{i, j}(||x_i - x_j||_2 - D_{ij})^2$ where $D_{ij}$ is the distance of point $i$ to point $j$.
