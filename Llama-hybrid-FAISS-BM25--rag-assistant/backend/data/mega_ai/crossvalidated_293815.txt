How could one apply convolutional neural network on inherently unordered input?

In visual tasks, I would have (width, height, channel) . Now imagine I have a bunch of pixels (thus vectors of length channel ), but there is no inherent ordering to these "pixels". Let's assume that "patterns" in the "picture" is still informative (for example, particular combinations of these "pixel" could give rise to hierarchical features). Now, what are some techniques I could apply in this scenario? Naively, I could just take a few of the dimensions in channel and pretend they are width and height (as in, order the remaining dimensions of the vectors according to these dimensions and then apply convolution on the result) - has this been done before?
