Creating regular time series from irregular time series (with data changes only)

I am using data from a sensor, that only sends the value if it has changed with the timestamp of the data change. The result looks for example like this: timestamp temperature 10:17:66 31 10:18:10 30 10:29:30 31 12:51:31 32 For some analysis, especially when I want to compare two time series I need equal timeintervals. For that purpose I would define a timeinterval like 10 minutes. I am not sure what is the best approach to calculate the values in that case in 10 minutes intervals. Let's say I want to calculate the value for 10:30:00. Between 10:20 and 10:30 most of the time the temperature was 30, so I surely have to weight that value higher than 31, which was present only for the last 30s. Is the best approach to calculate the integral here? Is there some R function, that can calculate regular time intervals in that way for me? I found the "approx.irts", which interpolates the values, but this is not the right way here I guess as I don't have missing values or times here?
