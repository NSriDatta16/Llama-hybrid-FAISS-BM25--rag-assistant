ASP.NET-MVC2 Preview 1: Are There Any Breaking Changes?

I was following Steven Sanderson's ' Pro ASP.NET MVC Framework ' book. On page 132, in accordance with the author's recommendation, I downloaded the ASP.NET MVC Futures assembly, and added it to my MVC project. Then, without encouragement from the author , I downloaded, installed, and incorporated the ASP.NET MVC2 Preview 1 dlls into my project. Now, I can no longer load the website. That is, when I hit F5 in Visual Studio, I get this error . In retrospect, I think it was a really bad idea to assume that ASP.NET MVC2 Preview 1 would only be additive; but I'd like other people to weigh in. Has anyone noticed any breaking changes in ASP.NET MVC 2 Preview 1? Also - Has anyone noticed any changes that impact Castle Windsor? Also, please let me know if I should be mindful of IIS6 vs. IIS7 ramifications.
