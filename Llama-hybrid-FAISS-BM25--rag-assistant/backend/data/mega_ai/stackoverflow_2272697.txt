How do I specify in a Makefile.am script that I only want to compile object .o files?

I have a Makefile.am which will be responsible for building a final application binary: project/src/Makefile.am Also in the src directory is a sub-directory called ctrnn which contains an additional Makefile.am : project/src/ctrnn/Makefile.am Now, ctrnn/Makefile.am should only generate object .o files with the idea being that the top-level Makefile.am should use the object files generated in subdirectory ctrnn to build the binary. This is the ctrnn/Makefile.am : SOURCES = network.cpp\ neuron.cpp AM_CPPFLAGS= @CXXFLAGS@ Based on this Makefile.am file, I want to end up with network.o and neuron.o. I am generating the according Makefile using Automake etc, yet when I try and then execute the make file, it doesn't do anything and just says: make: Nothing to be done for `all' I know why this is, I need to specify the build target. But how do I do this in the ctrnn/Makefile.am script given that I don't want to build a binary which would require bin_PROGRAMS but actual object files network.o and neuron.o ? (Note if I do specify a bin_PROGRAMS name, it rightly ends up complaining of an undefined reference to main). What am I do wrong?
