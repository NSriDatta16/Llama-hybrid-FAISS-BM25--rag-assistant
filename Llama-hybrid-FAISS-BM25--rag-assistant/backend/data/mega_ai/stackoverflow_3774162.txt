Given an AST, is there a working library for getting the source?

Is there a way to convert a given Python abstract syntax tree (AST) to a source code? Here is a good example of how to use Python's ast module, specifically a NodeTransformer . I was looking for a way to convert the resulting AST back to source, so the changes can be inspected visually.
