Clustering techniques at high dimensionality tend to be unstable/inaccurate. As such, if you are able to accurately classify one column based on others, then you are well suited with pursuing a dimensionality reduction technique such as Non-negative matrix factorization. In this way, you can simply remove the column from all data (as the other columns hold the same information), and then cluster on the reduced space.
