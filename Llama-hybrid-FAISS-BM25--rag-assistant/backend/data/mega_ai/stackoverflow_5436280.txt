Let's take OGRE and Unreal as examples. OGRE is open source. The entire code base is done by people volunteering. They will spend their free time doing it for enjoyment, or just to help. These aren't necessarily the best people. Unreal is commercial. It is done by paid workers. They do it as a job, and get paid for producing a high quality product. They are very likely to be much better than the average people on open source products.
