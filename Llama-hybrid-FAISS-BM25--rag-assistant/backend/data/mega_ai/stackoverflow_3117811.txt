How TinyMCE is supposed to work on ASP.NET MVC page?

In a previous question someone point out to me that TinyMCE is a nice and free WYSIWYG editor. Since then, the easiest part has been downloading the resource and have a editor being displayed on an ASP.NET MVC sample page. However, I haven't yet been able to make it work (even after surfing in the net - even in the TinyMCE's website I didn't see anything for first time user). Well, maybe the main point is to know how the thing's supposed to work. For instance, I've placed a button in the same Html.BeginForm where the TextArea is located. But when I clicked it, there was no post-back happening. So, here's my question: What the concept behind the editor? How do I get it post the content? (using a button, a link???) How do I receive the value posted in my action method? (using a local string variable - (model binding?) ) What am I supposed to expect? (text, fragment of HTML, both???) If someone can provide me with resource on that, that would nice. However, for now, I'd like to know how that's work. Thanks for helping.
