to update your average cost, try update mytable set ave_cost = cost / num; for the average cost per category, i'm not sure this will work on sql server, but you can try : update mytable set ave_cost_category = average from mytable inner join ( select category, avg(ave_cost) as average from mytable group by category ) as averages on table.category = averages.category
