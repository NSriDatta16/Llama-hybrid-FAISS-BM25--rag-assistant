First of all, you CAN learn them in 2 months time, if you are going to devote everyday for this. As per your background, you don't need much of the basics of ML, you just need Python. There are many answers for the same here- https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-way-to-learn-Python-from-scratch The simple roadmap for python here would be- Download and install python in your PC Start with a course and book (related to basic python concepts and programming) and start coding. I recommend both course and book because not everything is in a book and not everything is told in the courses. As soon as you start creating smaller working scripts, go to hackerrank and start doing exercises there. This will develop your understanding of data structures and which data structure to use in which type of problem. This will help you in writing scripts in python. For understanding deep learning, you can go to this- http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/ This tutorial uses Theano for building neural network models. It also explains many terms related to deep learning. And finally (you already know), practice is what you want to learn in this short time. And your biggest positive point is that you have a PhD in Maths, so you can easily understand the mathematics behind deep learning models.
