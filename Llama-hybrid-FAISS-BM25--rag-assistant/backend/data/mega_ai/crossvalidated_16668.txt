Isabelle Guyon (and colleagues) organised a challenge on active learning a while back, the proceedings are published here (open access). This has the advantage of being quite practical and you can directly compare the performances of different approaches under an unbiased (in a colloquial sense) protocol (random selection of patterns is surprisingly hard to beat).
