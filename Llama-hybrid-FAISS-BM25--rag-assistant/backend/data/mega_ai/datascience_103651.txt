Satellite relative motion prediction using simulated data as a training data. I have a problem where I might have too much training data available

I am trying to model the satellite relative motion using regression. What I am doing is predicting the satellite relative motion using the Xu-Wang equations, which are a set of 11 first-order differential equations. So my training data would look as follows: 5 first-order differential equations, which define the chief orbit need to be propagated using some numerical integration technique, but the amount of possible perturbations these 5 variables can take is infinite for example: a = 6700 ~ 50000 km e = 0~0.99 i = 0~180 M =0~360 m = 0~360 and then for each above mentioned condition the secondary 6 variables can take infinitely many positions x, y, z, = -1000km~1000km vx, vy, vz = -10km/sm~+10km/s. and then each of these scenarios needs to be propagated into the future, and the future itself can be up to 15 years. so even if I take 1 reading every 1 hour or 1 day, the amount of data is too much. i.e. each initial data will generate a whole time series. So really I am facing a problem where I may have too many possible situations to choose from. Is there a statistical tool or model that I can use to pick and choose which initial orbital conditions I should choose?
