What you describe is called Reverse Geocoding . Google provides a Geocoding Web Service API which you can call from your server-side application (using any language) to do reverse geocoding . For example, the following request: http://maps.google.com/maps/api/geocode/xml?latlng=40.714224,-73.961452&sensor=false ... will return a response that looks like the following (truncated): OK street_address 277 Bedford Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11211, USA 277 277 street_number Bedford Ave Bedford Ave route Brooklyn Brooklyn sublocality political New York New York locality political Kings Kings administrative_area_level_2 political New York NY administrative_area_level_1 political United States US country political 11211 11211 postal_code 40.7142330 -73.9612910 ROOFTOP 40.7110854 -73.9644386 40.7173806 -73.9581434 However be aware that the Google Maps API Terms of Use seem to prohibit the storage of the results , unless the store acts as a cache for data that will used in Google Maps. You may want to get in touch with Google and enquire on the Google Maps API Premier to have more flexible terms of use for your geocoding requirements.
