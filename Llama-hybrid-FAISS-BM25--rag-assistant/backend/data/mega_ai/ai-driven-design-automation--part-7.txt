erformance computing. Their solutions include high performance parallel storage and tools for managing large scale jobs. These are designed to help design houses manage the complex simulation and modeling tasks that are part of modern EDA. Limitations and challenges Data quality and availability One of the main challenges for using AI effectively in EDA is the lack of availability and low quality of existing training data. Machine learning models, especially deep learning ones, usually need large, varied, and high quality datasets for training. This increases the odds they will work well on designs unlike those they have seen before. However, detailed design data in the semiconductor industry is very sensitive and often considered a trade secret, with companies unwilling to share it. The lack of public, detailed examples makes it difficult for university researchers, and even EDA companies, to develop models that can be widely used. Furthermore, even the data that is available is often non-representative, with problems such being noisy, incomplete, or unbalanced. For instance, having many more examples of successful designs than ones with problems can lead to biased or poorly performing AI models. The work and cost of collecting, organizing, and correctly labeling large EDA datasets is one of the main obstacles to moving AI forward in EDA. Possible solutions include creating strong data augmentation methods, generating realistic synthetic data, and building community platforms for sharing data securely and for benchmarking. Integration and compute cost Putting AI solutions into practice in the EDA field is challenging. Adding new AI models and algorithms into established EDA workflows, which are often made of many connected tools and private formats, takes considerable engineering work and can face difficulties when working with novel or custom EDA tools. Also, training and running complex AI models, such as deep learning, requires high end computing resources. These may includes powerful GPUs, special AI accelerators, large amounts of memory, and/or long processing times. These needs lead to high costs for both creating and using AI models. Creating AI methods that can handle the ever growing size and complexity of modern chip designs, while staying efficient and using a reasonable amount of memory, is an ongoing challenge. Intellectual property and confidentiality The use of AI in EDA, especially with sensitive design data, brings up serious worries about protecting secret company information, known as intellectual property (IP), and keeping data private. Chip designs are very valuable IP, and there is always a risk when giving this secret information to AI models, particularly if they are made by other companies or run on cloud platforms. It is extremely important to make sure that design data used for training or making decisions is not compromised, leaked, or used to accidentally leak secret knowledge. While strategies like fine tuning open source models on private data are being tried to reduce some privacy risks, it is essential to set up secure data handling rules, strong access controls, and clear data management policies. The unwillingness to share detailed design data because of these IP and privacy worries also slows down collaborative research and the creation of better AI models for the EDA industry. Human oversight and interpretability Even with the push for more automation, the role of human designers is still vital, and making AI models understandable continues to be a challenge. Many advanced deep learning systems, can act like "black boxes", which makes it hard for engineers to understand why they make certain predictions or design choices. This lack of clarity can prevent adoption, as designers might not want to trust or use solutions if their decision making process is not clear, especially in critical applications or when fixing unexpected problems. It is essential to set design goals, check the results f
