Seeing that I am new to WPF and XAML I made the mistake of making my resources a style and did not realize that I could have simply made the brushes a resource and avoid styles altogether. I kept the reference to the DiscreteObjectKeyFrame s' values as static to the new brush resources. I changed the Ellipse to this: The style property was removed and I assigned the brush to the fill property directly. In the ObjectAnimationUsingKeyFrames tag I added Fill as the Storyboard.TargetProperty since I was no longer using a style to dress up the fill. The DiscreteObjectKeyFrame s now look like this: My resources are much simpler without being wrapped in a style and IMO, more elegant. Also the brushes are defined before the animation in my final solution. Everything is now working as intended. The best assumption I can make is that styles are not freezable since they were the components that I removed and I no longer receive exceptions regarding a freezable that cannot be frozen.
