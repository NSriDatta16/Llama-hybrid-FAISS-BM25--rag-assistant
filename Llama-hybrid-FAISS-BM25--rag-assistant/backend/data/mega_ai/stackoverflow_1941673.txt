Cucumber tests and captcha: how to handle that?

We are considering using Cucumber for testing web applications (not in rails, most of them are asp.net actually). The applications are in production, our main goal is to test if everything is fine with the services, from time to time, infra people would run it. We have two questions: 1) Is this a good use for cucumber? Do community people encourage this use of cucumber feature definitions? 2) We have some captchas in our applications. Is there an widely adopted solution for this common problem?
