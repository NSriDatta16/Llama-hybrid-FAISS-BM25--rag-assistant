Invoking a POST to an external site with C# (httpwebrequest)

This is driving me nuts and I can't figure out where I am dropping the ball. I've followed a few examples found via the googlemonsta to no avail. Any pointer to where I goofed would be greatly apperciated. var writer = new StringWriter(); param = "location=" + Server.UrlEncode(param); byte[] paramStream = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(param + "&param2=value"); var URL = "http://www.somesite.com"; HttpWebRequest request = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create(URL); request.Method = "POST"; request.ContentType = "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"; request.UserAgent = "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; sv-SE; rv:1.9.1b2) Gecko/20081201 Firefox/3.1b2"; request.ContentLength = paramStream.Length; using( var stream = request.GetRequestStream()) { stream.Write(paramStream, 0, paramStream.Length); } var response = request.GetResponse(); string result; using (var sr = new StreamReader(response.GetResponseStream())) { result = sr.ReadToEnd(); } Thanks! EDIT: As far as I can tell its hitting the site (i'm getting html back) but the params aren't pushed over. I'm basically getting where the values would appear had it been successful. I've tried removing the first & but didnt get anywhere. EDIT: Edited code to reflect changes.
