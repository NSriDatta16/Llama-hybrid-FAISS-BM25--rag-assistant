"Specified argument was out of the range of valid values."on Postback's process using Infragistics WebDialogWindow

I've got realy weird problem on a web page when processing a post back. Here is the error will fallow an explication : Error : Specified argument was out of the range of valid values. Parameter name: value Description: An unhandled exception occurred during the execution of the current web request. Please review the stack trace for more information about the error and where it originated in the code. Exception Details: System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException: Specified argument was out of the range of valid values. Parameter name: value Source Error: An unhandled exception was generated during the execution of the current web request. Information regarding the origin and location of the exception can be identified using the exception stack trace below. Stack Trace: [ArgumentOutOfRangeException: Specified argument was out of the range of valid values. Parameter name: value] System.Web.UI.WebControls.Unit..ctor(String value, CultureInfo culture, UnitType defaultType) +8670188 System.Web.UI.WebControls.Unit.Parse(String s, CultureInfo culture) +31 Infragistics.Web.UI.Framework.ControlObject.ConvertToUnit(Object obj, Unit def, Boolean allowNegative) +399 Infragistics.Web.UI.LayoutControls.WebDialogWindow.get_Top() +74 Infragistics.Web.UI.LayoutControls.DialogWindowBot.LoadClientPropsTransactionList(Dictionary`2 list) +350 Infragistics.Web.UI.Framework.ObjectBase.LoadTransactionList(Boolean deferLoadPostDataProcessing) +57 Infragistics.Web.UI.Framework.RunBot.LoadClientData() +57 Infragistics.Web.UI.Framework.RunBot.HandleLoadPostData(String postDataKey, NameValueCollection postCollection) +14 Infragistics.Web.UI.Framework.ControlMain.LoadPostData(String postDataKey, NameValueCollection postCollection) +19 System.Web.UI.Page.ProcessPostData(NameValueCollection postData, Boolean fBeforeLoad) +693 System.Web.UI.Page.ProcessRequestMain(Boolean includeStagesBeforeAsyncPoint, Boolean includeStagesAfterAsyncPoint) +1743 Explication If you look at the stacktrace, we easly see that .NET still aint pass throught my code so i can't put any breakpoint. Something more strange is that for EXACTLY the same process but with differents data (on my page), it works preaty fine. Please help me, im on it for about 3 hours! UPDATE I've got to say that, when it fails (for now only 2 objects on somethings like 30 tested), it fails ONLY on a Postback. It become on page that using : Infragistics webdialogwindow and a webcontrol to handles the "visible" like property (Hidden or normal not the size). But as someone said below (sorry don't remember your name), it's for sure regarding to the webdialogwindow but i just DON'T handle the position of it ... UPDATE 2 We've tried to removed a varchar(max) column's value from database and now it's workin'!! Wow, we don't know what to think because everyting looks to be ok.The problem is that we MUST keep this column's value!!! Anyone know what to think about that? This varchar(max) is shown as a Eval("DescriptionMemo") on a datalist.
