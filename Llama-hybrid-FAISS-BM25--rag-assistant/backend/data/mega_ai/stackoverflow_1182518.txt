The former method is a relative URL that locates resources relative to the server’s root. The latter is an absolute URL that indicates not just the directory, but the host, subdomain, even protocol. They each have their pros and cons. Using a relative path makes it easier to migrate to a new domain since the domain name is not part of the URL. Using an absolute path makes it easier to organize your files since you don’t have to use things like ../../images/ (which can makes things messy and difficult to read). As for performance, the only issue is that the absolute URLs are a slightly longer (though not always ), otherwise no.
