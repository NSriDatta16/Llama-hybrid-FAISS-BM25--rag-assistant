If you need no external access, you are presumably able to modify the database design so that you don't need the update at all. Can you explain more about what the update is doing? As depesz said, you could use either cron or pgAgent, but they are only able to go down to a one minute granularity, not 15 seconds. Considering sleeping inside the stored procedure until the next iteration is not a good idea, because you will have an open transaction for all that time which is a really bad idea.
