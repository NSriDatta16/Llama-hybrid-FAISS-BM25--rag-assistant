Apparently this IS possible with newer versions. See their How To Dissect Anything wiki entry. Basically, in the pcap header you set the network linktype DLT to USER DLT #147 decimal. Pcap files are simple to create . Then in wireshark Edit->Preferences->Protocols->DLT_USER->Edit Encapsulations Table , fill in the GUI dialog. And voila! it parses raw packets. UPDATE : This doesn't support some protocols (like DNS). But you can possibly append fake headers using text2pcap (development version as of Dec-2010).
