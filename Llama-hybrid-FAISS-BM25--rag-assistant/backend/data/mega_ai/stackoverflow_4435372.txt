While I wouldn't recommend doing it you can set the content-length to an estimate of what the content is, and you will get a progress bar. As long as you can guarantee that your estimate is equal to or greater than the actual content this will generally work. If your actual content is greater than the estimate than the content will be truncated to the specified content-length. I tested this in Firefox, IE, and Chrome without issue. The HTTP spec states that users agents MUST notify the user if the specified length doesn't match the actual length, but I have not observed this behavior with any browser I've tested. I investigated this as an option but abandoned it due to the potential unforeseen conflicts for playing outside the bounds of the specification.
