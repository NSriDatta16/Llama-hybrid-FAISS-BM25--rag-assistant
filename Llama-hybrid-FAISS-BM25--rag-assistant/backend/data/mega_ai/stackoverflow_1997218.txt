XPATH 1.0 does not provide the ability to sort a collection. You will need to leverage XPATH with something else. Here is an example XSLT solution that will find all elements that contain descendant elements, and then sorts them by the count of their descendant elements in descending order. , then select //a[descendant::img] --> has descendant images I wasn't clear from your question and examples whether you want to find any element with descendant or just with descendant . If you wanted to just find elements with descendant elements, then adjust the XPATH in the for-each to select: //a[descendant::img]
