Single page Rails app

I'm writing a 4chan-like imageboard in Rails. It's my first Rails app after going through Michael Hartl's Rails tutorial, and I'm not sure how to organize my controllers. I have a controller for posts, and a controller for pages. Is this how you would organize it? Do I even need a pages controller if I just want everything to happen on one page?
