loading shared classes in application javaee5

I am trying to load some classes that are common to all the web applications of my ear in a java ee 5 application. I tried to do this by putting the classes (not jar) in a) directory called "lib" b) also specifying in application.xml's lib/common.jar and was not successful by either option a or b but when I jarred the classes into common.jar, I was able to load the classes by method b) Do both these method need the classes to be jarred ? what is the difference between providing the classes via the above 2 methods ? why does it seem like there are two ways to specify loading common classes ?
