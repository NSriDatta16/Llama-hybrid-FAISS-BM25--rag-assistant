You could create a convenience view such as this: CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW ALL_SURESH_TABLES AS SELECT table_name, to_date(regexp_replace(table_name, 'SURESH_([[:digit:]]+)', '\1'), 'YYYYMMDD') AS table_date FROM ALL_TABLES WHERE regexp_like(table_name, 'SURESH_[[:digit:]]+') And then query it like this: SELECT MAX(table_name) KEEP (DENSE_RANK LAST ORDER BY table_date) FROM ALL_SURESH_TABLES WHERE TRUNC(table_date, 'mm') = TRUNC(SYSDATE, 'mm') (I didn't verify the second query, but it should be straight forward once the ALL_SURESH_TABLES view is created) Edit : In light of your comment regarding the "ORA-01830" error, I am led to believe that you have at least one table whose name starts with SURESH_ , ends with digits, but those digits don't form a valid date. For example, this causes the same error to occur: /* Notice the "date" has nine digits instead of eight */ SELECT to_date('201012088', 'YYYYMMDD') FROM DUAL Therefore, I recommend you change this: regexp_replace(table_name, 'SURESH_([[:digit:]]+)', '\1') into this: regexp_replace(table_name, 'SURESH_([[:digit:]]{8}).*', '\1') The modified regular expression will only pay attention to the first eight digits after " SURESH_ ".
