The jQuery object will take HTML and make it in to a DOM structure for further query, you can pass it in directly to create the object, or use it as a context if you just wish to query it. Edit: For some reason it seems necessary to wrap it in a DIV, if not already within one in this example. See the jQuery object documentation on this method for further information. See test framework for system at: http://jsfiddle.net/hUMqU/ var ht = " Paragraph Here "; $(' ' + ht + ' ').find('p').text(); or as context: var ht = " Paragraph Here "; $('p', ' ' + ht + ' ').text();
