Generate lags R

I hope this is basic; just need a nudge in the right direction. I have read in a database table from MS Access into a data frame using RODBC. Here is a basic structure of what I read in: PRODID PROD Year Week QTY SALES INVOICE Here is the structure: str(data) 'data.frame': 8270 obs. of 7 variables: $ PRODID : int 20001 20001 20001 100001 100001 100001 100001 100001 100001 100001 ... $ PROD : Factor w/ 1239 levels "1% 20qt Box",..: 335 335 335 128 128 128 128 128 128 128 ... $ Year : int 2010 2010 2010 2009 2009 2009 2009 2009 2009 2010 ... $ Week : int 12 18 19 14 15 16 17 18 19 9 ... $ QTY : num 1 1 0 135 300 270 300 270 315 315 ... $ SALES : num 15.5 0 -13.9 243 540 ... $ INVOICES: num 1 1 2 5 11 11 10 11 11 12 ... Here are the top few rows: head(data, n=10) PRODID PROD Year Week QTY SALES INVOICES 1 20001 Dolie 12" 2010 12 1 15.46 1 2 20001 Dolie 12" 2010 18 1 0.00 1 3 20001 Dolie 12" 2010 19 0 -13.88 2 4 100001 Cage Free Eggs 2009 14 135 243.00 5 5 100001 Cage Free Eggs 2009 15 300 540.00 11 6 100001 Cage Free Eggs 2009 16 270 486.00 11 7 100001 Cage Free Eggs 2009 17 300 540.00 10 8 100001 Cage Free Eggs 2009 18 270 486.00 11 9 100001 Cage Free Eggs 2009 19 315 567.00 11 10 100001 Cage Free Eggs 2010 9 315 569.25 12 I simply want to generate lags for QTY, SALES, INVOICE for each product but I am not sure where to start. I know R is great with Time Series, but I am not sure where to start. I have two questions: I have the raw invoice data but have aggregated it for reporting purposes. Would it be easier if I didn't aggregate the data? Regardless of aggregation or not, what functions will I need to loop over each product and generate the lags as I need them? In short, I want to loop over a set of records, calculate lags for a product (if possible), append the lags (as they apply) to the current record for each product, and write the results back to a table in my database for my reporting software to use.
