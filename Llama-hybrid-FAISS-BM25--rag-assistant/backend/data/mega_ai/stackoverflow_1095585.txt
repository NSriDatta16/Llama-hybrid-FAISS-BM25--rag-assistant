There's lots of good answers here, some things that haven't been mentioned is to have diagnostic code running in order to: Log HAL events (interrupts, bus messages, etc) Have code to keep track of your resources, (all active semaphores, thread activity) Have a capture ram mechanism to copy the heap and memory content to persistent storage (hard disk or equivalent) to detect and debug deadlocks, livelocks, memory leaks, buffer overflows, etc.
