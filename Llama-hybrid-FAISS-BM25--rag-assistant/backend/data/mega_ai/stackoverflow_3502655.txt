Using cron or similar scheduler involves polling , which works but is brute force and ignorance . I can't recommend it: there's a time delay between when the row changes and when cron executes the checking program; repeated checking is a waste of resources. The elegant solution is database trigger, see Using Triggers and Can triggers call an external application through a UDF? . You will get an event whenever your table row is on fire or something, and your email sending program is called immediately. If you want to use Perl, Email::Simple / Email::Sender is nifty.
