Used carefully and wisely, it can lead to elegant code, but usually, it just leads to confusing code. I say that it should be banned, unless you happen to know that it presents a very elegant opportunity for a particular design task, but you need to clearly know why it applies well to the situation, and why alternatives do not work elegantly for the situation. Eg, one good application of method swizzling is isa swizzling, which is how ObjC implements Key Value Observing. A bad example might be relying on method swizzling as a means of extending your classes, which leads to extremely high coupling.
