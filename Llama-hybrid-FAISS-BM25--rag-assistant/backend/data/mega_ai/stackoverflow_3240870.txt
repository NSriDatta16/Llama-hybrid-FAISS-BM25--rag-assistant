Preferences > Java > Editor > Save Actions . One of the "additional actions" is "Sort members". It'll reorganize the class members (like privates fields being grouped) after each save. Might also want to look into the Java > Code Style > Formatter to see if it helps. Edit : If you're not going to edit the files and still want to Sort Members, you can do it via the Project Explorer context menu under Source > Sort Members... . Every time I've used generated code, I had to massage it a bit anyway and assumed you would too. My bad.
