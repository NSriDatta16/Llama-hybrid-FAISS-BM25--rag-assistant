What's the most abused features in Visual Studio / C#?

For me, No.1 has to be code folding. #region xxx #endregion All of sudden, people find an excuse to have big classes(files) because they can "organize" them nicely. I once saw a half-page-long class with 3,000 lines. I was speechless and they were like "what's the problem"? No.2 is partial class. It's actually a nice feature especially when you work with generated code. However, some people use it to "break down" a class to multiple pieces. Why? Because that class is so big and popular that it's always locked in the source control. Instead of breaking down the class into different smaller classes, they create multiple files like my_Class1.cs, your_Class1.cs etc so that people can work on Class1 at the same time. I would like to include "Copy&Paste" but it's not Visual Studio's fault...
