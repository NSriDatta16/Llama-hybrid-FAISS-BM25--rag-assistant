Confusing implementation of F# CodeDom

I'm trying to create a class and a method in it. For C# and VB, the CodeDom providers emit preditable output, but the F# CodeDom provider emits the following. I'm wondering why. exception ReturnException8abef2fbb2404165b4b8690157bd3a49 of obj exception ReturnNoneException8abef2fbb2404165b4b8690157bd3a49 type // Hello test = class new() as this = { } abstract my_method : unit -> unit default this.my_method () = () end Ignoring the exception stuff (I guess the provider is still a bit buggy), I'm curious as to why I get such a weird definition with new() as this , an abstract method and a default implementation. Am I missing something here?
