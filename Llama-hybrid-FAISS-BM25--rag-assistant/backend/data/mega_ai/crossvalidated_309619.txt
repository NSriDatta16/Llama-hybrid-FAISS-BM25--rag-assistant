The samples $\mathbf{x}_i$ for which you find that $\alpha_i\neq 0$ are your support vectors. In a separable problem and hard-margin SVM, these are simply the vectors that hit the margin on either side of the hyperplane. In soft-margin SVM, you additionally get non-zero $\alpha$'s for vectors that are on the wrong side of the margin or even the wrong side of the hyperplane. Generally, the number of non-zero $\alpha$'s increases when you decrease cost parameter $C$ because your margin gets bigger and you allow for more violations, see What is the influence of C in SVMs with linear kernel? your data is not well separated because there's no way to separate the classes without violating the margin
