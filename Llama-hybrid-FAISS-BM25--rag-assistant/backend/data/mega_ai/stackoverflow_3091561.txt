How do I orderly generate controls underneath eachother?

I have a class which generates a form and controls. The controls vary between buttons, radio controls, check boxes and labels. The idea is to neatly create the form with a label above each control. The problem is that I cannot seem to find the formula or way to neatly organise/space them. It works fine when I have just text boxes, but I'm not sure how to handle larger controls, like check box lists. Here's an example of how I handle text boxes: case "Text": TextBox tbx = new TextBox(); tbx.Name = df.Value.Name; tbx.Text = (df.Value.DefValue != null) ? df.Value.DefValue : ""; tbx.Location = new Point(lbl.Location.X, lbl.Location.Y + 20); f.Controls.Add(tbx); break; Mind that this is all in a foreach loop. This is the part that precedes it (label): if (i == 0) { lbl.Location = new Point(10, 10); } else { lbl.Location = new Point(10, (i * 50) + 10); } This neatly sorts the text boxes and labels out with an even spacing. Can anyone offer me some advice on how to handle different controls? I want to place them underneath eachother but keep at least 10 pixels spacing from the bottom of each control to the top of the next label. Thank you in advance.
