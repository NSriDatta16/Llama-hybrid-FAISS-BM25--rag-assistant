iOS 4.2 camera and album problem

for some reason the same code I used to access the camera and photo album that used to work with previous iOS is not working. Whenever I open the camera application or the photo album the app crashes, and nothing appears on the crash log. I tested it for iOS 3.0 to 4.1 and it worked fine. Did this happen to anyone? is it a bug? It doesn't even get to the imagePickerController method, it crashes as soon as it loads the camera or album. The code I use is this: #pragma mark Photo methods - (void) getNewPhoto { UIImagePickerController * picker = [[UIImagePickerController alloc] init]; picker.delegate = self; picker.sourceType = UIImagePickerControllerSourceTypeCamera; [self presentModalViewController:picker animated:YES]; } - (void)loadPhotoFromLibrary { UIImagePickerController * picker = [[UIImagePickerController alloc] init]; picker.delegate = self; picker.sourceType = UIImagePickerControllerSourceTypeSavedPhotosAlbum; [self presentModalViewController:picker animated:YES]; } #pragma mark ImagePickerController methods - (void)imagePickerController:(UIImagePickerController *)picker didFinishPickingMediaWithInfo:(NSDictionary *)info { [picker dismissModalViewControllerAnimated:NO]; selectedImage = [info objectForKey:@"UIImagePickerControllerOriginalImage"]; } Thanks!
