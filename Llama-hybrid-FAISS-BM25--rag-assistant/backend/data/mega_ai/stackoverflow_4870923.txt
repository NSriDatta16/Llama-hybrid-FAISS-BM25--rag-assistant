I've found this to be an occasional necessary evil when your ORM is following the Active Row pattern. The problem I always run into is that a model only represents a single instance of the data structure. It makes no sense to add collection retrieval methods into the model. This is where I have historically used a service layer to handle pulling in collections of models. Although to be honest lately I've simply wrote a controller helper object that just abstracts my table object.
