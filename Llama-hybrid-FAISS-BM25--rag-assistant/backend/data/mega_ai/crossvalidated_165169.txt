This is a very frequent happening. The series data shows spikes due to the difference in the number of days. So, there is a technique called Calender Adjustment , where instead of plotting the net value against the time, the average value per time stamp is considered. Example: Average value per month. So, when the time series is adjusted accordingly (by considering the average value per time stamp; instead of the net overall value), the problem of complexity is solved. And on your question about: Do we even need to worry about this when forecasting using a time series model or does the model account for this? As you can see that this difference in the number of days per month increases the complexity of the series, so by the calender adjustment technique, one can simplify the model without losing on the features and details of the data. So, now we take into account the number of days , and do not need to consider the number of business days in a month and also do not need to worry about this when forecasting using a time series model . So, that would smoothen the plot and effectively remove the variation due to the different month lengths; thus making the pattern simpler. This is excellently explained here . The R code: library("fpp") monthdays
