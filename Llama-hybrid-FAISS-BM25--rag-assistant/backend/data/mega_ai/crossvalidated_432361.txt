The two formulas are for different loss functions, one of which is generally much better than the other when performing logistic regression. The first formula is used for calculating the output node deltas when using binary cross entropy loss and a sigmoid activation function for the output nodes. This is the formula I would use for logistic regression, and it also happens to be the formula for linear regression despite a different derivation. The second formula is a more general expression for using mean squared error loss when you have an activation function for your output node. In the case of linear regression, f′(h) = 1, because there is no activation function (it's the identity function), so you're left with the first formula. In the case of logistic regression, f′(h) = f(h) * (1 - f(h)). I would not recommend using mean squared error loss for logistic regression, as it's very slow. Binary cross entropy is a much better loss function to use with logistic regression.
