From CSS 2.1, ยง 16.6.1 The 'white-space' processing model : All tabs (U+0009) are rendered as a horizontal shift that lines up the start edge of the next glyph with the next tab stop. Tab stops occur at points that are multiples of 8 times the width of a space (U+0020) rendered in the block's font from the block's starting content edge. CSS3 Text says basically the same thing. From HTML 4.01 ยง 9.3.4 Preformatted text: The PRE element The horizontal tab character (decimal 9 in [ISO10646] and [ISO88591] ) is usually interpreted by visual user agents as the smallest non-zero number of spaces necessary to line characters up along tab stops that are every 8 characters. We strongly discourage using horizontal tabs in preformatted text since it is common practice, when editing, to set the tab-spacing to other values, leading to misaligned documents. If you're concerned with leading tabs, it's a simple matter to replace them with spaces. /* repeat implemented using Russian Peasant multiplication */ String.prototype.repeat = function (n) { if (n >=1) { if (1&n) accum += c; c += c; } return accum; } String.prototype.untabify = function(tabWidth) { tabWidth = tabWidth || 4; return this.replace(/^\t+/gm, function(tabs) { return ' '.repeat(tabWidth * tabs.length)} ); }
