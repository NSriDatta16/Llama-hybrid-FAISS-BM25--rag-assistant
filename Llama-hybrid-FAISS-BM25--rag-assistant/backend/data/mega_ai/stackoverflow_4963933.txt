Eclipse build.xml Ant Tab Has "Reference not Found" Error; Runs Fine

In my build.xml, Eclipse indicates there is an error, but running the Ant task in Eclipse or from the command line works fine. The error is: "Reference cobertura.classpath not found." for the code: If I change the code to following, the error goes away: Why can't Eclipse correctly parse the first code snippit?
