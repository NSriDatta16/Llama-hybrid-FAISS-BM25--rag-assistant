It depends on which binding you're using to get NSPopupButton's selected value. If you're binding to "Selected Value", you'll get a NSString. If you're binding to "Selected Object", you'll get the object represented by the selection, which in your case would be an NSNumber. Otherwise, you would add a NSValueTransformer to your binding to transform the selected value into the object you're expecting.
