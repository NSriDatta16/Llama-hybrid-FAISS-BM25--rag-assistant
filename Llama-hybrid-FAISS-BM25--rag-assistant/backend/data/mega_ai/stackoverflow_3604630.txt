How do I replace an event handler with jQuery?

I have a site that uses AJAX to navigate. I have two pages that I use a click and drag feature using: $(".myDragArea").mousedown(function(){ do stuff... mouseDrag = true; // mouseDrag is global. }); $("body").mousemove(function(){ if (mouseDrag) { do stuff... } }); $("body").mouseup(function(){ if (mouseDrag) { do stuff... mouseDrag = false; } }); I just type that out, so excuse any incidental syntax errors. Two parts of the site use almost identical code, with the only difference being what is inside the $("body").mouseup() function. However, if I access the first part, then navigate to the second part, the code that runs on mouseup doesn't change. I have stepped through the code with Firebug, and no errors or thrown when $("body").mouseup() is run when the second part loads. So, why doesn't the event handler change when I run $("body").mouseup() the second time?
