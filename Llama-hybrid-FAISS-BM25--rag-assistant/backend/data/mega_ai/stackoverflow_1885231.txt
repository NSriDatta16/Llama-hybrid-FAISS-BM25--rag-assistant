I don't believe there is any explicit documentation on this, because nothing directly in the Win32 API that supports that. You can use SetParent or SetWindowLongPtr with GWLP_HWNDPARENT to change to window's parent and owner respectively and you are free to any window message you like to another processes window with SendMessage(). If you want to move any data between two difference processes you are looking at Inter-process Communication (IPC), which Windows has several ways to do.
