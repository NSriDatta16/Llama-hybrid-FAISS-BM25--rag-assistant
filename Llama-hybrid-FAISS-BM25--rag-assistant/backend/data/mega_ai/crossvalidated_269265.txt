What is an analytical expression for so called value function $V^{\pi}$ in reinforcement learning?

One thing that struck me as odd when going through literature on reinforcement learning is how "theoretical" everything is. I expected the results in this field to be things that you can immediately punch into Python or MATLAB and get your hands dirty, but I am seeing most things in reinforcement learning is not expressed are an analytical fashion (and poorly defined - but maybe I am early on in the book). For instance, this so called value function https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~sutton/book/ebook/node34.html But what is $E_\pi$ ? I cannot punch $E_\pi$ into MATLAB, it is not a function that I am familiar with, so I must get rid of it immediately to arrive at an analytical expression that I can evaluate. If $\pi(s,a)$ is a probability distribution as I suspect it is, then using the expression of an expectation for a discrete random value, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value , $V^\pi(s)$ should be expressed as: $$V^\pi(s) = \sum\limits_{a = 1}^n \pi(s,a)\left(\sum\limits_{k =0}^\infty \gamma^k r_{t+k+1}\right)$$ Can someone check if I have the expression for the value function at state $s$ correctly?
