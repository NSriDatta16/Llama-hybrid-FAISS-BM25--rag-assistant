Which probabilities to rely on?

In a hypothetical situation, you are trying to determine whether your landlord is a fraud. You know that 1% of landlords are frauds. But then, you also find out that your landlord is a gambler and 20% of gamblers are frauds. a) Which probability do you rely on to determine whether your landlord is a fraud? b) Let's say I give a new information that 5% of landlords are gamblers, would your answer change? What would the probability that your landlord is a fraud be? A random scenario that I think of. Hopefully someone can help me understand the statistics behind it. For part (a), intuitively, you would want to say that the probability is 20% as it is a higher number and you want to be conservative in your estimation. But then, you can rethink the scenario as 99% of landlords are non-frauds and 80% of gamblers are non-frauds. If you go with the higher number, then you rely on the 99% non-fraud or 1% fraud. For part (b), I wonder that if you introduce a new information such as 5% of landlords are gamblers, would there be some kind of Bayesian probability that would put the fraud probability somewhere between 1% and 20%.
