How can i prove PCA is a better model than FA?

I am running some factor and PCA analyses, and it is clear that PCA (atleast visually) for my kind of data is working alot better. How can i provide evidence that PCA is the right model, outside of seeing that the variables grouped for each component are near perfect, compared to the factor analysis which is not.
