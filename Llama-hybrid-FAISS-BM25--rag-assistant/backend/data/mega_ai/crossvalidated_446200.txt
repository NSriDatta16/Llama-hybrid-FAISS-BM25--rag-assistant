I think you are confusing the terms slightly. In the Bayesian framework, $ \theta $ is a random variable and hence, like all random variables, it is following a probability distribution (unlike the frequentist framework where $ \theta $ is constant). "Random distribution" is not something valid exactly. Thus, before you gather the data, $ \theta $ is following the prior distribution and the posterior after you combine it with information (likelihood) from data. It always remains a random variable and it never changes.
