If you sample 100 dentists from the 500 in town, & observe $x$ who give privately-insured patients earlier appointments, $X$ is distributed according to the hypergeometric distribution $$\Pr(X=x)=\frac{\binom{\nu}{x}\binom{500-\nu}{100-x}}{\binom{500}{100}}$$ where $\nu$ is the number of dentists in town who give privately-insured patients earlier appointments. The usual exact $\alpha$ confidence interval for $\nu$ is given by $$\left\{\nu : \min\left[\Pr\nolimits_{\nu}(X \leq x), \Pr\nolimits_{\nu}(X\geq x)\right] > \frac{\alpha}{2}\right\}$$ though Blaker (2000), "Confidence curves and improved exact confidence intervals for discrete distributions" The Canadian Journal of Statistics , 28 , 4 shows how Spjøtvoll's notion of acceptability can be used to give often shorter intervals with the correct coverage & sensible nesting properties. A couple of oddities in your analysis: The waiting time difference between appointments could be considered as a continuous variable—why discretize it & lose information? You're considering this as a sample from the finite number of dentists, whereas it might be more natural to consider it as a sample from the infinite number of potential bookings; no individual dentist is likely to be completely consistent in his scheduling practices.
