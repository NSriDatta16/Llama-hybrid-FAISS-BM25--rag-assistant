Building a code asset library

I have been thinking about setting up some sort of library for all our internally developed software at my organisation. I would like collect any ideas the good SO folk may have on this topic. I figure, what is the point in instilling into developers the benefits of writing reusable code, if on the next project the first thing developers do is file -> new due to a lack of knowledge of what code is already out there to be reused. As an added benefit, I think that just by having a library like this would encourage developers to think more in terms of reusability when writing code I would like to keep this library as simple as possible, perhaps my only two requirements being: Search facility Usable for many types of components: assemblies, web services, etc I see the basic information required on each asset/component to be: Name & version Description / purpose Dependencies Would you record any more information? What would be the best platform for this i.e., wiki, forum, etc? What would make a software library like this successful vs unsuccessful? All ideas are greatly appreciated. Thanks Edit: Found these similar questions after posting: How do you ensure code is reused correctly? How do you foster the use of shared components in your organization?
