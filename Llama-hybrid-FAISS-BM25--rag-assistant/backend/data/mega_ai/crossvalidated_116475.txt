Why do I get the error message "Error: grouping factors must have > 1 sampled level" when I do a glmer?

My model is: model1 where I am relating average egg mass (continous variable) to a four group treatment (set to factor) and three categories of altitude (also set to factor). It doesn't seem to work and I get this error message Error: grouping factors must have > 1 sampled level .
