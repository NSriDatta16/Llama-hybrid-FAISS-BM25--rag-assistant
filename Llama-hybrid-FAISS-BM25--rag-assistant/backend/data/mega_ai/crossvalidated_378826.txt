auto.arima() fits a regression on your Fourier terms and models residuals using ARIMA . In your case, the residuals are modeled as ARIMA(1,1,2). This is not a "flat line" forecast, and if you look closely, you will see that the fits do not repeat exactly. It just appears this way, because the intra-weekly seasonality is by far the strongest signal. Unless you have a good reason to expect something different (e.g., calendar events, or intra-yearly seasonality), this is probably a pretty good model. You may want to look at models for multiple-seasonalities . If you are concerned that the forecast does not reproduce the variability in your historical data: don't be. Forecasting models attempt to disentangle the signal from the noise and only extrapolate the signal, because the noise is - by definition - not forecastable. Therefore, any forecast will look smoother than the original time series.
