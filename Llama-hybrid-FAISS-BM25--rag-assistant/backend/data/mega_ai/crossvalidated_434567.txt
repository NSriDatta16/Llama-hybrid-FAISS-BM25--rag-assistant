How can i normalize the input data to neural network

I've got a question. I thought about it so much, but cant get an idea how can I do that. I want to create neural network in Encog framework. The neural network is about shopping. I have a database with shopping lists with products. All users have their private lists. I need to create a neural network that will generate new list based on lists in db. For example based on lists from 2 months. But in Encog to input i have to send array of dobules. I read about normalization in documentation and was trying to search some ideas in internet but found nothing. How can i "convert" the products to double? I mean to use it in neural network. Many ppl just uses the Equation that will calculate the value between 0 to 1 or -1 to 0. But in my example, it's hard. Thanks for help!
