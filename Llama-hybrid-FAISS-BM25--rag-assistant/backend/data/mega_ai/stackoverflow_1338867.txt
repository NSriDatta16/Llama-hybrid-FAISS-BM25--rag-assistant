As @Pax mentioned, static variables are visible to all threads. There's no C++ data construct associated with a particular thread. However, on Windows you can use the TlsAlloc API to allocate index for a thread-specific data and put that index in a static variable. Each thread has its own slot which you can access using this index and the TlsGetValue and TlsSetValue. For more information, read about Using Thread Local Storage on MSDN. Update : There's no way to make globals in a preexisting library be thread-specific. Any solutions would require you to modify the code as well to be aware that the data has thread affinity.
