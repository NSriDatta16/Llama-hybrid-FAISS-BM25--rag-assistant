You can hide parts of a class using the so-called "cheshire cat", "letter/envelope", or "pimpl" technique (which are, all, different names for the same technique): class MainWindow { private: //opaque data class ImplementationDetails; ImplementationDetails* m_data; public: ... declare your public methods here ... } The best way is probably the abstract class mentioned in your 2nd paragraph (however I failed to understand your last sentence, in which you (tried/failed to) explain what your counter-argument to that is).
