While ELMo was trained on English data, it does not know whether the data you give it as input is English or not. The input of ELMo is received at character-level. It may happen that the 1B Word data had hindi characters intermixed, case in which your characters would be encoded as they are or, most probably, your characters are encoded as unknown characters (just like the unknown token for word-level NLP but for characters). ELMo is just a bunch of mathematical operations, so it takes whatever it receives and computes its operations on it, first, taking the character embedding with the characters you pass to it, then with a char-CNN followed by two highway layers and finally a bidirectional LSTM.
