Is there any reason you are reading the file into a string first instead of using a file stream directly? Instead of String xml = FileUtils.readFileToString(new File(sampleXmlPath)); transformer.transform(new StreamSource(new StringReader(xml)), new StreamResult(extractionWriter)); You could try transformer.transform(new StreamSource(new FileReader(sampleXmlPath)), new StreamResult(extractionWriter)); This may not be the cause of the problem, but I've seen it cause similar problems before. If your FileUtils.readFileToString is the Commons.IO version, it's reading the string in as UFT-16 (the Java default, IIRC) instead of what you want, which is UTF-8.
