Weighted samples in Tensorflow for convolutional neural networks

For my binary classification problem (A vs B), each image in either class has its individual weight. This means, for example, if I have 10000 images for A, not all of the images are equally important. Weight of "0.9" would mean it is very important, and a weight of "0.01" means that it is not that important. Can this information be communicated to the training in Tensorflow? Thanks for the help.
