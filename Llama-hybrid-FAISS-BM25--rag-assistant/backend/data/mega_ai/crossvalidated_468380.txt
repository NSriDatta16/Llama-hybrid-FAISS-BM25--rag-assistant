How to choose what feature vector to plot in multivariate regression analysis?

I'm new to the field of machine learning and I have been having this doubt for a long time now. If we want to plot a scatter plot, we plot it as, x as a function of y where x is a 1-D array. But in the case of multivariate regression, we have so many choices to plot X from, how does one choose which feature vector is to be plotted in the scatter plot? As for why I want to plot it, it's to visually confirm that my model fits the data. Thank you in advance!!! have a good day :D
