how to group objects in reportlab, so that they stay together across new pages

I'm generating some pdf files using reportlab. I have a certain section that is repeated. It contains of a header and a table: Story.append(Paragraph(header_string, styleH)) Story.append(table) How can I group the paragraph with the table (in latex I would put them into the same environment) so that in case of a page brake, the paragraph and table stay together? Currently the paragraph sometimes floats at the end of one page and the table starts on top of the next page.
