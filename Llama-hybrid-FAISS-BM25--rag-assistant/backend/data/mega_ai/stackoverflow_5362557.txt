Well I won't recommend you making it from scratch. Instead you can use the jquery plugins available freely :). Some of them I recommend are 1) Full Calendar FullCalendar is a famous jQuery calendar plugin which offers features like drag-and-drop, integration with Google Calendar and able to fetch events through JSON. Designers can easily customize the look and feel of the calendar, while developers can utilize the exposed hooks for user-triggered events. Website: http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/ 2) jQuery Interactive Date Range Picker This powerful date range picker is a modified version of jQuery UIâ€™s Datepicker component. It has a quicker date selection from a list of preset dates/ranges and a smooth transitions. The latest version uses the jQuery UI 1.7 and jQuery UI CSS Framework. With the power of jQuery UI, user can now switch the calendar theme easily.
