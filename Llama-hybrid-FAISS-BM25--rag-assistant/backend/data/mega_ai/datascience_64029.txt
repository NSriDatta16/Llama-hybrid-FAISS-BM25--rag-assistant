Chunking Sentences with Spacy

I have a lot of sentences (500k) which looks like this: "Penalty missed! Bad penalty by Felipe Brisola - Riga FC - shot with right foot is very close to the goal. Felipe Brisola should be disappointed." "Penalty saved! Damir Kojasevic - Sutjeska Niksic - fails to capitalise on this great opportunity, shot with right foot saved in the centre of the goal." "Penalty saved! Stefan Panic - Riga FC - fails to capitalise on this great opportunity, shot with right foot saved in the centre of the goal." "Penalty saved! Georgie Kelly - Dundalk - fails to capitalise on this great opportunity, shot with right foot saved in the centre of the goal." "Penalty missed! Still FC KÃ¸benhavn 1, Crvena Zvezda 1. Marko Marin - Crvena Zvezda - hits the bar with a shot with right foot." As you see, they are not really robotic, and after ending up writing 1500 lines of php code (with regex) and still being inconsistent, I decided to see my alternatives with machine learning. What I am trying to achieve is: For example this one: "Penalty saved! Stefan Panic - Riga FC - fails to capitalise on this great opportunity, shot with right foot saved in the centre of the goal." type => penalty action => saved reason => shot with right foot saved in the centre of the goal person => Stefan Panic I stumbled upon spaCy and saw "Named Entity Recognition" and thought maybe I can use it for this purpose. Especially as I have huge training data. I wanted to ask: Is spaCy's Named Entity Recognition is right for this task? If not, what should I try to learn for this task? P.S: I know a little about python but nothing about ML
