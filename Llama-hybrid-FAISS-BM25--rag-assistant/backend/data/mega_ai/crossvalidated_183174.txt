The short answer is yes you can. Here is a minimal working example of a logistic regression with one binary predictor variable. set.seed(4) ###Creat some psuedo data n = 100 x = rbinom(n,1,0.5) y = x y[sample(1:n,10,replace=FALSE)] = 1 y[sample(1:n,10,replace=FALSE)] = 0 model = glm(y~x,family="binomial") and so y is my binary output, and x is my binary predictor variable. The code runs with no error (so clearly you can include a binary predictor variable) and the example output from running this code would be: > model Call: glm(formula = y ~ x, family = "binomial") Coefficients: (Intercept) x -3.02 5.16 Degrees of Freedom: 99 Total (i.e. Null); 98 Residual Null Deviance: 138.3 Residual Deviance: 54.54 AIC: 58.54
