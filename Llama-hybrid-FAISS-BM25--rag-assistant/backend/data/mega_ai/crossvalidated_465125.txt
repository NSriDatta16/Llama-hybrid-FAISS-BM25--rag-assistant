I have exactly the same problem as you did and I just figured it out. There is one sentence in the paragraph between equation (14) and equation (15) in that paper: "The Newton algorithm for maximizing the (unpenalized) log-likelihood (14) amounts to iteratively reweighted least squares." And that's the key point. (14) and (15) are not strictly equal, but maximizing (14) is equivalent to maximizing (15). Moreover, minimizing the Lp norm for the linear regression problem by the Newton algorithm is the same as the IRLS algorithm involves solving the weighted linear least squares problem. Two resources: http://hua-zhou.github.io/teaching/biostatm280-2019spring/slides/21-newton/newton.html#GLM https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iteratively_reweighted_least_squares#cite_note-4 Hope it helps.
