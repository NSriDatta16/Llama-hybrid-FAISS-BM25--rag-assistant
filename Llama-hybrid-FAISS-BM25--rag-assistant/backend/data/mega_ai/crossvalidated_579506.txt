if you talk about regression analysis -> I suppose your AIM is to find out the predictors of your DV - for 2 conditions... But in order just to compare means between 2 independent unpaired samples (relative 2 conditions in your case), t-test is enough... see details of stat method choice here ... Concerning regression: I'd better do OLS regression not, but Partial Least Squares (as alternative to ANOVA ) for your explorative univariate multivariable analysis - as it is applied based on the correlation - e.g. python here ... -- to see what IVs influence most on DV under certain Conditions (taken either as random effect or covariates - could be tested both models for choosing worth while)... Or, perhaps, you have another aim of your data analysis? PLS could be applied for different purposes & with different selection methods... though any kind of LDA (as supervised as well as PLS) or factor analysis with rotation could also be used for dimensionality reduction in any case everything depends on the NATURE of your variables - IVs & DV (categorical or numerical) - e.g. PLS-DA is used for categorical output So, your question can be classified as "it depends" & besides I would really recommend to reduce the dimensionality before taking care about betas in different conditions where different predictors can become leading, at all
