This probably will not answer your question directly, but besides what the other answers suggest, I would recommend to look into non-recursive make techniques. That is truly an elegant way to parallelize build, although, depending on what are the existing Makefiles, can require significant effort. Non-recursive make has advantages not limited to easy parallelization: it sees a complete dependency graph and so it does not need to build too little or too much, meaning faster (sometimes much faster) build times. Some resources: Discussion on SO The classic text about trouble with recursive make Design of non-recursive makefile Implementation Another implementation Benchmarks (quite outdated though)
