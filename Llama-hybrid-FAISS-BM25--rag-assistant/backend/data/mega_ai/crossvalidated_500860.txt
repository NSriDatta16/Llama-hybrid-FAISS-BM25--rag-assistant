High Validation F1 score but low testing F1 score

I am working on a dataset related to an insurance company and the objective is to predict if the insurance buyer will claim their travel insurance or not. Training data: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dphi-official/Datasets/master/travel_insurance/Training_set_label.csv Testing data: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dphi-official/Datasets/master/travel_insurance/Testing_set_label.csv I have written the below code so far: When I submit the predictions on the website (it's similar to Kaggle), I get F1 score of 2.8850777368167977 while the 5 fold cross validation F1 score is around 74%. I read that in severely imbalanced datasets, there is not much smote can do if the variation within the minority classes is a lot. ( Source ) However, there are some entries on the website with F1 score of 12-15. Any suggestions on how can I improve the F1 score? #We will fill the missing values in Gender column with the mode value for the "Gender" column train_df['Gender'].fillna(train_df['Gender'].mode()[0],inplace=True) test_df['Gender'].fillna(test_df['Gender'].mode()[0],inplace=True) #"Duration" column has negative values. Replace it with median of "Duration" column as time cannot be -ve mask=train_df[train_df['Duration'] f1_global: # save the model to disk filename = 'finalized_model.sav' pickle.dump(svc, open(filename, 'wb')) #save fitted encoders, transformers and scalers filename = 'finalized_dim_reducer.sav' pickle.dump(pca, open(filename, 'wb')) filename = 'finalized_encoder.sav' pickle.dump(encoder, open(filename, 'wb')) filename = 'finalized_transformer.sav' pickle.dump(qt, open(filename, 'wb')) filename = 'finalized_scaler.sav' pickle.dump(rs, open(filename, 'wb')) f1_global=valid_f1_scor
