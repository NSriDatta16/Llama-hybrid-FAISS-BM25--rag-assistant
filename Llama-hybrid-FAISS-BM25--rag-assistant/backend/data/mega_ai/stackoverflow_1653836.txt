When you say you've tried it manually within the browser - is that over HTTP or file:/// Does sound like a path issue, TBH. Have a look in Safari or Firebug to see the HTTP activity when the host page loads. The 'nocache' JS file you include the in the host page loads the appropriate compiled JS for that user agent. Maybe it can't find JS.
