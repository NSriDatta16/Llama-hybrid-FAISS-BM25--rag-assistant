multiple random starting points can be used to avoid being stuck in a local maximum "frequentist packages"... lol (as if it was a thing): I always find "dichotomous thinking" very interesting thank god there is a Likehood school along with the Bayesian and the Frequentist. One can be a Likehoodist without going through the frequentist checkpoint, and the likelihood does not hold a special place in the frequentist school.
