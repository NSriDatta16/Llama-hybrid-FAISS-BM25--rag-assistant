This is a more a partial practical answer, but it works for me to do some exercises before getting deeply into theory . This ats.ucla.edu link is a reference that might help beggining to understand about multinomial logistic regression (as pointed out by Bill), in a more practical way. It presents reproducible code to understand function multinom from nmet package in R and also gives a briefing about outputs interpretation. Consider this code: va = c('cat','dog','dog','goat','cat','goat','dog','dog') # cat will be the outcome baseline vb = c(1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2) vc = c('blue','red','blue','red','red','blue','yellow','yellow') # blue will be the vc predictor baseline set.seed(12) vd = round(rnorm(8),2) data = data.frame(cbind(va,vb,vc,vd)) library(nnet) fit This is how you can interpret the log-linear fitted multinomial logistic model: \begin{align} \ln\left(\frac{P(va={\rm cat})}{P(va={\rm dog})}\right) &= b_{10} + b_{11}vb + b_{12}(vc={\rm red}) + b_{13}(vc={\rm yellow}) + b_{14}vd \\ &\ \\ \ln\left(\frac{P(va={\rm cat})}{P(va={\rm goat})}\right) &= b_{20} + b_{21}vb + b_{22}(vc={\rm red}) + b_{23}(vc={\rm yellow}) + b_{24}vd \end{align} Here is an excerpt about how the model parameters can be interpreted: A one-unit increase in the variable vd is associated with the decrease in the log odds of being "dog" vs. "cat" in the amount of 21.97069 ($b_{14}$). the same logic for the second line but, considering "goat" vs. "cat" with ($b_{24}$=-47.72585). The log odds of being "dog" vs. "cat" will increase by 6.705314 if moving from vc="blue" to vc="red"($b_{12}$). ..... There is much more in the article, but I thought this part to be the core.
