Eclipse 3.4 package explorer question

is it possible to do something like this: Let's say I have a lot of projects in my package explorer. I want to make different views. For example a view for projects I don't use very often, my main things, common things. Basically i want to clean up my package explorer to get a better overview of all my things. At the moment everything is in my head and all projects are overcrowding the package explorer. Is there any similar or recommended way to do this. Or let's just say how do you organize your things in the package explorer. thx. kuku
