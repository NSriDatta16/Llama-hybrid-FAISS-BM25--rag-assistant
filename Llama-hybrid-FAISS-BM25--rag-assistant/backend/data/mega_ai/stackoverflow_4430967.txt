== only checks whether the left hand side and the right hand side refer to the exact same instance of an object. And since "" translates to something like new String("") , it will always return false, if you compare it with a string that already exists. If you want to compare whether two instances of a class have the same state you need to use equals() . In your case *.getText().equals("") . A more elegant method would to use the isEmpty() method of the String class.
