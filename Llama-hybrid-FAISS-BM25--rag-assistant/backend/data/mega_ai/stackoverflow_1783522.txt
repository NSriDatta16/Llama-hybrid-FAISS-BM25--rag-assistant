I'll use Ajax.RenderPartial to load the content and to fill an empty DIV. If the JS is disabled, I'll link to a normal View and then it follows the normal process. I Think that's the way to Go, using RenderPartial is elegant for AJAX provided Content, just like this case. IFrame is something that should be avoid because of the evil precedence. The other thing that become handy in this case is the way you can handle both cases in your controller (JS active / JS not active): public ActionResult Action() { if (Request.IsAjaxRequest()) { //This one just have the explicit content return View("PartialView"); } else { //This one is a view that reference the partial View return View("CompleteView"); } }
