Iâ€™ve come to the same conclusion as yourself and others, traditional forecasting is still probably the most applicable and maybe reliable for time series of numeric values. There is some slight bleed in deep learning in discussion where time series for numeric values gets mixed into deep learning, where deep learning (currently) applies to modern challenges in pattern recognition for image, sound, clean text, or anomaly detection. I often have good results with VAR / VECM for daily transactional data, which could probably be applied to your signal processing use case.
