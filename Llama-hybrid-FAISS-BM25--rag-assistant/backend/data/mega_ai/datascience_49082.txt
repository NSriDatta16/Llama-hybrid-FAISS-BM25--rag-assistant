is it possible determine a best neural network classifier by considering only accuracy

Below, you have the accuracy plots for training and testing set for 6 different neural networks. is it possible to say, which of the following neural network classifier is better?. Having this little known information (training and testing accuracy by number of epochs plot) ? . Personally, I believe, the first classifier (top-left corner) is better because it shows that the accuracy of the testing data is stable as the number of epochs increases.
