Which classes do I need to nice solve the problem?

I'm new to object oriented php, so I'm not sure which classes do I need for programming. I want to write little program, to show information from the database. There is a web page with the form for user input above and some space for the database output. User can enter something and programm logic will query the database and make some output. This is all. The output will be formatted with css. I want to write this in the best tradition of object oriented programming. I'm not sure with class organization. Thanks
