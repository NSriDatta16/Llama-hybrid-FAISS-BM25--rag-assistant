The real problem is trusting the information you receive. For that matter, you have to at least authenticate the person you are receiving the information from. The question is good, but for really good solutions you would have to consider ranking-based algorithms. These work a little like Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), where a trusted relationship propagates and is used to authenticate a chain of recommendations. There is a good deal of academic research on the subject: Towards a Model for Trust Relationships in Virtual Enterprises Prague, Czech Republic September 01-September 05 ISBN: 0-7695-1993-8.
