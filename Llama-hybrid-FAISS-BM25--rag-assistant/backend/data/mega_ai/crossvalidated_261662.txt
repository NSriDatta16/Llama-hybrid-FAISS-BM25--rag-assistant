As @JuhoKokkala mentioned in the comments, high acceptance rate doesn't necessarily give good performance. Metropolis Hastings' acceptance rate can be increased by shrinking the proposal distribution. But, this will cause smaller steps to be taken, making it take longer to explore the target distribution. In practice, there's a tradeoff between step size and acceptance rate, and a proper balance is needed to get good performance. Hamiltonian Monte Carlo tends to outperform Metropolis Hastings because it can reach more distant points with higher probability of acceptance. So, the question is: why does HMC tend to have higher acceptance probability than MH for more distant points ? MH has trouble reaching distant points because its proposals are made without using information about the target distribution. The proposal distribution is typically isotropic (e.g. a symmetric Gaussian). So, at each point, the algorithm tries to move a random distance in a random direction. If the distance is small relative to how quickly the target distribution changes in that direction, there's a good chance that the density at the current and new points will be similar, giving at least a reasonable chance of acceptance. Over greater distances, the target distribution may have changed quite a bit relative to the current point. So, the chance of randomly finding a point with similar or (hopefully) higher density may be poor, particularly as the dimensionality increases. For example, if the current point lies on a narrow ridge, there's a much greater chance of falling off the ridge than remaining on it. In contrast, HMC exploits the structure of the target distribution. Its proposal mechanism can be thought of using a physical analogy, as described in Neal (2012). Imagine a puck sliding on a hilly, frictionless surface. The location of the puck represents the current point, and the height of the surface represents the negative log of the target distribution. To obtain a new proposed point, the puck is given a momentum with random direction and magnitude, and its dynamics are then simulated as it slides over the surface. The puck will accelerate in downhill directions and decelerate in uphill directions (perhaps even stopping and sliding back downhill again). Trajectories moving sideways along the wall of a valley will curve downward. So, the landscape itself influences the trajectory and pulls it toward higher probability regions. Momentum can allow the puck to crest over small hills, and also overshoot small basins. The puck's location after some number of time steps gives the new proposed point, which is accepted or rejected using the standard Metropolis rule. Exploiting the target distribution (and its gradient) is what allows HMC to reach distant points with high acceptance rates. Here's a good review: Neal (2012) . MCMC using Hamiltonian dynamics.
