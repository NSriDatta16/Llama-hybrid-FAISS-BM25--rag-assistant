I'm a development manager. For my organization, setting up and migrating to nhibernate involved some setup costs and added to our development time. Some of the developers liked it, some thought it was a waste of time. There hasn't been a noticeable change in error rates, but perhaps it's too early to tell. From my perspective, I think it helps junior developers who aren't sure of their work, but for the senior developers, it seems to slow them down - it's one more thing to keep updated. I'm not sure if we'll continue using this, revert back to our old ways (ad hoc unit testing), or let developers make a personal choice.
