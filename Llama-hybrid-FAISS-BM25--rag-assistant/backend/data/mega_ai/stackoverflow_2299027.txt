Isolated Storage is intended to provide a way for you to store data on the client WITHOUT knowing the specific location of the files you have stored. The reason for the lack of a URI is to keep the files you have stored in a "security sandbox". You may be able to figure out a way to get the actual URI but if there is a way it is likely that Microsoft will release a security patch that breaks your code. I would find a different way to accomplish your task. It is generally a bad idea to try "fighting" the security settings in the platform since future platform changes could break your application.
