Certainly you need to go beyond friends. The problem with only testing with friends is that they'll want you to succeed, and thus tell you it's good. (I mean look at all the people encouraged to try out for American Idol for crying out loud!) If you can get some sort of private beta going, that would be ideal. Because you do not have the budget for anything large scale, it will have to do. If you can get a decent enough population you should be able to get better feedback than from just friends. I wouldn't worry too much about diversifying the demographics, but certainly target people who would actually be interested in whatever sort of genre your game is in (I'm going to assume RTS based on the example you've shown).
