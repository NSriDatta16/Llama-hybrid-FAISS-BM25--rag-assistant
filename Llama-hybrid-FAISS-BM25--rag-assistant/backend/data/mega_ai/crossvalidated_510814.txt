According to this post , the distortion for $k$ centroids $\vec{\mathrm{m}} = [\mathrm{m}_1, \dots, \mathrm{m}_k]$ and class assignements $\vec{c} = [c_1, \dots, c_n]$ (where $c_i$ is the class found for point $\mathrm{x}_i$ ) obtained from running k-means on data $\mathcal{D} = \{\mathrm{x}_1, \dots, \mathrm{x}_n\}$ is defined as $$ J(\vec{c},\vec{\mu}) = \sum_{i=1}^n\lVert \mathrm{x}_i - \mathrm{m}_{c_i}\rVert^2$$ So distortion is not the average, however if you multiply it by $1/n$ you do indeed get the average squared distance of a random point to its assigned centroid. Using your values, $\frac{1}{n}J(\vec{c},\vec{\mu}) = 1.45$ tells you that On average a point is inside a ball of radius $\sqrt{1.45}$ around its centroid However since your data is normalized, the un-normalized data will we inside an ellipse as the ball is transformed differently along each dimensions by the mapping $\mathrm{x} \mapsto \sigma\odot\mathrm{x} + \mu$ .
