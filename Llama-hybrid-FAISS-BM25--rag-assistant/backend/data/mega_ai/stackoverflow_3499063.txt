The issue you are seeing is that in the Customer2 class CustomerName is a field but in the CustMetadata class CustomerName is a property. If you change CustMetadata to: public class CustMetadata { [StringLengthValidator(0, 20)] public string CustomerName; } then it works as expected. The Validation Application Block uses both the MemberType and the Name when matching the MetaData.
