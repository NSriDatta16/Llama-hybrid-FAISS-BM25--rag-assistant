Removing unique writing style from text

To start off, I'm not a data scientist or machine learning engineer. I'm mostly interested in finding existing solutions that will fit this usecase. I'm trying to build a forum that will protect users privacy. To my knowledge, it would be possible for malicious attackers who gain access to the forum to run replies through a classifier and be able to roughly group the replies to individual users based on writing style. Should those attackers also have labeled writing samples from people they are trying to pair with the users of the forum, it is possible that they could find matches and thus dox the user. What I want to do to try to prevent this form of attack is to run all replies through a one way algorithm that removes styled aspects of replies. I've tried a number of summarizing APIs, but none I have found seem to work well with short replies. It would be amazing to get some suggestions here from those more familiar with the space. Let me know if more details are needed.
