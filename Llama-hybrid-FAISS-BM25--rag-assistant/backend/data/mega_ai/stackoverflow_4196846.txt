Proper use of access_token for Facebook Graph API

I'm extending the example.php from php-sdk in github. I'd like to list out the movies the user likes. $facebook->api('/me/movies') does not return results though the logged-in user has liked movies defined. I began to wonder if access_token was required. Note, d is a simple print function: Movie Likes api('/me/movies/?access_token=' . $session['access_token']))?> Entering junk instead of the access_token has the same effect. So - unclear if access_token is required or there is another problem. Secondly, if an access_token is needed is the the session access_token the one to use.
