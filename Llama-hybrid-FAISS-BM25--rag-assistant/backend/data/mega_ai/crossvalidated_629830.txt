Is Power Function the same as Probability of Type I error?

I am currently reading Casella & Berger and at Paragraph 8.3.1 Error Probabilities and the Power Function It says the following: Suppose $R$ denotes the rejection region for a test. Then for $\theta_0 \in \Theta_0$ , the test will make a mistake if $\mathbf{x} > \in R$ , so the probability of a Type I Error is $\mathbb{P}_{\theta}(\mathbf{X} \in R)$ . For $\theta \in \Theta_0^c$ , the probability of a Type II Error is $\mathbb{P_{\theta}}(\mathbf{X} > \in R^c)$ . So, what I understood is $\mathbf{P}(\text{Sample thrown into Rejection Region}|H_{0} \text{was true})$ is the Type I error. Then, it goes on to give the following definition of the Power Function. The power function of a hypothesis test with a rejection region $R$ is the function $\theta$ defined by $\beta(\theta)= \mathbb{P}_{\theta}(\mathbf{X} \in R) $ So, does this mean that Power Function is the probability of Type I error? And Type I error (as I understood) is when the test puts the sample into rejection region but the Null Hypothesis was correct (i.e. the sample should've been in the acceptance region) i.e. we falsely rejected the Null Hypothesis. But in one the statistical inference tutorials I was following said that power function is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when alternative hypothesis was true which is equivalent to 1 - P(accepting null hypothesis | alternative was true) which is the same as 1 - P(Type II Error). So are these two statements equal? \begin{align} \beta(\theta) &= \mathbb{P}(\text{Reject } H_{0}|H_{0} \text{is True}) \\ &= 1 - \mathbb{P}(\text{Accept }H_{0}|H_{1}\text{ is True}) \\ &= \mathbb{P}(\text{Type I Error}) \\ &= 1 - \mathbb{P}(\text{Type II Error}) \end{align} Are these equations correct?
