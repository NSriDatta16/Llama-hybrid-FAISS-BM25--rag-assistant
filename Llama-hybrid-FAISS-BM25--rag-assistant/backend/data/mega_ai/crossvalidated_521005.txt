The method is simple, but a pencil-and-paper calculation would take some time. The possible states of the game can be described by non-negative triples $(n,f,b)$ representing, in turn, the numbers of pillars $n,$ the number of animals on the floe $f,$ and the number of animals on the bridge $b.$ (The number of animals in the igloo is determined by $4-f-b.$ ) When a state of the form $(0,*,*)$ is reached, the game is lost. Its value to us is zero. When a state of the form $(n,0,0)$ with $n\gt 0$ is reached, the game is won. Its value to us is $1.$ The expected value is the sum of the values times their chances, which equals the sum of all chances of winning: that's what we want to compute. The possible moves are An "ice cube" changes $(n,f,b)$ to $(n-1,f,b),$ provided $n\gt 0.$ A "bridge" changes $(n,f,b)$ to $(n,f-1,b+1)$ provided $f \gt 0.$ An "igloo" changes $(n,f,b)$ to $(n,f,b-1)$ provided $b \gt 0.$ The method is to work backwards from the winning or losing states to compute the expectations for earlier states in the game. Usually, each move is made with a chance of $1/3.$ As a shortcut, it helps to observe that in some states, not all moves are possible. For instance, from the initial state $(6,4,0),$ when "igloo" is rolled, nothing happens. The effect is to move eventually to either the state $(5,4,0)$ or $(5,3,1),$ each with probability $1/2.$ (This implies, by the way, that the answer must be a fraction whose denominator is a product of a power of $3$ and a power of $2.$ ) The pencil-and-paper calculation could proceed in this fashion: The value of $(1,0,0)$ is $1.$ The value of $(1,0,1)$ is $1/2,$ because there's a $1/2$ chance of moving to $(0,0,1)$ (with a value of $0$ ) and a $1/2$ chance of moving to $(1,0,0)$ (with its value of $1$ ). The values of $(1,0,2)$ and $(1,1,0)$ similarly are $1/4,$ because there are even chances of moving to $(1,0,1)$ or to a loss. The value of $(1,1,1)$ is $(0)/3 + (1/4)/3 + (1/4)/3 = 1/6$ because there are equal chances of moving to $(0,1,1),$ $(1,0,2),$ and $(1,1,0)$ with values $0,$ $1/4,$ and $1/4,$ as previously computed. Etc., etc. Proceeding (patiently!) through all $104$ possible states, we wind up with a value of $$148901 / 314928 = (61\times 2441) / (3^9\times 2^4) \approx 0.47281,$$ a little less than a $50\%$ chance of winning, for the initial state $(6,4,0).$ Using a computer helps. Here is the R program I used for the calculations. It is set up to evaluate other versions of this game, starting from any initial position, using obvious and minor modifications. It could be a useful tool to design a similar game with any desired winning probability. For instance, you can accommodate a player with a shorter attention span by using $n=4$ pillars and starting with just $f=2$ animals (winning chances: $57\%$ ); or you can give a player an advantage by starting some animals on the bridge. E.g. , starting with two animals on the bridge (initial state $(6,2,2)$ ) has a $69\%$ chance of winning. An optional array DEPTH tracks how many moves (using the shortcut previously described) are needed to reach each state. The maximum depth is $8+6-1=13,$ because after that many moves either all animals reach the igloo (eight moves) or all pillars collapse (six moves). # # Describe the game. # moves ```
