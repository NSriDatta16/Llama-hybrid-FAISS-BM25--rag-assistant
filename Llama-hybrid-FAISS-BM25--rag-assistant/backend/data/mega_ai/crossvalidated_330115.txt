This is basically done by so-called Spiking Neural Networks. They are based on Leaky Integrate and Fire models which are essentially Hodgson-Huxley with an extra resistive current term. You can find a reference here: Training Deep Spiking Neural Networks using Backpropagation -- Lee, et. al. and here: https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2016.00508/full
