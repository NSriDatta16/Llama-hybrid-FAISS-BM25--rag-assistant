I don't think you're missing any magic and I think refactoring to remove the persistence code from your business objects and into your persistence layer is the right way to go both from a unit testing and a design perspective. You may want to think about having the cache sit between your business layer and the persistence layer, mediating the retrieval/update of your business objects to simplify things. You should be able to mock/fake your cache and persistence layer if you separate things out this way.
