Results of stlf forecast prediction intervals change each run

Using stlf from Rob Hyndman 's forecast package in R, I have noticed that the prediction intervals change each time I run it on a specific series of data (stays the same on other time series data as it should). Here is the call: msts(x ,seasonal.period = 365.25/7) %>% stlf(h = 10, method = "ets", etsmodel = "ZZN", damp = T, lambda = 0) However, everything else stays the same. Each time the method stays the same "STL + ETS(M,Md,N)" The point forecasts are identical Model parameters are identical Two things solve this problem: Set the seed before running Take off the "lambda = 0" condition, the forecast intervals stay the same. I would like to figure out why this is happening so I don't need to use these solutions, but get at the heart of the problem.
