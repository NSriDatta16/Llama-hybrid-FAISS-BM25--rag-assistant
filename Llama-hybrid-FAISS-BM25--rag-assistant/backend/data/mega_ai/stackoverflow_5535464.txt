First of all, you should name the file person.pm (for Perl Module). Then you can load it with the use function: use person; If the directory where person.pm is located is not in @INC , you can use the lib pragma to add it: use lib 'c:/some_path_to_source_dir'; use person; Secondly, Perl doesn't have special syntax for constructors. You named your constructor create (which is ok, but non-standard), but then tried to call person::new , which doesn't exist. If you're going to be doing object-oriented programming in Perl, you should really look at Moose . Among other things, it creates the constructor for you. If you don't want to use Moose, here are some other improvements you can make: package person; use strict; # These 2 lines will help catch a **lot** of mistakes use warnings; # you might make. Always use them. sub new { # Use the common name my $class = shift; # To allow subclassing my $this = { name => undef; email => undef; } bless $this, $class; # To allow subclassing return $this; } Then call the constructor as a class method: use strict; # Use strict and warnings in your main program too! use warnings; use person; my $john_doe = person->new(); Note: It's more common in Perl to use $self rather than $this , but it doesn't actually matter. Perl's built-in object system is very minimal and places few restrictions on how you use it.
