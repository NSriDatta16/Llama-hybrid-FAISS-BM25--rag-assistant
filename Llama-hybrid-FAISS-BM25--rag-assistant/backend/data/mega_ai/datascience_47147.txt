The recommendation system is a broad term to describe everything from a poster "in case of fire.. " to ML-based systems that continuously evolve over time. A simple recommendation system consists of: Knowledge database representing some wisdom that will be used to make new recommendations. This database can be created from historical data, a model, or simply invented. Recommender engine - some sort of logic that takes inputs, run them with the knowledge database and produce a recommendation. This can be simple instructions e.g. before crossing a street, look left, then right. It can also be a decision tree helping to identify the best course of action, or a trained ML classifier. It can also be a generative neural network that takes user input and generates new stuff. For instance, predicts text as user types or suggests other books based on recent purchases. An alternative term for a recommendation system is an expert system. The heyday of these systems was the eighties and nineties. I suggest you look for older papers and books. Nowadays, machine learning is on the hype and often used where a simple decision tree would suffice.
