The problem is that your not correctly using KVC. There is two things you can do. Method 1: Simple but not so elegant Use the following code to add the object to the array [[self mutableArrayValueForKey:@"objectArray"] addObject:test]; This isn't so elegant as you have to specify the variable using a string value, so you will not get compiler warnings when spelt incorrectly. Method 2: Generate the KVO methods needed for the array "objectArray". Select the property in your interface declaration Select Scripts (the script icon in the menubar) > Code > Place accessor decls on Clipboard Paste the declarations in the appropriate spot in your interface file Select Scripts > Code > Place accessor defs on Clipboard Paste the definitions in the appropriate spot in your implementation file You can then use a method that looks like [self insertObject:test inObjectArrayAtIndex:0];
