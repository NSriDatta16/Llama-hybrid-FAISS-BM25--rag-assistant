The mentioned should be added to the "jsp" servlet in $CATALINA_HOME/conf/web.xml . Is this what you tried? (EDIT: $CATALINA_HOME was just a way to designate the root of Tomcat and that the modification had to be done in Tomcat, not in the WEB-ING/web.xml of your webapp. Anyhow, for JBoss which is embedding Tomcat , and depending on the version you are using, you'll find the mentioned file here: $JBOSS_HOME/server/default/deploy/jbossweb-tomcat55.sar/conf/web.xml . Here again, $JBOSS_HOME is the root of your JBoss installation, it may not be set as environment variable.)
