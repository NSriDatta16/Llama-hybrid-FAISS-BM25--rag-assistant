When fitting an arima model, how do I pick the residuals?

Let's say I have a time series $x_1, ..., x_t$. I fit an AR model and get my estimated parameters. Then I can simulate from this, but in order to do so, I also need some distribution from which I draw residuals. If I want my simulation to fit my time series as good as possible, how do I do that? What residuals do I use (or how to estimate such residuals).
