One can use the ACF and PACF to identify a useful model if the paramaters of that model are invariant over time AND there are no outliers/level shifts/time trends in the data. Unfortunately for you and STATA neither is true . The CHOW Test for checking constancy of parameters over time is discussed here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chow_test and here http://www.autobox.com/cms/index.php/news/188-autobox-coauthors-article-in-journal . I took your data (55 values) and used AUTOBOX which I have helped develop and found that there was a significant break point in parameters. . The actual coefficients for the first period (31 values) was while the coefficients for the second regime (24 values ) was . Unfortunately most time series packages assume constancy of parameters which is hardly ever true except for many textbook examples. Yes Virginia there is no Santa Claus ! My comment ... I don't think the CHOW Test is applicable for testing the dummy. The complete model should include ARIMA structure , exgoneous series and any Intervention Detected Pulses/Level Shifts.time Trends that are appropriate. Why don't you post in an (excel file .... easy for me ...) the original Y series and the exogenous series and I will take a comprehensive look at it. Taking unwarranted differences ( a transformation) or using unwarranted power transformations (like logs) is always dangerous as like drugs some are good for you and some are not ....so I will let you decide on which approach you wish to take ...original data or arbitrarily manipulated/transformed data . edited after receipt of data for Country 1: OP wished to identify a combined ARIMA model with 4 user suggested causals. Here is the Actual/Fit and Forecast graph The residual plot is here along with the residual ACF . The equation is here and here and here and here with forecasts[ ] . In summary there is important lag structure in the first user suggested input while the second input is not informative. There are a number of pulses and seasonal pulses and no ARIMA structure is required or needed. Incorporating good user-suggested causals is motivated in part to vitiate any otherwise neede ARIMA strucure. You should duplicate this study for Country2 and then use the CHOW Test to test the hypothesis of a common set of parameters.
