You could of course look at the line in the string, and try to find the function name, though that will not be reliable if they alias a function, e.g.: bar = foo2 foo1(); foo2() Otherwise it gets really hard. The coverage module does this, and Ned explained the particular technique in a blog post -- basically it involves rewriting the bytecode to separate out expressions into different (fake) line numbers. You might actually be able to use the coverage module itself for this.
