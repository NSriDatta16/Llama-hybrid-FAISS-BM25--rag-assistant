How to Compare 2 very large matrices using Python

I have an interesting problem. I have a very large (larger than 300MB, more than 10,000,000 lines/rows in the file) CSV file with time series data points inside. Every month I get a new CSV file that is almost the same as the previous file, except for a few new lines have been added and/or removed and perhaps a couple of lines have been modified. I want to use Python to compare the 2 files and identify which lines have been added, removed and modified. The issue is that the file is very large, so I need a solution that can handle the large file size and execute efficiently within a reasonable time, the faster the better. Example of what a file and its new file might look like: Old file A,2008-01-01,23 A,2008-02-01,45 B,2008-01-01,56 B,2008-02-01,60 C,2008-01-01,3 C,2008-02-01,7 C,2008-03-01,9 etc... New file A,2008-01-01,23 A,2008-02-01,45 A,2008-03-01,67 (added) B,2008-01-01,56 B,2008-03-01,33 (removed and added) C,2008-01-01,3 C,2008-02-01,7 C,2008-03-01,22 (modified) etc... Basically the 2 files can be seen as matrices that need to be compared, and I have begun thinking of using PyTable. Any ideas on how to solve this problem would be greatly appreciated.
