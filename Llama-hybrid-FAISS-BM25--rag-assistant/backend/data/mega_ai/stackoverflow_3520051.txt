It depends on where you're getting your maps from. Is there a public API? In general I'd say they would have to be added manually. To help you could create an interface that would do this for you easier i.e. you drag a small box around a specific area, then you can enter its details such as county, area code, etc. Store the regions as a 2-multidimensional array. map[x][y].town = 'uxbridge' then delegate an event listener to a image. Find out the x,y coordinates the mouse was clicked on, loop through the map array to see if it matches. The user would have to click on a 1px point for it to be found in the array, so to avoid this just use a "spacing" value of say 50px, so the x,y can be 50px out either way. Then highlight that area and add it to the region array. There probably is a better way of doing this with and better algorithm to search the map[] array, but ultimately you'd have to convert every element in the map[] array to which would be cumbersome anyway Actually scrap that, would be much easier and suited for this. The biggest problem here is working out how to get the regions stored into the map[] array, again this is point 1 and all about the API that you can use, or add them manually through an interface. Then you loop through the array and output it to each with its x, y, w, h coords to an area and push to the DOM once complete. Then add an event listener to each OR if you want to be much more efficient, delegate an event listener on to handle the on click events. Then you just pull the data from the map[] array for that area element.
