Citing from Wikipedia : If two or more series are individually integrated (in the time series sense) but some linear combination of them has a lower order of integration, then the series are said to be cointegrated. Similar definitions can be found also in time series textbooks, e.g. Lutkepohl "New Introduction to Multiple Time Series Analysis" (2005) Chapter 6. If the individual series are I(0), they are not integrated. A deterministic trend (like a linear time trend) will not do; I(0) plus a time trend does not constitute an integrated time series. You would need a stochastic trend to get an integrated time series. Thus you cannot proceed to cointegration analysis. What you could do is model the two series in a VAR or VARMA model including an exogenous variable - a linear time trend (if that is what the T stands for in your question).
