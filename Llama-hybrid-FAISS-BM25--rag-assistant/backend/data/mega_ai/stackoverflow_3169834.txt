UILabel inherits from UIView which inherits from UIResponder. All UIresponder objects can handle touch events. So in your class file which knows about your view (which contains the UIlabel) implement: -(void)touchesBegan:(NSSet*)touches withEvent:(UIEvent*)event; In interface builder set the UILabel's tag value. when touches occur in your touchesBegan method, check the tag value of the view to which the tag belongs: UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; if(touch.view.tag == MY_TAG_VAL) label.text = @"new text"; You connect your code in your class file with the UILabel object in interface builder by declaring your UILabel instance variable with the IBOutlet prefix: IBOutlet UILabel *label; Then in interface builder you can connect them up.
