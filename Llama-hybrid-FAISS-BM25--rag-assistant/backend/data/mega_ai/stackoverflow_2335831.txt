The correct way to detect bots is by host entry ( Dns.GetHostEntry ). Some lame robots require you to track by ip address, but the popular ones generally don't. Googlebot requests come from *.googlebot.com. After you get the host entry, you should check in the IPHostEntry.AddressList to make sure it contains the original ip address. Do not even look at the user agent when verifying robots. See also http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2006/09/how-to-verify-googlebot.html
