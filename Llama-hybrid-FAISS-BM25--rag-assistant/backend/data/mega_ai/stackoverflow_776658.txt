Inter-Image communication in Smalltalk. Possible?

I have a graph-traversal problem that is beautifully and elegantly modeled in smalltalk, but it's too big (in terms of computation and storage) for one smalltalk image instance. So, I want to partition the problem across multiple instances. My question is, is there any good way to send messages between smalltalk instances. Kind of like MPI, but for smalltalk. I should mention that I'm on Squeak, but if there is some flavor of smalltalk with this feature, I can cope.
