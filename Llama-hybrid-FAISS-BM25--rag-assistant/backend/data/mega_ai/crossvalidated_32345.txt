Compute p-value in paired bootstrap

I ran across a new paper from the Berkeley NLP group on statistical testing, An Empirical Investigation of Statistical Significance in NLP . There is pseudocode for computing a p-value in the paper, basically, the idea is that the sample set of $x_1,x_2,...,x_N$ are sampled with replacement from data $x$. Then $\text{p-value} = \text{count}(\delta(x_i) > 2\delta(x))/N$, where $\delta(x_i)$ is a metric gain. I could understand the formula for computing the p-value in Koehn's paper Statistical significance tests for machine translation evaluation , in which: $\text{p-value} = \text{count}(\delta_a(x_i) Is there any explanation or reference for the formula $\text{p-value} = \text{count}(\delta(x_i) > 2\delta(x))/N$. The authors also noted that if the mean of $\delta(x_i)$ is $\delta(x)$ and $\delta(x_i)$ is symmetric, then both formulas above are equivalent.
