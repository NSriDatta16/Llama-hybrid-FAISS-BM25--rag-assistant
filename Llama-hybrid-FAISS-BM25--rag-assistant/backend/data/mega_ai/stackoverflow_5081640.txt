Making Javascript resizable handlers on the borders of HTML elements

Dear experts, I am currently working on an code that allows users to drag & resize HTML elements across the pages. I could tackle the draggable no problem. But the problem comes from resizing. I don't know how attach Event Listeners to the "borders" of this elements to trigger the resize, specifically only the "right and bottom" borders. I am aware of the similar approach on the Jquery UI, but I do not want to use the Jquery UI. I would like to do it myself with vanilla Javascript and Jquery API. I have spent the whole day searching on Google for a proper tutorial but failed. If you could point me to the right direction I would really appreciate. Dennis
