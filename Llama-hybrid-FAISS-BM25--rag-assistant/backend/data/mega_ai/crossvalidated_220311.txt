Another possible interpretation in a hierarchal framework is simple a decomposition of the total covariance $\operatorname{cov}(X,Y)$ into two terms: the within group ($E[\operatorname{cov}(X,Y|Z)]$) and between group $\operatorname{cov}([E[X|Z],E[Y|Z])$ covariances. The first term represents in this example the average of the covariances of $X$ and $Y$ evaluated for each group while the second term is the covariance of the group-averages for $X$ and $Y$.
