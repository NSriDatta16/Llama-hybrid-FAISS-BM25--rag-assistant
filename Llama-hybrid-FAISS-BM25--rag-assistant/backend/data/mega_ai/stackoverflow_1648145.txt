SQL Server does not have parallel or deferred execution: each block of running code in a connection is serial, one line after the other. To decouple processing, you usually have to use SQL Server Agent jobs or use Service broker . These start executing in a new connection, new session etc This makes sense: What if you want to rollback your changes? What does the background thread do and how does it know? What data does it use? New, Old, lock wait, snapshot? What if it gets ahead of the main thread and uses stale data?
