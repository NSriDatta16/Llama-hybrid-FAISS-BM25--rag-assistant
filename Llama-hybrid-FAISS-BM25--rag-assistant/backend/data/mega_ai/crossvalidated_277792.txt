It depends on what you mean that Popper had nothing to with debate. IN some sense it is half correct In other sense, its WRONGER THAN WRONG; ultimately,he rejected priors or inductive logic; and he was intimately connected with these issues. The foundations of probability is generally considered to be his best work. Developed and helped make rigorous Von Mises frequentist theory Developed A confirmation Logic, using Popper Functions. Argued against Inductive logic, and standard bayesian inference; that is nonsense (see his paper on this Developed his own probability calculus similar to A Renyi Ultimately was interested in the debate, because he rejected both conceptions; arguing to a return to Kolmogorov interpretation of probability= the neo-classical physical interpretation called propensity theory Connected these issues to QM Generally considered to amongst the greatest mathematical philosophers of probability (if not the greatest in some cases) and probabilistic logicians More than half of his best work (read David Miller, who was close confident, contribution in the newly published cambridge companion to Popper)
