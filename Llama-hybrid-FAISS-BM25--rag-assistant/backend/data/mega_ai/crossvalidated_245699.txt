You are free to transform any parameter prior to MCMC sampling in a Bayesian analysis. If you want them later in other units, just transform them back - there is no dedicated function for that for coda::mcmc, but internally a coda::mcmc object is just a matrix, just apply your backtransformation on the parameters and that's that. If you transform the parameters, you also have to transform your prior accordingly, so that the amount of prior probability mapped on each area of the parameter space stays constant. Hence, a transformation has no bearing on the prior choice - it is mostly applied to make MCMCs sample more efficiently. Regarding how to choose priors - the literature and CV is full of text on that. I would maybe start with the classic Kass, R. E. & Wasserman, L. (1996) The selection of prior distributions by formal rules. J. Am. Stat. Assoc., 91, 1343-1370.
