I recommend to use a combination of CNN layers and a RNN layer (e.g. long short-term layer LSTM or gated recurrent units). It depends on your sequence classification problem, I tried to solve a typical application (e.g. in bioinformatics) and failed. Then I used this network architecture - which I found by very experienced data scientist - and suddenly it worked very well.
