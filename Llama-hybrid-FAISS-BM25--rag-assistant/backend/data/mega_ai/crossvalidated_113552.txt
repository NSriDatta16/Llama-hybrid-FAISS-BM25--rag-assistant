Composition of bankruptcy probability and firm size

I'm using neural network for a binary classification problem of bankruptcy prediction using patternnet function in MATLAB , so i have probability of bankruptcy for out sample (final report). I'm searching for a method to combine probability of bankruptcy and size ( for example total assets) of companies. I want have biggest companies with biggest bankruptcy probability so i need a hybrid method to combine these features. (the probability is probability of being in bankrupt class for a specific firm). How can i do that?
