Nothing in the CNN method requires clipping of the input data - that is simply a design choice by the modeller. I am not completely sure what you are asking for, but it seems that you are interested in the problem associated with the edges of the input matrix. Each pixel at the edge of the image is only captured in a single neuron in the first convolutional layer, making the information less used for classification (which reduces accuracy). Zero-padding is often used to overcome this problem, and could easily be used for other data types as well.
