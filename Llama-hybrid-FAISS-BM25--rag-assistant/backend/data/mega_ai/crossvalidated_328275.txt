How to model remaining hospital length of stay?

I am attempting to build a model which, for a patient currently admitted to the hospital, predicts the remaining amount of time until the patient is discharged. Some of the predictors I'd like to use are patient-level (e.g. ethnicity), others are admission-level (e.g. admission diagnosis), and others can be entered many times at irregular intervals throughout the admission (e.g. temperature and blood pressure). My first attempt was to build a model where each observation in my dataset was a single admission, using averages for the predictors which occurred multiple times throughout the admission, and the final length of stay as my dependent variable. However, when I applied my predictions to the currently admitted patients, some patients had already exceeded their predicted length of stay by several days. What would be the best way to build a model so that it predicts the remaining length of stay, given that the patient has already been in the hospital for a certain amount of time?
