Cannot add WebViewer of ActiveReports to an ASP.NET page

I installed ActiveReports from their site. The version was labeled as .NET 2.0 build 5.2.1013.2 (for Visual Studio 2005 and 2008) . I have an ASP.NET project in VS 2008 which has 2.0 as target framework. I added all the tools in the DataDynamics namespace to the toolbox, created a new project, added a new report. When I drag and drop the WebViewer control to a page in the design view, nothing happens. No mark up is added, no report viewer is displayed on the page. Also I noticed that there are no tags related to DataDynamics components in my web.config file. Am I missing some configuration?
