How to perform discrete root finding in R?

A typical statistics problem would be to find the minimal sample size for a known binomial process to guarantee that it would not fall below a certain threshold with a given probability. In R, uniroot would normally solve such problems, but because R uses gamma and digamma functions to evaluate the combinatorial probabilities, non-discrete sample size values render outrageous values that cause the root finding algorithm to fail. For instance: suppose the vector X of Bernoulli has success probability 0.5. How many X must we sample to guarantee the sample average of X has a 20% chance of being lower than 0.3. f > uniroot(f, interval=c(5, 20)) Error in uniroot(f, interval = c(10, 20)) : f() values at end points not of opposite sign Grid search becomes infeasible as we consider larger sample sizes and more precise intervals.
