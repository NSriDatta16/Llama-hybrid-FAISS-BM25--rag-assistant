Problem solved. The standard way of getting the form data $post = JRequest::get('post'); is not enough in the case of using a editor. This will filter the content, hence losing line breaks and paragraps. So we need to add an extra line to get the editor contents in a raw unfiltered way. This data will be passed to the model to save into the database.
