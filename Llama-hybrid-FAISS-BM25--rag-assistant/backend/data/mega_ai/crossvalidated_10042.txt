Here is a simple approach that does not use logistic regression, but does attempt to use the suggestions above. Calculation of summary stats assumes, perhaps naively, that the date is normally distributed. Please pardon inelegant code write a function to estimate the day of budbreak for each individual: use the day of year half way between the last observation of 0 and the first observation of 1 for each individual. budburst.day 180) y Calculate summary statistics #calculate mean mean(unlist(lapply(1:4, budburst.day))) [1] 16.125 #calculate SE = sd/sqrt(n) sd(unlist(lapply(1:4, budburst.day)))/2 [1] 5.06777
