Is it possible to have a "touchesBegan" on a UITableViewCell?

-(void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { touchStartTime = [event timestamp]; } -(void)touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { NSTimeInterval touchTimeDuration = [event timestamp] - touchStartTime; } touchStartTime is defined at class level. Any idea why this won't recognise the touch events? Thanks for the help!
