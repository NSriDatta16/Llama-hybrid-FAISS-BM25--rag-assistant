Any serialization API should do fine here. I would recommend something that is contract based ( not BinaryFormatter , which is type-based) as that will keep it usable over time (as your assembly changes). So I would build a basic object model (DTO) and use any of: XmlSerializer DataContractSerializer protobuf-net (you all knew it was coming...) OO, simple, and easy. And easy to use for passing fragments of the data (either between users of to a central server).
