svm loss function gradient

I was taking Stanford's cs231n class and was unable to understand the gradient calculated using the SVM loss function. You should go here to check the notes which I am talking about. This is the SVM loss function. And now we want to find it's gradients. With respect to the weights of the correct class, the gradient of the loss function will be, Until Now I understand Everything, the problem occurs in finding the gradient with respect to the incorrect classes : I do not understand the calculation of this gradient, where did the Sigma go?
