Forums in Django - which of these apps would be easiest to implement in this scenario?

I want to do something a bit like they have on IMDb - every film and every person has a forum dedicated just to them. I also want to have a forum on the main message boards, which would show all the threads from the film pages and another forum for all the threads from the people pages. I've been looking at DjangoBB , Dinette and Sphene (SCT) . DjangoBB looks like it has the most features and it's very elegant. Dinette doesn't seem that far behind. Sphene has a few disadvantages - less features I think and it makes me dependent on Sphene's Community app, but it seems like it might be the easiest to use in my scenario - I've seen examples of Sphene being used in similar fashion. I'm pretty sure all three can be made to do more or less what I want, but would love some opinions on what might work best for me.
