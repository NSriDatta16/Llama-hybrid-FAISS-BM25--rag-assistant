The python built-in hash function is not intended for secure, cryptographic hashing. It's intention is to facilitate storing Python objects into dictionaries efficiently. The internal hash implementations are too predictable (too many collisions) for secure uses. For example, the following assertions are all true: hash('a') This sequential nature makes for great dictionary storage behaviour, for which it was designed. To create a secure hash, use the hashlib library instead.
