What is the distribution of the conditional mean E(Y|X) in a multiple regression?

Suppose the model is $$ Y = b_0 + b_1X_1 + b_2X_2 + b_3D + b_4X_1D + e \\ e \sim\mathcal N(0, \sigma^2) $$ Where $D$ is a categorical variable. $$ E(Y|X_1, X_2, D=1) \sim\mathcal ?? \\ E(Y|X_1, X_2, D=0) \sim\mathcal ?? $$ I want the sampling distribution that incorporates the uncertainty in estimated of $b$ and also leverage in $X$, and I'm guessing something to do with how many observations are in the group $D$.
