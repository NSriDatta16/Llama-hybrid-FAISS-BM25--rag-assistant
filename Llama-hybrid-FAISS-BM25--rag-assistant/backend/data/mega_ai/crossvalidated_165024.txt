Perhaps it's my own biases for Bayesian methods speaking, but I think this is a prime example of how one might use Bayesian analysis to simultaneously account for uncertainties at different levels of your analysis. library(rstan) noise_model This model postis that the y_obs has been corrutped by some (known) noise delta_y . So we sample possible "true" values y_star to be centered around y_obs with the appropriate amount of noise. Now we use these values y_star as the dependent variable in our regression analysis. A previous version of this answer required a kludge on the back-end, but I realized that we can just enforce the hard constraints on $y^*$ by means of a transformation. This model won't work in its current state, because we need to define what something is in the model statement, and I'm not quite sure how to go about it. Perhaps a smarter person could point out what, precisely, we meed. I'm not entirely sure there's sufficient information in the question for me to answer this. I leave this answer here as a partial solution which others might build on. Stated another way, the specification of the errors in $y^*$ will permit one to replace this line y_star ~ normal(y_obs, something); with something appropriate to OP's needs, and the model will be complete. If you wish, you may place appropriate priors on beta as well.
