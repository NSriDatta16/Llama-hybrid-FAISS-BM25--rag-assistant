I'm not sure how you know they're highlighted but here's a simple O(n) aproach that I'd try. scan the words into a circular queue (max capacity of 400) and if they're highlighted then increment the counter, once you reach the queues capacity, dequeue words as is necesary to enqueue the next one. when you dequeue a highlighted word decrement the counter. keep track of the max that your counter reaches at all times and where this chunk of 400 words starts at the max. not too elegant but fairly simple.
