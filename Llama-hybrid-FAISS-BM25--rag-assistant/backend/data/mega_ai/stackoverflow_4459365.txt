PHP - Normalize user input array

If have an array like this: array 0 => string '62 52, 53' (length=9) 1 => string '54' (length=2) It's from user input, and you never know how/what they enter ;) What I want in the end is this: array 0 => string '62' (length=2) 1 => string '52' (length=2) 2 => string '53' (length=2) 3 => string '54' (length=2) Here's how I do it: $string = implode(',', $array); $string = str_replace(', ', ',', $string); $string = str_replace(' ', ',', $string); $array = explode(',', $string); Seems really clunky. Is there a more elegant way? One that maybe has better performance?
