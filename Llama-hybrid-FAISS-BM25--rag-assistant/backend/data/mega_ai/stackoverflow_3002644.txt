Rails MVC Best Practices for Website Modules

I am just beginning to build my Rails application and thus far I've followed a RESTful design and it's proven much easier to understand and organize the code and structure of the application. I have things like posts and comments. However for the front page. I want to display all the latest posts but also may be in the sidebar display things such as Latest Comments and Latest events. What's the best way to go about this while maintaining the RESTful philosophy?
