sun's application server?

in a tutorial they asked me to install the application server which could be downloaded from their site. what do they mean with application server? the link they provided: http://java.sun.com/javaee/downloads/index.jsp i mean come on sun, all these names. jdk then j2ee..and when i wanna download j2se it says jdk6. r they insane? a lot of people are wondering what is what...they just dont know how to name things. however, back to the question. so with application they mean java ee server? i've got a mac and people say java is already installed. what is installed exactly? the j2ee or j2se? do i have do download j2ee? Java is just killing me... EDIT: read something about that the application server is a name for ee server. and there are many ee servers like tomcat, jetty and glassfish. and i know these sometimes are called servlet containers. so that makes application server = ee server = servlet container? and jdk = j2se? so j2ee != jdk?
