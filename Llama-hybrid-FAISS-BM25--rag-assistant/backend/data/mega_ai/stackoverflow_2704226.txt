From a tech support perspective the amount of people who actually need to browse the web as part of their job is very low, and they tend to run dual browsers. Your average user only needs to access various in-house websites for travel expenses, company news, e-learning or what have you. And these websites have usually been built for IE6 years ago. There is very little value to be gained by rolling out a new browser on thousands of machines for people who don't have any business surfing at work.
