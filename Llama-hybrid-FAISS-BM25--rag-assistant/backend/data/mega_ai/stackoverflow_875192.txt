WPF Application - Visual Studio 2008 Toolbox Not Loading Correctly!

I'm pretty new to WPF however i've got a solid understanding of WindowsForms. When I create a new WinForms application in Visual Studio the Toolbox displays a huge list of different controls that can be used for developing the program. However, this is only the second time i've started to design stuff in WPF and the toolbox is literally only showing a few of the common controls - things like text boxes and buttons and not much else. I've create a WPF app before in which i dragged a flow document onto the grid and played around with its capabilities, but that doesn't seem to be there. No idea why this is happening? Something not loading correctly? Any help would be greatly appreciated!
