Testing whether there is an increase between two regression slopes in a time series

I have a data of sea levels from a particular station from 1940 till today. The linear regression on the data from 1940-1980 resulted in a slope of 3. The linear regression on the data from 1980-2010 resulted in a slope of 4. What test can be used to establish whether the increase in the slope is significant?
