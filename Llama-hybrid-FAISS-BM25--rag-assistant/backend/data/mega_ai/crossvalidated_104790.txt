It is possible to have a significant covariate in an ANCOVA model that does not show a significant correlation with the response variable when only looking at those 2 variables (due to some relationship between the covariate and the other terms being analyzed in the ANCOVA variable). In some of these cases not including the covariate (regular ANOVA) can give very different answers from the correct ANCOVA. So I would suggest still doing the ANCOVA if there was some a priori reason to believe that there may be a relationship. Generally when we warn people about the linear assumption in ANCOVA (also a parallel assumption) it is not to discourage ANCOVA, but rather to point out that if the relationship is non-linear (curved) then standard built-in ANCOVA routines will not capture the whole relationship and other routines may be needed (multiple regression with indicator variables, interactions, and polynomial or spline terms for example).
