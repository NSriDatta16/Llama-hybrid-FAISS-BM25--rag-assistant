Getting started with Azure Storage coming from a relational database point of view

I'm designing a new system, and I have need to store a pretty large volume of different type of data, with realitivly few rows per type. I know that if I were doing this with SQL Server (I don't want to use a SQL Azure database for this.) I'd make a new table for each type of data and make the correct relationships. I'm wondering if anybody has resources for people like me who are thinking in relational terms to begin designing for more "flat" storage like Azure or even S3. I'll be using .NET as the consumer of said storage, possibly with an Azure Compute Instance, but more likely with a remote client using the REST or SOAP api. So any guidance with respect to that is also greatly appreciated.
