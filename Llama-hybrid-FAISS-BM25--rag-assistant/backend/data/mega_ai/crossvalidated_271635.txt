Determining the number of days to reach significance

Apologies for what I think will be a simple question - it has been some years since I've take statistics. I run a business and we are attempting to determine the number of days required to reach a statistical sig. result for an A/B test regarding advertising spend. We plan to shut-off catalog spend entirely for a portion of regions while leaving it on for others and compare to see whether there is a sig. impact on our bottom line revenue. What puzzles me is how to determine the number of days to run the test considering there are many different variables that ultimately impact revenue beyond just catalog advertising (e.g. other media, weather, etc). My thoughts at how to approach are: Run a regression of catalog spend on overall revenue and determine coefficient Determine what 2 standard deviations away from mean of weekly revenue is Multiply catalog coefficient * 2 SD of weekly sales to determine how much to spend to see a result at 90% sig Divide step 3 by average daily spend to calculate number of days Any help would be appreciated!
