(jQuery/JS) How to *set* a list item to be 1st in a UL or OL regardless of its original order?

I have this working code here: function portfolio() { $('#main-projects').children().toggle(function () { $(this).css('cursor', 'pointer'); var projectname = $(this).attr('id'); //alert(projectname); projectname = projectname.replace("li-", "main-"); $('.main-details').hide(); $('.main-stage').fadeOut(300); $('#' + projectname).delay(300).fadeIn(900); }, function () { //Haven't written callback yet, no worries. }); } Works great already: when you click an LI (child of ul#main-projects ) it finds the name of the hidden slideshow div by replacing the name of the LI's id, replaces "li-(name of project)" with "main-(name of project)" then shows that div. What I also want it to do (and can't seem to find the solution to) is take the LI that's been selected and move it to be the first in the list to curate in a way for the slideshow that's just been shown above it. I know how to grab an item number with eq(index) but I haven't found anything that forces a reorder without dragging and dropping. Any ideas? Thanks in advance!
