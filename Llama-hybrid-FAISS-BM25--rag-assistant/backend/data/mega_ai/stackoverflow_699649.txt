Browser interface to command line python program

I have a command line tool that I have written (in Python) that interfaces to a SQLite database (one DB per user). This program presents a lot of data to the user which can be cumbersome in a terminal. One option is to provide a wxPython interface, but another thought is to leverage Firefox or Webkit to provide an interface. Anyone ever go about something like this? Or else any very easy ways to add graphical interfaces to manipulate large amounts of data in python programs? Thanks!
