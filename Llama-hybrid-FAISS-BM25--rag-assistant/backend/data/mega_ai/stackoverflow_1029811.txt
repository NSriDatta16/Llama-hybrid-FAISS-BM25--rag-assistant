Hibernate not creating entity tables if embedding components

I have made an application using Java/Hibernate/MySQL, but whenever I try running it, it complains that the table for one of my entity classes has not been created. After some trial and error, I have come to the conclusion that the problem is coming from the way I am mapping embedded components, but I do not know how I may fix it. Here are the relevant bits of code: @Entity public class Feed { ... //Definition of some properties @Embedded @AttributeOverrides( { @AttributeOverride(name = "type", column = @Column(name = "title-type")), @AttributeOverride(name = "mode", column = @Column(name = "title-mode")), @AttributeOverride(name = "value", column = @Column(name = "title-value")) }) public Content getTitle() { ... } ... } @Embeddable public class Content { ... // There are three properties with bean syntax // without any persistence annotation. } Does anyone know why Hibernate fails to create the table for the class Feed? And how I may correct it? Thank you in advance. Edit: Finally, I have understood; the fact that I used "-" characters in my columns was to blame. I replaced these with underscores and all is well again. Thank you very much for your help.
