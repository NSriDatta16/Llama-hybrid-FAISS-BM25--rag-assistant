SharePoint is an option but I don't recommend it. I've always wanted to try DotNetNuke. It has a strong community and a lot of growth. Our team worked on SharePoint features for 5 months before we ditched it. Deployment and debugging are awful experiences. We had to resort to lengthy build scripts within Visual Studio and we used a few open source tools ( WspBuilder , SharePoint Installer , etc.) just to make the process half-way manageable. Maybe SharePoint will grow up and get real Visual Studio integration some day (I hear that is the plan with VS 2010). Until then, it is just too much trouble. The learning curve is steep and you will have to spend a lot of time searching XML config files to track down problems. SharePoint will probably make you despise XML configurations! UPDATE: Sharepoint is getting some much needed attention in VS2010. See: http://www.cmswire.com/cms/enterpr...
