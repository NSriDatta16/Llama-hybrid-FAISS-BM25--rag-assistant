Logistic regression model predicts only one outcome, producing a high specificity but very low sensitivity. How do I improve the model?

I'm designing a logistic regression model to predict hospital mortality. Why? To identify 'adjusted' odds ratios for a variable of interest on mortality. Methods: - set up using a training dataset (75% of total) I have started with 19 variables (dataset 1684 observations). Included all variables with p Using stepwise selection (stepAIC function in MASS package (R)) Testing for confounding using interaction terms for variables in later models When I run predictions on the test cohort (25%), I get the following model diagnostics: Sensitivity 12% Specificity 95% Accuracy 78% Looking at the confusion matrix, the model is predicting the outcome to be the largest class - leading to a high accuracy but very poor model overall. How can I improve the model? Possible solutions? Go back to drawing board and find 'better' variables that may be predictive of mortality? Balance the data in the training data set via up/down sampling?
