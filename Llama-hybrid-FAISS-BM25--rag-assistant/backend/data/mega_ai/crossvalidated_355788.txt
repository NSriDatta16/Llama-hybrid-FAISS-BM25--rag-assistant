How do I extract transformed axes from a PCA on spectral data to carry out further analysis and determine important wavelengths using R?

I am using R to work with a large set of spectral data from 48 different samples (a combination of different types of waste fines and soils) and trying to determine if these can be differentiated by spectral characteristics. I've trimmed, smoothed, binned, visually analysed,identified peaks, plotted, and carried out a PCA to explore/reduce my data. I've included plots for a few of my samples below: This is where I get stuck. I think I'm interpreting the results of my PCA correctly - following is a small sample: wavelength PC1 PC2 440 0.21346388 -0.203888840 465 0.23812642 -0.165769920 490 0.25535560 -0.115942621 515 0.26409500 -0.042751356 540 0.25571588 0.072759577 565 0.21329858 0.240141788 590 0.14779569 0.354308668 615 0.11800394 0.406438803 640 0.05287909 0.459469282 665 -0.06526022 0.430522967 690 -0.17874835 0.292308921 715 -0.22794663 0.179020759 740 -0.25105080 0.109572330 765 -0.26113417 0.059239926 790 -0.26531615 0.007708572 815 -0.26462611 -0.031793585 840 -0.26069395 -0.061597354 865 -0.25497653 -0.083364774 890 -0.24827131 -0.097537491 915 -0.24270352 -0.105792034 According to my PCA results, PC1 explains 71% of the variation in spectra and PC2 explains 22%. I've decided to select values greater than 0.25 (or less than -0.25) as indications of relative importance, so 490-540nm and 740-890 for PC1 and 590-690 for PC2. I've also plotted the loadings as follows: The problem is that I don't know how to proceed from here. Peers have suggested I extract transformed axes from my PCA to see which wavelengths are important, and other suggest I carry out further analysis on the PCA results. I've tried researching both of these and keep coming up blank, hence my question. Can any of you brilliant minds advise me as to how to extract transformed axes using R or what other kinds of analyses I could carry out from here? Many, many thanks in advance.
