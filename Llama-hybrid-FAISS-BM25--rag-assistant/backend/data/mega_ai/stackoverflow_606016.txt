According to the C99 specifification (C99: TC3, 6.4.5, ยง5), string literals are [...] used to initialize an array of static storage duration and length just sufficient to contain the sequence. [...] which means they have the type char [] , ie modification is possible in principle. Why you shouldn't do it is explained in ยง6: It is unspecified whether these arrays are distinct provided their elements have the appropriate values. If the program attempts to modify such an array, the behavior is undefined. Different string literals with the same contents may - but don't have to - be mapped to the same memory location. As the behaviour is undefined, compilers are free to put them in read-only sections in order to cleanly fail instead of introducing possibly hard to detect error sources.
