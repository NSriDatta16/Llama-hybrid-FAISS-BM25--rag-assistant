which predictive model should I use if column is having string values?

I want to create a predictive model to predict a categorical value (1,0) but the independent variables are also having few string columns (country, location, age) which I feel are important for the prediction and should be included. Which model should I use, will Linear Regression work? till now I did regressions which only had continuous or discrete value, is there any norm to address values which has columns with string values ? Below is the similar question been asked before, but unfortunately I didn't get much information Regression Analysis with String values in column of DataFrame I am in an initial phase of learning and practicing machine learning please spare me if this question breaks the eligibility of valid question. Please provide some insight, any source of help will be appreciated!!!
