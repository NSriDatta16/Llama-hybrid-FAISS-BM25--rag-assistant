Organising code that includes php and javascript files

I have a website where I am including a php library file and a javascript library file. I have condensed the problem to the following files: index.php '); show_const_2();"> Some text here constants.php lib.js function show_const_1(string) { alert(string); } function show_const_2() { alert(' '); } The result is that when the page loads I get two message boxes. The first says "Hello World" and the second says " ". The first javascript method does what I want it to, but I will be using the function in many places across the site and so ideally I don't want to have to pass the constant as a parameter every time. Is there a good way to rearrange the code to make the second javascript method work?
