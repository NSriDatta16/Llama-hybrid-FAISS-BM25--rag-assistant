How to define loss function for an unbalanced dataset?

I use neural network to do classification. But instead of outputing one label, I want to ouput four independent labels such as [-1,1,1,-1]. Each of them is either 1 or -1, indicating a classification for a specific part of my input(image). However, I have about 3/4 -1s and 1/4 1s in my dataset, so the network tends to predict -1 everywhere, I use a simple mean square error loss now. What can I do to avoid such situation? THX!
