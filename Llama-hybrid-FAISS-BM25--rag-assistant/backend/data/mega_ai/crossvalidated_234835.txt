Unimodality Test for Discrete Distribution

I have several collections of discrete datasets of integer values, say, from 1 to 10, inclusive. I am interested in characterizing the various distributions in these datasets, and it is important for my purposes whether each distribution is shaped unimodally or multimodally. I am not interested in the explicit discrete mode in the sense that, for example, 8 is the most common value. Rather, I am interested in whether each distribution is shaped unimodally or multimodally. For example, what I would call a unimodal shape: And a bimodal shape: Obviously, the above two distributions exhibit very different shapes. And, as you can see, some of the datasets are very large, containing tens or hundreds of thousands of values. The discrete nature of the datasets is somewhat problematic because the most common test for unimodality, the Hartigan-Hartigan Dip test, assumes a continuous distribution. I am not a statistician, but it appears as if this is a rather rigid assumption. I tested an R implementation of the Dip test on what appeared to be some (artificial) perfectly unimodal discrete data and detected an incredibly small p -value, suggesting that the data was actually multimodal. The two other commonly mentioned tests for unimodality appear to be the Silverman test and the excess mass test. I know little about the latter, but this explanation of the former seemed to hint that the Silverman test applies to discrete data, although it was not said explicitly. So, my questions: 1) Am I thinking about this in the right way? Is "unimodality" the correct term here? 2) What is/are the best statistical test(s) to use for my data? Is the Silverman test an appropriate choice? 3) As I am not a statistician, where, if possible, might I find an already working implementation of the above statistical test (ideally Python or R)?
