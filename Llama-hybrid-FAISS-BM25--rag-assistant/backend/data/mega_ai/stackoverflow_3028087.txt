Berkeley DB java edition, any LGPL or BSD alternatives in Java?

I am dealing with a huge dataset consisting of key-value pairs. The queries are always in the form of range queries on the key space (keys are numbers) hence any persistent B-Tree like structure will handle the situation. I would like to use BDB-Java Edition but the product is closed source and my company doesn't want to buy BDB-JE License. I am wondering, would you please share your experience with any non-GPL java based key-value storage system. Thanks, -A
