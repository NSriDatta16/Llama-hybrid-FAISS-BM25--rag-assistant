What is the correct caption label for a code fragment?

I'm currently working on my Dissertation for my degree, and in writing my report, I don't know how to caption my code fragments correctly. For example... ==================================== Diagram/Image: "Figure 1 - My Diagram" Table: "Table 1 - Tabulated data" Code: "????? 1 - some pseudocode" ==================================== What would you replace the question marks with?
