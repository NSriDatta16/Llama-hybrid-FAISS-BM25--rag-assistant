is Google App Engine-MapReduce my best bet for a massively parallel solution in a cloud?

Is Google App Engine-MapReduce my best bet for a massively parallel solution in a cloud? My problem takes hours multi-threaded on a 4 core PC. I'd say 600 minutes might do. I would prefer 1000 servers get it done in 36 seconds. Switching from 4 core threading to 1000 server processing is eminently doable in my app. In fact, I can already send 1000 small jobs to 4 cores but it's not going to get done sooner than 4 big jobs to 4 cores given that I still have only 4 cores. (My dataset is small so Map-Reduce, which was designed for large datasets, might have a different sweet-spot than my type of compute-bound problem.) I think I can get this done if I have 1000 simultaneous URL fetches but as you may know Google limits at 10 requests. It seems Google is actively discouraging outsiders from putting massively parallel solutions on their infrastructure. I started looking into Google App Engine because upon deployment there will be very few users and it appeared App Engine has fine-grained costs - a feature I really like. My impression was that Amazon EC2 would be more work but also that costs were more likely to be chunky. Given that I'm a home-based business, I don't want to pay anything more than a nominal amount when in the early months I don't expect a lot of visitors to my website. May be they will never visit. In general, where do people turn to for massively parallel (compute-bound) problems that ought to be served by a cloud?
