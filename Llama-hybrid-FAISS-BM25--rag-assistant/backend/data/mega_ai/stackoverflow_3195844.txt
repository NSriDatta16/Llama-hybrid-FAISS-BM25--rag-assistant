WPF Slider layer issue

I'm using a WPF slider and have basically used it to implement a "Pull out control". Basically it's a slider control with two positions: 0 and 1 I have this control on the far left side so what you initially see is the thumb position at 0. The user can then drag it out to the 1 position to see the full view of the slider thumb. I have an issue where if you notice, the slider is laying over another control and since this is the case, we are unable to interact with the underlying control. What I've tried: Within the default style, I've tried to apply the HitTestVisible property on the track to be false; as well as other possible elements. However since the thumb, it would make the whole control not HitTest'able. |*------| 0 1 Any ideas on how I can somehow make the slider control HitTestVisible=false while also making the Slider thumb HitTestVisible=true.
