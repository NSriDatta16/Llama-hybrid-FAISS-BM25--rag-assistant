(I will address the second question.) NO While you no longer have to collect data on the variables who coefficients are estimated as zero, eliminating those variables and refitting will (or at least can) change the other coefficient estimates. During the minimization of the LASSO loss function, the features that wind up "dead" still contribute by setting their coefficients to be zero. I find it plausible that the math could work out to give that the penalized coefficient estimates happen to be the same as the unpenalized coefficient estimates for only the surviving features. That would be an elegant result, but it happens not to be correct.
