Intervals from an underdetermined nonnegative linear system

I'm working on a problem in genomics that yields the following puzzle. Let $b\in \mathbb R^I$ , $t$ and $p\in \mathbb R^J$ , and $s \in \mathbb R^{I\times J}$ . Suppose $t,b,p$ are known. Further suppose: $t_j = \sum_i s_{ij}$ $b_i = \sum_j p_j s_{ij}$ $s_{ij} > 0$ What's a simple, efficient way to infer, for all $i$ , $j$ , the narrowest interval $[\ell_{ij}, u_{ij}]$ that is guaranteed to contain $s_{ij}$ ? $I$ and $J$ will both be at most dozens and often much less, but I will want to repeat this hundreds of thousands of times. I tagged this as causal statistics even though it's not causal statistics because I know that very similar problems arise in the binary instrumental variable model when bounding the average causal effect.
