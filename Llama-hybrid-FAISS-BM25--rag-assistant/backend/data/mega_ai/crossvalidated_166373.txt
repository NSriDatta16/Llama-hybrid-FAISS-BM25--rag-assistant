I agree with @EdM's, and here's another perspective. In my experience with multiple imputation, getting the overall estimate has been very straightforward. It's the uncertainty part that's tricky. For an overall estimate in general, as @EdM said, you'd average over the estimates obtained from each imputation. For the model coefficients, this is trivial as it's just an arithmetic mean of a bunch of numbers. For the survival functions, however, you might have to think a bit, especially if PROC MIANALYZE doesn't have a ready-made solution for survival situations (i.e., it's not Bear Grylls). In that case, I believe you'll have to fix covariate values at specific values and estimate the survival curve using the model fits from the various imputations. Perhaps you'll want to evaluate points on a fixed grid, and then finally average them to get a pointwise average curve. But to me, the interesting part of multiple imputation is the variance adjustment, as you've literally made up data and need to pay a penalty for this in your reported uncertainty. "Rubin's Rules" make this straightforward whenever Wald-type statistics (estimate / se) are available, but I don't know how you'd do it for Kaplan-Meyer survival curve estimates.
