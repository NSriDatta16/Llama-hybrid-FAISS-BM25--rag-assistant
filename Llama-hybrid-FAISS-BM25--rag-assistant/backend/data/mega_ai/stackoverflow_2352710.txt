In this case, like in many others, I prefer dependency injection : have your class (e.g in its __init__ ) accept the DB connection as an argument. This makes it easier and cleaner to test, lets you switch strategies as needed (e.g. to move to a "pool of DB connections" strategy if you find otherwise you're making too many DB connections at once), and distributes responsibilities more accurately and flexibly. In general, I think of Dependency Injection as probably the most important Design Pattern that was not listed in the great "Gang of 4" book!-)
