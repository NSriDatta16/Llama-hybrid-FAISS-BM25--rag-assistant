I would think a time series analysis would be best. There is a great deal of dependency between measurements based on time, so time is an important factor. You could also consider a linear mixed model, which would allow for dependency within a predictor. One word of caution: Next time you set out to do a study, you must determine the analysis that you will be conducting before collecting data. An IRB should not have approved this study without a plan of analysis. Determining the analysis before collecting data will help to uncover any experimental design issues.
