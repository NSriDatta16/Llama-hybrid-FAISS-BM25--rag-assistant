So, I wrote an app once that had to adjust various parameters in an image based on the value of a slider and there are a couple of things you can try. First, cache your images. You are loading them from disk each time which will be much slower than retrieving them from memory. Only load from disk when you have to. Second, don't add and remove controls, instead you can just use existing controls to display the images and change the image/resize the control(s) as needed. Third, double buffer your display logic. It may not help you much in this case because you are blitting them to the screen in one shot anyway, but it's worth a try. Fourth, you could use a timer instead of the value changed event of the spinner. When the user drags the slider start the timer and, in the timer Tick event perform your logic. When the user lets go of the slider stop the timer. This way you can control the maximum update speed. In the end I had to get right at the image data directly to perform my image manipulations because GDI+ was just a bit too slow. Again though, you're not actually changing pixel data, so a bit block transfer (blt) should be fast enough. I hope some of that helps.
