Running Variance Inflation Factor(VIF) iteratively for a large number of features taking a long time

I am trying to do logistic regression on a dataset with 1,500 features that are very multicolinear. I care about interpretability of coefficients so I am running a VIF calculation on all columns and eliminating the highest VIF at each step until I reach about 1000 features. This process even for one step takes a very long time computationally. Is there a better or more efficient way to eliminate multicollinearity on a large number of features to prepare them for interpretable regression? Thanks
