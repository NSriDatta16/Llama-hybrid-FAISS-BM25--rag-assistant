With the same predictors in all of your models, the basic rule for the pooling step of multiple imputation is : The pooling step consists of computing the mean over the m repeated analysis, its variance, and its confidence interval or P value. So in your case, the "mean" etc. would be for each regression coefficient in the Cox models. (It's not clear in your question what you mean by "estimate the probabilities from each imputation.") Calculating the p -values properly might require information about covariances. I don't use SAS, but a quick look at its manual page suggests that PROC MIANALYZE is designed to do what you want. It would seem to work best if you do the analyses in a way that maintains the special data-set structures that SAS uses to keep track of covariances in multiple imputations. (That's certainly the case for the mice package in R for multiple imputation.) EDIT: In response to the revised question, an important issue would be the distributions of survival probabilities among the imputations, as they might not be as amenable to pooling among imputed models as the regression coefficients are. For example, if some probabilities are very close to 100% or 0% then simply taking the average of the probabilities is likely to lead to trouble, particularly in calculating the p -values for differences between groups. You will be better off by following the standard imputation procedure for pooling multiple models into a single model, and then getting the estimates of survival probabilities from that single pooled model.
