Within the overlayMap , add a draggable marker to display the frame of the RectangleOverlay , and a non-draggable marker to display the semi-transparent box itself. Then, add bindings to some of the maps' events to update size and position of the markers, i.e. the maps' bounds_changed , drag , and/or center_changed events. Finally, update the location of the maps when the frame is dragged by binding a function to its dragend event.
