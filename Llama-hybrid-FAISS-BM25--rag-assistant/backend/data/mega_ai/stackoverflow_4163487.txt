Adding to Alberto 's answer: Here is a small demo: $ cat a.sh # the script a.sh just exports a variable foo export foo="$1" # with it's value set to first command line argument. $ echo $foo # currently variable foo is not set. $ . ./a.sh $(pwd) # source the script passing it pwd as argument. $ echo $foo # variable foo is now set. /home/codaddict $ pwd # the present working directory. /home/codaddict
