machine learning model true negative rate is too low while true positive rate is too high

I am using the tm package and h2o package to do text mining using neural network. Here I have a data frame of 100 most frequent words in the text. These variables only have values of non-negative integers. I am predicting a binary variable called "response". After multiple attempts, my true negative rates remain very low. Here is the confusion matrix: Confusion Matrix for F1-optimal threshold: __________0 1 Error Rate 0 10049 83784 0.892905 =83784/93833 1 3272 134237 0.023795 =3272/137509 Totals 13321 218021 0.376309 =87056/231342 As you can see, the true negative rate is too low and true positive rate is too high (137509 actual 1s and 93833 actual 0s). i even attempted decision tree method but result is similar. I want to have a better balance between these two values. I am not sure if this is caused by the data itself or my original frequency data frame. How should I tune the parameters/what better ML model should I use? Also, I performed table function on my original data. The percentage of 1 is indeed $59\%$, not $94\%$.
