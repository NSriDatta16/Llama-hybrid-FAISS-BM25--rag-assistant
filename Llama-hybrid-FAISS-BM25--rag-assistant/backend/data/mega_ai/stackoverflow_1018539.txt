One tip I've seen is to turn off Auto-create stats and Auto-update stats before doing the bulk insert: ALTER DATABASE databasename SET AUTO_CREATE_STATISTICS OFF WITH NO_WAIT ALTER DATABASE databasename SET AUTO_UPDATE_STATISTICS OFF WITH NO_WAIT Afterwards, manually creating statistics by one of 2 methods: --generate statistics quickly using a sample of data from the table exec sp_createstats or --generate statistics using a full scan of the table exec sp_createstats @fullscan = 'fullscan' You should probably also turn Auto-create and Auto-update stats back on when you're done. Another option is to check and defrag the indexes after a bulk insert. Check out Pinal Dave's blog post .
