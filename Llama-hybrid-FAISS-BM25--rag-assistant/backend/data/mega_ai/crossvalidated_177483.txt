A bilinear function (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilinear_map ) is a function that is linear in each variable when all other variables are fixed. For instance, $f(x, y) = x y$ . Your $p(y \mid x)$ is log-linear if $f(x, y)$ is linear in $x$ and $y$ . It is log-bilinear if $f(x, y)$ is bilinear in $x$ and $y$ . See slide 9 of http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~hinton/csc2535/notes/hlbl.pdf and slides 17, 23, and 24 of https://piotrmirowski.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/piotrmirowski_2014_wordembeddings.pdf as reference.
