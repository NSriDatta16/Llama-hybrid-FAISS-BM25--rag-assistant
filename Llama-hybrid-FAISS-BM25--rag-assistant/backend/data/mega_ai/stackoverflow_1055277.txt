Remember that o(1) does not mean that each lookup only examines a single item - it means that the average number of items checked remains constant w.r.t. the number of items in the container. So if it takes on average 4 comparisons to find an item in a container with 100 items, it should also take an average of 4 comparisons to find an item in a container with 10000 items, and for any other number of items (there's always a bit of variance, especially around the points at which the hash table rehashes, and when there's a very small number of items). So collisions don't prevent the container from having o(1) operations, as long as the average number of keys per bucket remains within a fixed bound.
