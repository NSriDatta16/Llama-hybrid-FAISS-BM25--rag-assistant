If you create an Audio element using: var a = new Audio("my_audio_file.wav"); And add a suspend event listener via: a.addEventListener("suspend", function () {console.log('suspended')}, false); And then load the file into mobile Safari (iPad or iPhone), you'll see the 'suspended' get logged in the developer console. According to the HTML5 spec, this means, "The user agent is intentionally not currently fetching media data, but does not have the entire media resource downloaded." Calling a subsequent a.load(), testing for the "canplay" event and then using a.play() seems like a suitable method for auto triggering the sound.
