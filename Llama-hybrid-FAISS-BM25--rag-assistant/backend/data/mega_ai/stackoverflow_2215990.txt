I've found one workaround. While using ActiveRecord to store the session, add ActionController::Dispatcher.middleware.delete Rack::FacebookSession ActionController::Dispatcher.middleware.insert_before( ActionController::Base.session_store, Rack::FacebookSession, ActionController::Base.session_options[:key]) in an initialization file, like config/initializers/session_store_fix_facebooker_session_key.rb This has been done on by someone else before and he explained it on a message on the Facebooker group on but it doesn't work with the cookie session storage, Rail's default .
