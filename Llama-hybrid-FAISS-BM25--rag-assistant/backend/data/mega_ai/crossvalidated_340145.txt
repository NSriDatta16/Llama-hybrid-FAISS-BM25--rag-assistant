Survival probability given an average life expectancy

How can I obtain the probability that one person will die at or before a certain age if I only have the average of the life expectancy? For instance, a person is 45 years old. The life expectancy is 60 years. Can I find the probability the person will die at age 45 (not before 44, but not after 45)?
