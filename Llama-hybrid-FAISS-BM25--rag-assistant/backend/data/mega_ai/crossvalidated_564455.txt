On the question: Should I make any data transformations? Yes, take a subsample and apply an analysis of transformation routine (research, for example, the Box-Cox method here). As to whether you should use poor explanatory variables to improve your predictions, my answer is it depends on whether say variables are understandably fundamental to the nature of the dependent variable and there is a good explanation as to the current poor correlation. If not, just work with the dependent variable possibly in a transformed state (and then reverse the transform albeit interpretation issues may arise). Speaking somewhat generally, this likely will, with time, produce a lower average error measure. I hope this helps.
