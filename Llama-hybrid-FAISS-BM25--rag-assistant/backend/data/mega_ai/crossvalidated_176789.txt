I dig a little and found that G Power does have a section on logistic regression in the supporting manual ( G Power 3.1 Correlation & Regression, 2009) ) Here are explanations for the parameters based on that manual. This will help to get the conceptual part but you may still struggle with specific numbers to enter. Odds ratio & Pr(Y=1 | X=1)H0 : These two are to calculate the effect size. "Given the conditional probability p1=p(Y=1|X=1) under H0, we may define the effect size either by specifying p2=(Y=1|X=1)under H1 or by specifying the odds ratio OR =[p2/(1-p2)]/[p1(1-p1)]." R2 other X : "The sample size N is multiplied by (1-R2), where R2 is the squared multiple correlation coefficient when the predictor of interest is regressed on the other predictors," i.e., "The proportion of variance of Xj explained by additional predictors in the model (R2 other X)." X distribution, X parm mu, & X parm sigma : These are about the predictor distribution. "The power of the test also depends on the distribution of the predictor X, the 'X distribution' and its parameters need to be specified. Users may choose between six predefined distributions or select a manual imput mode. Depending on this selection, additional parameters must be specified" (see the original manual for details).
