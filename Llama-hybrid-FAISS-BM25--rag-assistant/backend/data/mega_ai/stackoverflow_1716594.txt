If the schema was large, I think i would be relying fully on a SQLMetal script to generate my *.dbml and backing classes. This way you can just regenerate your entire data model whenever your database gets updated. Otherwise, if a table, view, etc, gets updated in the database you don't have to delete and then re drag-and-drop that table into your visual *.dbml file. Actually, I am not expert with SQLMetal, but I think you can even use it it to generate everything you need for Linq-toSql and not even require/generate a *.dbml file.
