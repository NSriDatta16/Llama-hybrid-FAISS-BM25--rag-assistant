There is this excellent free online book on the subject, which covers indexing, queries, scoring, ranking, PageRank and everything else on the subject really. It's really very good. It covers the theory and practice of search engine technology and information retrieval. An essential read if you are diving into the nuts and bolts of a search engine, like Lucene.
