I would take a look at the Telerik reporting http://www.telerik.com/products/reporting.aspx Reports are just C# classes and you can modify the reports easily by writing your own code inside the report, you can also for instance create a base class and have all reports inherit from that. I would think you could leverage this level of flexibility to meet your needs.
