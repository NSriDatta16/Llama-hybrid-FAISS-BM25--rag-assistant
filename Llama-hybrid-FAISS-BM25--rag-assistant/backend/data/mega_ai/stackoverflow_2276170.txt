In Xcode development, a UI element, or "view" is in front of another view when it is a subview of that view. For example, if view B is a background and view C is a control, to place the control above the background (i.e. closer to the user), you would make view C a subview of view B. In Interface Builder, this is accomplished by dragging the control into the background. Essentially, you are looking at a tree structure, with the views in the background being near the root of the tree, and views in the foreground (closer to the user) being near the leaves of the tree. The Windows and Views document from Apple's iPhone developer documentation may help to clear things up. Note 1: You should almost never overlap individual controls, such as buttons and text fields. Doing so goes against Apple's user interface guidelines. You can , of course, still do this if you want to, but you need to be aware that you are stepping out of the safety zone. If you are simply writing a "normal" iPhone application, your best bet is to stick to Apple's way of doing things. Note 2: If, for some reason, you do need things to overlap in a specific way, you can make use of CALayer objects to keep everything properly ordered. CALayer objects are part of Apple's Core Animation technology.
