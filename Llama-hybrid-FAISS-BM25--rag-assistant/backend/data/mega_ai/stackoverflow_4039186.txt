I've been doing some research and here is what I have come up with: A QSystemTrayIcon cannot explicitly handle a drag/drop event. However there is a workaround based on the Spifftastic tray icon location method. You create a uniquely colored icon and place it as the icon for a brief moment and take a screenshot of it. Given that you know the color sequence for the icon, you can search through the screenshot and locate the particular icon's location. A transparent widget is positioned over the icon and is used as the drop target. I have yet to work at a few of the finer details of the operation but that is the gist of it. All things considered it is a hacky way of things but given that there are no other ways to do this I think it is acceptable. Fluffy App (written in C#) uses the Spifftastic method to locate the tray icon. I'm assuming the part about the transparent window is how they accomplish that but I have yet to decompile and examine their system.
