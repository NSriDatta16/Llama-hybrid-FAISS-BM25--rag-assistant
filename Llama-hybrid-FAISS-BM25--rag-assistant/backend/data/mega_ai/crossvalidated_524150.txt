How do I represent multiple values as one unique state in reinforcement-learning?

I'm currently teaching myself reinforcement-learning with Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction by Sutton & Barto. I'm a little bit confused, because you often have to combine multiple values into one unique state which can then be used for reinforcement-learning. How do I achieve this? Is there some kind of hashing-algorithm? Thank you for your help!
