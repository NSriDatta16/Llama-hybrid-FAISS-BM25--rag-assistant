Is there a way to delete files instantly on Windows XP?

On my Mac and any other Unix machine, when I delete a file by any of the several available methods ( rm on the command line, drag to trash, press delete key) it usually happens instantly. Occasionally it takes a few seconds if it's a huge file. On Windows, when I try to delete something a dialog comes up with a progress bar. On my machine the deletion can take 10 to 20 seconds or even more in some cases. Is there a way to perform a delete operation on Windows XP with no wait period? Also, is there a way to not have to click those "are you sure..." dialogs?
