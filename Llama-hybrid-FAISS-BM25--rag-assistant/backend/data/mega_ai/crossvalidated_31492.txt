Help me understand $p$-values in Bayesian glm

I am trying to run a Bayesian logit on the data here . I am using bayesglm() in the arm package in R. The coding is straightforward enough: df = read.csv("http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1791181/bayesglm.csv", header=T) library(arm) model = bayesglm(PASS ~ SEX + HIGH, family=binomial(link="logit"), data=df) summary(model) gives the following output: Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 0.10381 0.10240 1.014 0.311 SEXMale 0.02408 0.09363 0.257 0.797 HIGH -0.27503 0.03562 -7.721 1.15e-14 *** --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 (Dispersion parameter for binomial family taken to be 1) Null deviance: 2658.2 on 1999 degrees of freedom Residual deviance: 2594.3 on 2000 degrees of freedom AIC: 2600.3 Please walk me through this. I understand that this code uses a very weak prior (since I am not specifying the prior means) so the output is going to be practically the same if I used glm() instead of bayesglm() . But the output should still be in the Bayesian spirit, right? What are the $p$-values and $z$-values here? Aren't these frequentist inference tools? Are they interpreted differently here?
