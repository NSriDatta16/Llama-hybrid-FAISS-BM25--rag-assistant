It's not the most elegant of solutions but MS SQL Server uses the PK & FK prefix naming convention for keys so you could use something like... SELECT CONSTRAINT_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.KEY_COLUMN_USAGE WHERE TABLE_NAME = @TableName AND LEFT(CONSTRAINT_NAME,2) = 'FK' If that's your DBMS :) EDIT When I tried the answer by Quassnoi I got an "Invalid column name 'REFERENCED_COLUMN_NAME'." error.
