What is the best (most productive) FLEX IDE?

Some requirements: Step-by-step debugging & Break Points View variable values while debugging IntelliSense (auto-completion). Ideally done with "smarts" so it only shows you the syntactically valid options to complete something. E.g., Textbox. would trigger members of that class (.Text, .BackColor), etc. And then Textbox.BackColor= would trigger a list of valid colors. Drag'n Drop style GUI design. I'm not concerned about cost (Ok, over $1K gets a little pricey looking :-)
