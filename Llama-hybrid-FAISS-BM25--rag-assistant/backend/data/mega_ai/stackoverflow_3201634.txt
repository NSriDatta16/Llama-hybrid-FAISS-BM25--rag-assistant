I have not tried it (becaus I don't want to kill my Shop), but I think you can just change the Port in the Magento Admin. In System / Configuration / Web / Base URL. Just try to add the Port to the URL there. Does that work? You cannnot rewrite a URL that Magento writes in it's HTML Output using mod_rewrite. The Request to the wrong URL (without the :8080 Port) won't even reach your server. UPDATE: Look at the Source of the HTML output (i.E. go to your Shop with your Webbrowser and press CTRL-U or whatever). Do tags like the following have the correct URL, including the port?
