You could consider working with ARIMAX or SARIMAX models. These models will allow you to deal with any problem of autocorrelation. You can include autoregressive (AR) or moving average (MA) terms as needed, to eliminate autocorrelation. You can easily include any independent variables along with the AR and MA terms. You can model any seasonal behaviour as you need to account for fall or rise in population during holiday seasons or any other season. They usually provide good forecasts. If you are using independent variables, you will need data on those variables to make forecasts for the future. Dynamic forecasts can only be made if the model is purely AR/MA process.
