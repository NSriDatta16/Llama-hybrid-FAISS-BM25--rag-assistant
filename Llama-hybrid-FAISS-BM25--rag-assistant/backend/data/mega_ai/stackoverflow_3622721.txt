Indentation in WPF TextFormatter

I'm making a WPF text-editor using TextFormatter. I need to indent some paragraphs, so I'm using the Indent property from the TextParagraphProperties class. This works great in this scenario: Regular text without any indentation. This paragraph has a uniform indentation so everything is ok. But I also need this: John: This paragraph has a diferent indentation in the first line. Joe: So I don't know how to make this happen. I found the ParagraphIndent and FirstLineInParagraph properties, but I don't know how they works, or if then would be usefull. Thanks in advance!! Jose
