Problem Implementing Simple StructureMap Config

I just started digging into StructureMap and am running into some problems getting my config up-and-running. It seems that when I try to register Plugins in their respective PluginFamily they aren't being found by StructureMap. I've gone over many examples on the web but can't seem to see where I am going wrong. Can another set of eyes see what my problem is? Thank you so much for your time. --Charly [TestFixture] public class BooleanCustomFieldTest { [SetUp] public void SetUp() { log4net.Config.XmlConfigurator.Configure(); ObjectFactory.Initialize(x => { x.PullConfigurationFromAppConfig = true; }); } [Test] public void StructureMapCanCreateAnInstanceOfBooleanCustomField() { ICustomField field = ObjectFactory.GetNamedInstance ("Boolean"); Assert.IsNotNull(field); Assert.IsInstanceOf (field); } }
