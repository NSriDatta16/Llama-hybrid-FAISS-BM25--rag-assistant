Best approach for model selection Bayesian or cross-validation?

When trying to select among various models or the number of features to include for, say prediction I can think of two approaches. Split the data into training and test sets. Better still, use bootstrapping or k-fold cross-validation. Train on the training set each time and calculate the error over the test set. Plot test error vs. number of parameters. Usually, you get something like this: Compute the likelihood of the model by integrating over the values of the parameters. i.e., compute $\int_\theta P(D|\theta)P(\theta)d \theta$, and plotting this against the number of parameters. We then get something like this: So my questions are: Are these approaches suitable for solving this problem (deciding how many parameters to include in your model, or selecting among a number of models)? Are they equivalent? Probably not. Will they give the same optimal model under certain assumptions or in practice? Other than the usual philosophical difference of specifying prior knowledge in Bayesian models etc., what are the pros and cons of each approach? Which one would you chose? Update: I also found the related question on comparing AIC and BIC. It seems that my method 1 is asymptotically equivalent to AIC and method 2 is asymptotically related to BIC. But I also read there that BIC is equivalent to Leave-One-Out CV. That would mean that the training error minimum and Bayesian Likelihood maximum are equivalent where LOO CV is equivalent to K-fold CV. A perhaps very interesting paper " An asymptotic theory for linear model selection " by Jun Shao relates to these issues.
