If you are using ivy from ant and you are running Ant 1.6 or later, you could use the task to include build file fragments within your ant build file. The referenced files have to be complete Ant build files, though: ... ... You could also use standard XML syntax from within your ivy.xml or build.xml file: ]> ... &common; ... This will literally include the contents of common.xml where you've placed the &common; entity. (The filename common.xml in this example is resolved relative to the containing XML file by the XML parser. You may also use an absolute file: protocol URI.)
