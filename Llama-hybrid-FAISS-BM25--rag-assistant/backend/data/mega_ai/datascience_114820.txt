adding conditional variables

I am working with NBA df. I have columns with total stats for each player. Stats(columns), total careeer only, are: games played, points, rebounds... There's 17 of them. Here's what it looks like for Michael Jordan. player games played points rebounds Michael Jordan 1072.0 32292 6672 I'm trying to develop a model (neural network???) that will point a future All Star player. My question is should I add columns with career averages for each player? So that I would divide each career total statistic by 'games played', e.g.: 'points' / 'games' = 'points per game' and repeat it for each total staistic. Would that be something helpful for my model or would it be unnecessary? How should I know if adding columns is an added value to a model?
