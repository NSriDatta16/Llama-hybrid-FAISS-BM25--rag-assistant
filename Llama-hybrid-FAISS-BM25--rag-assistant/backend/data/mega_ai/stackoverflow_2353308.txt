Saving things to the executable of the applications (so it will be there on next application launch) in C#

Alright, so I know about the Settings.Properties.Default.* Stuff, but thats not what im trying to use.. I'm trying to develop my own class, ill show you: public sealed class SettingsHolder { public SettingsHolder(){} public T Setting { get{ /*return setting*/ } set( /*store setting*/ } } } so then i could compile that to a dll, and reference it in an application, and do something like this SettingsHolder stringHolder = new SettingsHolder (); stringHolder.Setting = "hello world"; and on next application launch string welcome = stringHolder.Setting; and welcome should = "hello world".. is this at all possible? i had origannally tried to disect the actual properties.settings class, but with no luck
