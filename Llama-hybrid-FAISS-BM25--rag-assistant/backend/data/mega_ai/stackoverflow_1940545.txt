Convert rss pubDate to EST in .NET

I am trying to convert the pubDate in the Rss to EST. If you look at the links posted below, they have different timezones. Is there a function which takes any type of dateformat and convert to EST ? http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss http://www.cricinfo.com/rss/content/story/feeds/0.rss http://feeds.latimes.com/latimes/entertainment?format=xml http://newsrss.bbc.co.uk/rss/newsonline_world_edition/business/rss.xml
