Before going to the specifics of the method, first we need to understand the two classes of feature selection: 1. Univariate: where we consider the input features one by one. 2. Multivariate: where we consider a group of variables together. In many cases univariate feature selection can produce good enough results and like all things in machine learning "there is no free lunch" kicks in and you have to decide everything based on data. For example, in the chessboard problem (often also known as XOR problem) in feature selection as shown in figure below. Both X and Y would not be able to distinguish the two classes red and black; while both of them taken together can distinguish the two. This video from over 10 years before explains this should be give a good introduction http://www.quizover.com/oer/course/introduction-to-feature-select-by-isabelle-gu-videolectures-net Including this article http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/guyon03a/guyon03a.pdf by the presenter herself.
