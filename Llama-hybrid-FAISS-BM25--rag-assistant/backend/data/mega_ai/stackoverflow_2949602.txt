Python / Django : emulating a multidimensional layer on a MySQL database

I'm working on a Django project where I need to provide a lot of different visualizations on the same data (for example average of a value for each month , for each year / for a location , etc...). I have been using an OLAP database once in college, and I thought that it would fit my needs, but it appears that it is much too heavy for what I need. Actually the volume of data is not very big, so I don't need any optimization, just a way to present different visualizations of the same data without having to write 1000 times the same code. So, to recap, I need a python library: to emulate a multidimensional database (OLAP style would be nice because I think it is quite convenient : star structure, and everything) non-intrusive, because I can't modify anything on the existing MySQL database easy-to-use, because otherwise there's no point in replacing some overhead by another.
