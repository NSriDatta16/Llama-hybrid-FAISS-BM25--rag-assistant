Stepdown deleting non-significant arima structure married with stepup remedies base upon the "current set of model errors" possibly incorporating both arima structure and waiting to be discovered Intervention variables https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/09c4/ba8dd3cc88289caf18d71e8985bdd11ad21c.pdf is quite useful as is described here Is it possible to automate time series forecasting? and here where @Adamo opines Interrupted Time Series Analysis - ARIMAX for High Frequency Biological Data? Essentially arima model identification starts with the assumption of a simple mean nodel and then recursively adds structure that appears to be evidented/needed and proceeds until signal is separated from noise including stepping up when evidence is present regarding lack of constancy of the model error variance or lack of constancy of parameters over time . Modelling time series is much like peeling an onion to get to the heart of the matter i.e. the underlying sufficient signal.
