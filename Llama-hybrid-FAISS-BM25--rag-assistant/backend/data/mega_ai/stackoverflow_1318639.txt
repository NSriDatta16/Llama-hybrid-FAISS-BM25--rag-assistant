You can find a full comparison here: http://www.pragmaticworks.com/products/business-intelligence/dtsxchange/DTSxChange-vs-MSWizard.htm At a high-level, the existing Microsoft wizard does not handle some common tasks like Dynamic Properties Task. It also doesn't handle things like ODBC or all the flat file conditions. With the DTS xChange tool, it will migrate pretty much all conditions, re-engineer the logging and auditing framework of the package and turn on some of the new features in SSIS. It also includes BI xPress, which will help migrate ActiveX Scripts post-migration with code snippets.
