Don't just clone all the nodes. Dijit widgets are JS objects associated with the DOM, so simply renaming and copying DOM nodes after the fact won't work. Instead, clone the code (dojo.clone on a DOM node) before Dojo parses and instantiates the widget. I think you'll find this much simpler in the end. To do this, you would have to call dojo.parser.parse() manually on the document and/or fragment(s) If you had this snippet in a string, you could just insert it in the document twice with innerHTML then call parse() You'd still have that one id="save" to deal with. You could assign an id value to that button manually, either with string manipulation or using dojo.query. Don't forget, you'd probably want to do the same for the form name to make it unique.
