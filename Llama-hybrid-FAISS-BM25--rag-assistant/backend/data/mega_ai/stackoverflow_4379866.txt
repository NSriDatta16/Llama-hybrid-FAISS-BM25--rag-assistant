Quick question about storage on android

This is my first question relating to android development. I would like to know the best way to go about storing an array on an android phone so that even when the app/activity is ended the data remains, I thought about doing it using a SQLite db, but have not been able to find any information about how to keep this database even when the app has ended. Any advice would be apprectiated, thanks. Sam
