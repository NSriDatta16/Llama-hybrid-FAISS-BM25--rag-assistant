In general an ANOVA or MANOVA is only able to analyze data without any missing cells. One possible design, which is often used would be to also test the healthy controls at two-time points, in parallel with the patients. That way the clear effect of the medication (and not just of the time passing) can be identified. An additional possibility would be to use a Bayesian Regression instead of a MANOVA. In case a MANOVA can be used, a regression and a MANOVA are completely the same, however, a regression is more flexible, being able to work with missing data, incomplete cells etc.
