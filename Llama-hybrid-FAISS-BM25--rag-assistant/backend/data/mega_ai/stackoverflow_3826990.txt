Assuming your view is called ExampleView. Click on the file owner and then press ⌘+4. This will highlight the identity box. Make sure that the class name is the same as the name of your class. Save and close Interface Builder and then go into Xcode and verify: // ExampleViewController.h #import @class ExampleViewController; @interface ExampleViewController : UIViewController { IBOutlet UILabel *label; } @property (retain, nonatomic) IBOutlet UILabel *label; @end In your .m file: // ExampleViewController.m #import "ExampleViewController.h" @implementation ExampleViewController @synthesize label; Then save the xcode files and open up your ExampleView.
