We use both methods at my work, but slightly different, we keep all sales data in the primary table for 30 days, then at night (part of the nightly jobs) the days sales are rolled up into summaries (n qty of x product sold today ect) in a separate table for reporting reasons, and sales over 30 days are archived into a different database, then once a year (we go on tax years) a new archive database is started. not exactly perfect but.. this way we get the summaries data fast, keep all current sales data at hand and have an unlimited space for the detailed archive data. we did try keeping it all in one database (in different tables) but the file size of the database (interbase) would grow so large that it would drag the system down. the only real problem we have is accessing detailed data that spans several database, as connecting and disconnecting is slow, and analysis has to be done in code rather than sql
