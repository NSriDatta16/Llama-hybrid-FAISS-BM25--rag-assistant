Why volume preservation is important for Metropolis update?

I think my question is naive but I would like to ask why why volume preservation is important for MCMC and specifically Metropolis update.I'm reading the following paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1206.1901.pdf where it says The significance of volume preservation for MCMC is that we neednâ€™t account for any change in volume in the acceptance probability for Metropolis updates. If we proposed new states using some arbitrary, non-Hamiltonian, dynamics, we would need to compute the determinant of the Jacobian matrix for the mapping the dynamics defines, which might well be infeasible. where the Metropolis update for HMC is defined by $\alpha=min\left \{1,exp\big(-H(q^{*},p^{*})+H(q,p)\big) \right \}$ where $q$ denotes the position and $p$ denotes the momenta and $(q^{*},p^{*})$ is the proposed state. What would be the problem for $\alpha$ if we had different volume for the proposed $(q^{*},p^{*})$ .
