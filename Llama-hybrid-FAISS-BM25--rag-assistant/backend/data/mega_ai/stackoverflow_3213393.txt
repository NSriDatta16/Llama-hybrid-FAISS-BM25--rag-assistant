I looked for something similar a while back and ended up building my own. There are docking frameworks out there, but that was not what I was looking for. I used the FabTab on codeplex as a starting point. I removed the features we didn't want and added others, like dragging from one tab control and dropping it on a second to move the tab, and having tabs on all 4 sides at once, if desired.
