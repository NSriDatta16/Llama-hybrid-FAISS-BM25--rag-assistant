A params array is the obvious answer. An alternative is to create a class to represent the criteria. You could then use collection initializers, something like: bool result = myCollection.Contains(new Criteria { { 2, Item.Balloon }, { 4, Item.Cupcake } }); But if that's not useful either, we definitely need more information in the question. If you could provide an example the syntax that you'd like to call the method with, that would certainly help us.
