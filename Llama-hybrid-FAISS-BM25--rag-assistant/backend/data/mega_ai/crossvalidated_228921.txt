First: "Remember that all models are wrong; the practical question is how wrong do they have to be to not be useful." Box, G. E. P.; Draper, N. R. (1987), Empirical Model-Building and Response Surfaces, John Wiley & Sons. Thus there is no one and only correct way to model your data. The research question is broadly inquiring about the association of background type on the perception of category, however there are 2 distinct questions: Is background=3(face) associated with response=0 (face) (research hypothesis: Yes) Is background=2(object) associated with response=1 (object) (research hypothesis: No) Your setup is factorial. You are varying the levels of factors ( Category , Noise and Background ) and measuring the response for different combinations of these. Your particular interest is in the association of background (a 3-level factor) with the response (a binary variable), therefore a logistic regression analysis would seem to answer the questions. The estimate for background=2 answers the question: what is the difference in the log-odds of responding with object when the background is an object compared to when the background is black. This answers research question 2. To be consistent with the research hypothesis, this estimate should be small and/or not statistically significant. The estimate for background=3 answers the question: what is the difference in the log-odds of responding with object when the background is a face, compared to when the background is black. The negative of this estimate is therefore the difference in the log-odds of responding with face when the background is a face, compared to when the background is black. This answers research question 1. To be consistent with the research hypothesis, this estimate should be small and/or not statistically significant. However, that is not the end of the story.... Obviously you have repeated measures on participants, and this needs to be controlled for, since the responses of one participant will be more like other responses of the same participant, than those of other participants (that is there is likely to be correlation of measurements within each participant). This can be controlled for by including random intercepts for Participant or by including Participant as a fixed effect. 5 is considered by many as the minimum number of levels for a factor to be used as a random effect and since you intend to add more participants to the study, this would be my recommendation. Either method controls for repeated measures so you could run both models and I will present both below. You also have repeated measures on each picture, where each picture is measured 3 times. Thus there may also be correlation within each picture. Since you have 420 different pictures, it would not be a great idea to include picture as a fixed effect to control for this, so a random intercept is appropriate. So, my starting model would be a mixed effects model with random intercepts for Picture_ID and Participant , with fixed effects for Category , Background and Noise (with noise being coded as numeric). Participants are not nested within pictures, and pictures and not nested within participants so these are crossed random effects. In R using the lme4 package, this would be specified as: glmer(Response ~ Category + Background + Noise + (1|Participant) + (1|Picture_ID), data=dt, family=binomial(link=logit)) Due to the small number of participants, an alternative model is: glmer(Response ~ Category + Background + Noise + Participant + (1|Picture_ID), data=dt, family=binomial(link=logit)) The analysis can be extended to allow for: interactions between the fixed effects non-linear association between the response and Noise (by including quadratic and possibly higher order terms for Noise) the association of Noise to vary between participants and/or picture (by including random coefficients for Noise) The above is based on contrasts of the desired background with the black background - that is face vs black and object vs black . If face vs object is required this can be handled by recoding the factor or specifying the reference level directly. If face vs not face or object vs not object is required then this can easily be accomplished by creating dummy variables.
