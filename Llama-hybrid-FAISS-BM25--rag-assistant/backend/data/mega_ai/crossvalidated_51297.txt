There seems to be no conjugate prior for the Poisson regression model ( see ). However, you can use any proper prior on $\lambda$ that reflects your prior knowledge on it. For example: Gamma distribution, log-normal distribution, exponential distribution, among others. If your prior information is vague, then you can use a heavy-tailed prior, for instance a half-Cauchy distribution with scale parameter $\sigma=5$ (you may want to try with larger values). In order to simulate from the posterior, you can employ the R package mcmc and the command metrop() where you simply have to input the log-posterior, up to a proportionality constant, and adjust the variance of the proposal to obtain a reasonable acceptance rate. If you want more details, please post your sample or a simulated sample. Using the posterior sample you can calculate and compare several estimators such as Maximum a posteriori (MAP), the posterior mean, the posterior median, and etcetera. Although the use of these estimators may not allow for an explicit expression of the posterior, the simulation step is reasonably fast and therefore you can run a simulation everytime you add a new observation.
