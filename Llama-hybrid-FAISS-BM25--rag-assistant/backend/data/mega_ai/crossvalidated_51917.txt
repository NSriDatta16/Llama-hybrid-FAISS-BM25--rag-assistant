Using the appropriate machine learning algorithm

I am not sure if this is the right forum to ask this. I have some data of the houses, like their size(in square meters), if they use aircondition, how many residents live in, I have their electricity consumption as well. I want to train any Machine Learning Algorithm to the dataset above, in order to create a model that estimates the houses consumption. I tried many different algorithms (using weka tool), but I did not have good results. I was said that SVMs could solve this problem, with the right preprocessing. However, i did not have good results either. Can anyone help me, in the way i should approach this problem? Thanks in advance
