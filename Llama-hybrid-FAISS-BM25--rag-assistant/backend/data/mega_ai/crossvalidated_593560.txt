The Cochran Armitage Test-for-Trend is just the score test for a logistic regression with a single continuous adjustment for the ordinal category. As a test, it is most powerful when the trend is in fact logistic linear (i.e. follows an S shape), and when the distribution of counts is inversely proportional to the variance for a particular stratum. These aren't "assumptions" per se. One can show that, even if the trend were monotonic, even if not linear, then the "trend" slope-of-best-fit is some non-zero value and so the test still has power. You could robustify the test by fitting said logistic model and estimating the robust sandwich-based standard error and associated p-value. For your data, if one were to plot the influence and leverage functions for these observations, we could see it's the last "extremely important" category that has the highest impact on the analysis, where the proportion deviates from the homogeneous 50% that's typical of the first 4 categories. Where I think you've gone wrong is that it seems to me that the "X" variable should be gender and the "Y" variable the ordinal Likert response. Fitting a simple T-test, or cumulative logit model should tell you if there's a difference in the average response from men and women which is more sound.
