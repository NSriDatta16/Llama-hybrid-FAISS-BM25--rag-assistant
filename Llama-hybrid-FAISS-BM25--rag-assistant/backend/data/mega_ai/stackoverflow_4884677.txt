BlackBerry persistent-store data lost after OS update

I am creating a BlackBerry application that starts automatically when the device starts, and it uses the persistent store to hold data. After updating the OS version, the application does not run on startup and if I start it manually, there is no data in the persistent store, and the program crashes. So what is happening... 1. when auto-run setting is lost during OS update? 2. when persistent storage is lost? and how do I solve this?
