You can not avoid the re-creation of the form, if the form is to be processed by Drupal. It is a central part of Drupals form processing workflow : Every form is at least build twice, once for initial output, and at least once again when the post from the client comes in. It can even be more than that, depending on what the form does afterwards, e.g. on redisplay when any validation errors occurs (Usually a cached version gets used by then, but that depends on the specific form). What you should do is follow Simons suggestion - on the first call to your form builder function, make your API calls and store the results in $form_state['storage']['yourIdentifier'] ('yourIdentifier' being some string not used by standard form processing - usually starting with your modules name). On every call to your form builder function, you check if that results are already in $form_state['storage'] . If they are, you just use those, skipping the API calls. This will avoid the duplicate API calls, and gives you more control on how/when to do them (e.g. you can also clear those results during validation, if a special condition calls for a refetching from the external API).
