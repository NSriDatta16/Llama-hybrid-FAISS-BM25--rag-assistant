The only time I've done something like this in production code was when a collegue and I built a pre-processor so that we could embed XML fragments from other files into a larger XML. On load we would first parse these embed (file references in XML comment strings) and replace them with the actual fragment they referenced. Then we would pass on the combined result to the XML Parser.
