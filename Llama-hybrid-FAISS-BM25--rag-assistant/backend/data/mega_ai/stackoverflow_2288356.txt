how to create a loop in a function with another function?

I'm new to Java and I'm doing a uni course. I've been asked to design three functions.I have to find the difference between each adjacent numbers in an array, another to total the array and the last one to calculate the difference using the other functions then write a programme. I'm totally lost on the last function and my tutor has gone away on hols. Here is the code I have done so far. I don't want people doing the code for me but if anyone can advice me what I need to do I would appreciate your advice. I'm not sure how to loop the difference function into the array and store it into the new array I have made. If anyone could explain where I am going wrong I would love to hear from you! var numberArray = [10,9,3,12]; // function difference will find the highest value of the two numbers,find the difference between them and return the value. function difference(firstNumber, secondNumber) { if (firstNumber > secondNumber) { return (firstNumber - secondNumber); } else { return (secondNumber - firstNumber); } } // function sum will add the total numbers in the array and return the sum of numbers. function sum(numberArray) { numberTotal = 0 for (var total = 0; total
