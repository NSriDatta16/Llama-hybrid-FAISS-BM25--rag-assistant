Share a Kohana install between sites

Hey all, kind of new at Kohana and I have a quick question. I have a site where there will be three subsections, organized by subdomain (i.e. admin.site.com, community.site.com, www.site.com) but each of the subsections will be pulling from the same database so should be sharing the same models. Is there a way to organize it so that I can use the same Kohana model/system/module files for each of the subdomains, but keep the application folder separate? Something like: /home/user/admin/ application/ bootstrap.php cache/ ... index.php /home/user/community/ application/ bootstrap.php cache/ ... index.php /home/user/public_html/ application/ bootstrap.php cache/ ... index.php /home/user/kohana/ modules/ ... models/ ... system/ That way I can keep Kohana up-to-date across three sites with only one update, plus I can use the same modules and model classes. Is there any way I can make this happen? Or is there some other method I should be using? Thanks!
