type of the neural network

I am developing a neural network for a binary classification task. I am using the following code: model = Sequential() model.add(Dense(200, input_shape=(9,), kernel_regularizer=l2(0.1), activation='relu')) model.add(Dense(80, activation='relu')) model.add(Dense(40, activation='relu')) model.add(Dense(2, activation='softmax')) # lr was 0.0001 # optimizer was RMS prop model.compile(optimizer=SGD(lr=0.01), loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy']) model.summary() Is this considered an MLP, feed forwards, or what exactly is its name ?
