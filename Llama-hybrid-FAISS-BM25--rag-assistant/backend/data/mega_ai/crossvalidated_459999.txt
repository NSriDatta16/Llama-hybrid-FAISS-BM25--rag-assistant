Dr. Raoult's statement is false. A bigger dataset (on your domain of discourse subject) is always better. It yields a better average, thus better certainty. You may apply the principle of charity. Probably what he is trying to say is: A small (but most significant) sample set is better than a bigger (but less significant). Imagine you are sampling hydrochloroquine efficacy in treating patients with Covid-19, but you sample randomly (without testing for Covid-19). This'll yield a misleading average. From a scientific point of view, in general, you should ignore non-scientific press.
