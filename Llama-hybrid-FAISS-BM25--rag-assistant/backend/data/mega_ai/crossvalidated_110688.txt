Binary Logistic Regression Methods

I have data sample size of almost 15,000 cases. The dependent variable is a dichotomous variable stating whether the patient has the disease or not, Yes=1, and No=0. I have 12 more independent variables which are continuous as well as dichotomous. My question here is, before I apply the logistic regression, I need to know which parameters have a great impact on the DV; how do I do that? Secondly, there are 7 different methods of using binary logistic regression like enter, forward conditional, forward LR, etc; what is the basic difference between these? I couldn't find any matter on this on the internet.
