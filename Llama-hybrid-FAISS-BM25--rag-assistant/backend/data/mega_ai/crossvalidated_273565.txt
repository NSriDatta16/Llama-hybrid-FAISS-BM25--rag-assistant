Is it a sin to plot data when you don't have a test set?

Let's say I have an Excel workbook containing data I want to analyse. I plot the data in Excel and see it has roughly a linear shape. Therefore, I use Excel to draw me the fitted line and brag to my manager that I found some new insights. Unfortunately, if the plot had roughly the shape of $x^2$, $x^3$, $\sqrt{x}$ or $e^x$, I would have probably also recognized it. Through the plot, my mind automatically tried to fit any of those models and probably others ($log(x)$ for instance) which could lead to overfitting. Can I plot data, look at the plot, fit a model, and get reliable results if i don't have a test set? More generally, should ALL statistical analysis have a test dataset ?
