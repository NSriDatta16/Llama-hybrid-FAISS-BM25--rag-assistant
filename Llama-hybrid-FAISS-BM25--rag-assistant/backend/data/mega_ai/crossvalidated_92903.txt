Intercept term in logistic regression

Suppose we have the following logistic regression model: $$\text{logit}(p) = \beta_0+\beta_{1}x_{1} + \beta_{2}x_{2}$$ Is $\beta_0$ the odds of the event when $x_1 = 0$ and $x_2=0$? In other words, it is the odds of the event when $x_1$ and $x_2$ are at the lowest levels (even if this is not 0)? For example, if $x_1$ and $x_2$ take only the values $2$ and $3$ then we cannot set them to 0.
