glmStepAIC model is doing better that other models

I am training a model on an imbalanced dataset (about 5-20% of positive class) and trying out different algorithms in R using caret package. I have 57 predictors and around 2000-3000 observations in my training dataset. So far, I tried several models and got ROC and AUC PR plots for these models: I see a lot of criticism of using Stepwise Logistic Regression with R and I do understand that there are indeed a lot of problems with it. At the same time, I see that it is doing rather well and I am not sure how to interpret it. May it be that I do something wrong with training other models? I am using repeated 5-fold cross-validation: objControl Any guidance is highly appreciated. Thank you!
