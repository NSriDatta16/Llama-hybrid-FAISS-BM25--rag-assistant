How to run a time series model based on select seasonal data only

I have a time series dataset for electricity load demand as follows: datetime load 2017-01-01 00:00:00+00:00 483.52698 2017-01-01 00:05:00+00:00 480.69008 2017-01-01 00:10:00+00:00 480.28880 2017-01-01 00:15:00+00:00 478.72021 2017-01-01 00:20:00+00:00 476.37618 ... ... 2021-08-30 22:40:00+00:00 951.17640 2021-08-30 22:45:00+00:00 946.24726 2021-08-30 22:50:00+00:00 940.98128 2021-08-30 22:55:00+00:00 935.02204 2021-08-30 23:00:00+00:00 929.44998 The data is by 5 min increments. Instead of running a traditional SARIMA model accounting for the seasonality (monthly), I'd like to instead run 2 seperate time series models, 1 for summer and 1 for winter, so for example the summer time series model would only look at data from Jun-YEAR - Aug-YEAR. This data would not be continuous in that the final day in August would be followed by June 1st of the next year. Thus would I have to re-index the data? I'm not clear how to account for this when only comparing certain months in a time series and having the gap from end of the final month to beginning of start month of the following year (ex: 8/31/2019, 6/1/2020).
