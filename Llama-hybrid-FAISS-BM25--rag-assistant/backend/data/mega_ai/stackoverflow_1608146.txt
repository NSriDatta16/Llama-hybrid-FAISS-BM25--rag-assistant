Thanks to everybody for the answers and comments. I think I sorted out the problem. It was actually related to interaction between native C++ and C# layers in my application. The object that was supposed to be displayed in XtraGrid was created in C++ layer, the grid was displayed asynchronously with object construction/deconstruction, that's why at the moment when the grid was ready to display it, the object itself didn't exist. Hence the rubbish. It's good the grid itself was not crashing or firing exceptions.
