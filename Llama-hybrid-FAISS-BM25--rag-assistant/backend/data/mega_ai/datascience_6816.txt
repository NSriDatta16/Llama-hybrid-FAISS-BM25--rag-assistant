What are the features to distinguish two short term signals (time series)

Imagine that I have a set of short term time series data (signals) with different shapes and parameters. I would like to extract/select a set of features (parameters/functions/indeces) to identify each sequence and distinguish between them. Such features are simple features e.g. max and min value, mean, variance, start and end value, etc. or more complex ones e.g. entropy, no. peaks, power spectrum, etc. I am looking for more "representative" features to express the signals and distinguish them. What features do you know (in signal processing or data mining fields) that can represent a parameter in signals? For example, in the following image, there are two signals with the same parameters such as mean, min-max values. But what are the features that differ them (for instance no. peaks, but generally what else?)
