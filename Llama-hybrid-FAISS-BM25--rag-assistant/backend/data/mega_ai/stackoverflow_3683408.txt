You could detect it on server side by looking into UserAgent property of the Request object. That should work with most mobile browser but will require writing a couple of "or" statements. For example to detect an iPhone you can use something like this if (Request.UserAgent.Contains("iPhone")) { // load iphone specific JS/CSS here }
