Choosing one method for modeling Value at Risk (VaR) over another - determining the "best" model

I estimated the Value at Risk of a time series of log returns with different approaches and models. Now I want to compare the models and chose the model that most accurately estimated the Value at Risk. Question: How can I determine which model is best? Which model should I choose? My current approaches are: Example plots and VaR backtesting approaches (e.g. the unconditional (Kupiec) or conditional (Christoffersen) coverage tests for the correct number of exceedances). But I don't know how to choose one model over another, e. g. the VaR backtesting for all methods suggests that I can not reject the Null Hypothesis. Thanks! I have related questions: Evaluate Value at Risk (VaR) models with different VaR backtesting approaches - averaging p-values?
