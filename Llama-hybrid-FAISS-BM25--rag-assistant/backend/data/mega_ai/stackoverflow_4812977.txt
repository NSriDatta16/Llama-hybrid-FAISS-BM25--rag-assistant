android - UI like sliding down notification bar

I want to develop a panel with animation same as notification panel. I mean to say the notification panel is a cool control where you grab and slide down the notification bar and see all the notifications. Actually, I am having 2 UI , 1st should be shown with Button at top, when user click on that button, the 2nd UI with listview items should be slide down same as notification panel and again when user click or drag the 2nd UI at the top side, then 2nd UI should be become invisible. I hope i made clear my question. From Christian's answer , I am trying to use a sliding drawer that will display a list of options. I need this to expand over the current ListView on the page. So if anybody know how to implement such layout or UI with sliding down animation then please share it. Please suggest how to build with such control or layout? any ideas or suggestions Thanx
