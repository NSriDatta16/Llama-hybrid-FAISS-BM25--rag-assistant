AFAIK, gcov works by preprocessing your C or C++ source code. If you have pure assembly language files, I don't think gcov ever sees them. If it does, I'd be suprised if it understand how to safely insert code in arbitrary-target assembly code, with ARM being common enough so there's a faint chance. The problem with instrumentating assembly code is the test coverage probe code itself may require registers, and there isn't a safe way to know, for an arbitrary piece of assemblers, a) what registers are available, and b) if there's an inserted instruction, will some other instruction break because of the extra space (e.g., a hardwired jump relative across the inserted instruction).
