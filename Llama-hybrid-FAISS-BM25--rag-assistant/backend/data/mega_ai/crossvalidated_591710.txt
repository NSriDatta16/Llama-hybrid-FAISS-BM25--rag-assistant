What deep learning methods should I explore for my panel data where one country is fixed?

The data looks like the following image and is available from 1980 to 2019: As you can see, nation 1 doesn't differ in any of the panels; only country 2 does and the country 2s for each panel remain same. What deep learning technique should I to explore to create a research report on it? I've seen a post on this site that recommended using LSTMs for panel data, but I'm not sure if that's the best strategy for my dataset. I did more research on LSTMs, and it appears to be suitable for my goal of prediction based on all values given its reliance on long term memory. Can someone guide me please? Edits based on comments: I will have >70000 observations. In the worst case where I restrict the time series range, I will land up with 20k observations. I understand that this might be less, so I am open to the possibility of allowing variation in country 1 and then using the model for prediction of my current country. I have around 6-10 variables (features) that determine the "Value" column in the table.
