Just think about the fact that you have a 10:1 class ratio and yet your interest is in zero-one loss, that is, maximizing the proportion of cases correctly identified. The accuracy of a trivial model that just guesses the modal class for every case would be 10/(10 + 1) = 91%, which is pretty high. In order to substantially beat 91%, as with 95% accuracy, you need one or more highly predictive features. If you don't have any, as is often the case in real problems, the best you can hope for is quite small improvements on 91%. In a nutshell, this problem is too easy for statistics or machine learning to be able to get you much more predictive power. Possibly I can give you more specific advice if you add details .
