Problem:fetch product URL in a custom Module: Magento

I have created a custom module in magento and wants to show products with their URL as links. I am trying in this way :- for ($counter=0; $counter loadByAttribute('id',$products[$counter]->product_id); echo $_product->getProductUrl(); } but the $_product->getProductUrl() function always return a url which is not related to none of the loaded products. Can you guys inspect it and let me know what I am missing? Thanks.
