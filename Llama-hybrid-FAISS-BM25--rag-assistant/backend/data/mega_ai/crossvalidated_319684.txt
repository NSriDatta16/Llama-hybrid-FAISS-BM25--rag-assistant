Data visualization is always a great way to start. Here is how I would approach it. Since you are only interested in before noon - limit all data from 6am to noon. Run three different ANOVAs (delay time as dependent variable, aircraft carrier as independent variable) for each airport. Or you could run one model including airport as another main effect along with the interactions. Examine residuals for severe violations of model assumptions. Investigate the output to see which airlines are significantly shorter in flight delay. Will need to do some multiplicity adjustments. Googling ANOVA and R will give you plenty of material. There are other questions to consider such as do I want to almost guarantee a delay time of less than 30 minutes compared to no delay time at all? This, I believe, requires more advanced models. To answer this I would use a Bayesian approach in JAGS and compute theses posterior probabilities. However, for your sake, I think you can just focus on least square means from the ANOVA models.
