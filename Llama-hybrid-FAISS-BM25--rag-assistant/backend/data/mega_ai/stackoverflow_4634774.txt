Android memory types (RAM v Internal Memory)

On a separate thread I demonstrated my ignorance of memory types by asking about the best way to copy a file into "internal memory" and was advised that this was not a good idea and that it would be better to read the file into "RAM". I am now trying to understand how these two types of memory are related and how they can be used. I understand that "internal memory is perceived to be the flash that is used to store APKs, ROM images, etc." The specification for my HTC Hero says that there is "ROM: 512MB, RAM: 288MB" with no indication of how the RAM is subdivided. On the phone the "Settings"->"SD & phone storage" page simply refers to "SD card" and "Internal phone storage" and for the latter just shows one amount for "Available space". The Android Reference for Data Storage mentions "Internal Storage". This is a place where "you can save files". The page also mentions SQLite database files which I think can be stored in the "Internal storage". However, the page doesn't seem to offer any explanation of the sub-division of RAM between Internal Storage and another (presumably more dynamic) type. Is there some kind of dynamic division of the total RAM (288MB on the Hero) into two sub-divisions which are usable in different ways? If so, where in the Android documentation is this explained?
