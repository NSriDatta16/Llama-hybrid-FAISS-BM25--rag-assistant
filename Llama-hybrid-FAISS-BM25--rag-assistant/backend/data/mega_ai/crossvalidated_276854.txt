First, depending on the source of the data, you may want to do some normalization (standardization, integral normalization, etc.) to make the spectra comparable, specially across biological replicates. (Also possibly background/baseline correction.) I would start with your approach (3) and plot the results in a low dimensional space (MDS or PCA) just to see if the technical replicates are not too dispersed, and cluster together. As I understand, in both (1) and (2) you end up with the same number of samples (=25), and the standard procedure is to average the technical replicates. You may find this article describing biological and technical replicates to be of help. But again, I believe that the signal preprocessing may have a strong effect. In some cases (e.g. hyperspectral imaging) it is valid to use all "replicates" (e.g. pixels) from each sample, although supervised methods are commonly employed.
