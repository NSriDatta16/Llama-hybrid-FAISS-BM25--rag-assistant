I recognize that this might be tangential to the OP's question, but this may be helpful in feeding Google. One use that I've found for UIView tagging is actually not to find a view by the tag in the view hierarchy (which as referenced above, can become quite expensive), but rather to discriminate two or more views from each other by a delegate that's assigned to handle several of them, as a way of avoiding a ton of property assignments (which can certainly make UIViewController code more tightly coupled). A classic case of this is a UITableViewController whose UITableViewDataSource delegate has been externalized to a separate class. Say the UITableViewController later wants a search bar added, and wants to leverage the same UITableViewDataSource. What that means is that UITableViewDataSource methods will be called, and the data source will need to frequently discriminate the real UITableView from the searchResultsTableView on the UISearchDisplayController. If the UITableViewController set a tag on each of the table views, then the data source could easily branch behavior based on the tag value, and without needing references of the table views or (worse,) the search display controller. Again, I realize this wasn't exactly the tree up which the asker was barking, but it's the only use case I find myself really feeling good about using tags.
