You'd need to implement a lookup table with the alternate names in it: Base | Alternate ---------------- Robert | Bob Elizabeth | Liz Elizabeth | Lizzy Elizabeth | Beth Then search the database for the base name and all alternates. You'll end up with a number of multiple matches which will then need to be checked to see if they really match based on a comparison of whatever other data you have in the two databases. Maybe the dates of the records in each database could be used - records entered close in time indicate the same person.
