In your case, if I understand you correctly, customer login (within the same day) is considered the poisson process. Then, you might want to quickly check see if the time interval between 2 logins follows an exponential distribution. but do you have timestamp per login per customer_id? on the other hand, if the motivation is just to get the expected number of logins for any given person on any given day. You can first take groupby average by customer_id. then check the distribution of the customer_id level lambdas. and decided whether you want further take an average to get point estimate of the lambda for the population. or give a confidence interval estimate. or even overlay other customer level data (demographics maybe) to get more insights.
