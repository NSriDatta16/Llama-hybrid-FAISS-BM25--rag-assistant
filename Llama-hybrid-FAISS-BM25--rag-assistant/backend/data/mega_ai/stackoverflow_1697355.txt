Java Class AudioFormat: Byte ordering

I'm working with java, trying to use the AudioFormat Class. I have the following piece of code: AudioFormat Baseformat = input.getFormat(); AudioFormat Finalformat = new AudioFormat(AudioFormat.Encoding.PCM_SIGNED, Baseformat.getSampleRate(), 16, Baseformat.getChannels(), Baseformat.getChannels()*2, Baseformat.getSampleRate(),false); AudioInputStream stream1 = AudioSystem.getAudioInputStream( Finalformat, input); numBytesRead = stream1.read(audioBytes) Where audioBytes is an array where the data bytes are stored. I need to know how those bytes are organized. In Finalformat I'm specifying PCM enconding, stereo and 16 bits per sample. That means that for a given time instant there are 2 samples (1 for each channel) and each sample has 2 bytes. How are these bytes arranged? If audioBytes = AABBCCDD, which bytes belong to each channel and what is the byte order of each sample? An example of the explanation I'm looking for is: AA BB is the left channel; AA is the low order byte. Thanks to everyone who reads this.
