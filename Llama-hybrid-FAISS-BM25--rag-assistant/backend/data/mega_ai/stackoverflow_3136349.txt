vs Microsoft the anti XSS library

With .net 4 there's a new script enclosure that's like but does an html encode. People are encouraging the use of this new syntax. My question is, does protect against XSS better or as well as using the Microsoft Anti XSS library? A Microsoft security person once told me to never just use HTML Encode as it doesn't protect very well and that I should always use the Anti XSS library (or another library). Is that still true with ? Or can I confidently use knowing it's going to protect my app from XSS like people are saying?
