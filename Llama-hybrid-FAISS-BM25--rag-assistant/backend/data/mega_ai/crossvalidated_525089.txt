Our professor suggested that the second alternative $$ RMSE^{M}(\hat{\Phi}, Te)=\sqrt{{1\over n}\sum_{j=1}^{n}{1\over \vert Te_j\vert }\sum_{x_{i}\in Te_j}(\hat{\Phi}(x_{i})-\Phi(x_{i}))^{2}} \hspace{2cm}(2) $$ made the most sense as per the additive nature or variances you want to average them before taking the square root.
