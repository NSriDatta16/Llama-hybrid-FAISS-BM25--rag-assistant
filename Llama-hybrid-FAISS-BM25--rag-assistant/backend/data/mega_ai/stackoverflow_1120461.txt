I don't think that diagram is very good, and probably makes things a lot more confusing. The controller should be responsible for giving the Model to the View. The Model should contain nothing more than simple accessors for your data. Any need to interact with the Model - or change any of it's values - should take place thru the Controller. This way, the View only needs to know how to render/present the Model to the user. So any operations on the Model - things like saveFavoriteContactsToLocalStorage() - should be methods of the Controller, not the View class. Also, the Controller should not need a reference to the View to be constructed - I think that ends up reversing the intended order of the entire MVC pattern.
