Basically the latter. There is no need to test a class just because it is defined as a distinct class. If you are refactoring without adding any functionality or otherwise changing behavior, the only reason to add tests is if you lack confidence in a certain part of the code. Otherwise, the code is already under test, and the fact that it is tested via another class should not matter. That being said, there are times where the structure of the code has changed so much that for organizational purposes you want to move the test, so you can tell where this piece of code is actually being tested from. But that is a different question from saying that "this is an independent unit, so it must have independent tests."
