Why does WaitHandle implement IDisposable explicitly?

System.Threading.WaitHandle (and hence ManualResetEvent etc) implement IDisposable explicitly. This seems to discourage it's use (calling Close() achieves the same as casting to IDisposable and calling Dispose). I'm just wondering if there is a good reason for this?
