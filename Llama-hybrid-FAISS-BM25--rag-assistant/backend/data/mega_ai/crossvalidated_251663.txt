"How does an RNN ever learn the beginning of the sequence if its state vector is always random when learning the beginning or if it is polluted from the previous epoch of training on the end of some sequence?" Typically, the hidden state of the first timestep (often denoted by $\mathbf{h}_0$) is the same for all sequences: as a result, there is no pollution from previous sequences or randomness. It is often chosen to be a zero vector. FYI Learning initial state in RNNs
