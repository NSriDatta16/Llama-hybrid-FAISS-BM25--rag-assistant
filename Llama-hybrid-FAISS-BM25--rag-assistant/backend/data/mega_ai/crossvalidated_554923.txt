Finding independent predictors with multiple logistic regression

I am conducting a study in order to find independent predictors of a binary outcome variable (A=110, B=51). The main goal of this work is to verify if any of 14 variables are independent predictors when adjusted to 3 variables that I already now are independent predictors. Considering the one in ten rule I am able to use only 5 predictors in the multiple logistic regression model. So is it possible to do several multiple models with the same 3 variables and to enter 2 other variables at a time to get these 2 adjusted for the former? I have been trying to find studies using this approach but I couldn't find any so far (specially from medical literature which is my area of research). If you know any paper describing this approach could you share it with me please?
