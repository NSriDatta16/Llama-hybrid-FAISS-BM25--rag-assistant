So I have this same question coming up for myself. I don't have a good answer, but I'd like to throw up a couple possibilities to see how people shoot them down. 1.) Process in blocks. Take the regression for each block, doing some kind of weighted average at the end. 2.) Take advantage of svd of the covariance matrix of A having some relationship to the svd of A [U,S,V] = svd(A) [Uc,Sc,V] = svd(cov(A)) In both cases the matrix V is the same. If regression is Ax = y, and A is millions x hundreds array, performing the covariance of A first may be less efficient, but more memory manageable. I haven't figured out what to do after this step.
