Using a feature in prediction even if it gets zero as p-value?

I created two binary classification based logistic regression models and I got these results: Model 1: Accuracy: 67.51% AUC: 65.21% Model 2: Accuracy: 67,99% AUC: 65,70% The second model is created based on an additional column (Col_x). But, when I try to use the following code to show the correlation, I got the result: (0.16402709962654458, 0.0) from scipy import stats stats.pearsonr(data['y'] , data['Col_x'] ) I would like to know if I can considerate Model2 an improvement of Model1 even if I have a p-value = 0.0
