What tools can I use for Django Testing Automation?

I'm looking into automating a test runner which would do the following things daily (or hourly or whenever I want basically): Pull the latest code from a git repository. Run the Django test suite or something like Nose. Run Selenium tests. Give Pass/Fail and coverage statistics via a web interface. Email developers in the case of failures. What kind of setups are out there? I've seen some blog posts, but many are pre-Django 1.1 and I know that the test suite has been improved significantly with that release, so I'm curious what the latest and best options out there are.
