Yes, data science work do exist in domains of management and computer science. I think data science is a huge domain in itself to include in any of the curricula. So, I would explain how data science is used in the domains: Management: Data Science used in a lot of ways. I use data science and analytics in every phase of the customer acquisition and retention funnel; which includes designing models for using the customer event tracking data and identify patterns and predict churn. Here is an example article from the Moz blog, which explains about the use of deep for churn prediction and customer retention. Computer Science: Most of the data science has roots in computer science basics. However, including the concepts of distributed computing would help the students understand and appreciate the concept of Big Data, when they later enter the industry. So, I think data science is a huge domain in itself, and has it's share of unique applications in a wide range of domains. However, bulk of data science concepts and techniques have taken roots in math, stats and computer science basics and concepts. So, I think the knowledge of those domains would be helpful and suffice. So, these are some links which can help in curriculum re-design for accommodating data science concepts in the management and CS curricula: MBA speciality. Curriculum of the Data Science and Business Analytics program at the Santa Clara University. Curriculum of the Masters of Data Science in Virginia University. The third bullet is something very close to how data science can be included or blended with the Computer Science degree.
