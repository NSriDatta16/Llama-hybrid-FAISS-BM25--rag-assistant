One of the workable approaches: If you have sufficient data, and, you need to so this often, you can train your own custom NER model. Write a pipeline to match drugs and compare price and deliver a small app that solves the problem once and for all! Custom Named Entity Recognition models helps you identify a named entity from a given chunk of text. There are plenty of models available that provide out of the box support of healthcare related named entities, like, drug! Once you have extracted named entities like drug, dosage etc. (btw, dosage can also be solved by writing a regex), you can compare the cosine similarities to find the right match. You can try different word embeddings to have more accurate match.
