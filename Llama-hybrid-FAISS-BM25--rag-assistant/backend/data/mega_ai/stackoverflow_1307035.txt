Back in the day of K&Rv1, it was encouraged to use float/double interchangeably being as all expressions with floating-point types were always evaluated using `double' representation, a problem in cases where efficency is paramount. A floating-point constant without an f, F, l, or L suffixed is of type double. And, if the letter f or F is the suffix, the constant is of type float. And if suffixed by the letter l or L, it is of type long double.
