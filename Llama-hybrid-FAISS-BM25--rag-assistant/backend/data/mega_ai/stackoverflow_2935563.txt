HTML5 Web Storage Cleared when Browser Clear Cache?

Is HTML5 Web Storage cleared when the browser clears its cache? If it does, many people like me may lose data if they accidentally clear cache? or like in this comment ... Since HTML5 local storage is kept separate from js cookies (like Silverlight, Gears, Flash), it opens up a world of 3rd party privacy issues for HTML5 as these objects will likely NOT get deleted with a clear cache or delete temporary data ... where web storage is not cleared, but leads to privacy issues?
