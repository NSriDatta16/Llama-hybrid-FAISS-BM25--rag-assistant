If you just want to hack something out quickly, it's probably a bit easier to do at least some kinds of applications with Access than a web front end with a SQL (or whatever) backend. It is still being developed (Access 2010 was release within the last month or two, if memory serves). I haven't used the new version to say for sure, but the last time I did any looking, it seemed like new editions were mostly updating the look to go along with the latest version of office, cleaning up semi-obvious problems and bugs, but not a whole lot more than that. I wouldn't say it's dead, but I don't see much to indicate that it's really one of Microsoft's top priorities either. Trying to pin down it's biggest limitations is hard. The "JET Red" storage engine it's based around doesn't scale well at all -- but it was never really intended to. Its basic design is intended to conflate the application with the data being stored, so it's relatively difficult to just treat it as raw data to be used for other purposes. I don't know if it's still the case, but at least at one time, the database format was also fairly fragile -- file corruption was semi-common, and in most cases about the only hope of recovery was a backup file (which meant, at best, losing everything that had happened since the last backup -- and some forms of corruption weren't immediately obvious, so corrupt backups sometimes happened as well). It comes down to this: if one of the Wizards built into access can produce exactly what you want, or at least something really close, and you only ever need to support a few users with the result, it might be a reasonable choice in a few situations. If that doesn't (all) apply, there are almost certain to be better alternatives.
