This is a very interesting question. Suppose that we have a 2 dimensional covariance matrix (very unrealistic example for SEM but please bear with me). Then you can plot the iso-contours for the observed covariance matrix vis-a-vis the estimated covariance matrix to get a sense of model fit. However, in reality you will a high-dimensional covariance matrix. In such a situation, you could probably do several 2 dimensional plots taking 2 variables at a time. Not the ideal solution but perhaps may help to some extent. Edit A slightly better method is to perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the observed covariance matrix. Save the projection matrix from the PCA analysis on the observed covariance matrix. Use this projection matrix to transform the estimated covariance matrix. We then plot iso-contours for the two highest variances of the rotated observed covariance matrix vis-a-vis the estimated covariance matrix. Depending on how many plots we want to do we can take the second and the third highest variances etc. We start from the highest variances as we want to explain as much variation in our data as possible.
