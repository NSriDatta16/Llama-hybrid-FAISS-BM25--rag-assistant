R Calculate Deviance Residuals in a Logistic Regression

I am working on a project, where I want to build a function which performs a logistic regression but does not use the glm() function. I ran in a little bit of difficulties, when it comes to calculate the deviance residuals. I looked up the underlying formula, but it is quite hard to for me to apply it in R. I would appreciate every help in the regard. As my code is pretty messed up right now, we will assume that my own logistic regression function produces the same outputs as the glm() function but not the deviance residuals: This is an example where I calculated the Pearson Residuals by hand: x 0.75747 -1.24114 0.85700 -1.09700 0.96960 -0.96960 1.09700 -0.85700 1.2411498 -0.7574760 Check for correctness: print(resid(model1, type = "pearson")) 0.75747 -1.24114 0.85700 -1.09700 0.96960 -0.96960 1.09700 -0.85700 1.2411498 -0.7574760 If someone could help me using the arguments of the model1 to calculate the deviance residuals I would be extremely thankful!
