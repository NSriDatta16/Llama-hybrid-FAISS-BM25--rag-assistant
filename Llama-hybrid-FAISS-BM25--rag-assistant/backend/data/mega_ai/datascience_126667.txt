Improve text classification accuracy

Task: I am building a text classification for salary prediction for data science jobs. I want to achieve at least 70 percent accuracy. Data: Features: Consists of job descriptions of data science, data engineering, data analyst jobs of about 1800 samples Target: Target is the salary column binned into 5 different categories. I obtained this using the pandas q cut. The salary is heavily right skewed. Problem: The problem is that the models I train are always in range of 40 to 50 percent accuracy. I have tried different models like Random forests, SVM, Logistic Regression with Bag of words model and Tf-idf. But accuracy doesn't increase? Questions: Should I be trying different word embeddings like glove or word 2 vec?. Should I try better models or move on to try neural networks? Is the bad accuracy because the text data and my target is completely uncorrelated?. Should I try to different binning lengths for target and try different number of bins? The data also has some samples which unrelated to data science but have software engineering in their titles, should I remove those? [
