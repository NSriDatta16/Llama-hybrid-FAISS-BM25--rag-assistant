In terms of unsupervised methods , there are some advanced sparse PCA methods that are more suitable for image classification problems. Examples are structured sparse PCA (Jenatton etal. 2010) . Something that I have some experience with myself is sparse PCA with preserved sparsity (i.e., global/joint sparse PCA); a method that makes sure PCA selects the same features when the reduced dimension is larger than 1. You can find some code samples here . If you're interested in supervised methods , many use canonical correlation analysis (CCA) in a least squares framework to find a weight matrix for the features. This is essentially a feature selection scheme. Quick explanation of CCA: let's say you have N sample features of dimension d stored in a Matrix X and their corresponding N binary labels are stored in the matrix Y . CCA can provide a pair of weight matrices that minimizes norm( XW - YV ) , where W and V are the weight matrices. W can be viewed as a feature selection matrix. NOTE: Y doesn't have to be binary when using CCA. Therefore, many have considered using CCA for multi-class classification.
