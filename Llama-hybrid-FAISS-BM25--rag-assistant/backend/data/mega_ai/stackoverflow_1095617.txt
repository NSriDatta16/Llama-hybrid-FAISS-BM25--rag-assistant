Warning number guide in Visual C# 2008

What is a good resource for finding out the warning numbers in Visual C# 2008. I found this page: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/4wtxwb6k.aspx but it's very hard to sort through the warning numbers. I am trying to figure out which warning number to use for the warning disable pragma: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/441722ys.aspx Specifically, I am trying to find the one related to Missing XML comments for publicly visible types.
