How would you convert an $ARIMA(0,1,1)(0,1,1)_{12}$ model to equation form?

I'm still having some difficulty understanding how an $ARIMA(p,d,q)(P,D,Q)_m$ model is translated into an equation. Also, given some output (for example in R), how do the coefficients relate to the equation? In ordinarily least squared regression, it's pretty straight forward where B1, B2, etc... are the coefficients to their respective regressors. With time series it is a bit harder. Any resources for this?
