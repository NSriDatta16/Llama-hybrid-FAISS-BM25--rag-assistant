Prefixing private fields with underscore is basically the same thing as using "this.". However underscore is faster to use, shorter and more elegant to me (this comes from Java I believe). Having the same names for function parameters and private fields seems a bit tricky to me. Not only once have I forgot to use "this" which resulted in nasty NullPointerException (yes, I did java someday... :) ). As far as I know it doesn't violate any FxCop rule, as it's not a hungarian notation.
