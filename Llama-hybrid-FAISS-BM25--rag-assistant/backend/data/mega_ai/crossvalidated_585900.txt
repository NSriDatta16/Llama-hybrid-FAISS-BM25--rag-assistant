Interpretation of lasso shrinkage

In the case of the ridge estimator, we can interpret the shrinkage induced by the ridge estimator to be at its most extreme when a predictor has low variance. High-variance predictors provide the most information/signal about our response, and low-variance ones contribute to "noise" which should be shrunk down - reminiscent of a continuous version of PCA here. Is there a similar interpretation to the lasso? That is, how does lasso choose which covariates to shrink down and truncate and what does that imply about them? If a predictor is dropped by lasso, can we then suggest that that predictor was weak/low variance/irrelevant?
