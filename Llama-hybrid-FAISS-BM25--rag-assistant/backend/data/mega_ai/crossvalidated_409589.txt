Everything you will ever need regarding estimation of parameters in a state space model is in this document: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MARSS/vignettes/EMDerivation.pdf Kalman Filter/Smoother assumes that the parameters are known in advance so that the unobserved state can be estimated. The initial values for the state can be user supplied or a diffuse initialization approach can be used. For this the standard reference is: https://www.amazon.com/Time-Analysis-State-Space-Methods/dp/019964117X For the matrix parameters and noise co-variance estimation the standard procedure is Expectation Maximization which is described in detail in the first reference, and also in https://www.stat.pitt.edu/stoffer/tsa4/tsa4.pdf chapter 6.
