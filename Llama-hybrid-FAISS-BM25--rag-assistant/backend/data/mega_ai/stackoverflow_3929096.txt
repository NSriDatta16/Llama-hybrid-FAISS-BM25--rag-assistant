RAMdisk slower than disk?

A python program I created is IO bounded. The majority of the time (over 90%) is spent in a single loop which repeats ~10,000 times. In this loop, ~100KB data is generated and written to a temporary file; it is then read back out by another program and statistics about that data collected. This is the only way to pass data into the second program. Due to this being the main bottleneck, I thought that moving the location of the temporary file from my main HDD to a (~40MB) RAMdisk (inside of over 2GB of free RAM) would greatly increase the IO speed for this file and so reduce the run-time. However, I obtained the following results (each averaged over 20 runs): Test data 1: Without RAMdisk - 72.7s, With RAMdisk - 78.6s Test data 2: Without RAMdisk - 223.0s, With RAMdisk - 235.1s It would appear that the RAMdisk is slower that my HDD. What could be causing this? Are there any other alternative to using a RAMdisk in order to get faster file IO?
