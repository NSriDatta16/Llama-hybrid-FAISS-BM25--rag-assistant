Either: One comment table per Entity type Or: one master Entity tables with child Comments and EntityType specific tables. EntityMaster: EntityID, foo, bar Comments: EntityID, CommentID, UserID, ... PK is (EntityID, CommentID etc) For the 3 Entity tables, PK is EntityID EntityOne: EntityID, EntityTypeID (check constraint = 1), ... EntityTwo: EntityID, EntityTypeID (check constraint = 2), ... EntityThree: EntityID, EntityTypeID (check constraint = 3), ... There is no shortcut or elegance in having one comment table for 3 parents: it's wrong in database design terms. Personally, I'd probably go for option 1... Edit, on reflection: Sometimes you have to look at the usage of the data. If the 3 entities are used separately, on separate screens, don't link to each other then it'd be option 1. If the 3 entities are used and displayed together, then option 2 makes more sense because you can pull data together more easily.
