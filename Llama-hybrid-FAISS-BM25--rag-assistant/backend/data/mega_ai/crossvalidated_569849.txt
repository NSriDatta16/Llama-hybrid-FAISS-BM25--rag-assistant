Stuck with MC results if you validated your MC algorithms/codes I have worked for aviation industry for many years as an system safety & reliability engineer. 1 item per aircraft or does it have redundancy? Does any pre/post flight check for item A exist? What is the schedule of the fleet? What are the mission (flight) hours for each? Remove/Replace costs will differ in different airports due to parity ratio and time-to-replace differences probably. What are these ratios? if this item is safety critical & has redundancy, then you have a chance also failure of all A items & the catastrophic result. This is a cost also. and may be more constraints specific to item A... One of the most beautiful results with MC is you'll have %n confident probability values like: required spares per airport in order not to be in spare-shortage with a probability of %95 is n or, with a probability of %95, expected total cost for the maintenance of item A will be in $[C1,C2]$ for the new fleet flight schedule of 2023 is X. ... much more possibilities of reporting For your models: " The blue curve is Approach 2 (each interval is 100 hours) " seems problematic to me since 100 >> An average flight (mission) hours . It seems like a random choice to see smaller numbers which probably hurts the reality level of the model. "MC is looking at the possibility of the component failing once but also the probability that, in extreme case, the component could have failed 2 or 3 times at that interval ". If the item A has redundancy, it must consider the failure of any or more of them. This is what should be done actually. If the item A has no redundancy (single A per aircraft), then your MC code mustn't allow to produce $>1$ failures for item A. (validated MC code!) 10,000 component to asses the behavior of 1 and that the MC is providing additional insight on the component . If the meaning of the "of 1" phrase is "items A in the fleet" then yes, MC is providing additional insights on the component in the fleet domain. Else if the meaning of the "of 1" phrase is the item A solely, then no. (No additional info for item A that it's remove/replaceable with predicted Weibull parameters.) APPROACH #2 is ok since it doesn't use faulty/useless MTBF concept. observe that even I said that 100 hours choice in blue model may be faulty, it's more compatible with orange model. Stay away from green model. No point to know Cost per MTBF since time between failures varies with a Weibull distribution with an aging unit. ( $\beta>1$ ). Generally, stay away from MTBF. MTBF is a too strong blundering illness in reliability engineering world without any vaccine for masses. Lastly, you may wish to compare your MC results (I recommend) for various number of runs. For example results for 1e+3 runs, 1e+4 runs, 5e+4 runs etc.. to feel ok that the MC converged enough and increasing the number of runs won't add any plus value. Good luck with your decisions.
