Best approach for detecting human in a picture

I am trying to detect if an image contains human or not. I will use CNN for this. I am planning to make a dataset like following. Train human (contains 2000 or more human image) other object (contains 2000 or more non human image) Test human (contains 500) other object (contains 500 ) I am planning to use keras and I will train data from directory . Is there any alternative approach ? Because I am having trouble with collecting human and non human object image.
