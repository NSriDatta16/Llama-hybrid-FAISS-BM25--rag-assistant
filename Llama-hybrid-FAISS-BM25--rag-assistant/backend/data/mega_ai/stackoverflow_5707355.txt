Format text input before or after storing it in the database?

First, I am not using a WYSIWYG. The only modes of formatting will be like: *italic* , **bold** , #header# , [link](www.link.com) , and maybe a couple others. ^ That being the case, when do I do the actual parsing? Before I store it in the database OR after I retrieve it from the database? I would rather not do it before storage, but I'm unsure...
