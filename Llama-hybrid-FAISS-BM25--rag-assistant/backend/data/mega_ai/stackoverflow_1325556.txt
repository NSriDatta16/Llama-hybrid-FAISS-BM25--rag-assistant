Install Firefox extension using windows registry

I have followed the instructions here [MDC - Adding Extensions using the Windows Registry], but haven't been able to get Firefox to automatically install my extension when I restart it. I have written an application that is half windows service and half FF extension. I have built an installer and want it to be able to install the Firefox extension along with the service. So far I have tried the following things: Removing my dev version of the extension from FF first Removing the pointer file to my dev version of the extension from my profile dir Removing my "dev" profile completelly so that FF only has a "default" profile Running FF without the -no-remote and -P switches I setup for the dev environment Trying the key in both HKEY_CURRENT_USER and HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE Carefully checking the ID and Paths I have used Trying Paths that don't include spaces Trying the Paths in Quotes Trying a trailing \ at the end of the path Trying the .xpi filename at the end of the path instead of just the dir name Building the XPI using the Extension Builder plugin instead of manually (although my manual build would install just fine if I dragged it to FF) I'm using FF3.5.2 on Windows 2003 Server (could it be a W2K3 install security issue?) UPDATE: Now tested also on WinXP FF3.0.11. Same problem.
