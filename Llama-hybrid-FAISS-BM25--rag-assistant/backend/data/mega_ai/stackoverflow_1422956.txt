Things are now routed through Element storage : ) Element.getStorage(yourElement).get('prototype_event_registry') will give you an instance of Prototype's Hash , so you can do anything that you would do with hash. // to see which event types are being observed Element.getStorage(yourElement).get('prototype_event_registry').keys(); // to get array of handlers for particular event type Element.getStorage(yourElement).get('prototype_event_registry').get('click'); // to get array of all handlers Element.getStorage(yourElement).get('prototype_event_registry').values(); // etc. Note that these are undocumented internal details which might be changed in the future, so I wouldn't rely on them except for, perhaps, debugging purposes.
