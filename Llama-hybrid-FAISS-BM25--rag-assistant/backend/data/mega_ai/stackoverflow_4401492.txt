Good way to enable auto refresh of events on the fullCalendar jquery plugin?

Is there a good way to have the fullCalendar jquery plugin auto-refresh its events? I am able to simply call 'refetchEvents' using a timer, but that presents issues if the user is currently dragging an event (throwing javascript errors during the refresh while the event is dragged). Is there a better way?
