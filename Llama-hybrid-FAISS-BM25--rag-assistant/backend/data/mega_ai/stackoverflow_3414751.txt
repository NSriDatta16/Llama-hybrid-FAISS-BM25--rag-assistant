What to use as the container with ribbon control?

I'm writing a data-entry software with lots of pages. For example one page for entering team data and another page for entering match data. I want to use the new fancy Microsoft ribbon control to organize different pages and categories. The problem is I'm new to WPF and I don't know what should I use for: a. The container of pages (should I create a usercontrol for each page?) b. The container on the main page where ribbon is placed. (By clicking each ribbon button an specific page should be opened on the main window.) What would you do?
