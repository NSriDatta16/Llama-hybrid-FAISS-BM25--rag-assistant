Yes, you can add a column with 1's to your data and treat it like a regular feature, but this will only add the bias term to the first layer.

Check out this numpy implementation of a neural network from scratch for details. By the way, where are you implementing your neural network? If you only need to use it and not implement it by yourself, you can use some higher level library such as keras .
