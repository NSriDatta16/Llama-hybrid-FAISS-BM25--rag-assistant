Indeed, I see a comment: " The DOM is supposed to work that way, that's how it works in Mozilla, NS4x, and IE. We can't change that even if we wanted to, lots of sites would break. " so I would lean toward an historical error. Image element is already in HTML 2 DTD... Perhaps that's for that and possible other culprits that authors discourage using Dom hierarchy like that in favor of getElement[s]ByXxx functions (or XPath!).
