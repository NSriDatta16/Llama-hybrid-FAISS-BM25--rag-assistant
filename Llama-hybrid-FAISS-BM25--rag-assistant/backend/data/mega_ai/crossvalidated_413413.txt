Can a neural network solve this problem? Yes. A simple neural network with three units and a ReLU activation function can represent this function exactly: $$ y=[1;1;-1] \cdot \sigma\left( \begin{bmatrix}1&0&0\\0&1&0\\0&1&-1\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}a\\b\\1\end{bmatrix}\right) $$ This network represents a function $y=a+\sigma(b) - \sigma(b-1)$ , which for your input range performs rounding. Is a neural network an appropriate tool to use for rounding? Absolutely not. If there exists a simple, known math relationship that can be evaluated efficiently, there is no need to use neural networks. Is this problem an interesting case for studying behavior of neural networks? Sort of. It is small enough to evaluate the network on all cases at each timestep, which might give certain insights into the learning behavior. As you can see on your own experiments, even though there exists a trivial solution to the problem (above), your learning algorithm fails to discover it. That's certainly one of interesting aspects of neural network learning.
