A Maven project has a groupId , an artifactId and a version (OMG, 3 properties) so you need to set them: mvn archetype:generate -B -DgroupId=org.sonatype.mavenbook.simple \ -DartifactId=simple \ -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT You don't like it? It's too much effort? Don't use Maven. It seems that maven isn't satisfied to be just a Java build tool, but want to control all aspect of developing... Maven is more than just a build tool. It's not what you want? Don't use Maven. Can someone recommend a really dedicated build tool for Java? It's the third time you ask for recommendations (first time here , second time here ) and since you're just ignoring the answers suggesting Maven, Ant, Make, Buildr, Gradle, Gant, I would recommend javac .
