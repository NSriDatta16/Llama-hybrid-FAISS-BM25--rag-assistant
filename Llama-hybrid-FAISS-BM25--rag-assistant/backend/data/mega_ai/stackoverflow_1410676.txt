You can do it in a variety of ways: Use the Nexus artifact upload page (note this only works for multiple artifacts with the same groupId and artifactId). Set up a script, with multiple invocations of the maven-deploy-plugin's deploy-file goal , one for each artifact. If you have access to the file system, you can copy the files directly into [sonatype-work]/storage/[repository-name] . If you do this, set up scheduled tasks to rebuild the metadata and reindex the repository.
