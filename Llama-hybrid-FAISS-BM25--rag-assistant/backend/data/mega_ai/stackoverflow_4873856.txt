An two-dimensional array of integers (4 byte) with 32'000 by 32'000 elements occupies about 16 GByte of RAM. Does your machine have that much memory? Anyhow, out of the more than 1 billion array elements, only very few will have a count different from zero. So it's probably better to go with some sort of sparse storage. One solution would be to use a dictionary where the tuple (a, b) is the key and the count of occurrences is the value.
