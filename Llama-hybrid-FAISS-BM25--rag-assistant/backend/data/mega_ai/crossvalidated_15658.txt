At the very least, you would have wanted to consider polychoric correlations , which are specifically formulated to provide estimates between correlations of the underlying traits rather than their crude categorizations (as is done by Pearson correlation). Depending on the purposes of your analysis, you may or may not be OK with the simple correlation. If you are thinking whether to place yogurt and ice cream on the same shelf in the supermarket, without knowing who will be buying it, then this information may suffice. If you are doing a more in-depth analysis of who are the buyers of the two products, you would have to consider other demographic characteristics, like age, marital status, number of children, whether the person is the one who does the regular grocery shopping, and probably a ton of other things. Then you could put an ordinal logistic regression for each Likert scale to explain the purchasing behavior. It may or may not make sense to try to combine them, as the products are rather different.
