There is nothing inherently wrong with using a GARCH pattern to describe the time-varying conditional variance of a time series. Whether you are doing intervention analysis or some other stuff, accounting for conditional heteroskedasticity (if it is present) is sensible and advisable. If you fail to account for conditional heteroskedasticity, you are facing model misspecification. Nevertheless, the increase in model complexity due to the addition of a GARCH structure has the usual drawbacks such as increased chances of overfitting and high estimation variance. Therefore, you cannot be guaranteed to have, for example, better forecasts if you add a GARCH structure in your model. If you are following the lecture notes as in the link you have provided, adding GARCH to ARIMA should be no problem. You would first check the residuals from the ARIMA model and see if they suffer from conditional heteroskedasticity; if they do, add a GARCH structure. What you could also think about is intervention effects on the variance of the time series. Perhaps the unconditional variance increases or decreases following an intervention, or perhaps the autoregressive dynamics in the conditional variance is affected. In any case, the basic idea of intervention analysis is the same. You just may consider it in the conditional variance equation (GARCH) in addition to the conditional mean equation (ARIMA) or even on its own.
