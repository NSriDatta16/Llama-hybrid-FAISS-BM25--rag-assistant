WebView autoscales local images

My question is similar to this one , but is different enough that I am going to post a new one. I am writing an image viewer that downloads a PNG from a remote server, saves it to storage, and then opens it in a WebView so that I get multi-touch zoom for free. These images are usually going to be documents, so the user will want to be able to zoom in very far. I am sending down images of sufficient resolution to enable this, but the WebView seems to be "helping" me by scaling my image to the screen size to start out with. This means that my image is much too low resolution to be properly zoomed in on. I have searched around for this, and I have found some other people encountering a similar problem , but the only possible solution I found was to cut the image up into tiles and reassemble them using HTML before loading it in the view. This seems like a kludge, and I am asking the StackOverflow hivemind if anyone has either a way to turn off that scaling, or an alternative method to get what I need. The code that initializes the WebView : viewer = (WebView)findViewById(R.id.activity_imageviewer_webview); viewer.setBackgroundColor(0); WebSettings settings = viewer.getSettings(); settings.setJavaScriptEnabled(false); settings.setBuiltInZoomControls(true); settings.setUseWideViewPort(true); settings.setLoadWithOverviewMode(true); The code that loads the image into the WebView : viewer.loadUrl(Uri.fromFile(imageFile).toString());
