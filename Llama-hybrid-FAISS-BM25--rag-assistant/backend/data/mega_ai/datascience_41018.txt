I usually use mice for missing data imputation. It relies on chained equations and performs very well. It also has a random forest method, but typing methods(mice) you will find a list of available options, that can overcome the issues encountered by standard approaches such as logistic regression techniques. Another option is using the na.impute option available in caret package.
