You're ignoring the XML namespace that is in play - you need to pay attention to that! WITH XMLNAMESPACES('http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/' AS soap, 'https://temp.uri.com/Project/Object/Data' AS data, 'https://temp.uri.com/Mngmt/' AS mgmt) SELECT RequestXML.value('(/soap:Envelope/soap:Body/mgmt:PrintList/mgmt:Account/data:AccNumber)[1]', 'BIGINT') AS 'AccNumber' FROM [dbo].[Table1] That hopefully works!
