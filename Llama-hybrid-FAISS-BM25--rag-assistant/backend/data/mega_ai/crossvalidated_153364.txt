Predicting the job switching period of an employee

I have a machine learning problem to solve. Given the data about employees, is there a way by which we could possibly predict that when an employee is going to switch his current job? We can make use of all the publicly available data like the user's public profile on LinkedIn, Stack Overflow, Github etc. (Not sure if we even need these profiles or not). Also, if there is a way to solve the problem using Machine Learning, please suggest me what model should I use for it and the input variable involved. My current approach involves using a user-user collaborative filtering where we try to predict the employees switching period based on the switching period of similar employees in his/her neighborhood. The parameters that can be used to find similarity among the employees could be: The time they have spent in their previous companies. Their qualifications, like number of degrees, types of companies they have worked in etc. Total years of experience. Location of the users. I have't thought deep into the problem yet. I wanted some suggestions before starting with it. Any kind of help on this question will be really appreciated.
