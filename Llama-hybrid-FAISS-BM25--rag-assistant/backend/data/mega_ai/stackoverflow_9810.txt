The months in the Julian / Gregorian calendar have the same number of days each year, except February who can have 28 or 29 days depending on the leapness of the year. You can find the number of days in the Description section at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar . As @darkdog mentioned you have DateTime.DaysInMonth. Just do this: var days = DateTime.DaysInMonth(year, month) + WhatDayOfWeekTheMonthStarts(year, month); int rows = (days / 7); if (0 Take into consideration the fact that for globalization / localization purposes, some parts of the world use different calendars / methods of organization of the year.
