Evaluate the relative importance of variables using PCA

I have a large set (100+) of variables on which I'm performing PCA. The PCA returns me a list of components, each of which is in turn a list of the weights to be placed on my variables in a linear combination. What I want to do is use these numbers to evaluate the relative importance of each variable in describing the dataset. I don't want to just look at the absolute values of the weights in the first principal component, as that would ignore all the other components. However I also don't want to just sum the weights of each variable in all the principal components, since that doesn't take into account the fact that earlier components are more important than later ones. One idea I've been told is to, for each variable, do a weighted average of the weights, where each weight is multiplied by the variance that the corresponding component represents. The logic is that that does make the earlier components (i.e. the ones with larger variance) have greater importance than the later ones (the ones with smaller variance). Would this be a sound idea? Is there another, better solution?
