How to handle unicode strings in a XeLaTeX document?

an earlier question led me to XeLaTex (it was about LaTeX and Unicode). So I've got now this document: \documentclass[a4paper]{article} \usepackage[cm-default]{fontspec} \usepackage{xunicode} \usepackage{xltxtra} \setmainfont[Mapping=tex-text]{Arial} \begin{document} গ a ä ͷ \end{document} With the font "Arial" only the a and the ä are displayed, the other two characters are only a box each. If I remove the \setmainfont-command, only the a is displayed. If I change "Arial" to "Linux Libertine" I receive an error message: Illegal fontname `Linux Libertine': contains ' ' This is irritating, because the WikiPedia-Example about XeLaTeX has a font-name containing spaces. What do I have to do to make all the given chars appear in my pdf-document?
