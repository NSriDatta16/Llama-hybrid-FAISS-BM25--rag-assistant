Most of the time, the exception helpers in the BCL are there to support localization (which is usually wrapped up in the SR internal class you'll find in almost all .NET BCL assemblies.) The general idea is that you use a helper method to pass in some basic data for an exception, and the helper handles the retrieval of resources and formatting of data for you to create the exception. The benefit is that you centralize code for exceptions that may be thrown from multiple locations, but which need to be created in the same way. So generally, same idea as any other utility class or inherited object...promotes reuse and maintainability. As for where to put them...I like to have an "internal area" in each of my assemblies with an exception helper, resource helper, and other internal "assembly support" types.
