There's rarely a reason to manage your event listeners in this way. If you bind to drop, dragover, dragleave at the same time as you bind to dragenter do you still see the problem? The HTML dnd api is a little bit weird when you first look at it . Depending on what you are trying to do something simple like onDragOver=function(e) { e.stopPropagation() } onDrop=function(e) { /* handle drop */ } may be all the listeners you need.
