update magento currency rates using custom php file

I'm trying to use a custom file to update currency rates using cURL from my local bank and insert the data into the currency database table. Do I have to create a module to do that, or can I do that without creating a module? I intend to use cron too. Does anyone have any advice on how to achieve this, and are there any tutorials? Thanks..
