Probabilty Scale Versus Log Odds - Interaction Effect Size

I am looking at doing some power analysis for a simple full factorial design using logistic regression as the method of analysis 2 main effects and their interaction. I am trying to discern the magnitude of the interaction through postulated probabilities. Specifically I have the following factors A and B, each with a low (-1) and high (1) level. Given a balanced experiment I believe I can average over the other level for the main effects and calculate the main effect of A as 0.11% and the main effect of B as 0.0934%. Slicing the simple effects of A I calculate the interaction as -0.08%. I am therefore thinking with the power analysis I should have almost as much power for the interaction term as the other main effects, especially B. It works out that the interaction term is tiny through the logistic regression. Is there any way to tell just from the probabilities if the interaction is "large" or "small"? > x_df x_df A B 1 -1 -1 2 -1 1 3 1 -1 4 1 1 > X X [,1] [,2] [1,] 12 9988 [2,] 5 9995 [3,] 25 9975 [4,] 10 9990 > summary(glm(X~x_df$A+x_df$B+x_df$A*x_df$B, family = binomial)) Call: glm(formula = X ~ x_df$A + x_df$B + x_df$A * x_df$B, family = binomial) Deviance Residuals: [1] 0 0 0 0 Coefficients: Estimate Std.
