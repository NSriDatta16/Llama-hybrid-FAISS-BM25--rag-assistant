you can subclass UITableView and use it instead of standard UITableView . Why? Because You will be able to do smth like this - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event{ [super touvhesBegan:touches withRvrnt:event]; } this method will be called each time you touch your table. so you will be able to resign your textField as firstResponder inside this method.
