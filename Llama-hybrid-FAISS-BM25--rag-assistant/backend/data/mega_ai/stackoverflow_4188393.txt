Is there an in-memory key/value store that can notify an external entity of a change?

I have read about in-memory key/value stores but have never actually utilized one. The first that come to my uneducated mind are CouchDB and memcached (I know CouchDB isn't necessarily in-memory, but is often used as such). I am looking for one of these in-memory stores that support basic scripting, such that I could notify an external entity (through a RESTful API) of a change. Some preliminary research reveals that CouchDB supports something called Change Notifications Memcached does not seem to support this type of feature, and is a more general storage-only service (again, my ignorance may shine through here). Does anyone have any experience doing this? Any words of wisdom for potential pitfalls or headaches? Is there some other software I didn't list that would support these features?
