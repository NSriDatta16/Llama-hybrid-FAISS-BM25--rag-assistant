Perhaps this answer is cheating, but it seems strange no one has mentioned the rpy project, which provides an interface between R and Python. You get a pythonic api to most of R's functionality while retaining the (I would argue nicer) syntax, data processing, and in some cases speed of Python. It's unlikely that Python will ever have as many bleeding edge stats tools as R, just because R is a dsl and the stats community is more invested in R than possibly any other language. I see this as analogous to using an ORM to leverage the advantages of SQL, while letting Python be Python and SQL be SQL. Other useful packages specifically for data structures include: pydataframe replicates a data.frame and can be used with rpy. Allows you to use R-like filtering and operations. pyTables Uses the fast hdf5 data type underneath, been around for ages h5py Also hdf5, but specifically aimed at interoperating with numpy pandas Another project that manages data.frame like data, works with rpy, pyTables and numpy
