The only practical method I can think of is as follows: Split the period you want to analyze in arbitrary "buckets", say, 24 1-hour buckets over the day. For each Bucket count how many calls either started or finished between the start or the end of the interval Note that the 1-hour limit is not a hard-and-fast rule. You could make this shorter or longer, depending on how precise you want the calculation to be. You could make the actual "length" of the bucket a function of the average call duration. So, let's assume that your average call is 3 minutes. If it is not too expensive in terms of calculations, use buckets that are 3 times longer than your average call (9 minutes) this should be granular enough to give precise results.
