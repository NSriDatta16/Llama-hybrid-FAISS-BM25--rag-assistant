My personal preference would be to use them sparingly for now and to wait to see how Microsoft and other big organizations use them. If we start seeing a lot of code, tutorials, and books use code like 3.Days().FromNow() it makes use it a lot. If only a small number of people use it, then you run the risk of having your code be overly difficult to maintain because not enough people are familiar with how extensions work. On a related note, I wonder how the performance compares between a normal for loop and the foreach one? It would seem like the second method would involve a lot of extra work for the computer, but I'm not familiar enough with the concept to know for sure.
