how far along are you at with this effort? I'm thinking of doing the same thing, so I'm willing to help. Def. not an experiment for us. My team needs to run wordpress on lots of computers and we really don't care about broken plugins, those can be fixed to implement a DB interface when it comes to creating their entities, the gains of being able to scale horizontally without dealing with mysql and configuration issues are enormous, no single poitn of failure, faster response times, and you have a platform on which you can think of more interesting services on top of wordpress. I find it crazy that the automattic doesn't really show much interest about DB independence, maybe they have a deal with mysql that prevents them from this, but oh well, they're GPL nazis, if they're not with us, then we can fork them, I'm sure all the major plugins will be re-implemented aswell to be supported on noSQL dbs. http://wordpress.org/support/topic/suggestion-support-mongodb-hypertable-or-other-nosql-storage
