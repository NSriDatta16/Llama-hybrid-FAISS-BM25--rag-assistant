R using GLM and manual solve logistic regression have different (close but not exactly the same) results

I am getting different results (close but not exact the same) from R GLM and manual solving logistic regression optimization. Could anyone tell me where is the problem? BFGS does not converge? Numerical problem with finite precision? Thanks # logistic regression without intercept fit=glm(factor(vs) ~ hp+wt-1, mtcars, family=binomial()) # manually write logistic loss and use BFGS to solve x=as.matrix(mtcars[,c(4,6)]) y=ifelse(mtcars$vs==1,1,-1) lossLogistic
