No, you don't have to do differencing when using XGBoost or neural networks. The idea with those data-driven models is that they have so many parameters that they can adapt to any property of the data. You don't have to presume any model, meaning you don't have to do the work to figure out an appropriate model. The disadvantage of data-driven models is that you learn much less about the "inner properties" of your data-generating system. But if you only care about prediction, that is totally fine.
