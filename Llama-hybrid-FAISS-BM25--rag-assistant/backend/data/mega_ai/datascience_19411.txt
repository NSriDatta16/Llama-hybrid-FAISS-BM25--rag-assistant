Actually, there is a formula which can easily convert character based PPL and word based PPL. $PPL = 2^{(BPC*Nc/Nw)}$ where $BPC$ is character based $PPL$, $Nc$ and $Nw$ are the number of characters and words in a test set, respectively. The formula is not completely fair, but it at least offers a way to comparing them. The following are some reference. [1] Hwang K, Sung W.
