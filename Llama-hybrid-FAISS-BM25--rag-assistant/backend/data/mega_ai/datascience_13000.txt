There is no definite source on how to do feature engineering. It is often dependent on the problem you are trying to solve. Some say it is more of an art than it is science. But I would go through some of the high scoring kaggle kernels / winning solutions if available. Just head over to kaggle and browse through the competitions. There is a lot of very useful material in there. Also the journal of machine learning research has a lot of papers about feature engineering. Just search on their site http://www.jmlr.org/ . The following links are useful and to long to paraphrase: Some information about some best practices of feature engineering can be found on Quora, see this link At machine learning mastery there is this page about feature engineering.
