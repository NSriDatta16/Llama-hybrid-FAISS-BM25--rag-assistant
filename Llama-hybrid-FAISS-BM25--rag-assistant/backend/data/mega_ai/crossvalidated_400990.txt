For Question 1: "So how can I say these sequences are not random and they tend to look a certain way? (test for randomness)" You could use the binomial distribution. A binomial distribution is given by the product of multiple Bernoulli distributions, or trials. e.g. If you toss a fair coin 20 times (trials), how many times may it come up heads? $$Xâˆ¼Binomial(n,p)$$ The Binomial probability of exactly $X$ successes from an experiment with $n$ independent trials when the probability of success in each trial is $p$ . In your case: ( $n$ ) trials = length of sequence. ( $X$ ) successes = number of 1's observed in sequence. ( $p$ ) probability of success = 0.5 aka random. You can use the CDF to determine if your observed value of $X$ in each sequence is different from random at different confidence intervals. I actually set up a demo of this here . For Question 2: pattern-finding Similarly, you could identify the number of k-length successes in your sequences and use the n-choose-k binomial coefficient to determine probability of observing these sequences by random chance. Also, as you suggest you could explore clustering. Perhaps calculate some second order features such as: the average sequence length, average time between clusters of size k, cumulative 1's, exponential moving averages etc. It really depends on what you mean by pattern finding? Do you want to identify common sequences, if so then why not count the frequencies of k-length 1's and 0's or the time between these. Alternatively, if you want to predict these time series patterns the above listed features, lagged and a classification model may work.
