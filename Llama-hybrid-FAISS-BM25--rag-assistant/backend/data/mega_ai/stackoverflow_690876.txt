Several years ago (as a school project), I implemented in C a write-once read-many mapping (and other collections) which took an existing collection, and then "sealed it" by creating a much more memory and cache-efficient representation (e.g., a graph was stored as an optimized array). We saw amazing performance differences. Since Java supports interfaces, implementing something like this can be a lot easier (and in fact encouraged) but I'm not familiar with an out-of-the-box implementation.
