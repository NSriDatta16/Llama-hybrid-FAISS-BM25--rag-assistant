How to make SmartGWT TreeGrid reparent selectively allowed depending on nodes

I have the following data in a SmartGWT TreeGrid object. Home |-Room 1 |-Room 2 |-Table |-Chair Reparenting is allowed by calling treeGrid.setCanReparentNodes(true); I want to allow selectiv reparenting only: for example, it should be possible to move (drag&drop) the Table to Room 1, but it should not be possible to move the Room 1 into Room2 or the Chair into Home. How can I selectively allow reparenting depending on the node type (or a node's attribute)?
