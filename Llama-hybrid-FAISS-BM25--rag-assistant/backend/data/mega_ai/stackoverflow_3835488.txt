On submit from textarea - mysql error

I am using TinyMCE on my new site in english, that I am doing by myself (I am like a sunday programmer :) ). As before I was doing sites in my native language, I did not get this problem: So... when i write in the textarea a word " don't " or " doesn't " the " ' " breaks the MySQL query and I get an error about MySQL syntax. Is there a way to go around this and allow " ' " to be saved in the database? The code for edit page looks like this And query $sql="UPDATE works SET client='".$_POST["client"]."', description='".$_POST["description"]."', text='".$_POST["text"]."', image='".$_FILES["attels"]["name"]."' WHERE id=".$_GET['id'].""; And also, is there a way to remove tag from The textarea, because tinymce automatically sets these in front of every paragraph. But I don't need them.
