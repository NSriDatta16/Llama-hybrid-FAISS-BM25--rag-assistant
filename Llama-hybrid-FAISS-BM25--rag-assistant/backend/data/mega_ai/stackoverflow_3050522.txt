I guess your answer really depends how your errors are bubbled out of the 'AusLogics_Defrag.exe' app... Providing the 'AusLogics_Defrag.exe' app outputs one, you could work with the ExitCode property of the process returned when you call Process.Start() . A non-zero value indicates an error in a normal implementation.
