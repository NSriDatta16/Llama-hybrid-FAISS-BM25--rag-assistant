It has already been said that Oracle is allowed to give you the rows in any order it wants, when you don't specify an ORDER BY clause. Speculating what the order will be when you don't specify the ORDER BY clause is pointless. And relying on it in your code, is a "career limiting move". A simple example: SQL> create table t as select level id from dual connect by level select id from t 2 / ID ---------- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 10 rijen zijn geselecteerd. SQL> delete t where id = 6 2 / 1 rij is verwijderd. SQL> insert into t values (6) 2 / 1 rij is aangemaakt. SQL> select id from t 2 / ID ---------- 1 2 3 4 5 7 8 9 10 6 10 rijen zijn geselecteerd. And this is only after a simple delete+insert. And there are numerous other situations thinkable. Parallel execution, partitions, index organised tables to name just a few. Bottom line, as already very well said by ammoQ: if you need the rows sorted, use an ORDER BY clause.
