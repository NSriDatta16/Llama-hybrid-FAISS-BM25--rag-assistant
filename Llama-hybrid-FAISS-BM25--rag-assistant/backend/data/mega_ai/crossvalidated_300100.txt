That depends on the type of time series model of your choice. Typical time series models only depend on the time series data and not on external data. That means that they try to describe the structure of the time series. Is it seasonal? Is there a trend? How much noise is there? These typical time series models (like ARIMA) should thus somehow assume that the time series does not drastically change. It it would, it would ruin their prediction. That's why time series analysis often have the assumption of a stationary processes (see e.g. this chapter of an online textbook "Forecasting: principles and practice" for some visual examples). With this assumption the time series model can safely assume that future exampels follow the same pattern as the past. Thus for time series models that depend on the stationary process assumption (the majority) the proper thing to say about a prediction is: based on the patterns in the time series I observed in the past, I would expect this increase/decrease tomorrow
