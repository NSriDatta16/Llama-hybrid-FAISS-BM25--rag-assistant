Unfortunately i don't think there would be a straight forward method of achieving this just using a charts default members. I would expect you'd need to extend the chart component you were using and tie in with the internal workings of the chart. This isn't such an easy thing to do and the inner workings of the chart components are pretty complex. Something that isn't helped by a fairly messy implementation inside some of the classes. There are obviously several directions you could take in solving this particular problem some that are more elegant than others. It's defiantly possible but it's probably not a job for someone that is relatively new to flex. If i were you i would probably try to find a compromise to your requirements until you feel more comfortable delving into the chart components code. IF you do decide to give it a go then you should come back with specific problems as myself and others are probably reluctant to solve such a big problem.
