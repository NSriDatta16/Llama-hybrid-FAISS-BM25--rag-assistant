How would you interpret the following innotop output?

I'm trying to optimize an application running a MySQL with the InnoDB storage engine. When running innotop in the live environment I get the following output: When Load QPS Slow QCacheHit KCacheHit BpsIn BpsOut Now 0.00 87.80 0 41.21% 100.00% 11.51k 836.42k Total 0.00 105.50 190 15.04% 99.34% 13.23k 692.85k When , Load , QPS and Slow are self-explanatory. But what about QCacheHit , KCacheHit , BpsIn and BpsOut ? In general, what are considered "okay" values for those, and when should I start worrying?
