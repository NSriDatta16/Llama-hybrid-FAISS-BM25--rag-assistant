Let me take a shot. First I'm going to convert your HR into their original values by taking the log: table 1 results lower upper IRBMI274 0.68 0.59 0.77 table 2 results lower upper IRBMI274 2.60 1.91 3.28 IRBMI274:AGE -0.03 -0.04 -0.02 The standard error will increase on the main effect because we are adding more correlated variables to the regression (think of the extreme case of perfect collinearity: the standard errors would be massive/infinity). So we shouldn't be surprised that the std. error increases. Judging from the coefficients above, I don't think you demeaned the age variable (using dubious means, I think the average is ~64 years in the dataset). Try demeaning age first, as that can help reduce possible colinearity .
