If you actually want to run separate servers to test out server software see the other answers, but... It sounds like (because you are a developer, not a sysadmin right?) you really just want to run Python and PHP sites on the same computer. So, forgive me if I'm reading into your question, but this setup allows me to run both kinds of sites on the same computer with the same port (port 80) in one server, Apache. I make new entries in my /etc/hosts file (or C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts on Windows) and point them to 127.0.0.1: 127.0.0.1 localhost # development projects 127.0.0.1 somephpsite.com.local 127.0.0.1 www.somephpsite.com.local 127.0.0.1 otherpythonsite.com.local 127.0.0.1 www.otherpythonsite.com.local Then in Apache I add VirtualHosts for each site: DocumentRoot "/Library/WebServer/Documents" ServerName localhost Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews AllowOverride All Order allow,deny Allow from all DocumentRoot "/Users/Robert/Projects/SomeSite/somephpsite.com" ServerName somephpsite.com.local ServerAlias www.somephpsite.com.local ErrorLog "/Users/Robert/Projects/SomeSite/error.log" CustomLog "/Users/Robert/Projects/SomeSite/access.log" common Order allow,deny Allow from all DocumentRoot "/Users/Robert/Projects/OtherSite/otherpythonsite.com/static" Alias /(.*(\.css|\.gif|\.ico|\.jpg|\.js|\.pdf|\.txt)) /Users/Robert/Projects/OtherSite/otherpythonsite.com/static/$1 WSGIScriptAlias / /Users/Robert/Projects/OtherSite/otherpythonsite.com/wsgi.py ServerName otherpythonsite.com.local ServerAlias www.otherpythonsite.com.local ErrorLog "/Users/Robert/Projects/OtherSite/error.log" CustomLog "/Users/Robert/Projects/OtherSite/access.log" common So, the PHP sites run in the DocumentRoot like they always do. And the Python sites run in WSGI. And they both run in Apache. Then to test, I just add ".local" in whatever browser I'm using to work on my local copy.
