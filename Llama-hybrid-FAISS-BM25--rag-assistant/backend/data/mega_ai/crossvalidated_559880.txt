If the principal components explains, say 80% of the variation (as opposed to 95%), then I have incurred some loss in the accuracy of my model. Performing PCA does not reduce the accuracy of the model. The principal components, when you use all of them, should also explain the 95%. It is the reduction of the dimensionality which reduces the explained variation. So this is a matter of model selection and finding models with fewer parameters. The role of PCA is to do this model selection by redefining the parameter space in order to find a small number of components that explain a large amount of variation.
