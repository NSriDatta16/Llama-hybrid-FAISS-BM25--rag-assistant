If it seems reasonable to assume that prices are normally distributed you can use gaussian mixture modeling to identify the clusters in your data. Consider the following example of chip sales. Let's say that chips are sold in packs of 1, 5, or 20 with associated average costs of \$1, \$4, $10 respectively. You don't know this exactly and you want to separate sales into clusters based on the size of the pack sold. There is also variation in the price that each vendor charges so that the price for any unit size is normally distributed with some variance which is not equal across unit-sizes. set.seed(777) chips_1 = rnorm(n = 15, mean = 1, sd = .25) # Sample of prices for 1-packs chips_5 = rnorm(n = 30, mean = 4, sd = 1.0) # Sample of prices for 5-packs chips_20 = rnorm(n = 8, mean = 10, sd = 1.0) # Sample of prices for 20-pack chips = c(chips_1, chips_5, chips_20) hist(chips, breaks = 12, freq = F, main = "Histogram of Prices for Chips", xlab = "Price ($)") lines(density(chips, adjust = .5), col = "blue") Using the mclust library we can fit a gaussian mixture model to the data. First, we compare the fits with different numbers of clusters via BIC. library(mclust) BIC This plot indicates that the data is best explained by a mixture of three normal distributions. We can estimate the respective means and variances of these three distributions. fit = Mclust(chips, G=3, model="V") summary(fit, parameters =T) plot(fit, what="density", lwd = 2, xlab = "Price ($)") The estimated parameters are summarized below. Additionally, every point in this example was correctly classified according to the distribution from which it was drawn. The fit$classification parameter details the predicted classifications. $$\begin{array}{c|c|c|} & \text{Estimated} & \text{Actual} \\ \hline \text{Mean 1} & 1.039 & 1.000 \\ \hline \text{Mean 2} & 3.952 & 4.000 \\ \hline \text{Mean 3} & 10.37& 10.00 \\ \hline \text{Variance 1} & 0.050& 0.063 \\ \hline \text{Variance 2} & 1.149 & 1.000 \\ \hline \text{Variance 3} & 1.540 & 1.000 \\ \hline \end{array}$$
