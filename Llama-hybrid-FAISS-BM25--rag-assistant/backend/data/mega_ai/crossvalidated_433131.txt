"Normalization" and "standardization" are used in ambiguous ways in statistics and machine learning literature. They don't have any fixed meaning. Pearson's correlation coefficient is defined as $$ \operatorname{corr}(X,Y) = \frac{\operatorname{cov}(X,Y)}{\sigma(X) \; \sigma(Y)} $$ It is a "normalized covariance" in the sense that this operation transforms covariance to $[-1, 1]$ range, it has unified units that do not depend on the scaling (standard deviations) of $X$ and $Y$ .
