As per RFC 5849 section 3.4.1.2 , the OAuth base string URI does not include the query string or fragment. If either the client or the server does not remove the query parameters from the base string URI and add them to the normalized OAuth parameter list, the signatures won't match. Unfortunately, it's hard to tell which side is making this mistake. But it's easy to determine this is the problem: If it always works without query parameters but always fails with query parameters, you can be pretty sure that one side or the other is generating the wrong base string. (Be sure that it always happens though... intermittent errors would be something else. Similarly, if it never works with or without a query string, that would also be something else.) The other possibility is that normalization was done incorrectly â€” the parameter list must be sorted and percent encoded sequences must be upper-cased. If it's not normalized correctly on both sides, that will also cause a base string mismatch, and thus a signature mismatch.
