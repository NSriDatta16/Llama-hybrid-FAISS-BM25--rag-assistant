In .NET, memory is treated different than all other resources: While you have to take care of releasing all resources you need, you don't have to worry about memory. In C++, you have to take care to release all resources you use, including dynamically allocated memory. However, C++ employs a number of tools and techniques (namely automatic scope-based allocation/deallocation and RAII ) to help you with this. In a decade of writing C++ code, I have rarely ever (read: on average less than once per year) manually freed memory and if so, it was in a RAII handle class.
