While what you are asking is possible, there is nothing "simple" about rolling your own workflow host based on .NET 3.x workflow runtime. Take this from someone who has done this. It will get much easier in .NET 4.0, so it is also worthwhile to consider that your solution will be obsolete in a few months. If your problem domain contains only document-based workflows, I strongly suggest that you consider a SharePoint solution instead. Please see the following links for some information on this option: http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepointdesigner/HA101005911033.aspx http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/RobertShelton/Building-an-Approval-Workflow-with-SharePointMOSS-2007-and-Visual-Studio-2008/
