Performance problems on iPhone using simple graphics

We're working on a couple simple games and we have some performance problems that we keep running into, and I was curious if it was a code issue or a "we're using the wrong objects" issue. Our games are basically simple ones that work as follows: We have a custom view that we load, and a custom object that is our game engine. The view has a timer that fires like such: [NSTimer scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval:1.0 / 30.0 target:self selector:@selector(animationTimerMethod) userinfo:nil repeats:YES]; and in our timer method, we have the following: - (void)animationTimerMethod:(NSTimer*)timer { if([gameEngine doGameLoop]) //only redraw if we need to [self setNeedsDisplay]; } Our drawing code is very simple, we're just drawing a couple of images on the screen, using code similar to the following: - (void)drawRect:(CGRect)rect { CGGraphicsContext ctx = UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext(); CGContextDrawImage(ctx, someRect, someImage); } The main problem we have is responsiveness to touch. Our code will not get a response in the touchesBegan method many times. Is this just a limitation of the Core Graphics library? Should we be using OpenGL? Are there other ways to do simple animations (not even objects moving on screen, just 6 or so frames of animation for an object in the same place) that would be more responsive? Thanks so much!
