One of the (not so) many options is JavascriptMVC , which is pretty cool and I've used it for one midium-size project. It's website is pretty discouraging, but give it a chance and watch the video . One possitive aspect is that it's creator always answers really fast in JMVC's google group. But, actually, if I had to remake the project I mentioned, I would not use it, as jQuery provides (almost) all JMVC's functionality, you just have to get used to it. For an example in how to handle big apps with jQuery, I would recommend you to watch this video between others of Alex Sexton and other members of the yayQuery podcast .
