If performance is not a big issue you can take a more naive approach to drawing anti-aliased lines, e.g.: Draw the lines in a higher resolution grid (e.g. some integer multiple of your target resolution) - you'll need to adjust their thickness. Downsample to your target resolution by converting each block of n x m pixels to a single pixels, e.g. by averaging the RGB values. Depending on what language or OS you're developing with there may be built in functionality to simplying this. Alternatively you can calculate what portion of each pixel is covered by your line (by intersecting the pixel square with the line) to calculate the pixels value, make the pixel intensity relative to the portion of the pixel area covered by the line.
