UINavigationController is it needed?

Im a budding iphone developer, and doing my best but i have a query regarding the UINavigationController. I have a tab bar app, with 3 tabs. The 1st tab has five UIButtons, each loading a different "section" of the app, and each section will have a number of views. The other tabs simply display some info. as users select any of the UIButtons on my first tab i am using [self.view addSubview: xxxxx]; and as users navigate away from this view i use [self.view removeFromSuperview]; My question is: Is this a bad way to do things? should i use a navigation controller? The reason i have not used one is because i wanted a custom looking UI and i understand that the navigation controller forces your design a little. And on top of that i will be using core data to implement persistent storage.... will my way of implementing this application cause an issue with core data? Any help regarding thsi would be highly appreciated. Cheers Tom
