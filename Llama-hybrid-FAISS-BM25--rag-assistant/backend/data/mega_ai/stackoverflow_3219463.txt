Are you using an iframe?... this is from the documentation: ColorBox broken or displaying incorrectly when loading documents: Often this is due to not using an iframe when an iframe would be required. The default method, ajax, is only for elements that can exist within a element. If you are loading a complete HTML document with , , and elements, then using an iframe is required. While nesting these elements may appear to display correctly in some browsers, it is still invalid HTML and should not be depended on. Remember to set the width and height values for ColorBox when using an iframe, it has no way of knowing the dimensions of elements that exist within the iframe. ColorBox leverages jQuery's load method for handling ajax. If you are loading a document from the same domain as your current document, you can use a selector pull out just the portion of the document that is needed. Example: $('#example').colorbox({href:"document.html div#content"});
