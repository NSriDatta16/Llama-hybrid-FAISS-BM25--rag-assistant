The standard deviation does, indeed, give more weight to those farther from the mean, because it is the square root of the average of the squared distances. The reasons for using this (rather than the mean absolute deviation that you propose, or the median absolute deviation, which is used in robust statistics) are partly due to the fact that calculus has an easier time with polynomials than with absolute values. However, often, we do want to emphasize the extreme values. As to your question about the intuitive meaning - it develops over time. You are correct that more than one set of numbers can have the same mean and sd; this is because the mean and sd are just two pieces of information, and the data set may be 5 pieces (as 1,3,5,7,9) or much more. Whether a mean 5 and sd of 2.83 is "wide" or "narrow" depends on the field you are working in. When you have only 5 numbers, it is easy to look at the full list; when you have many numbers, more intuitive ways of thinking about spread include such things as the five number summary or, even better, graphs such as a density plot.
