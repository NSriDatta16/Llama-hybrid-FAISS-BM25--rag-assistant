DataMapper Associations, simple code, not working

I'm just begining to use DataMappers associations, just to test things out have a very simple table structure, and it's is borking. require 'dm-core' require 'dm-migrations' DataMapper.setup( :default, "sqlite3://#{Dir.pwd}/dbtest.db" ) class Account include DataMapper::Resource property :id, Serial has 1, :userprofile, :model =>"UserProfile" end class UserProfile include DataMapper::Resource property :id, Serial belongs_to :Account end DataMapper.finalize #whether I have this before or after auto migrate the result is the same DataMapper.auto_migrate! This should just work, nice and simple, DM is working for everything else(I'e already been using it plenty). Here is the result when I run this code, anyone know what the problem is?: DataObjects::SyntaxError: duplicate column name: account_id (code: 1, sql state: , query: CREATE TABLE "user_profiles" ("id" INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, "account_id" INTEGER NOT NULL, "account_id" INTEGER NOT NULL), uri: sqlite3://d/Borrow/dbtest.db) from d:/Ruby/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/dm-migrations-1.0.0/lib/dm-migrations/adapters/dm-do-adapter.rb:92:in `execute_non_query' from d:/Ruby/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/dm-migrations-1.0.0/lib/dm-migrations/adapters/dm-do-adapter.rb:92:in `create_model_storage' from d:/Ruby/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/dm-migrations-1.0.0/lib/dm-migrations/adapters/dm-do-adapter.rb:90:in `each' from d:/Ruby/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/dm-migrations-1.0.0/lib/dm-migrations/adapters/dm-do-adapter.rb:90:in `create_model_storage' from d:/Ruby/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/dm-do-adapter-1.0.0/lib/dm-do-adapter/adapter.rb:260:in `with_connection' from d:/Ruby/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/dm-migrations-1.0.0/lib/dm-migrations/adapters/dm-do-adapter.rb:85:in `create_model_storage' from d:/Ruby/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/dm-migrations-1.0.0/lib/dm-migrations/auto_migration.rb:79:in `create_model_storage' from d:/Ruby/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/dm-migrations-1.0.0/lib/dm-migrations/auto_migration.rb:175:in `auto_migrate_up!' from d:/Ruby/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/dm-migrations-1.0.0/lib/dm-migrations/auto_migration.rb:130:in `auto_migrate!' from d:/Ruby/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/dm-migrations-1.0.0/lib/dm-migrations/auto_migration.rb:45:in `send' from d:/Ruby/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/dm-migrations-1.0.0/lib/dm-migrations/auto_migration.rb:45:in `repository_execute' from d:/Ruby/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/dm-core-1.0.0/lib/dm-core/model/descendant_set.rb:33:in `each' from d:/Ruby/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/dm-core-1.0.0/lib/dm-core/model/descendant_set.rb:33:in `each' from d:/Ruby/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/dm-migrations-1.0.0/lib/dm-migrations/auto_migration.rb:44:in `repository_execute' from d:/Ruby/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/dm-migrations-1.0.0/lib/dm-migrations/auto_migration.rb:22:in `auto_migrate!'
