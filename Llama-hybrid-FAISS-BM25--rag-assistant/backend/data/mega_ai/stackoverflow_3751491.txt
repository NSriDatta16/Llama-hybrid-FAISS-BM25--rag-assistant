I'll second what @annakata said. Additionally, I highly recommend that whomever is responsible for managing SCM in your organization to set up a check-in alert that lets you know when someone checks code into the trunk. That way, you can follow up (with the previously-mentioned cricket bat, if necessary) with the developer responsible. Some other techniques to consider: Only allow senior developers to check in. Developers shelve their changes, and the senior devs review then check-in. They can help be your gatekeeper. Use the gated-check-in feature of TFS2010 to help you. Turn on gated check-ins for the trunk. Education in a form that developers can understand. Make them know exactly why building off the trunk is a bad thing. SCM process education can go a long way to getting people to comply. If they think it's just an arbitrary rule, they don't feel bad about violating it. Add consequences (to whatever degree your organization allows). Things like a beer/pizza fund that they need to contribute to when they screw up, or a funny hat that needs to be worn, or even a loud announcement to the entire development organization when someone checks in to trunk. It gets the point across quickly.
