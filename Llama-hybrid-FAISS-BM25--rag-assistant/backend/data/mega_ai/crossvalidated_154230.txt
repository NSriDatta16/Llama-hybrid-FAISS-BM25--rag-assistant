ARIMA, or ARMA for stationary time series, is a univariate method for time series modeling. Theoretical justification comes from Wold's theorem where you can approximate stationary stochastic process by some low-order ARMA model. Often structural changes or such cause problems for the ARMA modeling since various statistics by which one tries to infer structure of model are affected greatly. One solution is to use some form of deterministic model for structural changes and then use ARMA for "whitened" series.
