how to get touch coordinates in an image then draw a markup icon and its content in a popover view

I would like to built an iPhone/iPad application to show large images (in a scrollView or something else which support dragging and zooming) that allow user to: Touch some where in the image to markup and leave comment User can tap on that markup icon/button to view comment in a popOverView Edit comment or remove that markup So I want to ask that: How can I get the touch coordinates in image (not screen)? How can I draw a markup icon/button at touch point in the image and it would follow image even when dragging, zooming since the image is really large, maybe up to 8000x6000 pixels? How can I display comment/note when user touch on markup icon/button in a view like popOverview in iPad? Save and load these information. It is nearly similar to tagging functionality of Facebook App in iPhone. Any help is appreciated, thank in advance!
