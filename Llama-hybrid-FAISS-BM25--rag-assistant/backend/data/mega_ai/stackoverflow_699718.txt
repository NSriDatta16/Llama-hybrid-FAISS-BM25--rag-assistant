If, by responsibility, you mean repository (thanx, Blair), you found that you can't branch to another repository. But if your code and your project are related, then it makes sense to have them in the same repository. You will want to learn more about svn and use it better. For instance, "trunk" is just a directory name, so you can have one for the project, and a separate one for the code. Although, using those particular words, most of us would expect "code" to be inside "project". Anyway, if you go outside of a repository, you lose all history and you lose all chance of branching or merging. So you need to rethink your organization. Or use a different version control system that does what you want.
