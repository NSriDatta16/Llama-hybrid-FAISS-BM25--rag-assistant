This is a good question which should provoke some thought. Database access is often not subject to rigorous testing - particularly not automated testing, and I would certainly like to increase the amount of testing on my database. I'm using the MbUnit test framework running from inside Visual Studio to do some testing. Our application uses stored procedures wherever possible, and the tests I have written set up the database for testing, call a stored procedure, and check the results. For a collection of related stored procedures, we have a C# file with tests for those stored procs. (However, our coverage is probably about 1% so far!). Active record is an attractive option because of Ruby's built-in emphasis on automated testing. If I were starting over, that would be a point for using active record.
