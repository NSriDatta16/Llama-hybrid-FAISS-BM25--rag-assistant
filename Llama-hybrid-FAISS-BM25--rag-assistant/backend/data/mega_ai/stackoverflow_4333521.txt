Passing int array to fragment shader

I'm attempting to plot an iterative function in OpenGL ES. An array of ints is being updated with how often a given pixel is hit by the iterative function. I'd like to pass this density array to a fragment shader and use it to plot the result on a simple quad covering the whole screen. My question is: can I pass this array directly to the shader as a uniform and generate pixels by using gl_FragCoord to look up the density for the given position or should I rather use the array to create a texture with one channel using GL_LUMINANCE and pass that to the shader?
