about the first question, I can suggest you TeamBox , very similar to Basecamp, but it's open source, with an avaiable repository on github. it's written in rails. for the second question: for sure I learnt about MVC approach (I re-applied same philosophy to PHP in some works). the next generation frameworks are using even more abstractions and layers. for example using ORM libraries for different databases (you save time writing SQL queries, you can use same API for different databases, even for the new NoSQL storages). I suggest you to look for Redis, CouchDB and MongoDB databases. they are different each other about approach and data-organization, but they are becoming very useful for complicated web-apps
