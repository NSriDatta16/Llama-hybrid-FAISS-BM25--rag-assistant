How do I merge (or zip) two IEnumerables together?

I have an IEnumerable and an IEnumerable that I want merged into an IEnumerable > where the indexes of the elements joined together in the KeyValuePair are the same. Note I'm not using IList, so I don't have a count or an index for the items I'm merging. How best can I accomplish this? I would prefer a LINQ answer, but anything that gets the job done in an elegant fashion would work as well.
