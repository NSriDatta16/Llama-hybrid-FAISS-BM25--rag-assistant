How to drag the url in WebView and drop to a textlabel

I have a webview and want to drag the url on the webview to a textlabel. I know there is the option of 'Copy', but I prefer to do as the dragdrop function in normal computer. Is this possible for iphone app? Welcome any comment Thanks interdev
