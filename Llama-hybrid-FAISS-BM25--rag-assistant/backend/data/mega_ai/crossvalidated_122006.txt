Is there an R package to calculate differential entropy

I am trying to calculate differential entropy over my data. This is how a subset of my data set looks like : test.Kidney.meth 0.0666666 0.129032 0.0333333 0 0 0 test.Liver.meth 0.25 0.0625 0.1875 0 0 0 test.brain.meth 0.0192308 0 0.0196079 0.0526316 0.1 0 test.lung.meth 0.15625 0.0937498 0.125 0 0.25 0.333333 test.panc.meth 0 0 0 0.0454546 0.2 0.333333 test.pericard.meth 0.101449 0.0735294 0.102941 0.151515 0.05 0.153846 test.skin.meth 0.030303 0.030303 0.0588235 0.0833333 0.181818 0 test.uterus.meth 0.0441177 0.0294117 0.0434783 0.0416666 0.0526316 0.125 I am trying to compute entropy for every column and then will just average it out over all the columns. While going through different R packages I found that most of them discretize the continuous data and then compute the entropy. Since my data is small (in terms of number of rows or length of each column vector) I doubt that I would get reliable results. Thus I was wondering if there is any R package available which calculates differential entropy. Or Entropy over Continuous data.
