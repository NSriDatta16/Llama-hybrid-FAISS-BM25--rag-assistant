Disclaimer: I'm not to familiar with A/B testing. One of the strengths of Bayesian statistics is the use of priors, hyperpriors, and the hierarchy. Right now you have a flat beta(1,1) prior on all your outcomes. There must be some prior information you can include. I am not entirely sure what you mean it has "a 87% and 90% probability of being less than the Control and Treatment 2, respectively". Are you not looking at 95% credible difference in group estimates? And to answer your questions: yes, the Bayesian approach can definitely be stronger. It all depends on the data and prior, though. If you use a flat prior, there is not much benefit to the Bayesian approach (IMO). Second, again it depends on the prior. With a flat prior you would probably see an agreement most of the time. To finish, I would really recommend reading Doing Bayesian Data Analysis . Not the whole book, but just the first few chapters, to get a better intuition on Bayesian statistics.
