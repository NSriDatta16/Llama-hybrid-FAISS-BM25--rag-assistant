The amount of pixels do not change on the video, however, the section that you are interested on at each frame does. One way you could deal with this is by using image segmentation techniques, this is, at each time-step you can extract the image from the background and feed it to the CNN. If the number of pixels are not exactly the same at each timestamp after segmenting, you can simply re-scale the images to a fixed shape. In any case, a CNN could easily deal with these type of raw images as they are, due to the translation-invariance property given by the convolution + pooling steps. Think about it as the same way in which a CNN can recognize a cat independently on the position at which it is located on an image.
