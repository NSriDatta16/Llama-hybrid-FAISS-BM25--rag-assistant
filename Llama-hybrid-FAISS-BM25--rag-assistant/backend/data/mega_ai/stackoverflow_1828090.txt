I don't think there is a built-in function but you can calculate it yourself. To do this, calculate the root-mean-square average of continuous samples. rms = sqrt((sample0^2 + sample1^2 + sample2^2 + sample3^2) / numberOfSamples) The following links should be helpful to you as they contain the full source code to two excellent Android sound related projects.
