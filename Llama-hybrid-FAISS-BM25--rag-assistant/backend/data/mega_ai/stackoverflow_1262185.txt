My gut says "No." CPU time is not GPU time. If your CPU is busy updating the view, you might need to change the system to a more CPU friendly view. It sounds like it is not lazy loaded and is getting all of the data and all of the updates. How big is your range of values? If you do not have many values, this could be fine. My suspicion is that you have a large number of values and it is maintaining the entire list in memory. This is bad for a few reasons. It takes a lot of memory, you need to pay attention to all of the changes (not just the ones that affect your current display), it is a lot of content to shift around and update. I would look for a more friendly control that only loads part of the data. The graphics card that you have should be able to render the view in a very small fraction of a second. Try grabbing the application and wildly moving it around the screen. This will give you an indication of how quickly it can be updated (yes, not entirely accurate since it is probably being cached). How big is your list? Jacob
