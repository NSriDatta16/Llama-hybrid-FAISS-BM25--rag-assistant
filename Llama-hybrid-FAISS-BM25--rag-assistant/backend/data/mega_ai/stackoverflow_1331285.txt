Your deadlocks can definitely be related to the rebuilding of the indexes. There is also no doubt that those indexes don't need to be rebuilt that frequently. At a minimum though you should consider using the ONLINE option if you can to keep the index from being dropped before it's rebuilt. Here's a guideline we use: Index should be rebuilt when index fragmentation is greater than 40%. Index should be reorganized when index fragmentation is between 10% to 40%. Index rebuilding process uses more CPU and it locks the database resources. SQL Server development version and Enterprise version has option ONLINE, which can be turned on when Index is rebuilt. ONLINE option will keep index available during the rebuilding.
