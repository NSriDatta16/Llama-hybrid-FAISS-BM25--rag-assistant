There are some interesting results relating the performance of $k-NN$ approaches to the optimal (Bayesian) decision process, discussion can be found in e.g. in Pattern Recognition and Neural Networks B.D. Ripley (1996), but they they are more of the form: if I know the $k-NN$ error rate, I can bound the optimal error rate. In the end, I suspect that you'll end up doing cross-validation, for various $K$, on your training set, and pick the $K$ that minimizes the training error.
