There is no function called lower-case in XPath 1.0 which is the version of XPath used in Firefox. You need to use the ugly translate function instead:- translate(text(), 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz') ...but of course you would need to extend this if you need coverage of a wider character-set.
