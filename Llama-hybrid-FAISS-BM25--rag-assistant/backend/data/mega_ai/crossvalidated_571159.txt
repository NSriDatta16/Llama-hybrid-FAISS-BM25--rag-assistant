There are multiple definitions of sample (and population, in case of discreteness) quantiles. If you use the empirical cumulative distribution function definition (which is not a weighted average of two estimates) this agrees fully with Kaplan-Meier under no censoring, because K-M is precisely one minus the empirical cumulative distribution function. Note that sample quantiles are noisy estimates --- even more so with censoring which lowers the effective sample size.
