May I suggest a different approach? Im going to assume that 3D graphics are not essential. I believe that if youre really just starting out, going straight for 3D rendering can be a bit complex. 2D is much simpler. Therefor, follow these simple steps, expect it to last about two hours or so: Download (and install) Python Download (and install) PyGame Download (and install) Notepad++ , you will use this to write your code, save it with the .py extension (not .txt) Head over to the Line By Line Chimp Tutorial (great tutorial!) After youve read and experimented with that you should be able to create something of your own with a complexity level of, say, Tetris. I created an asteroids clone . Dont hesitate to return here on Stackoverflow to ask for help if you run into problems. I have helped a few friends through that tutorial that wanted to "try out game programming" and should be able to help you with anything you can manage to get stuck on. Now go nuts on the keyboard! Before you know it, you'll have created Dragon Age 2!
