As Tim said in a comment, what you're doing is re-sampling, not a bootstrap. There is a type of bootstrap, often called the" $m$ of $n$ " bootstrap," in which your resample sizes $m$ aren't of the same size as your original data sample $n$ . That can be useful for estimates of difficult statistics like extremes; see this page and its links. But you are evaluating something more like a mean value, and you specifically want to evaluate how your ability to estimate it changes with the sample size. One problem if you "provide a p-value and call it enough fraction sampling if the test does not find a sig. difference" is that you can find a non-significant difference just by having a really small sample size. What you need is some type of equivalence test . One approach is to do two one-sided tests (TOST). You decide first on lower and upper limits around your true value that don't matter in practice. You then perform one-sided tests of two null hypotheses on the re-sampled values: one that that the mean re-sampled value is below than the lower limit and one that it is above the upper limit. If you reject both those null hypotheses then you accept equivalence. That forces you to have enough data to reject those properly formulated null hypotheses. Before jumping to that, however, look carefully at the results of re-sampling. I'd recommend looking carefully at histograms of the 5 score levels (without averaging yet) over multiple re-samples at each of several sampling percentages. I'd watch out for problems that might come from intra-organ heterogeneity. You might have the ability to sample randomly from all portions of the organ, but will that happen in practice? If you find that 5% sampling is adequate, will the pathologist still prepare the whole organ and then randomly choose 5% as you did in your evaluation? Or will only 5% of the organ be prepared and evaluated? Unless you can count on great homogeneity within each organ that's evaluated, those won't be the same. See for example: Kayser, K., Schultz, H., Goldmann, T. et al. Theory of sampling and its application in tissue based diagnosis . Diagn Pathol 4, 6 (2009).
