Variability Reduction Using Square Roots

I am averaging volumes over a couple of shapes using different orientations and plane views. I think I read somewhere that the variability can be reduced in proportional to the square root of the number of shapes that is being used for the average, but I can't find any references to this. Is that statement about variability reduction true? If not, what is the actual statement (with reference provided)?
