The good news: You are already able to calculate the regression coefficients, for example you are able to say "per extra year of schooling, the subjects earn on average 1000€ more". The bad news: You don't understand what a confidence interval is. You need to express how certain you are on your calculation. Imagine you run the experiment with 10 subjects, or with 1000 of subjects. In the second case you are more certain of the effect. The certainty is expressed with a confidence interval. You say for example "per extra year of schooling, the subjects earn on average 1000€ [750€ to 1250€] more", which mean that you expect to find in 95% of experiments with a fixed number of subjects the coefficients between the confidence interval expressed between brackets. More can be found in every textbook. Hope this helps.
