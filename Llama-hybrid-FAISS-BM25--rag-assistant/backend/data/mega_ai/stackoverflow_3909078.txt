We're working on a desktop app here that leverages email communication to help teams succeed with projects. The app represents email communication in channels, as chats, and adds project related info so that all ownerships and requests could be tracked. It is in "beta" but check it out, may be there is a fit for your team: http://yoxel.com/personal-commitment-manager.html
