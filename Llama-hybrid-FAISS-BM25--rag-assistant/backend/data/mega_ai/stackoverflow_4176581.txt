I would recommend continuing to use '-Wall' as the default option, and disable any checks you need to on local, per-module basis using an OPTIONS_GHC pragma at the top of relevant files. The one I might make an exception for is indeed '-fno-warn-unused-do-bind', but one suggestion might be to use an explicit 'void' function ... writing 'void f' seems nicer than '_ As for name shadowing - I think it's generally good to avoid if you can - seeing 'map' in the middle of some code will lead most Haskellers to expect the standard library fn.
