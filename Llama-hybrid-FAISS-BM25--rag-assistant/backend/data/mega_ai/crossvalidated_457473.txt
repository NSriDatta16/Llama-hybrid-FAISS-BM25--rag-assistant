Both of these definitions I'd say are part of the process of feature engineering/feature extraction. The first is just more preliminary, as your model gets more complex and you tweak it, you may utilise the tools of the second such as transformations or PCA (technically a linear transformation). A transformation in a simple case could involve something like squaring one of your variables thereby making your model polynomial for example, while PCA will help remove redundancy in your data, reducing the number of features. What you're describing as a process of choosing what to measure before presumably you even generate your data set sounds a bit like experimental design. If you were doing A/B testing for example followed by building a predictive model then the experimental design would come first and with it choice of variables to measure. Further feature engineering would follow once you had the data. So at the very least the process you're describing would happen prior to the other two definitions of feature extraction. (Note I'm using feature engineering/feature extraction interchangeably here whereas sometimes engineering is the broader category while extraction a subset)
