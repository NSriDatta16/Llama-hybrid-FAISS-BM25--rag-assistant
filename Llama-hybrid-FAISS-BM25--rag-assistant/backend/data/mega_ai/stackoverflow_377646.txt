I would suggest that you use DomDocument, and DomXPath, rather than SimpleXml. However, in general, XML is not an optimum medium for storage of data - You should probably use a database for whatever it is you're doing. If you need to exchange the data easily, you could perhaps use SQLite, instead of the more common MySql.
