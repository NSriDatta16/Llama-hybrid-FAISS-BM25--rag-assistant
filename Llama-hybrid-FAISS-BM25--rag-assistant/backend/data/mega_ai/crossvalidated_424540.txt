Although it seems very late to put a comment for an answer to your question, I do not really agree with the answer provided above. If you run a random forest prediction model with a 10-fold-cross-validation, you get only one model and get the model performance with average statistics(usually). If you have two random forests with different model parameters, then you get two models and you run 10-fold-cross-validation two times. Then you compare the model performances against each other. You can pick the best one out of the two models and train the model with the whole data and then run on the test data to get the final model performance. This is how I understand.
