Pass arguments from array in php to constructor

Normally, if I want to pass arguments from $myarray to $somefunction I can do this in php using call_user_func_array($somefunction, $myarray); However this does not work when the function one wishes to call is the constructor for an object. For fairly obvious reasons it does not work to do: $myobj = new call_user_func_array($classname, $myarray); is there something fairly elegant that does work ?
