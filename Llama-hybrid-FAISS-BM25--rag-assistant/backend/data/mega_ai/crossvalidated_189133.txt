Fcop offered a great analogy with cookies but have covered only the sampling density aspect of the curse of dimensionality. We can extend this analogy to the sampling volume or the distance by distributing same number of Fcop's cookies in, say, ten boxes in one line, 10x10 boxes flat on the table and 10x10x10 in a stack. Then you can show that to eat the same share of cookies the child will have to open ever more boxes. It is really about the expectations but let's take a "worst case scenario" approach to illustrate. If there are 8 cookies and we want to eat a half i.e. 4, from 10 boxes in a worst case we only need to open 6 boxes. That's 60% - just about a half too. From 10x10 (again in a worst case) - 96(%). And from 10x10x10 - 996(99,6%). That's almost all of them! May be the storage room analogy and distance walked between rooms would do better than boxes here.
