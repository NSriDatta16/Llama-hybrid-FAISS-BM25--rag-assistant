I am not familiar with JSON or the json-framework, but clearly objectForKey cannot be used to access the X's since they all have the same key. If you know that objectForKey:@"OBJECTS" will return either an NSDictionary (single element) or an NSArray of NSDictionarys (multiple X elements), then you could do something like: if ( ![results isKindOfClass:[NSArray class]] ) { results =[NSArray arrayWithObject:results]; } That will get you a consistent result, assuming you understand exactly how the json-framework will behave. It will be somewhat fragile, if the elements ever return an array of entries instead of an NSDitionary then it will all fall apart. There may be a configuration setting for the json-framework that lets you control how it behaves in this case and that would be preferable.
