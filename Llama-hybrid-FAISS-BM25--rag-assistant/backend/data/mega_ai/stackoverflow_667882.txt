Sometimes it's easier to combine a regex with a little extra checking. So \ .*?\ should match anything between ... like tags. You can then programmatically check that the and are not and respectively. It'd probably be easiest to check this if you group them ala: (\ ).*?(\ ) then check to make sure $1 and $2 (or however you do backreferences in your environment) aren't the paragraph open and close tags. .*? specifies minimal matching; I'm assuming your regex environment supports that.
