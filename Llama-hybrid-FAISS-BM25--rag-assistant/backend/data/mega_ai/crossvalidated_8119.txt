Jags error with dgamma

I am trying to sample from a Gamma distribution in JAGS gd[i] ~ dgamma(k,r) where k and r are have priors such that they are positive. However I get the following error when I compile the model: Error in node gd[9] Unobserved node inconsistent with unobserved parents at initialization Any ideas? EDIT: BACKGROUND What I am trying to do is to estimate the parameters of the CIR process with Bayesian techniques. In order to assess the estimator, I have simulated some data with given parameters on a quarterly basis (timeStep=90): jdata Then I wrote a model with JAGS. The problem is that the CIR process has scaled noncentral chi square distribution and this is not directly supported in JAGS. So inspired by R implementation, I came up with model { for (i in 2:length(timeSerie)){ ncp[i] Trying to run the model ( jags.model in R ), I get the following error Error in node gd[18] Unobserved node inconsistent with unobserved parents at initialization (Now it is 18 instead of 8, because I use other simulated data). I tried to debug JAGS (gdb and valgrind) to no avail: I don't have enough knowledge to do it...
