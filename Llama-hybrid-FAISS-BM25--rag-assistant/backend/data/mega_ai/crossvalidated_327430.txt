Actually, your y scores need not be normally distributed. Even when y departs from normality, it is entirely possible for the residuals to assume normality, which is one of the assumptions of linear regression. The distinction with logistic regression (or poisson or other), however, is a somewhat different issue. There you are specifying the mapping (or link) between changes in X and y scores.
