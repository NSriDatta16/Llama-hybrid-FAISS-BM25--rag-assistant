Many of the features of full-blown applications servers are provided individually, and can be bundled with simpler alternatives like Tomcat or Jetty. JMS has multiple implementations , like ActiveMQ, HornetQ, etc. Same goes for JTA . Spring is a nice alternative to JavaEE in that regard - it can run on a simple Tomcat and supports datasources, JTA and messaging. SprignSource also develops the tc server, which is a "enterprise-like" tomcat. (I noticed you omitted Glasfish from the list - it is an application server worth taking a look at.)
