The reason you don't see notions like a "predefinable alpha error rate" with Bayesian updating is that the update of the posterior often accounts for these effects. If the sole decision that's needed is when to stop, then that can be posed as a Bayesian hierarchical model. If tests need to be done along the way, then, yes, life is more complicated and you'll need to study, 'cause there's no quick answer. First paper to check out is Gelman, Hill, Yajima, "Why We (Usually) Don't Have To Worry About Multiple Comparisons", http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/multiple2f.pdf The second, more important reference is Section 7.6 ("Sequential analysis") and the related subsection 8.2.4 of Carlin and Louis, BAYESIAN METHODS FOR DATA ANALYSIS (3rd edition), 2009, pages 346ff and 398ff. All that said, while I can't delve any more deeply into your problem of groups and their success or failure in your model, I suspect you may be thresholding some measure of performance to obtain success or failure. If so, information may be being thrown away unnecessarily and, so, whatever you determine is a stopping point may be more conservative than necessary ... meaning later. If so, the measures will need a different model than binomial, but you'll gain. For more, see the talk by Dr Frank Harrell, Jr, 2010, and its references, Information Allergy .
