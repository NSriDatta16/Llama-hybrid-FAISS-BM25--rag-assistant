Even more automation can help here ! Yes, writing unit tests can be a lot of work, so use some tools to help you out. Have a look at something like Pex, from Microsoft, if you're using .Net It will automatically create suites of unit tests for you by examining your code. It will come up with tests which give good coverage, trying to cover all paths through your code. Of course, just by looking at your code it can't know what you were actually trying to do, so it doesn't know if it's correct or not. But, it will generate interesting tests cases for you, and you can then examine them and see if it is behaving as you expect. If you then go further and write parameterized unit tests (you can think of these as contracts, really) it will generate specific tests cases from these, and this time it can know if something's wrong, because your assertions in your tests will fail.
