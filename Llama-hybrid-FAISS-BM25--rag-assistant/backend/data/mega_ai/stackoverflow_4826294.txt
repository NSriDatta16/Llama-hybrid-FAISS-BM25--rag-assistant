You don't really make any question so I'm not sure whether you're aware of the merge subcommand but that's the one you need: http://svnbook.red-bean.com/nightly/en/svn.ref.svn.c.merge.html Pay special attention to the --accept parameter; you need it in order to get automated conflict resolution: C:\>svn help merge [...] --accept ARG : specify automatic conflict resolution action ('postpone', 'base', 'mine-conflict', 'theirs-conflict', 'mine-full', 'theirs-full', 'edit', 'launch') I also recommend reading the Branching and merging chapter in the Subversion book.
