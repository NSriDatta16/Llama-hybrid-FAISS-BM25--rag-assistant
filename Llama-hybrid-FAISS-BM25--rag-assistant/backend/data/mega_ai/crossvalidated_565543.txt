Hypothesis testing and standard deviations away from the mean

A vice chancellor believes that at her university (UoX) graduates on average have higher salaries that the overall graduate population in the UK. She knows that the average salary of all graduates in the UK is £29,065. She has asked you to test her theory. Let be the random variable that represents the salary of the UoX graduate population. You choose a sample of 100 UoX graduates and find out their salaries. After collecting your 100 independent and identically distributed (iid) observations, you find that the sample mean is = £32,512. You know that the variance of the salaries for UoX graduates is 2 = 18790. Calculate the test statistic and present the result of your test. Is the principal correct that UoX graduates on average have higher slaries compared to the rest of the UK graduates? I have got a very odd solution for the problem above where the Principal is almost 100% to be correct. The probability of getting that sample result is 251 std deviations above the mean of the null hypothesis, which is impossible. I just want to see if I have got it right. Here is how I got this figure. Var(UoX Sample Mean) = 18790/100 = 187.9 Assuming the Null Hypothesis is true and UoX graduate salary is no different than the national average of 29065, then the mean of sample mean is 29065. Therefore, our sample of 100 UoX graduates with mean salary of 32512 is (32512-29065)/squareroot(187.9) = 251 standard deviations away from the mean of Null.
