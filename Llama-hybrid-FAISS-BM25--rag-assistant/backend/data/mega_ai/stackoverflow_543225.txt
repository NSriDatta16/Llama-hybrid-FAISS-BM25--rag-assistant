How to avoid tripping over UTF-8 BOM when reading files

I'm consuming a data feed that has recently added a Unicode BOM header (U+FEFF), and my rake task is now messed up by it. I can skip the first 3 bytes with file.gets[3..-1] but is there a more elegant way to read files in Ruby which can handle this correctly, whether a BOM is present or not?
