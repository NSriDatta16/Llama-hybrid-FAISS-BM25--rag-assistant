CLI only supports generic arguments for covariance and contravariance when using delegates, but when using generics there are some limitations, for example, you can cast a string to an object so most people will assume that you can do the same with List to a List but you can't do that because there is no covariance between generic parameters however you can simulate covariance as you can see in this article. So it depends on the runtime type that it is generated by the abstract factory. That reads like a markov chain... Bravo.
