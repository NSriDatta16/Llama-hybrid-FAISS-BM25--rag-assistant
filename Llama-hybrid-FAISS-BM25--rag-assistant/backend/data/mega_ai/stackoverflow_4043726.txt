how to compile src/test/java with maven when test code and main java code depends on the same jar file?

I am beginning to learn Maven and ran into a problem when I am trying to compile the test source code in a maven project. My main java source code is dependent on a jar file so I have a dependency declared in my pom file as following: 4.0.0 com.mycompany myMavenApp 0.0.1-SNAPSHOT com.mycompany.maven.testapp domain 1.0 Compile error when compiling the test code: [ERROR] \projects\news\publishing\src\test\java\com\mycompany\transformers\monitoring\JournalMonitorTest.java:[40,30] cannot find symbol [ERROR] symbol : class JournalMonitor [ERROR] location: class com.mycompany.transformers.monitoring.JournalMonitorTest
