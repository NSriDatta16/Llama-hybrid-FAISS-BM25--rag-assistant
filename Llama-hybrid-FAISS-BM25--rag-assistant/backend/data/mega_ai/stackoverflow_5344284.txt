Perhaps our build.properties is too old (from 3.2's template, probably), or perhaps we constructed our target platform improperly, but thanks to a blog post by Kai TÃ¶dter , one of the many potential remedies we tried in desperation was (according to Kai's "Trick 1") deleting everything out of our target platform directory except the plugins and features directories. That at least stopped PDE Build mysteriously choking, and error messages then guided us to the rest of the fixups we had to do. (In our case, those fixups consisted almost entirely of updating a secondary (tests) product definition's list of required plugins by clicking "Add Required Plug-ins" and removing a reference to the org.eclipse.ant.optional.junit4 fragment.) Indeed, it appears that merely deleting either one of the following lines from the target platform's configuration/config.ini is sufficient to unstick PDE Build: eclipse.p2.profile=epp.package.rcp (or) eclipse.p2.data.area=@config.dir/../p2 ...though we have preferred to just strip out everything but plugins and fragments lest there be other magical beings hiding in the target platform that could potentially trip us up. (We don't understand why deleting one of those lines would placate PDE Build . . . but we're back in business.)
