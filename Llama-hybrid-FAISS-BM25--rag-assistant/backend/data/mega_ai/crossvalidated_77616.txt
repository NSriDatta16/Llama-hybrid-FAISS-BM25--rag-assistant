As touched upon by @scortchi the reviewer was operating under the false impression that it is not possible to model nonlinear effects of predictors on the logit scale in the context of logistic regression. The original model was quick to assume linearity of all predictors. By relaxing the linearity assumption, using for example restricted cubic splines (natural splines), the entire shape of the curve is flexible and inflection point is no longer an issue. Had there been a single predictor and had it been expanded using a regression spline, one could say that the logistic model makes only the assumptions of smoothness and independence of observations.
