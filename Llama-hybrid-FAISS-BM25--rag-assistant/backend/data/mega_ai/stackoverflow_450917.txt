Database/Web servers as a Virtual Machines vs Bare Metal?

I manage a database (Oracle 8i) and web server (IIS) for about 50 simultaneous users on average and a theoretical limit of 100 simultaneous users. A mid level system. We just got a dual-socket Quad-core XEON - 16GB RAM - SAS-RAID-10 beast and I am exploring the possibilities of taking these two separate servers and merging them into two virtual machines both running on the new server (Server 2009 Hyper-V). 1) In general, what are the performance penalties (as well as any gotchas and hidden consequences) of running both the database and web servers as virtual machines on one mega server vs running them on two separate slower boxes? Is it a big NO-NO or it is something worth trying for a mid-level system that will never need to scale? 2) What are the general performance penalties (in percentage) and gotchas for virtualizing just the database server? We run Oracle 8i (but are considering moving to MS SQL Server). 3) If only stress tests can determine an reasonable answer, what would be the easiest way to test these scenarios (tools / configuration). Thanks in advance for any generous knowledge-sharing.
