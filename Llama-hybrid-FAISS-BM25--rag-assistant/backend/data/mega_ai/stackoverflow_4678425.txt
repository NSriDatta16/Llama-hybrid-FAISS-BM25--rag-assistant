Problem send touchEvent to backView for make Scroll in tableView

My problem is that I have a ScrollView and back I have other view with TableView. I intercept the touch in the ScrollView and send the touchBegan, touchMoved, touchEnded and touchCancel [tableView touchesXXXXXX:motion withEvent:event]; (XXXX is Began, Moved, ...) These work for detect touchs, and I can select the row in the back tableView, but my problem is that can't make scroll in back tableView. How I can send the touch event for make scroll on tableView? Because sending the touchMoved event to tableView don't make scroll. Thanks for your help!
