Thanks for a long and frank explanation of your worries! Having non-normal errors is not an issue if you incorporate the true distribution of the errors in your Bayesian calculation. If you mis-specify and use another family of distributions than the "true" one, you have to assess the impact of this error either analytically or by simulation. I am quite skeptical of the "most conservative" label endowed by Jaynes on the normal distribution. I would think it applies only to the case when you replace a normal error with a $t$ error, since the normal distribution had lighter tails than any $t$ distribution. But if the error can be double-exponential or anything else with even lighter tails, I do not see why the normal should be "most conservative".
