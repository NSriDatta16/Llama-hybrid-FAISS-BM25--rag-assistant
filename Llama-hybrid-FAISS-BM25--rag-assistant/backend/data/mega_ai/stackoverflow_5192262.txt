It's still very much a work in progress , but you should be able to: import scalaj.reflect._ for { clazz Sorry about the toSeqs , they're to work around a known issue using Option s in a for-comprehension. Please don't push it too hard, it's still very young and fragile. I'm certainly not at the stage yet where I'd accept bug reports :) UPDATE Well... I know that I said I'm not accepting bug reports, but this one seemed so useful that I've pushed it up to github anyway. To do the job dynamically (from a String class name): import scalaj.reflect._ for { clazz
