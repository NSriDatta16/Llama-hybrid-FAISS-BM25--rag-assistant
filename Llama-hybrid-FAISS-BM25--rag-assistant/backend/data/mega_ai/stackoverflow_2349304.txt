Consider a database with a properly normalized parent-child relationship. Let's say the cardinality is an average of 2x1. You have two tables, Parent, with p rows. Child with 2x p rows. The join operation means for p parent rows, 2x p child rows must be read. The total number of rows read is p + 2x p . Consider denormalizing this into a single table with only the child rows, 2x p . The number of rows read is 2x p . Fewer rows == less physical I/O == faster.
