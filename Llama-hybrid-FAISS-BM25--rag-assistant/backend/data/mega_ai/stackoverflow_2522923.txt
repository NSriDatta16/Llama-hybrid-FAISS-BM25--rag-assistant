Embedding two slideshows

I am trying to embedd two slideshows into my flash file. I already managed to integrate one, but I can't integrate another since my knowledge of actionscript is very limited. For people that know Flash well it is a really easy question. What do I have to rename in this script so that I can create a second slideshow, without always calling on the first one. Here is the script for the first slideshow: (I got it from the website where I bought the template for the slideshow from) var loader:Loader = new Loader(); var monoslideshow:Object; loader.contentLoaderInfo.addEventListener(Event.CO MPLETE, onLoadComplete); addChild(loader); loader.load(new URLRequest("monoslideshow.swf")); function onLoadComplete(event:Event):void { monoslideshow = event.target.content; monoslideshow.showLogo = false; monoslideshow.setViewport(new Rectangle(730, 20, 700, 660)); var xml:XML = monoslideshow.loadXML(xml); }
