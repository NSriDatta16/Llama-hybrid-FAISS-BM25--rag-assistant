The same way as you would in Java. In Java, packages organize classes in physical directories. I'm not sure about this, but the compiler even encourages this convention IIRC. In C# you're not obliged to organize your classes into separate directories that match your namespaces, but it's a very common convention though. Speaking of namespaces in C#, they do not follow the com.domain.appname.tier convention, but use the Company.Product.Tier format. How to reorganize large classes depends on the application. This is an exercise in applying OOP guidelines and applies to both Java and C#.
