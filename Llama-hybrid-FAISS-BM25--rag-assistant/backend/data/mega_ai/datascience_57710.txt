There is a great book written by Andrew Ng, called "Machine Learning Yearning". You can download it for free here https://www.deeplearning.ai/machine-learning-yearning/ In the Kaggle's dataset now. The datasets you have are the training and the test. Even if you wanted to use the test dataset, you cannot. If you open it, you will see that only the features are there. The target column is missing, because this is the file that you need to use the model and predict the values to upload it on Kaggle. Reading the chapters 5, 6 and 7 of the linked book, you will get a lot of great advises on how to handle the training data. In short. You should split the training dataset in 3 parts. Training set — Which you run your learning algorithm on. Dev (development) set — Which you use to tune parameters, select features, and make other decisions regarding the learning algorithm. Sometimes also called the hold-out cross validation set. Test set — which you use to evaluate the performance of the algorithm, but not to make any decisions regarding what learning algorithm or parameters to use. Quoted from chapter 5, page 15. Keep in mind that the above Test set has nothing to do with the test file that you got from Kaggle.
