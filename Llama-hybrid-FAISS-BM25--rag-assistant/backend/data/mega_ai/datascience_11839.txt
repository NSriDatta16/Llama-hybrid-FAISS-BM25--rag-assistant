Since no one has mentioned bayesian optimization yet: "Bayesian optimization is a sequential design strategy for global optimization of black-box functions." At the bottom of that wikipedia page are links to several bayesian optimization libraries like: Spearmint MOE - Metric Optimization Engine SigOpt BayesOpt GPyOpt fmfn's bayesian optimization library (short & simple) Besides libraries using bayesian optimization there are also libraries using TPE (trees of parzen estimators), like hyperopt . Here's an image of fmfn's bayesian optimizer optimizing a non-linear 2d function. As you can see, a point close to the global optimum is found after relatively few iterations and the system tests more points in more promising (red) areas than in less promising (blue) areas - making it more efficient than random search: (full animation)
