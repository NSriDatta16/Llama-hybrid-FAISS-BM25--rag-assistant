SL4 TransformToVisual: "Value does not fall within the expected range."

I have a ScrollViewer containing a Canvas: This code causes an exception, "Value does not fall within the expected range." var generalTransform = scrollViewer.TransformToVisual(MapCanvas); Any hints on what causes this would be appreciated. Looking in the online help, I couldn't find documentation of what exceptions TransformToVisual might throw or why. UPDATE: Is there q way to test the scrollViewer and/or MapCanvas to make sure the TransformToVisual call will succeed?
