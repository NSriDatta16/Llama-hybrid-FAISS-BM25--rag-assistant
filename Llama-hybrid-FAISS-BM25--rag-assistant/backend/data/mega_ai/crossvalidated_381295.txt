Timeseries with multiplicative noise in Stan

Say we have a monthly time series $y_t \geq 0$ dominated by seasonality, where the absolute differences from year to year are much smaller during low season. To avoid negative values and capture the higher uncertainty during high seasons I want to fit the time series based on last year's value with multiplicative noise, i.e. as $$ y_t = y_{t-12} \cdot \varepsilon_t. $$ What is the correct Stan code for this?
