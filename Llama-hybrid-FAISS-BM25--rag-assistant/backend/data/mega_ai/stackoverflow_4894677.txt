You said its less than 2mb, so storing files in table is an option. Although the best solution is to have a document management system like alfresco or even use an existing version management solution like svn. (rather than directly storing in the file system you need a Content Management System). You could just store the url of the document. This will help you in maintain, will avoid bloating of your database, will not affect your db performance and more importantly will simplify your programming, by leveraging existing solution ( did I say version management, in the of chance you might need it).
