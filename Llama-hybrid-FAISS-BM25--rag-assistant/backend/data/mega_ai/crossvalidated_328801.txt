One Class SVM for Time Series data

I am trying to use an OCSVM for my time series data which looks like this: Time Speed_of_Vehicle Direction Lane ------------------------------------------------------------ | 00:00:21 | x mph | North | 1 | | 00:01:12 | x' mph | North | 3 | | 00:05:01 | x''mph | South | 5 | | . | . | . | . | | . | . | . | . | There are 6 lanes in total [4 North and 2 South] Time-stamps with the speed, direction and lane features for 30 days I am trying to fit a OVSVM model over this data for anomaly detection. I have not used an SVM before so, I am unsure on how to pass the data to train the model. What features would be most useful in my case to train the model? What I have thought of doing was; There are about on an average 700 time-stamps for each day. These time-stamps are not aligned for the days. So, I aggregate the time stamps on fixed intervals for each day. Now that the data observations have aligned time periods, I am not sure on what features to put in my vector. Is it advised just to include the Speed_of_Vehicle as my feature for each observation? I have also thought about having a different model for each different lane. So 6 trained OCSVMs for each lane. Is it necessary/advised to include the time feature as well since the data is contextual ? Any advise on how to train the model or reference to any papers will be appreciated.
