Price optimization for tiered and seasonal products

Assuming I can collect the demand of the purchase of a certain product that are of different market tiers. Example: Product A is low end goods. Product B is another low end goods. Product C and D are middle-tier goods and product E and F are high-tier goods. We have collected data the last year on the following 1. Which time period (season - festive? non-festive?) does the different tier product reacts based on the price set? Reacts refer to how many % of the product is sold at certain price range 2. How fast the reaction from the market after marketing is done? Marketing is done on 10 June and the products are all sold by 18 June for festive season that slated to happened in July (took 8 days at that price to finish selling) How can data science benefit in terms of recommending 1. If we should push the marketing earlier or later? 2. If we can higher or lower the price? (Based on demand and sealing rate?) Am I understanding it right that data science can help a marketer in this aspect? Which direction should I be looking into if I am interested to learn about it.
