Sampling for Approximate Bayesian Computation without Simulation

I am trying to use ABC for a physical black box phenomenon. Both the input space and output space are 3D, and there is a proper distance function for the performance space (CIEL*A*B* Î”E). It is not possible to simulate this black box, therefore the samples need to be physically measured and evaluated. In addition, this measurement should be done in batches. I am wondering whether it's possible to perform ABC without a simulator and if it is an efficient approach for this problem. Furthermore, is there an iterative sampling method for posterior that provides samples in large batches, e.g., Sequential Monte Carlo with many chains?
