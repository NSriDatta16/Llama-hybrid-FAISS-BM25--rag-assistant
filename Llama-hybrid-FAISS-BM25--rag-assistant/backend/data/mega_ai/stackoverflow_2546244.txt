I usually organize my projects in this way: project main.py README models bar.py foo.py views foolist.hml barlist.hml controllers controller1.py controller2.py api controllerapi.py helpers utilities.py lib extfoo.py db foo.db test test.py Look at this post ; it's a really great article on how to structure a project (not in python but it does not matter).
