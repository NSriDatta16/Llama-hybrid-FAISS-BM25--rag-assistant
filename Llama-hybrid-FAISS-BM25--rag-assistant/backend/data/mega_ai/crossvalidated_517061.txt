np.log() vs StandardScaler() in preprocessing of dataset variables

I'm anew to DS and now I'm passing this introductury Course on Kaggle. I'm trying to catch the logic behind this exercise , introduction. Particularly the part of data transformations is unclear: preprocessor = make_column_transformer( (StandardScaler(), make_column_selector(dtype_include=np.number)), (OneHotEncoder(sparse=False), make_column_selector(dtype_include=object)),) X = preprocessor.fit_transform(X) y = np.log(y) # log transform target instead of standardizing Author chooses to apply StandardScaler() to numerical variables and np.log() transformation to target variable. Can you explain me please what's the reason for using np.log() transfromation? Data itself looks like this (with 'FE' as target variable): Thanks in advance for all the possible answers an explanations! If you suggest some articles to read to fill the gaps, I will be really grateful.
