Even though the second approach is my preferred one, since the rules of Golf probably won't change very often, the first design could work in this case. The sum column, if you would choose to have one, could be computed with a trigger. However, you would have to handle the situation when you and your friends decide to go a 9-hole or a 36-hole round. There is also the issue with how to store additional per-hole information, in case there are any. A schema with a separate table with a row for each hole played by a player will be much easier to maintain. As always, the best solution depends on how you are going to use, update and query the data. If your only use case involves displaying total scores and high scores, the first approach could work. As soon as a use case is to deal with information related to a particular hole, your application code and/or SQL will be harder to write and maintain. Take for instance getting the average score for a particular hole for all games played. In any case I would suggest going with the second alternative and store per-hole scores in a separate table. The performance benefits of having all scores in the same table will probably not outweigh the troubles with maintaining it and writing queries towards it.
