If you want to use the same action on your controller for serving both situations, I'd probably change the signature to something like this: public ActionResult Index(bool archive, int? page) Then, you can have two different routes for this. First for the non-archived stuff: routes.MapRoute( "NewsArticles", "News/Page/{page}", new { controller = "News", action = "Index", archive = false } ); And then for the archive version: routes.MapRoute( "NewsArticlesArchive", "News/Archive/Page/{page}", new { controller = "News", action = "Index", archive = true } ); Now you have the liberty in your action of filtering based on the archive bool. Also, I agree with the others here that the Page text in the URL is redundant. If you decide to remove it, you can just yank it out the routes above and everything should still work. Good luck!
