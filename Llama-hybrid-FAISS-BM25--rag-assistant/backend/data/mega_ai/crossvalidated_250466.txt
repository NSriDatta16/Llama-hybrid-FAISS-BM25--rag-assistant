How to combine results from multiple imputed categorical data

I would like to combine the results from multiple imputed categorical data to compare with the results from the original data. I know how to combine results from multiple imputation of dichotomuous and continuous data (coefficient resp. odds ratio, standard errors and p-values). I also know how to pool $\chi^2$-values from a $\chi^2$-test to compute a pooled p-value ( Li 1991 ). But how should I pool the cross tables respectively percentages of each level (2xn-level cross table)? Should I just average the single cell of each multiple imputation, respectivly the percentages of each level? Update 1: To have an idea about the data, I created a table: df0 This could be the original data with total $N$ observation. Now, imagine 10 such tables from multiple imputation with each $N_1=N_2= ... =N_{10} > N$.
