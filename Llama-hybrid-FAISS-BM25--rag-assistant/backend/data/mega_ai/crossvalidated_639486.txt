How do bookmakers update their odds in real-time?

I wasn't satisfied with the answers on this question , so I'm asking again: how do bookmakers adjust their implied probabilities as bets arrive sequentially? Suppose there are four things to bet on, and they're all mutually exclusive: events A, B, C and D. Suppose at this moment the bookmaker's implied probabilities are $q_a, q_b, q_c, q_d \ge 0$ . A winning bet of a dollar on event $A$ pays out $(1-q_a)/q_a$ . A losing bet of a dollar results in the loss of that dollar, and so on and so forth. I understand how and when arbitrage is possible. In the case that these implied probabilities sum to something less than $1$ , then one can bet in proportion to the implied probabilities to guarantee a profit in every outcome: \begin{align} \left\{ \left(\frac{1-q_a}{q_a}\right)q_a - q_b - q_c - q_d \right\} & > 0 \tag{A happens}\\ \left\{ -q_a + \left(\frac{1-q_b}{q_b}\right)q_b - q_c - q_d \right\} &> 0 \tag{B happens} \\ \left\{ -q_a - q_b + \left(\frac{1-q_c}{q_c}\right)q_c - q_d \right\} & > 0 \tag{C happens} \\ \left\{ -q_a - q_b - q_c + \left(\frac{1-q_d}{q_d}\right)q_d \right\} &> 0 \tag{D happens} \end{align} If the implied probabilities sum to something greater than $1$ , then the same reasoning applied, but you would have to be able to bet in negative amounts. For this reason, as I understand, many bookmakers will set the implied probabilities to something greater than $1$ and hope that their clients bet in proportion to the quoted odds. However, they obviously don't control the flow of bets. Say a large bet comes in for outcome $A$ . What is an example of a specific algorithm that would shorten the odds for outcome $A$ , and then adjust the other implied probabilities so that they all continue to sum to the same number that's greater than $1$ ? If there isn't any documentation of any strategy, is there known to be a framework for thinking about this? Optimal control, perhaps? I imagine you would need some hypothesized probability distribution describing future bets, but I'm lost at how to turn that into something specific. Finally, I'm less interested in something ad hoc. Something that's based on some framework would be nice so that one could reason about its guarantees.
