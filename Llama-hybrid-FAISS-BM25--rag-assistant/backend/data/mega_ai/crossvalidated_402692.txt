The original use by Francis Galton was in a problem where children's heights were being predicted from parents' heights. Tall parents (parents taller than average) tend to have tall children, but on average shorter than themselves, whereas short parents (parents shorter than average) tend to have short children, but on average taller than themselves. This phenomenon was called regression to the mean , where regression means falling back, rather than deterioration. The name has stuck for all similar problems, including the great majority that have nothing to do with heredity. But a regression effect can be expected in many testing-retesting problems. This history is well documented. For example, see this Wikipedia article and its references.
