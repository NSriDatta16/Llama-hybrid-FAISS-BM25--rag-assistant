Not really frameworks but real games (maybe their engine will be useful though, at least the first one)... First one is Warzone 2100 , a real-time strategy and real-time tactics game (under GPL). More details on its Wikipedia page . Second one is Americas Army: Special Forces , a FPS game developed by the U.S. Army based on the Unreal Engine. It has a Wikipedia page too. In the America's Army game, players are bound by Rules of Engagement (ROE) and grow in experience as they navigate challenges in teamwork-based, multiplayer, force versus force operations. In the game, as in the Army, accomplishing missions requires a team effort and adherence to the seven Army Core Values. Through its emphasis on team play, the game demonstrates these values of loyalty, duty, respect, selfless service, honor, integrity and personal courage and makes them integral to success in America's Army. AFAIK, Americas Army is not open source but I don't know if it's because it's classified or because of license issues with UT. See http://forum.americasarmy.com/viewtopic.php?t=310306 for more details. Maybe the Army can help you :)
