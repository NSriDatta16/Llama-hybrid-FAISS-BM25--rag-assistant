With this sort of dependent variable, there are two basic alternatives: Treat the variable as continuous, or ordinal. If you decide on continuous, then a starting place is "regular" OLS regression. If you decide on ordinal, then you could start with ordinal logistic. Each might have to be modified based on whether the assumptions are met. How to decide? Technically, this kind of scale is ordinal. You don't know that the spaces between the numbers are equal. If you want to be absolutely correct, then you can't use OLS, because that does assume that the data are interval (or ratio). But, first, an ordinal logistic would give you 10 intercepts to deal with; that's complicated. And, if the assumption of proportional odds is violated, then you might need nominal logistic, which would give you 10 parameters for each independent variable, which gets really hard to interpret. Second, while it's not guaranteed that the spaces are equal, it may be justifiable to assume so. This justification would depend on the exact nature of your test. One of my favorite statistics books is Statistics as Principled Argument by Robert Abelson (it's a really easy read, but will get you thinking). One of Abelson's points is that data analysis is not so much about what is right in some absolute sense as what you can justify. If you argue that the scale is really continuous, will people buy that argument? For a lot of psychological variables, it makes considerable sense. It may be an artifact of the particular scale that yields only integers and, really, someone could be between 4 and 5 (or whatever). You could try both ordinal logistic and OLS and compare predictions. If they are similar, then you can use the simpler and more familiar model. (How similar? That's up to you!)
