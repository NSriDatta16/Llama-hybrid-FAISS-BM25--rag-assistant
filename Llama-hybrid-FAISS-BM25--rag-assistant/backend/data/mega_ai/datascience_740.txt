I would suggest you to use libsvm, which already has adjustable class weights implemented in it. Rather than replicating the training samples, one modifies the C parameter for different classes in the SVM optimization. For example if your data has 2 classes, and the first class is only 10% of the data, you would choose class weights to be 10 and 1 for class 1 and 2 respectively. Therefore, margin violations of the first class would cost 10 times more than the margin violations for second class, and per-class accuracies would be more balanced.
