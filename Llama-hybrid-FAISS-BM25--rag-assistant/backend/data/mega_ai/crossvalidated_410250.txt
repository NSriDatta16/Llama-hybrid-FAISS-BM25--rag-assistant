Short answer: you can build a test set to validate time series models! If that weren't the case, and leaving a few of the final observations for testing then time series would be a pretty bad technique. Indeed, you can do this recursively. Take the first few dozen data points, fit the models, try to predict the first few days after that. Then take all of the data previously used (train and test) and go a few days further. In the end, you will have a good amount of comparisons of model performance.
