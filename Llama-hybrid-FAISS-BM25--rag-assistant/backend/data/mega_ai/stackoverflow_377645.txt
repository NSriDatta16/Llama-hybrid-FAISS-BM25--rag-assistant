You shouldn't be intimidated for windows mobile development. It isn't much different from desktop development. I strongly recommend that you use .NET Compact Framework for development and not C++/MFC. Some useful links: Mobile section at the Code Project. You would find a lot of articles, a little digging is needed to find the appropriate one. Smart Device Framework from OpenNetCF offer valuable extensions to the compact framework. When you install the Mobile SDK, you will find under the Community folder links for the Windows Mobile and CF framework blogs. These are also valuable resources. Regarding your application, you are right about the WCF and the SQL Server CE. These are the proper ways for handling communication and storage. Some hints for people coming from a desktop world: You need to have some sort of power management. The device may automatically go to suspend state. Also, you shouldn't consume power when you don't have to. Network connectivity is a difficult issue. You can register notifications for when a specific network (Wi-Fi, GPRS) becomes available or unavailable. You can also set the preferred means of communication. Make the UI as simple as possible. The user uses his thumb and/or a pen and he is probably on the move. Test in a real device as early as possible.
