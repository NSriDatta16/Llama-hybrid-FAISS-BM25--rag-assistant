What is CorLoc which is used to evaluate object detection performance?

I tried to understand this evaluatation method for object detection. My understanding is, the neural networks will give a bounding box for a target object and CorLoc evaluates only positive images which contain the target class, and counts the percentage of images for IOU > 0.5: CorLoc = (the boxes that IOU > 0.5) / (all boxes belong to the target class) e.g. there are 100 bounding boxes for car, but just 60 bounding box's IOU > 0.5, so the corloc is 60/100 = 60% I found this image where there are three bounding boxes: red bbox means IOU 0.5 CorLoc is therefore 2/3 = 66% But I don't understand why ignore the rightmost motorbike and why just evaluate CorLoc on traing dataset or something I need to know about corloc?
