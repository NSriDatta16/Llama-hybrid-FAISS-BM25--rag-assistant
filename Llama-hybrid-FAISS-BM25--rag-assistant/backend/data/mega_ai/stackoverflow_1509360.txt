How do I disable the click handler on a YUI Node?

I am wanting to be able to disable the click functionality of a radio button so I can uncheck it. However, when I uncheck it, the click still fires and the end result is a radio that unselects (and modifies other page elements accordingly), and then re-checks because of the onclick event. var clickFunction = function(e, radio, p){ var checked = radio.get("checked"); radio.set("checked", !checked); }; this.controlNode = Y.Node.create(" "); this.label = Y.Node.create(" " + display + " "); Y.on("mousedown", clickFunction, this.label, this.controlNode, parent.controlNode); parent.controlNode.appendChild(this.controlNode); parent.controlNode.appendChild(this.label); The mousedown event handler is used, as it's for fat fingers on a (windows) touch screen, and movement between mousedown and mouseup does not constitute a click. (Throughout a tap with a finger, the finger will increase and decrease it's surface area on the screen, and a non-multitouch screen put the cursor at the average of the contact points. A slight roll will move the cursor). The mouse down bubbles up, and results in dependency evaluation and show/hiding other controls on a page. I simply want undo; and I think that having another reset option is less than satisfactory for my particular use. If nothing else eventuates here, I shall have to use that.
