It sounds like you are interested in fitting a mixed effects (binary) logistic regression model . You'll likely need to recode your dependent variable so that it takes the value 0 (instead of FALSE) and 1 (instead of TRUE). Your model will include crossed random effects for participants and items. The R function that you need to fit this type of model is the glmer function from the lme4 package. See this link for a detailed example of glmer's use in a setting similar to yours: http://people.linguistics.mcgill.ca/~morgan/book/mixed-effects-logistic-regression.html .
