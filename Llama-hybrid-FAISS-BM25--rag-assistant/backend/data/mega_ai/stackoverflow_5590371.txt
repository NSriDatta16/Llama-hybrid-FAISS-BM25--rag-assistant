As mentioned in Merge Tool Configuration The merge tool is run with an argument list of args with the following variables expanded: $output expands to the existing file which already contains the version from the first parent - and this is also where the result of the merge ends up / must end up $local expands to file.orig which is created as a copy of file in the working directory version - it thus contains the unmerged version from the first parent $base expands to /tmp/file~base.* which is created with the version from the common ancestor revision ( see hg debugancestor ) $other expands to /tmp/file~other.* which is created with the version from the new second parent revision which the first parent is merged with (so yes, "left (local) be A5, center (parent) be A2, and right (other) be B4") (See " performing the merge ")
