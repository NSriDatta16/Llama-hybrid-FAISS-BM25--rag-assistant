Variable importance in RNN or LSTM

Several method have been devised for accessing or quantifying variable importance (even if only relative to each other) in MLP neural network models: Connection weights Garsonâ€™s algorithm Partial derivatives Input perturbation Sensitivity analysis Forward stepwise addition Backward stepwise elimination Improved stepwise selection 1 Improved stepwise selection 2 (these were described in http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2004.03.013 ) Is there any method that can be applied to RNNs or LSTMs neural networks?
