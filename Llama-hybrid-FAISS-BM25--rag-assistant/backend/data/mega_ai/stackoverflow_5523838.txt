Sharing authentication across Catalyst apps

I have a three applications that I would like to keep separate for manageability purposes. They run as a Plack server as suggested here , proxied behind nginx. I would like to have a separate application to manage logins, and have that login and its authentication process shared across all other apps, with authorization done via roles. I would like to use Catalyst::Authentication::Store::DBIx::Class for storage. I have tried managing authentication at the Plack level with Catalyst::Authentication::Credential::Remote doing it at the Catalyst level (which would be ideal), but can't seem to make the login seen by the Catalyst apps. Thanks for your help.
