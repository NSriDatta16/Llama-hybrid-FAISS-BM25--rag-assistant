After having read a lot more papers and having talked to many people about machine learning topics, this is how I would define the words: A class as an abstract concept which exists. Each class has properties and can have a lot of different labels. For example, the class cat has the properties "feet" (with the value 4), the property "Genus" with the value "Felis". There are many way members of the class can look like. Also many labels: cat, Katze, Felis silvestris, , . A label is just a sticker you put on the concept. A name. We need a word to be able to talk about the concept. I use labeling for the manual process of defining which parts of the dataset belong to which class. And I use classification for the process of the automatic classifier deciding which part of the data belongs to which class. So typically, labeling is done by a human and proceeds classification which is done by the machine.
