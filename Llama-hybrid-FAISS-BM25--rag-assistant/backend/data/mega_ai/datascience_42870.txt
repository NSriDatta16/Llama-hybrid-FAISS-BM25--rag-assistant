Getting negative r2_score with new set of dimensions

I am trying to predict flight take off delay using my current dataset. At this point of time, I only have four dimensions. scheduled_time_departure (A) , flight_id , day_of_week actual_time_departure(B) , take_off_delay(B-A) when I try to predict actual_time_departure(B) using scikit linear regression model using ( scheduled_time_departure (A) , flight_id , day_of_week ) on x-axis, I am getting good r2_score However when I am trying to predict take_off_delay (which is actually difference between actual_time_departure and scheduled_time_departure ), in that case I am getting negative r2_score . Note: to convert string to integer I am using LabelEncoder . scheduled_time_departure and actual_time_departure are in seconds not a timestamp, that is second of day, 86400 is max value it can have. I even tried doing normalization of scheduled_time_departure I have ensured that take_off_delay is always positive. For the case when I was predicting actual_time_departure , I tried using one hot encoder but that agravated r2_score P.S: I am new to machine learning and data science, let me know if I am making dumb mistake :) P.P.S: I understand model can be worst if r2 score is negative, however I want to understand the reason.
