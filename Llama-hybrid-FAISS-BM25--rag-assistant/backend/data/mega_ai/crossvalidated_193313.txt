How to best model interaction effect of two continuous predictor variables?

Consider the following problem: In a logistic regression model, we believe that two continuous predictor variables $X_1$ and $X_2$ impact the probability of event. It is hypothesized that the effect of $X_2$ on event depends on the value of $X_1$. More specifically, as level of $X_1$ increases, the effect of an unit increase in $X_2$ (at some fixed reference level of $X_2$) on log event odd first increases then plateaus out. How may we model such interaction effect? I have considered the following three approaches, but none seem satisfactory. What would you suggest? Any comments on the three approaches would be welcomed in the comment section as well! Include the interaction term $X_1\cdot X_2$ in the model. However, I have trouble getting meaningful interpretation of its parameter estimate. Discretize $X_1$ into three indicator variables, $X_{1l}$, $X_{1m}$ and $X_{1h}$. $X_{1l}$ is the indicator for $X_1$ falling into its lowest 33-rd percentile. Include $X_{1l} \cdot spline{X_2}_1$, $X_{1m} \cdot spline{X_2}_2$ and $X_{1h} \cdot spline{X_2}_3$ where $spline{X_2}_i$ is natural cubic spline effect on $X_2$ for each $i$. -- The parameter for this model seems easier to interpret, however, the decision to split into 3-tiles seem arbitrary. (A variation on 2) Split the modeling population into three pieces - the first one containing $X_1$ with lowest 33-tile values, second one the middle 33-tile, and the third one the highest 33-tile values. Fit a model on each of the segments using a cubic spline effect on $X_2$ together with the other predictor variables.
