TouchesBegan only in specific UIView

I have three UIView instances: UIView *view1; UIView *view2; UIView *view3; -(void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch =[touches anyObject]; CGPoint startPoint =[touch locationInView:self.view]; } But i want that the toch-action only go in view2. It doesnt work if i make: locationInView:view2 -(void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch =[touches anyObject]; CGPoint startPoint =[touch locationInView:view2]; } What do I wrong? How can i check, which view is the view i actually can see on my iphone?
