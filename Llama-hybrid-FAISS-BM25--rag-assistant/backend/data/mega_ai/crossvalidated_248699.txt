Suppose we have a population of $N$ Bernoulli trials, but $N$ is unknown. Suppose $α ∈ [0, 1]$ (.01 in the example) is known and we draw a simple random sample of size $αN$ (unknown). We observe $X$ successes (known) in the $αN$ trials. We want to estimate $K$, the number of successes among the $N$ trials in the population. Since the sampling is without replacement, $X$ follows a hypergeometric distribution with population size $N$, sample size $αN$, and number of successes $K$. You could estimate $K$ in a Bayesian fashion, putting priors on $N$ and $K$, or you could find the maximum likelihood estimate of $K$ (which will probably be $X/α$, as you'd expect). Of course, there's no way to compute the error between the estimate and the true value without knowing the true value. You could get a sense of the uncertainity in the estimate using a credible interval (in the Bayesian case) or a bootstrapped confidence interval (in the MLE case).
