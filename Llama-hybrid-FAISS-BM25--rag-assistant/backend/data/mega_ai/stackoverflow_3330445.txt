It's certainly possible to overwrite a file so that the previous content cannot be recovered. But this has to be done by the drive itself to make sure the correct block is overwritten... C# interacts with the filesystem, not physical blocks, so won't provide any security. The actual way to ask a drive to securely erase something varies with interface (ATAPI vs SATA, vs USB mass-storage vs SCSI vs firewire), and C# doesn't provide a simple way of commanding at this level.
