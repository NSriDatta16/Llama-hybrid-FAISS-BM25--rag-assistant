Dealing with seasonality when doing dimensionality reduction

I want to perform dimensionality reduction (in particular, PCA) on a data set that is highly seasonal. One approach that I came across when researching this is "seasonal PCA", where you split your data set into seasons, and then run PCA on each season separately. This seems like it wastes a lot of data. Are there other approaches for dealing with seasonal variations when doing PCA, or is there perhaps another dimensionality reduction approach that's more appropriate?
