How do I retrieve a list or number of jobs from a printer queue?

I'm looking for a way to get a list or number of jobs from a particular printer. In the best case I would want to have a "Job object" that represents one print job and its name in the print queue. This is required because I need to monitor the state of a printer so I can refill the print queue with a new batch of documents without overflowing the print spooler Thanks in advance! Edit: added code fragment of solution private int GetNumberOfPrintJobs() { LocalPrintServer server = new LocalPrintServer(); PrintQueueCollection queueCollection = server.GetPrintQueues(); PrintQueue printQueue = null; foreach (PrintQueue pq in queueCollection) { if (pq.FullName == PrinterName) printQueue = pq; } int numberOfJobs = 0; if (printQueue != null) numberOfJobs = printQueue.NumberOfJobs; return numberOfJobs; }
