How to go about with real GUI development with Java Swing and MVC

I am creating a Blackjack Card game emulator. I am a SCJP,familiar with Core Java concepts. I have a very basic understanding of Java swings and awt. Already finished writing the basic game logic,a CLI logic. My design includes several classes like, Dealer,Player,Table,Card,Casino and some others.. Enums for Cards and suite. I have read about MVC as a theoretical concept, familiar with the name 'design patters'(no understanding whatsoever as to how they are implemented) Everywhere I am suggested to learn while writing some real code.So I started off with this... I am stuck now, how should I go about writing code for my project?? Writing the GUI code and organising it within the already existent code.
