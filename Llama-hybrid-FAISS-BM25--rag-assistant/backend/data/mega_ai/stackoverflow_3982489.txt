Selenium, Nunit Best Practices?

I would like to learn more about how to use Selenium IDE and RC for creating good automation tests. Is there anybody who is interested in sharing info. or discussing this? Especially for things like: 1) What's a good way to organize the UI tests? Right now I am executing these tests thru NUnit and that executes the tests in the order of their alphabetical names. Is there a better way. (I am writing the selenium scripts in C# and not java) 2) How are the results logged? 3) Modularizing the Selenium RC tests? I am having a problem here. Since I am executing my tests thru NUnit, the only way I could figure was to give IDs to the tests so that they get run in the right order. Also I am having to write all my tests one after the other in the textfixture class. Again is there a better way? I tried creating additional files but when I create tests there and select them to run in NUnit, it looks like the selenium server doesn't even get started. 4) What are the best practices for automation testing? Any pointers to any sites/books/ etc.? These might seem very simple things but I've spent weeks trying to come up with better ways, so if somebody is willing to offer suggestions or input I'll really appreciate it! Thanks!
