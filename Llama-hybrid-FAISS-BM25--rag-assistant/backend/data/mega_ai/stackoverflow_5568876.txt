It's not really the italicisation that's causing the problem; it's just that your UILabel isn't wide enough. Make sure it has enough width to accomodate the text you want. So either resize the UILabel in interface builder to be wider (by dragging one of the right hand corner), or if you're making the UILabel in code, give it a wider frame. Italics just happen to reveal the fact that your UILabel isn't very wide and you were just about "getting away with it" before.
