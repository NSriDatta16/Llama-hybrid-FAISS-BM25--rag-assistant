Interpreting the Intrinsic Scatter (dispersion)

I have some data with uncertainties on both the independent and the dependent parameter. I did a Hierarchical Bayesian Model to study whether there is a correlation between the dependent and the independent parameters. The result of the MCMC is: $$ y = (0.13 \pm 0.03) + (-0.18 \pm 0.6)x + \epsilon $$ where $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$ is the intrinsic scatter. From MCMC, I estimated $\sigma = 0.05 \pm 0.02$. I need help to interpret the intrinsic scatter and hence the correlation. My interpretation The slope of the line, taking into consideration the uncertainties, is nearly ZERO. Thus I can say that there is no correlation. Looking at the intrinsic scatter, the value on average is not small (but not big too, right?). So the data points do deviate a bit from the best fit line. Is this the way to interpret my results? Here's a graph of my data point. The red dotted line is the best fit line whereas the light red lines are samples from my MCMC chain.
