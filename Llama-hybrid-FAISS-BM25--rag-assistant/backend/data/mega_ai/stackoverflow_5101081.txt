How do I save and reload MySQL Query Cache to Keep Site Running at Peak Speed

I am running a Magento e-commerce installation (which runs on PHP/MySQL) on a testing server. I have a fairly large (from what I've read) query_cache_size of 272,629,760 bytes and it works great. The site runs lightning fast once most of the queries are loaded into the query cache, as fast as the fastest production sites (other than perhaps Google.com or Amazon.com). But the problem I have is that in order to load all of those queries into the query cache I have to manually click through 100's of links on the site. Every time you click a link, a query is sent to the database and saved in the cache. But if I restart the server, then I have to do that all over again. There must be a better way! Ideally, I think there should just be a way to "backup" the query cache before restart and load it upon restart. Is this possible? Otherwise, i'm just going to have to design a web crawler that automatically clicks all my links.
