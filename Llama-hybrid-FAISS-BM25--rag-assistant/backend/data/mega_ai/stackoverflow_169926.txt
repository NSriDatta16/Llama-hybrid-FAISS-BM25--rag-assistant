It is not clear from your question whether you are a programmer or not, so I'm not sure whether you are after tools in the sense of apps or services that to what you want, or a library that makes site-mining easier. If the latter is the case and you use ruby, I can thoroughly recommend WWW::Mechanize . It provides a nice API for writing scripts to search web pages (by DOM or by text), follow links, and fill out forms. I've used it several times to organise information that's spread over several web pages within a site. I believe the ruby version was based on an earlier library for perl but I can't vouch for the perl version it I've not used it.
