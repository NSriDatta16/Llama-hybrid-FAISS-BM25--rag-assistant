Considering the client (user's browser) can send you whatever it wants, I would say there is no way to be sure which website your script is called from : As you want to know the URL of the website embedding your widget, and not the address of the user, $_SERVER['REMOTE_HOST'] will not help $_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER'] could seem OK, but actually is not : The client doesn't have to send it (and it doesn't always do) As it is sent by the client, it can be forged / faked Quite easily So, I'd say there is no real solution to this problem, at least on your server's side (If I'm wrong, I'm interested to know !) But maybe you can do something on the client's side : when writing all this, I thought about google maps, and it's system of API Key : you have an (unique) API key four your domain When you load the JS scripts from google, your send this key if the key is not registered for the domain on which you are trying to display the map, there is an alert message, saying " The Google Maps API server rejected your request. This could be because the API key used on this site was registered for a different web site. " but the map seems to be displayed anyway -- at least on my test server this alert is really anoying for the end-user , and I don't think anyone would want an alert displayed on their site because they are using your service withot authorisation... Maybe you can have a look at how this is done for google maps :-)
