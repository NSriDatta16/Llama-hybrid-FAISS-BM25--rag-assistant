Where does the binary logistic regression model equation come from?

In Frank Harrell's Regression Modeling Strategies, he states: The ordinary linear regression model is: $$C(Y|X)=E(Y|X)=X\beta$$ and given $X$ , $Y$ has a normal distribution with mean $X\beta$ and constant variance $\sigma^2$ . The binary logistic regression model is: $$C(Y|X)=\textrm{Prob}(Y=1|x)=(1+\exp(-X\beta))^{-1}$$ How is this formula $(1+\exp(-X\beta))^{-1}$ derived? I have tried looking at his cited sources but it is still not clear to me. How do we go from $C(Y|X)=E(Y|X)=X\beta$ to $\textrm{Prob}(Y =1|X)=(1+\exp(-X\beta))^{-1}$ ?
