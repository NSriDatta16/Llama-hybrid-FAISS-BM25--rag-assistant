How to test relationship between a continuous independent variable and a categorical dependent variable?

I have a quite common issue. I would like to test whether the waiting time at a restaurant is related to customer satisfaction ratings. The independent variable is continuous: waiting time. The dependent variable is categorical: customer satisfaction ratings of Happy, Unhappy, Not answered. Can I use one-way ANOVA? There will be 3 groups (Happy, Unhappy, Not answered) and each group has customers' waiting times. However, in this case, it sounds like the independent variable is the categorical one (ratings) and the dependent variable is continuous (waiting time). Does ANOVA care which is independent, which is dependent? Or, can I use multinomial logistic regression? Then how do I tell if there indeed exists a relationship between the waiting time and the target (ratings)? Check whether there's a positive coefficient? Your advice is highly appreciated!
