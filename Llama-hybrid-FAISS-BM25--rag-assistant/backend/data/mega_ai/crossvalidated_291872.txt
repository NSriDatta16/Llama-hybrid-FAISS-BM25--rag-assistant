This is analogous to "why use linear regression if ridge regression is available" - if your primary goal is predictive accuracy, you wouldn't. Since SVMs are only used for predictive modeling, I don't think there is much real world use for hard margin. The soft margin problem includes the hard margin as a special case, so if you're doing everything properly, your hyperparameter tuning of the soft margin will find the hard margin solution if that maximizes the predictive power of the model. That said, hard margin SVMs are useful to understand as a stepping stone to the soft margin case. So there is pedagogical and mental mapping use for them.
