I think that you do not need to compress more this files, other than gZip. Of course you need here to be sour that your js files on webresource are not the debug versions. If you try to change the location of this files, eg try to place them on the end, then maybe you get javascript errors because this functions are probably needed to be found by asp.net controls I only suggest to add some cache on the client side . You can do that on Application Begin Request - something like: protected void Application_BeginRequest(Object sender, EventArgs e) { // get the file name string cTheFile = HttpContext.Current.Request.Path; // here just see if this is the files that you wish to add some extra cache if (cTheFile.EndsWith("WebResource.axd", StringComparison.InvariantCultureIgnoreCase)) { // add some cache - what ever you think, or add an eTag app.Response.Cache.SetExpires(DateTime.UtcNow.AddHours(4)); app.Response.Cache.SetMaxAge(new TimeSpan(4, 0, 0)); app.Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.Public); } }
