Any one know why changes made to a .aspx page in the designer are not saved by visual studio 2008?

im developing an asp.net website application but suddenly all changes i make to the page in the visual studio designer are not being saved for some reason. Every thing i do in the code behind file is saved with out any problem, also if i edit the .aspx file but in sourceview, the changes are saved, but if i drag a control from the toolbox onto the page designer and set some properties and then save, nothing will have been saved when i close and re-open the page, all changes are lost. Its confusing and i have no idea why. Edit: also this happens on only one aspx file. All the other files edits are saved. Edit: I have tried the hotfix here with no luck http://blogs.msdn.com/b/webdevtools/archive/2009/03/23/hotfix-for-design-view-does-not-update-html-and-to-designer-inserts-a-lot-of-nbsp.aspx
