Perl format() issue - Empty lines between paragraphs get stripped and cannot be displayed

I'm using Perl's format and write functions to output some text. The requirements are below: Print an article (length unknown) using Perl format . Maximum 80 characters per line. Last word should be wrapped to the next line if there is not enough space. Empty lines between paragraphs need to be retained. The problem I'm having now is any blank lines between paragraphs cannot be displayed. I checked, and this seems to be caused by the use of " ~~ ". The format is defined as below. format FULL_TEXT = Full Story: ^ Is there a way to print this empty line between paragraphs while still meeting other requirements? For example, below is what I expect. However, as I said before, the empty line between the two paragraphs is stripped and cannot be displayed. COLLINGWOOD unfurled its 2010 premiership flag at the MCG last night and marked the occasion as protocol demanded, by lowering the colours of its longeststanding rival, Carlton in a contest that was epic in style, if not consequence. The crowd was 88,181, a record for home-and-away contests between these clubs. An old feeling stirring in the AFL.
