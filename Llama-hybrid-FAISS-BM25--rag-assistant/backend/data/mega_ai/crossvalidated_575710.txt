Once you center IV's (independent variables) the interpretation of a model is different. Particularly, if the data is centered with its average, then all the data is shifted by its average (subtracted by the average of the data) and the interpretation of any coefficients of the variables that were centered given by say a regression model, is interpreted to be the average of whatever it is the data is about, and this change in interpretation is also reflected in the interaction terms.
