Getting $_POST variable from table

I'm trying to build a sort of resource allocation form. I'd like to be able to print a table from a database, and then allow users to click on each cell that they would like to reserve. Also, being able to drag and select multiple cells. Then send all of this via $_POST to another php script. Problem is, I have no idea where to start. Any suggestions?
