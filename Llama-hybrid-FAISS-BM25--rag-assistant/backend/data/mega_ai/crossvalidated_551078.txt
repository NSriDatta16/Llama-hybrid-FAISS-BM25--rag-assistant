How could I train one model which forecast multiple groups? (Time Series Problem)

Firstly, I would like to apologize if if this is question has been discuss. I am pretty new to TS Forecasting. I have a question about how to approach time series problem. I have a data set that has columns for date, store identifier, employee identifier, number of employees, sales, hours worked, holidays, etc. My main question is how to transform the dataset to forecast sales per employee for the following month using the information of more dimensions besides sales. to be more specific in order to make this question more answerable. let's say I have a dataset with this shape date employee_id worked hrs holiday hrs ... sales 2020-01-01 1 160 0 ... 10000 2020-01-01 2 148 12 ... 8000 2020-01-01 3 60 100 ... 15000 2020-02-01 1 178 0 ... 9500 2020-02-01 2 165 5 ... 1000 2020-02-01 3 180 0 ... 30000 2020-03-01 1 140 20 ... 11000 ... ... ... ... ... ... My goal will be to create a model to forecast the number of sales for each employee for next month, so if my train set last until June, my goal will be to forecast July sales and feed my model with new data the next month and so on. The thing is that, for all documentation and kernels I have found, the forecasting was done either grouping all sales together or creating N models per employee (being N the number of employees) How could I, if possible, just train ONE model which forecast the next month sales per employee? In addition I would also like to try different models, from Logistic Regression, SArima, prophet to random forest Xboost etc. I understand that I will have to do different transformations for the different models. For example I don't think I can use the rest of the dimensions in sarima or Prophet, but I'm not sure either. Moreover, I would like to cover the basics before get into Deep Learning frameworks I am very sorry if this is question has been discuss Any help or documentation is appreciate
