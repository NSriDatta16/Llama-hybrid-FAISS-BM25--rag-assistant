When would time series not work?

In my understanding, a time series model is a way to predict the observation. For example, having a time series data points, one possible way to model is using AR model which is $y_{t}$ by $y_{t}= a_{1}x_{t}+a_{2}x_{t-2}+a_{3}x_{t-3}+...+\epsilon_{t} $. There are many applications in real life using time series series model. For example, it seems when people are talking about prediction in finance, it is usually refers to time seres model. However, I wonder why would the time series model would work? It seems really strong assumption on betting the future observation would be a combination of the disturbance, weighted by the coefficients $a_i$. I know that there would be assumptions like stationarity and homoscedasticity (although heteroscedasticity would still keep it unbiased) to ensure the unbiased estimation for the coefficients. However, I guess my problem is at bigger level of asking under what situations the time series model can capture the essence of the target it tries to model.
