Fixed Effects, Random Effects, Pooled OLS: Hausman and Breusch-Pagan Lagrange multiplier (LM) tests

I have encountered that whenever deciding upon the model for panel data, it is suggested to perform the Hausman test first and the Breusch-Pagan Lagrange multiplier (LM) test should be performed only if the Random Effect model is suggested by Hausman Test. Could anyone elaborate on why performing BP test is only relevant if the Hausman test suggests RE model and is useless otherwise?
