I think they are global to all requests made with that specific thread only. Other threads get other copies of the thread-local data. This is the key point of thread-local storage: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread-local_storage#Java . Unless you check the appropriate option in the servlets config, the servlet container will use your servlet with multiple threads to handle requests in parallel. So effectively you would have separate data for each thread that's up serving clients. If your WebApplication isn't distributed (runs on multiple Java Virtual Machines), you can use the ServletContext object to store shared data across requests and threads (be sure to do proper locking then).
