How to find out the interval within which probability of sample mean lying within $\pm a$ units of population mean is $0.95$ using Python?

I am a beginner in the field of statistics and data science, so request you to treat me kindly. I have to solve the following problem in python: Suppose the population variable $X$ is $\text{N}(3, 0.3)$ and $n = 20$ . How large an interval must be chosen so that the probability is $0.95$ that the sample mean $\overline{X}$ lies within $\pm a$ units of the population mean $\mu$ ? I know 68% data lies within 1 standard deviation ie 2.7 to 3.3. 95% data lie within 2 standard deviations ie 2.4 to 3.6. My code: from scipy.stats import norm a,b = norm.interval(alpha=0.95, loc=3, scale=0.3) print(b-a) Output: 1.1759783907240324 But the answer (b-a) is incorrect as its not matching the predefined answer of the hidden test case. On printing a,b values I got: $$a = 2.412010804637984$$ $$b = 3.587989195362016$$ May be I did not get the question correctly or I am not computing in a proper way. #Attempt 2 from math import sqrt u=3+(1.96*(0.3/(sqrt(20)))) l=3-(1.96*(0.3/(sqrt(20)))) u-l # 0.2629615941539756 #Attempt 3 from math import sqrt u=3+(1.645*(0.3/(sqrt(20)))) l=3-(1.645*(0.3/(sqrt(20)))) u-l # 0.22069990937922945 Attempt 4 Assuming the question wants half width of the interval, I divided the answer by 2 but its still showing incorrect... from math import sqrt u=3+(1.96*(0.3/(sqrt(20)))) l=3-(1.96*(0.3/(sqrt(20)))) (u-l)/2 # 0.1314 Attempt 5 from math import sqrt u=3+(1.645*(0.3/(sqrt(20)))) l=3-(1.645*(0.3/(sqrt(20)))) (u-l)/2 # 0.11 Answers not matching hidden test case Kindly suggest me what to do.
