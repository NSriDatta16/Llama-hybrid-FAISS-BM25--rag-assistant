Where to declare class constants?

I'm using class members to hold constants. E.g.: function Foo() { } Foo.CONSTANT1 = 1; Foo.CONSTANT2 = 2; This works fine, except that it seems a bit unorganized, with all the code that is specific to Foo laying around in global scope. So I thought about moving the constant declaration to inside the Foo() declaration, but then wouldn't that code execute everytime Foo is constructed? I'm coming from Java where everything is enclosed in a class body, so I'm thinking JavaScript might have something similar to that or some work around that mimics it.
