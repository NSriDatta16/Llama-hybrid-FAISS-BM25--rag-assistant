From this article on The Verge : [an infrared sensor] throws 30,000 infrared dots on your face. The systems reads the map, matches it against the stored image on the phone using a built-in neural network processor, and unlocks the phone. So it is a neural network of some kind, if this reviewer can be trusted. Based on the image recognition literature, I would assume it's even a deep neural network. Unfortunately, as the comments say, we will likely never know exactly the model due to trade secrets.
