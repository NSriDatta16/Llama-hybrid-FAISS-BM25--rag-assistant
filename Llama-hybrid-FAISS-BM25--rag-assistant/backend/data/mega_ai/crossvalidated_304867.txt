If you just modeled $Y$ directly that is called a linear probability model --if you believe that covariates affect the probability in a linear way, that wouldn't be a ridiculous thing to do (despite Peter Flom's blanket statement that "regression on Y when Y is dichotomous doesn't work right"; also, just so you don't misunderstand---the model $\beta_0 + \beta_1 X$ is for the expected value of Y , which is a probability, so prior comments about $Y$ not being allowed to take on values other than 0/1 are irrelevant). You could fit a linear probability model using least squares (although be careful with the p-values) or using the binomial likelihood directly, although numerical problems can arise from non-finite likelihoods, which you can usually handle with good starting values (and is less of a problem when you have a good sample size). People usually use logistic regression for this situation, modeling the probability on the log odds scale, because of the numerical stability and the convenient interpretation of the coefficients as log odds ratios.
