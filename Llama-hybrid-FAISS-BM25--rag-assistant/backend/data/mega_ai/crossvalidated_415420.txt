Understanding equation used by Hastie et al

I am trying to recreate FIGURE 3.6 from Elements of Statistical Learning. The only information about the figure is included in the caption. I am not clear on what the equation on the Y-axis means precisely. My understanding is that $\beta$ is a vector of length 31 with first 10 elements iid as $N(0,0.4)$ and the other 21 elements being 0. Then $\hat{\beta}(k)$ represents the coefficient estimates at step k in the stepwise regression. For example, in forward stepwise, after the first coefficient is added we would have $\hat{\beta}(k=1)$ which would be a vector of length 31 with the first element being the first coefficient estimate and the remaining 30 elements being 0. Then, sequentially, the remaining 30 coefficients would be estimated, updating this vector for each new coefficient. At each step $k$ we would calculate $\mathrm{E}||\hat{\beta}(k) - \beta||^2$ by calculating $||\hat{\beta}(k) - \beta||^2$ and averaging across the 50 repetitions. What is the correct interpretation for this equation in this context?
