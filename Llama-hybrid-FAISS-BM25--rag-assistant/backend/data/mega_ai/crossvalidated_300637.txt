Modeling influence of social impact with linear regression

Is it right to use linear regression to make a forecast based on social media impact? Suppose you have the next dataset (events), where time delta is amount of minutes passed from the previous event: +-----------------------------------------+ |event time current # of related | | id delta price Google's articles| +-----------------------------------------+ | 1 1 50.60 110 | | 2 15 50.71 120 | | 3 38 50.85 120 | | ... ... ... ... | | 100 4 80.70 120 | | 101 8 80.71 120 | | ... ... ... ... | | 203 61 90.01 142 | I'm confused about two things that make me hesitate about applicability of linear regression here: Social media ( # of related articles ) influence current price , but not immediately. The delay might be from few hours up to few days/weeks. That means that # of related articles is always outdated to current price . All I figure out - is to calculate average delay of social media impact and shift current price data relative to # of related articles . Is there any better solutions? current price is updating much frequently than social media impact ( # of related articles ). I.e. in data example below you see that price growth from 50.60 up to 80.71 thanks for increase of # of related articles from 110 to 120 . But from event id 2 up to event id 203 # of related articles remains the same. Is linear regression able calculate correct coefficients based on this data? Any tricks?
