How does a bayesian interpret a null association?

After reading about the bayesian approach, I'm wondering how they would interpret a null finding from a regression coefficient. I ask because in a frequentist approach, if the p .05 you'd say that it wasn't. For example, you could imagine someone using frequentist statistics saying something like (where b is a regression coefficient): participant height was associated with participant weight, b=.30, p Now in the bayesian context, it seems like there's no easy way to describe associations. Maybe, if using something like a credible interval to describe the posterior distribution for a regression parameter, you could say that associations with a 95% credible interval excluding zero are strong associations but that associations with 95% credible intervals including zero are weak ones? I guess my question is how does a bayesian describe their result when they get a situation like this from the frequentist context: participant height was not associated with participant shoe size, b=.05, p=.40.
