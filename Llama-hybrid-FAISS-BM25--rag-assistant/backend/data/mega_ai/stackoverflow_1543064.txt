What exactly is this ClassLite ? Why does your Class inherit from ClassLite ? Is there really an 'IS-A' relationship here ? What is the reason of existence for ClassLite ? Is it a class which you use when, for instance, you have to display an overview of 'Class' instances ? Then, if this is the case, you should have a look at DTO's or 'Views', Projections and the AliasToBeanEntityResultTransformer.
