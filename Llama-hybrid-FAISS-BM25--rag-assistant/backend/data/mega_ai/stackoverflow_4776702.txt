Why is this HTTP header not printed?

I have the following code: Net::Pcap::loop($pcap, -1, \&proccess_packets, ''); sub proccess_packets { my ($user_data, $header, $packet) = @_; my $ip_packet = NetPacket::Ethernet::strip($packet); my $tcp_packet = NetPacket::IP::strip($ip_packet); my $tcp_obj = NetPacket::TCP->decode($tcp_packet); if ($tcp_obj->{data}) { my $request = HTTP::Request->parse($tcp_obj->{data}); my %headers = split /[:\n]/, $request->headers_as_string; print Dumper($headers{'Accept-Language'}); # this line is printed print $headers{'Accept-Language'}; # this line is not printed } } Could someone have any explanation why this line is printed: print Dumper($headers{'Accept-Language'}); and why this is not printed: print $headers{'Accept-Language'}; What could be the problem here? Could someone give an advice? Is it related to the callback mechanism of libpcap?
