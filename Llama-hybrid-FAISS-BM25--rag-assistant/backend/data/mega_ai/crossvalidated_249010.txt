What is the relationship between classification and regression in Neural Network?

In general, neural networks are trained to as classifier to make classifications. But, in supervised machine learning, we usually need to make regression or make predictions, such as predict tomorrow's stock index or temperature. So, my question are what is the relationship between classification and regression in Neural Network? And how can I train a neural network to train a regression model to make predictions?
