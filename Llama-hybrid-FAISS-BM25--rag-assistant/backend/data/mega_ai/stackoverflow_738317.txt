You could combine S.Lott's answer about using pickle (you should use cPickle though for better performance) with SqlLite. sqlite is built into python 2.5 and up, so all you'll need to do is import :), then just store the pickled objects as strings in there and you'll have a nice fast method of accessing the data (compared to building your own method) that will help keep you organized as well. note: cPickle is almost identical to pickle in use. Only difference is that it is written in C Useful Python Docs: sqlite3 module pickle module edit : It may be a good idea to have a user controlled memory usage limit. It would be a shame to be storing a bunch a data on disk and waiting on slow-ass disk I/O when the user has 8GB of RAM ;)
