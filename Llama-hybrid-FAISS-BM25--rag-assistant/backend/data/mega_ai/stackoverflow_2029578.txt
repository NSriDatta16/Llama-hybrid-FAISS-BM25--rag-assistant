This question could lead to enough content to fill a book. In general, I would not recommend adding unit tests to your classes for concurrent scenarios. With practice I think you'll learn that automated unit tests have one or several "sweet spots" -- and that focusing your efforts in these areas (and using other practices in other areas) yields better ROI. But your class seems to be about concurrency (can't tell for certain based on info provided), and therefore this could be a case where you really want a concurrency-simulating test. You can (as far as I know) start up multiple threads in a unit test if you wish. But there may be a simpler way. Consider leveraging the Compose Method pattern. While we're on the subject -- this pattern is pretty critical to effective unit tests over all, not just with concurrency.
