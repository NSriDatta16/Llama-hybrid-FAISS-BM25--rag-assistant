How to get the standard deviation when summing down a category with multiple independent observations?

I am not sure how to handle calculating the standard deviation in my situation. Four researchers (i.e., R1, R2, R3, and R4) are taking independent measurements of the same variableâ€”the time that a subjects talks in a conversation. Let's say there are 6 subjects. Each subject can be grouped into one of 2 roles: A or B. The subjects are having a back-and-forth conversation, such that the measurements take the following form: Subject Speaking Role R1 Measurement (seconds) R2 (seconds) R3 (seconds) R4 (seconds) 1 A 12 13 12 14 3 B 56 52 51 55 5 B 30 33 32 34 2 B 27 24 28 27 1 A 167 164 152 165 6 A 13 17 17 18 3 B 83 78 82 85 4 A 63 68 61 52 1 A 26 18 26 38 If I want to get the average across researcher measurements for the amount of time that people from role A and B were speaking, what is the most appropriate way to get the standard deviation: Option 1) Should I sum down each researcher's measurements within each role and then take the mean and standard deviation across researchers to get something like this: Role R1 (s) R2 (s) R3 (s) R4 (s) Mean (s) Stdev (s) A 281 280 268 287 279 7.95 B 196 187 193 201 194 5.85 Option 2) Or, should I get the variance across researchers for each time a subject speaks and then sum down each role, like follows: Subject Role R1 (s) R2 (s) R3 (s) R4 (s) Mean (s) Variance 1 A 12 13 12 14 12.75 0.92 3 B 56 52 51 55 53.5 5.67 5 B 30 33 32 34 32.25 2.91 2 B 27 24 28 27 26.5 3 1 A 167 164 152 165 162 46 6 A 13 17 17 18 16.25 4.91 3 B 83 78 82 85 82 8.67 4 A 63 68 61 52 61 44.67 1 A 26 18 26 38 27 68 Role Mean (s) Stdev (s) A 279 4.99 B 194 2.96 Additionally, does anything change if one of the researchers misses a measurement and the sample sizes are different?
