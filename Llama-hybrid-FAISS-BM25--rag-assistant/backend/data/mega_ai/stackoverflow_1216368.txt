Problem with TreeView in SilverLight

I have the following class structure: class Organization { string Name; List users; List Children; } class User { string Name; } I cannot modify these classes. I need to display all the information about organizations and users in one TreeView control. I.e., organization nodes should contain suborganization and user nodes. The question is how can I do this having no CompositeCollections or Multibindings in Silverlight?
