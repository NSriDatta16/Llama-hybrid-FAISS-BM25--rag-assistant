Entity Framework 4 eager loading not working at all!

I am converting linq2sql to entity framework. During the conversion I needed to convert the loadwith of linq2sql with include for eagar loading, but the eager loading is not working. When I used the profiler, I found that the child entities are loaded with they are accessed. DataBaseEntities context = new V3C_DataBaseEntities(); context.Agents.Include("Account"); Agent ag = context.Agents.Where(x => x.Login_ID == "2").SingleOrDefault(); // here the account should have been loaded, // but actually they are loaded with the line below this is executed. Console.WriteLine(ag.Account.ID.ToString()); If do the following, It works perfectly, but I must do the way mentioned in the question. var c = (from ag in context.Agents.Include("Account") where ag.Login_ID == "2" select ag).SingleOrDefault(); I would also like a type safe way of loading child entities.
