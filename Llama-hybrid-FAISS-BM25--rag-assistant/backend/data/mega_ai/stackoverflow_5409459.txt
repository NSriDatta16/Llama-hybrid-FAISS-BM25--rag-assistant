Why does xalan not throw a TransformException error with malformed XML

In my unit tests I am trying to throw a TransformException error by sending some malformed xml to the org.apache.xalan.processor.TransformerFactoryImpl implementation of javax.xml.transform.Transformer calling transform(Source xmlSource,Result outputTarget) throws TransformerException The console shows the following message, but no TransformerException is thrown file:/filepath/MalformedInput.xml; Line #85; Column #16; XML document structures must start and end within the same entity. Any ideas as to why it doesn't throw a TransformerException or how I can raise an Exception for this situation? I have tried with saxon and a TransformerException is thrown, but i would prefer to use xalan thanks
