If your issue is with the use of a conditioning symbol "|" instead of a semi-colon or an index in the notation of a family of distributions $$\text{Pr}(x|\theta)\qquad\text{vs.}\qquad \text{Pr}(x;\theta) \qquad \text{vs.}\qquad\text{Pr}_\theta(x)$$ a first answer is that it is a matter of notations and that once one has clearly set a notation for this family it can be used as such. (Notation-wise, using $\text{Pr(x)}$ for a distribution should be discouraged as it does not apply to continuous and mixed random variables.) The distribution (and the associated density) are dependent on the value of $\theta$ , meaning that two different $\theta$ 's [should] lead to two different densities. This function is thus defined conditional on the chosen value of $\theta$ and one could not use it without knowing this value of $\theta$ . A second answer is that a conditional distribution sets the conditioning variable to a fixed value. In a conditional density $f(x|y)$ the value $y$ is constant while $x$ varies on the state space $\mathcal{X}$ , e.g., $\mathbb{R}$ . The value of $y$ taken by the conditioning variable $Y$ thus determines the function [of $x$ ] and for all purposes acts like a parameter. There is thus no [pragmatic] distinction to be made between $y$ and a parameter $\theta$ when using this conditional density. Furthermore, if $\theta$ becomes random, as for instance in a Bayesian analysis, adopting the conditional sign on $\theta$ makes notations coherent [with a joint distribution on $x$ and $\theta$ ].
