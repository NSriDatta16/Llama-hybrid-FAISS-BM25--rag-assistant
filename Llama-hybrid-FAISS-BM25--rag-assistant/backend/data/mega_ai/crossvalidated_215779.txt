Removing intercept from GLM for multiple factorial predictors only works for first factor in model

I am running a binomial logistic regression with a logit link function in R. My response is factorial [0/1] and I have two multilevel factorial predictors - let's call them $a$ and $b$ where $a$ has 4 factor levels $(a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4)$ and $b$ has 9 factor levels $(b_1,b_2,\dotsc,b_9)$ . Therefore: mod The model output would then show all the information about the model as well as the coefficients. There is a factor level for both a and b missing (a1 and b1) from the summary output. I understand that it is constrained in the "intercept" of the model. I have read that if I want to remove the intercept term and see the estimates for those factor levels I can just add -1 to the model formula, i.e.: mod2 In the new model (mod2) the intercept term is then gone and variable a's factor-level a1 is given amongst the list of coefficients. But, variable b's factor-level b1 is still missing and given that there is no intercept term anymore, how can I interpret the odds-ratio for that factor level then? Could someone please explain to me how to get the coefficient for b1 too and why this is happening?
