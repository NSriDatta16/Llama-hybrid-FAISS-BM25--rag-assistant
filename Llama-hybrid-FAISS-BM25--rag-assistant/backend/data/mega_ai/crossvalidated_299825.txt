This shouldn't be a problem. Problems such as image-superresolution which use neural networks often involve the output size being much larger than the input size. Other examples are the decoder half of an encoder-decoder network and semantic segmentation, where the input is HxWx3 but the output is HxWxK and K can be much bigger than 3. There isn't any fundamental reason that having more outputs than inputs should cause problems with NNs.
