Which will go to heap and which to stack? And why? Everything there goes onto the heap. Why? Because the heap is for storage of data where the lifetime of the storage cannot be determined ahead of time . In your example the lifetime of everything - the numbers, the strings, the lists - cannot be known ahead of time, so they all have to go onto the heap so that the garbage collector can determine when that storage is dead. When will int i and DateTime dt be treated as Value type and will be put into stack? They will always be treated as value types because they are value types. That is, they will be copied by value and contain their own values . They will never be put onto the stack because the lifetimes of their storages cannot be known ahead of time. If I have an interface then where will be the objects be placed in this case ... stack or heap? The question doesn't make any sense. You've only got types , no objects . What objects are you talking about? But the answer is the same: the objects will be put on the stack if the lifetimes of their storages are known ahead of time; otherwise, they'll be put on the heap to be garbage collected.
