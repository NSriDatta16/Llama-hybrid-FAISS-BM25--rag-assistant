Display new arrivals by category in Magento

I would like to display the most recently added products from a specific category on my Magento store. I have studied the code at http://www.tridian.com/developer-blog/adding-new-arrivals-to-magento/ . From what I've found so far, this seems to be the best place to start. The problem is that it will grab the newest products from the entire catalog, whereas I want to limit the catalog scope to a specific category ID. I understand that I will need to change if($curr_category == 'new arrivals') to check for the specific category, and I suspect I will need to put a flag or condition within that if statement. Any help would be extremely appreciated!
