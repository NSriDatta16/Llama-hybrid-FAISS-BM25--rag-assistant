In your study of subjects deciding whether or not to believe 20 videos are factual, it seems easy to get a reasonable confidence interval. Roughly speaking, suppose you have $100$ subjects who viewed the $20$ videos, and that on average 25% of the videos are believable. Then you may have data similar to the 100 in the list x below (simulated using R). These are numbers of videos each of the subjects found believable. Notice that this sample has mean $\bar X = 5.07$ and standard deviation $S_x = 2.07.$ set.seed(1019) x = rbinom(100, 20, .25) summary(x); sd(x) Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. 1.00 3.00 5.00 5.07 6.00 10.00 [1] 2.070744 If you want the percentages of 20 videos each subject found believable, then you have 100 percentages $p$ with mean $\bar p = 0.2535$ and standard deviation $S_p = 0.1035,$ p = x/20 summary(p); sd(p) Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. 0.0500 0.1500 0.2500 0.2535 0.3000 0.5000 [1] 0.1035372 Then a standard 95% confidence interval for the percentage believable is of the form $\bar p \pm 1.96S_p/\sqrt{100},$ which computes to $(0.233, 0.274).$ The boundaries of this CI are safely within the interval $[0,1].$ mean(p) + c(-1,1)*1.96*sd(p)/10 [1] 0.2332067 0.2737933 If only 1 in 20 of the videos is believable then you might get a CI such as the one below, still with suitable endpoints. x = rbinom(100, 20, .05); p = x/20 mean(p) + c(-1,1)*1.96*sd(p)/10 [1] 0.03767976 0.05432024 If you want to share a specific computation along these lines that gives a result you find unsatisfactory, please edit it into your question and leave a comment. Note: If you had only 10 especially gullible or skeptical subjects, proportions may be very near 0 or 1, and the normal approximation involved in making the CIs above may be problematic. With such extreme results from only 10 subjects your results may not be reliable, but the method shown above still gives confidence limits between 0 and 1 in the two examples below. x = rbinom(10, 20, .01); p = x/20 mean(p) + c(-1,1)*1.96*sd(p)/10 [1] 0.001900968 0.008099032 x = rbinom(10, 20, .99); p = x/20 mean(p) + c(-1,1)*1.96*sd(p)/10 [1] 0.985868 0.994132
