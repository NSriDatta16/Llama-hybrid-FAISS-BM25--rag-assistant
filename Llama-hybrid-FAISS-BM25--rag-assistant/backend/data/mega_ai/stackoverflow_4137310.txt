There may already be a set of translations for you to download. Start by going to http://www.magentocommerce.com/translations , then click "Select" for your language, then click "Package". Unzip the download into your magento directory and it will place a whole lot of CSV files where they need to go. You can edit these yourself with any spreadsheet program. You might need to clear the cache after importing or adjusting these files.
