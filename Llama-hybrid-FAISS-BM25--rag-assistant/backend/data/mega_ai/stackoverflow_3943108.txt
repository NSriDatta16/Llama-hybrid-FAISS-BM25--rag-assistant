You are not updating the text in the RichTextField. It only gets added to the screen when there is no runtimestorage object associated with App2.RTSID_MY_APP. Your code needs to keep a handle on the RichTextField by putting it into a field of the App1 object. Then update the text in the run() method. I edited your code, adding braces to the if statement, which makes this more clear.
