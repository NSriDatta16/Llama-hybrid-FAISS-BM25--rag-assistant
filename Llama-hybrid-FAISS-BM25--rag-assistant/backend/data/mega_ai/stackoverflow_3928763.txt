As Mason said, FastMM4 is your friend here. You may want to give a look at this CodeRage 2 session: Fighting Memory Leaks for Dummies . It mainly shows how to use FastMM to prevent/detect memory leaks in Delphi. Was for D2007 but still relevant. As for why running twice does leak but not running once, from experience, it's mostly due to creating and storing an Object in a Field/Variable without checking first if it was assigned, leaking the previous reference. Construct like this: TSomething FMyObject: TMyObject; [..] TSomething.Destroy; begin FMyObject.Free; end; [...] //somewhere in code: FMyObject := TMyObject.Create; //leaks the previous FMyObject Obviously not as straightforward and probably hidden in some setters or through some kind of List/container... Here I'd guess adding to the VirtualTreeView without checking...
