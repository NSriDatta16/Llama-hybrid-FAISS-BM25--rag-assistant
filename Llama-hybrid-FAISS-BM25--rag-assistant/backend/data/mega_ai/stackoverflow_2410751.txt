For this assignment I would use pypacp , which is a python packet capture and injection library. Pypcap uses raw sockets to forge packets. If for some strange reason you are forced to use C then this project will be more difficult. In this case you should use libpcap to sniff the line and the raw socket library will depend on the platform you develop on. You can sniff the line looking for TCP sequence ID's. Based on this id you can forge a RST or FIN to break one side of the connection. The hard part will be trying to maintain the TCP connection using raw sockets. It will be nearly impossible to maintain the application layer connection, HTTP would be an easier protocol to maintain but if it was http it would be easier to just hijack the cookie.
