How do decision trees in random forests handle conflicts?

Let's say our input elements (training data) are 6 people with three attributes, Height, Weight, and Gender, and we are predicting if that person will have cancer or not (boolean 0 or 1). Let's say we want to create 2 decision trees in our random forest, each tree containing 3 people. Now let's analyze the 3 people in one of these trees. Person ID: 0 Height: 170cm Weight: 70kg Gender: Male Cancer?: Yes Person ID: 1 Height 150cm Weight: 55kg Gender: Female Cancer? No Person ID: 2 Height: 170cm Weight: 70kg Gender: Male Cancer?: No We have a conflict , because both Person 0 and Person 2 have the same attributes for Height, Weight, and Gender, but Person 0 has cancer, but Person 2 does not. How does the decision tree creation algorithm (within the context of random forests) handle this?
