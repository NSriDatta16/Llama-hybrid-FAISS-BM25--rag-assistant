Is it okay to make predictions without using all regressors?

Currently, I am looking at a time series model (linear regression) that has 5 independent variables. The owner of the model says only 3 regressors are fed with input and predictions are made using only those 3. The two that are left out are AR and MA terms. I wonder whether is it EVER okay to do that?
