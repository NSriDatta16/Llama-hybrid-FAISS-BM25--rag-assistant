This is a subject I've seen postings about before. I've been meaning to write an article about it and have finally done so. It is here: The Lie of Independence I encourage you to read it. The gist is simple, though. The question is wrong. It's not 'Do you use an application or framework with lots of dependencies, or one that doesn't have them?' It is: 'Do you use an application or framework that has lots of external dependencies, or one that tries to do it all internally?' And the question that follows is 'Do you really have faith that the person or people writing this framework understand every nuance of every tiny detail of every task that needs to be done to process a web request?'
