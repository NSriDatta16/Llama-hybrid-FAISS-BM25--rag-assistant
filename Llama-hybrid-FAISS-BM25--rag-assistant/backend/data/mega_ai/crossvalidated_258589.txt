HMM with some known inputs

I am trying to solve a problem using HMM where the observations Yt are the result of both known and hidden parameters, but unfortunately, I am not sure how to combine the known and hidden parameters for both training and evaluation of the HMM. I have looked at general Bayesian networks for a hint but am not finding what I need. I am wondering if there is a standard approach for doing this and if anyone could point me in the right general direction?
