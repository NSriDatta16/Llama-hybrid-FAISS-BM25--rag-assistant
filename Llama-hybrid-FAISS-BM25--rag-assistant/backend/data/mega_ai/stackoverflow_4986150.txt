I think it would be simpler to put one transparent div covering everything and then handling the drag of the video yourself using the mousedown/move/up handlers in the transparent div instead of doing all this trickery for the buttons. It is also much easier to maintain if the embedded div needs to be changed. Just be careful that IIRC Internet Explorer ignores events for a totally transparent div (!).
