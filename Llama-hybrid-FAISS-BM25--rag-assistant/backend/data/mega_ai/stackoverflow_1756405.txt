Here is a quick example. Program a drag operation in a fully declarative manner, using LINQ to events. //Create an observable with the initial position and dragged points using LINQ to Events var mouseDragPoints = from md in e.GetMouseDown() let startpos=md.EventArgs.GetPosition(e) from mm in e.GetMouseMove().Until(e.GetMouseUp()) select new { StartPos = startpos, CurrentPos = mm.EventArgs.GetPosition(e), }; And draw a line from startpos to current pos //Subscribe and draw a line from start position to current position mouseDragPoints.Subscribe (item => { //Draw a line from item.Startpos to item.CurrentPos } ); As you can see, there are no event handlers all over the places, nor boolean variables for managing the state. If you are curious about those GetEventName() methods, suggesting you to read this entire article and download the source code and play with it. Read it here and play with the source >>
