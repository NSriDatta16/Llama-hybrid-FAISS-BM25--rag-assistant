I would plan on it taking about 50% of the time and effort it took to create it in the first place. I have done EXACTLY what you are asking about for a commercial software product that consisted of roughly 500 kloc. We balanced the desire for refactoring with the desire to get something working and released as quickly as possible. It took nearly the entire team about 1 full year to get it done...for a product that took 4 years to create in the first place. It was a gigantic undertaking..not to be underestimated.
