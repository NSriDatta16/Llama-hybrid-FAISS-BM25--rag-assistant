Implement Google Maps-like image dragging functionality?

I have a graph with 1000+ nodes that is fairly sparse. I would like to create a visualization of this graph, and let users drag around it, the same way that users can drag the image of Google or Bing maps around. Is there any service/toolkit/technology that exists to allow me to do this easily? Javascript? Silverlight? Flash/Flex?
