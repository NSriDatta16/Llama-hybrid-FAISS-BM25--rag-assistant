Using individuals as a random effect

I would like to compare the average gene expression of three different genes in three different brain structures under two different conditions (see the table below). All means have been calculated with the same 11 individuals. When conducting statistical analyses, do you think I should use the individuals as a random effect and perform a mixed model? If yes/no, why?
