Do you think that would be an optimal assignment for the class? I would personally split the groups so that I have the top in each category in different groups. The students can leverage their skills and improve in that way. I could frame the problem as $\arg\max\limits_{x \in Cat} Score_x \bigcup \arg\min\limits_{x \in Cat} Score_x$ where you are sampling without replacement.
