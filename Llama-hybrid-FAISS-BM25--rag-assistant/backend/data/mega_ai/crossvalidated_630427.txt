Cannot seem to find a statistical difference despite a clear difference in the dataset

I've got a dataset of patients with AVM (neurosurgical disease) where you can receive endovascular treatment, surgical treatment or both (usually because endovascular treatment failed). My outcome is post-operative modified rankings scale (MRS). I've dichotomized it by allocating 0-1 to 0 and 2-6 to 1. I've shown that perioperative stroke is significantly associated with lower post-operative MRS. It turns out that the risk of perioperative stroke is 20% in the endovascular group, 5% in the surgical group and 38% in the "both" group. A logistic regression using the dichotomized MRS as the dependant variable, however, cannot show this difference in MRS between groups. A confounder I thought of, is the presentation type, where presenting with a hemorrhage is likely to be assigned surgical treatment, and this is also associated with a lower post-operative MRS. However if I adjust for this, I still cannot seem to show a difference. I'm using stata and my logistic regression is: logistic mrsbinary i.groups AGEatpresentation SEX presentHemorrhage This runs a logistic regression with the binary variable, MRS 0-1 as 0 and 2-6 as 1, as the dependant variable and the groups as a categorical variable (0 = endovascular, 1 = surgical, 2= both), the age, sex and whether the patient presented with hemorrhage. I would suspect a statistical difference in post-operative MRS between treatments, due to the aforementioned, but I do not. Can anyone see something I do not? Here's my data from stataex: [CODE] * Example generated by -dataex-.
