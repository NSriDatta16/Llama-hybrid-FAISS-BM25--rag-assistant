Views or Organic Groups for this use-case

This is related to another question that I asked before . I'm using views to present to the user a list of nodes. The user then has to pick their top 3 choices, which I then save to a sub-list that I need to remember to show to the user later. I was going to use Flags to mark the user's choices. I now realized that this isn't going to work well, because I may need to present to the user more than 1 list and get him to choose his top 3 choices from each. The problem is there may be overlap between the lists, so flagging wouldn't be accurate. For example the first list may be: Tom Samantha Jack Amanda Dave Rory Ted and the second list may be this, where Rory and Samantha are overlaps from the first list: Rory Hugo Samantha Ryan Bill If the user needs to choose Rory as one of the top 3 in both lists (or wants to choose Rory on the first list, but not on the second list), flagging per user wouldn't work. To create the user's list of choices, I was thinking to either: let the user create a view themselves. Is that possible and how? or use organic groups, which I know very little about. So my question here: are they better suited to help me with this sort of scenario?
