What predictive model is appropriate?

I am trying to forecast the number of bikes (or empty stands) available at a station in a bike sharing system. For example: I would like to know how many bikes should be available at a given station next Monday, between 8 and 8.05am . Data used: History of available bikes/stand per station recorded every minute Weather conditions (dry / wet) I found out that chances of getting a bike were 20% higher on a wet day. So basically, I'd like a model which can use these factors to estimate the number of bikes that should be there, based on : historical data of this station for this day of the week and this time of the day dry/wet weather I've been advised to use Logistic Regression, but I am wondering if the output of it will be binary or if it can be an actual number of bikes ? Apologies in advance for my poor maths level, but I would definitely enjoy a bit of help, thank you.
