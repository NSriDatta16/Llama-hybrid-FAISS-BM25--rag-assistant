Single sign-on ActiveDirectory and Java EE

Scenario: We sell Java EE (JBoss+SpringSecurity) software to large corporations which mostly use ActiveDirectory Our Java EE (JBoss) software can be hooked up to ActiveDirectory, however it requires Roles addition into ActiveDirectory i.e. cn=esp_administrator,cn=Roles,o=company,o=com As per my understanding, JBoss will need an account to "bind" to ActiveDirectory to do the search i.e. cn=admin,cn=Users,o=company,o=com Users still need to login to our Java EE application manually (not single sign-on) Say our Java EE app http://javaee-webapp and one of the company portal is at http://intranet-portal say using Atlassian Jira How can I implement single sign on with this setup? One thing comes to mind is to read cookies from http://intranet-portal , but this only works if our Java EE webapp is a sub-domain of http://intranet-portal , i.e http://intranet-portal/javaee-webapp I've read the following QA Single Sign On for a Web App Transparent user session over several sites (single sign-on + single sign-off) I don't think the customers want us to install Shibboleth IDProvider just for single sign on. Other than a "Remember me" option, what other choice do I have?
