Frequency weights for logistic regression in R

I would like to fit a logistic regression model in R. The data collection process results in an un-balanced amount of events and non-events. I could re-sample from the data to re-create the original prevalance of the events, but I would rather use all the data. The glm() function in R does not use weights as sampling weights, but uses weights as an integer number of trials. From the help page "when the elements of weights are positive integers w_i, that each response y_i is the mean of w_i unit-weight observations". See also this question, Case weighted logistic regression , for more on smapling vs trial weights. Is there an R package to compute a sampling weighted MLE, or what are other options?
