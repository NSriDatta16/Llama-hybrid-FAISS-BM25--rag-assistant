Where to Put Python Utils Folder?

I've a whole bunch of scripts organized like this: root group1 script1.py script2.py group2 script1.py script2.py group3 script1.py script2.py utils utils1.py utils2.py All the scripts*.py use functions inside the utils folder. At the moment, I append the utils path to the scripts in order to import utils. However, this seems to be bad practice (or "not Pythonic"). In addition, the groups in actuality is not as flat as this and there are more util folders than listed above. Hence, the append path solution is getting messier and messier. How can I organize this differently?
