Premailer works fairly well. Plus CampaignMonitor and MailChimp both provide very good free templates (good as in "terrible old school markup", but they're perfect for HTML email). EDIT: a bit of a tangent here, but once you work with HTML email and once the feelings of rage and repulsion have subsided, you may want to check out fixoutlook.org =)
