There are many JS books available, but you really should grab a copy of David Flanagan's JavaScript: The Definitive Guide if you really want to learn this (still the best JS reference IMHO). Read the chapter on closures and you'll get a lot more in-depth knowledge than anyone can give you in a reply here.
