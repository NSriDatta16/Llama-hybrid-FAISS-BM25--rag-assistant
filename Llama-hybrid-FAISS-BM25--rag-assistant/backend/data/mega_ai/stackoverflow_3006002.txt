What is the best jQuery based window plug-in you have ever used?

I tried a couple of jQuery based window plug-ins but unfortunately was not satisfied with any of them. Here's what I tried: http://hernan.amiune.com/labs/jQuery-Windows-Engine-Plugin/jQuery-Windows-Engine-Plugin.html http://fstoke.me/jquery/window/ http://www.soyos.net/aerowindow-jquery.html I need following features without any compromises: Maximize, minimize (to a reasonable location such as bottom-left corner of the visible page, not in the middle of the screen), drag, resize, etc. Highly and easily configurable Actively developed (this can be relaxed a little bit) Comes with good documentation (and examples) works cross-browser (I had problems in IE when I tried to use fstoke.me's implementation). The three plug-ins I have tried failed in one or more respects. I'm not looking for very fancy, animated effects, just very basic but yet adequate functionality. Any suggestions?
