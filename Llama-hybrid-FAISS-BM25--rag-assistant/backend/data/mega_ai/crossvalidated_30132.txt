SAS is important in the pharmaceutical industry but not necessarily in other disciplines. in business and marketing time series analysis and survey sampling are particularly important. Yes big pharma and business use SAS a lot but it is expensive and makes more economical sense with multiple users that you would find in big companies. in the social sciences SPSS is more commonly used but is also expensive. R is free and many advanced statistical procedures can be found in the CRAN libraries.
