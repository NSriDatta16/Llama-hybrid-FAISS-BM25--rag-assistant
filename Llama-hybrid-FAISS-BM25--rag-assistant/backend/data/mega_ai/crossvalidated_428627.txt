Fundamental understanding of Gaussian Process and their terminology

I am new to this site as well as Machine learning, so kindly bear with me. I have been trying to understand Gaussian process and their implementation. Notation: 1) Let's say that the $\vec{x}$ $\in R^{n}$ and $f(\vec{x})$ $\in R$ 2) I have m data points of ( $\vec{x}$ , $f(\vec{x})$ ) Things I have understood: 1) Gaussian process gives a distribution over functions that might be possible given data ( $\vec{x}_{p}$ , $f(\vec{x}_{p})$ ), p = 1....m So the squared exponential kernel defined by: $k(x_{i},x_{k}) = \sigma^{2}exp\left(\frac{-1}{2}\Sigma_{j=1}^{q}\left(\frac{x_{i,j}-x_{k,j}}{l}\right)^2\right)$ Things I have not clearly understood: 1) What is $x_{i},x_{k}$ and what are their dimensions? 2) What is covariance matrix and what is its dimension? 3) What is the value of q, is it 'n' ? 4) What is the size of the kernel? is it a matrix of size m x m or n x n? As you might have guessed I am pretty new to all this. If you could give a small three data points and two dimensions input to demonstarte the sizes of kernel and co variance matrix. Thank you for your time.
