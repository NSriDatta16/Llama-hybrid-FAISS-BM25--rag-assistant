SQL Server's query optimizer bases its plans on statistics. If the statistics are not up to date or indexes have been 'skewed' by many inserts or deletes, then the optimizer sometimes gets it wrong. Most of the time it does a great job. Things you should check: Are your statistics up to date? Are your indexes fragmented?. Do you have a regular scheduled index maintenance job? Are you falling foul of parameter sniffing, causing inappropriate plans to be cached? Is your data selective enough for an index to be choosen? I wouldn't use query HINTS unless you really have to as a last resort. They have a nasty habit of coming back to haunt you.
