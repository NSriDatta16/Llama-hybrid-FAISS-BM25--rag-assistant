It's impossible to say for sure, but my guess is that they simply did pairwise t-tests. They looked at the average responses from the groups that interested them and did t-tests. An option for these data would have been a two-way ANOVA (unbalanced, no doubt) with smoking and exposure group as the factors. There is no evidence from the abstract that the researchers attempted any such a thing. The advantage to such a model would be more degrees of freedom for error and better estimate of error (assuming constant variances!). In my experience, a lot of researchers don't go further than pair-wise t-tests.
