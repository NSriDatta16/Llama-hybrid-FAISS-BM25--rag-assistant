Ranking undergrad students by their future income - Mixture distribution

I would be very grateful for some advice on how to model mixture distributions with R. Given a problem to create a ranking of graduate students by their yearly income after completing their education, what are some suited models for this task? Specifically, my data has a distribution with a point mass at 0 (the majority of graduates doesn't find, or start, a full-time job right away). The rest of the data is sort of nicely distributed. The data $x$ was transformed $\log(x+1)$. My first approach was a simple regression model My second approach were two models (one for classifying whether they get a job - is very weak, and second to predict the income) Simply chaining these two models works much worse than the simple model. My next step would be a Bayesian mixture model to predict income. I was thinking about fitting a mixture with 2 Gaussians, where I would set the mean for one of them to be known as equal to 0. Would that make sense? Has anyone a good experience with some package? Another problem might be that I am always predicting the income using a regression and building a ranking from that, rather than running an ordinal regression. What is the best way handle this situation - if the target variable (income) that the ranking is based on is itself available for training data? Full disclosure: This is a fictitious scenario, as I cannot discuss the exact details of the real case.
