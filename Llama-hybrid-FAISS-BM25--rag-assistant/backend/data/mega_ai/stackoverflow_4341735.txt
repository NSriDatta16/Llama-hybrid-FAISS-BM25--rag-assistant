Yes, put the following header in your .htaccess file: Header set Content-Disposition attachment Of course you can also send this header via PHP, but htacesss makes much more sense in this case. However, it only prevents it from being displayed in the browser. Everyone can download it knowing the link! You cannot really protect images unless you add something like password protection to your site. You can prevent some hotlinking through referer checks though - but that's just to stop dumb webmasters from embedding your images.. it won't stop anyone who really wants your stuff. But if that's fine for you.. have a look at Allow/deny image hotlinking with .htaccess
