The 408 timeout message typically means that the user agent, in this case your pjsip application, sent it's request but did not get a response. I'm involved in a free SIP service called sipsorcery that you can test your software with. It lets you view a full trace of your SIP messages with either a Silverlight browser application or telnet console which is extremely handy when trying to troubleshoot.
