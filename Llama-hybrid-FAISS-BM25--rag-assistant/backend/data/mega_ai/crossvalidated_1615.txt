Adding to what Shane says, I think the continuum comprises: Firm philosophical standing in the Bayes camp Both considered valid, with one approach more or less preferable for a given problem I'd use a Bayesian approach (at all or more often) but I don't have the time. Firm philosophical standing in the frequentist camp I do it like I learned in class. What's Bayes? And yes, I know working statisticians and analysts at all of these points. Most of the time I'm living at #3, striving to spend more time at #2.
