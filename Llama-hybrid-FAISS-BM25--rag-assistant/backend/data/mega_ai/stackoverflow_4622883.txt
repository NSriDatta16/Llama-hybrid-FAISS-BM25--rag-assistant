JRuby and Generics

I have the following java code: nameFinderModel = NameFinderME.train("en", "organization", sampleStream, Collections. emptyMap()); And my conversion is as follows: nameFinderModel = NameFinderME.train("en", "organization", sample_stream, {}) Is this an adequate conversion or am I missing something? Are there any general guidelines for converting generics to JRuby?
