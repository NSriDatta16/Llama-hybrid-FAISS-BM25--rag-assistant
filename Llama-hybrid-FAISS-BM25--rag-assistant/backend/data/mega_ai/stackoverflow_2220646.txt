I haven't tested this on a 500 code, but it works on others like 200, 302 and 404. response=$(curl --write-out '%{http_code}' --silent --output /dev/null servername) Note, format provided for --write-out should be quoted. As suggested by @ibai, add --head to make a HEAD only request. This will save time when the retrieval is successful since the page contents won't be transmitted.
