If you would have kept the comment, it would have been a tad easier. It says: /* Callback function invoked by libpcap for every incoming packet */ Here it says about typedef void(*) pcap_handler(u_char *user, const struct pcap_pkthdr *pkt_header, const u_char *pkt_data) : pkt_header is the header associated by the capture driver to the packet. It is NOT a protocol header.
