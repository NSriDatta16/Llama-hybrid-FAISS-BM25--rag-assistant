I am not immediately aware of a "built-in" function (e.g., in base or similar), but we can do this very easily and efficiently in a couple of lines of code. Here is a function that takes a matrix (not a data frame) as an input and produces either the transition counts ( prob=FALSE ) or, by default ( prob=TRUE ), the estimated transition probabilities. # Function to calculate first-order Markov transition matrix. # Each *row* corresponds to a single run of the Markov chain trans.matrix If you need to call it on a data frame you can always do trans.matrix(as.matrix(dat)) If you're looking for some third-party package, then Rseek or the R search site may provide additional resources.
