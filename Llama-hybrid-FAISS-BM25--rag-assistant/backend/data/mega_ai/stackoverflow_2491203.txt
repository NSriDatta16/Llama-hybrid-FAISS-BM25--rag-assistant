Handling hundreds of actions in Struts2

I've inherited a struts 1 web application where, in order to reduce the number of Action classes (I guess this is the reason), lots of actions are mapped inside a single Action class, like: public XXXAction() throws Exception{ actions = new Hashtable(); actions.put("/XXX/main/load", new Integer(0)); actions.put("/XXX/main/save", new Integer(1)); ...... } public ActionForward executeAction(ActionMapping mapping, ActionForm form, HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse res) throws IOException, ServletException { try { switch (((Integer) actions.get(action)).intValue()) { case 0: loadXXXMain(); break; case 1: ....... and so on (in some Action classes I have almost one hundred of these small actions). Now I'm looking at migrate to struts2 and I would like to have a cleaner and better solution to handle this, maybe without having a single Action class for each of these small classes. What do you suggest? I don't like this solution, but I don't like having hundreds of Action classes.... Thanks! Roberto
