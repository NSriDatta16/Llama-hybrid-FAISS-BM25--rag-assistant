I'd check out Pattern , which is a Python web mining module providing a suite of text retrieval, analysis, and viz tools. I haven't personally used it but looks powerful. Module pattern.web is a web toolkit that bundles various API's (Google, Gmail, Bing, Twitter, Wikipedia, Flickr) with a robust HTML parser and web spider. Its purpose is to retrieve online content in an easy-to-use, uniform way.
