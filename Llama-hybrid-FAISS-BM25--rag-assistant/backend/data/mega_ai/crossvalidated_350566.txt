Is there a specific standard error for an individual residual?

On page 97 of Introduction to Statistical Learning book, there is a paragraph on studentized residuals within the context of looking for outliers. But in practice, it can be difficult to decide how large a residual needs to be before we consider the point to be an outlier. To address this problem, instead of plotting the residuals, we can plot the studentized residuals, computed by dividing each residual e i by its estimated standard error. This gist of this makes sense, I understand that we are looking for residuals that are more than 2-3 deviations away from the mean. What confused me was use of the word "its" in each residual e i by its estimated standard error This implies there is a standard error for each residual e i as opposed to a standard error for all of the residuals as a group. Have I misread or misunderstood this? When calculating studentized residuals am I dividing each residual by the regression RSE or some other denominator?
