It's using capability checking to retrieve an element with the id dhtmltooltip and falling back to an empty String if there is not a capability for doing the retrieval. UPDATE : As others have pointed out, the check for getElementById should be first, and could probably be omitted since any browser that could be called "modern" with a straight face has had it for a long time. UPDATE 2 : With the new context, JSLint is complaining that it isn't document.all.dhtmltooltip . You should probably just rewrite the whole thing as: var tipobj = document.getElementById("dhtmltooltip"); and be done with it.
