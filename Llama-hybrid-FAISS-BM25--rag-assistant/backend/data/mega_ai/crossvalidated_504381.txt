I couldn't be sure of your notation, and I didn't see a final result there. So I went to '538' and got the data on the six polls currently listed for the Warnock race. I show below how I would combine the six polls to get an overall confidence interval. For example, the first-listed poll of 857 likely voters showed 98% of them (840) choosing either Warnock or Loeffler, with 51% of them (437) for Warnock. [That's 52.02% for Warnock among subjects declaring a preference.] Similar computations for all six polls are summarized in R below: LV = c(857,500,500,550,1342,713) # 6 polls: all subjects Ln = round(Lv*c(.98,.98,.91,.97,.97,1)) # subj for W or L Lw = round(Lv*c(.51,.49,.46,.48,.49,.5)) # subjects for W Fw = Lw/Ln # fraction for W round(Fw, 4) [1] 0.5202 0.5000 0.5055 0.4944 0.5054 0.4993 n = sum(Ln); w = sum(Lw) w; n; w/n [1] 2190 # Total for W [1] 4334 # Total for W or L [1] 0.5053069 # Overall fraction for W Altogether, there were 2190 responses for Warnock out of 4334 responses for either Warnock or Loeffler. Because we know of no reason to 'weight' the polls other than sample size, this seems a reasonable way to combine their findings. My method gives an overall $50.53\%$ of useful responses favoring Warnock. A Jeffries 95% confidence interval $(0.4904, 0.5202)$ for the fraction of likely voters favoring Warnock is computed in R as follows: qbeta(c(.025,.975), w+.5, (n-w)+.5) [1] 0.4904225 0.5201842 # Jeffries Ci Considered here as a frequentist confidence interval, this result is based on a Bayesian argument with the non-informative Bayesian prior $\mathsf{Beta}(0.5, 0.5).$ Taking into account the binomial likelihood based on $n = 4334$ useful responses, the ,Bayesian posterior distribution is $\mathsf{Beta}(2190.5, 2144.5),$ quantiles $0.025$ and $0.975$ of which give the confidence interval. [According to the Wikipedia page on binomial confidence intervals, this Jeffries interval estimate has good coverage properties when used as a frequentist confidence interval.] Using the traditional (asymptotic) Wald 95% CI we get $(0.4904,0.5202).$ Specifically, this interval is of the form $\hat p \pm 1.96\sqrt{\hat p(1-\hat p)/n},$ where $\hat p \approx 0.5053$ is the observed proportion in favor and $\sqrt{\hat p(1-\hat p)/n} \approx 0.0076$ is the (estimated) standard error. On account of the relatively large sample sizes, it is not surprising that the two interval estimates match. p.hat = 0.5053069; n = 4334 p.hat + qnorm(c(.025,.975))*sqrt( p.hat*(1-p.hat) /n) [1] 0.4904219 0.5201919 # Wald CI According to the New York Times the percentage of the final vote for Warnock was 51.0%, so the point estimate from my 'combination' of polls is quite close to the final vote, and the CIs cover the final vote percentage.
