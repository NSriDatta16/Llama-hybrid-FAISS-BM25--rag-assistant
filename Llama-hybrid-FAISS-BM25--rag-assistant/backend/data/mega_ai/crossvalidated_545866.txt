Find the points that make the biggest impact on the correlation

I am reconciling two time series, $X_{1...n}$ and $Y_{1...n}$ . They are supposed to have close to 100% correlation, but in reality often not. When that happens, I want to quickly find the points that make the biggest impact to the correlation. Does there exist a formula for me to find the points with the biggest impact? edit: specifically I want to find a fixed list of points to remove, that will give me closest to 100% correlation.
