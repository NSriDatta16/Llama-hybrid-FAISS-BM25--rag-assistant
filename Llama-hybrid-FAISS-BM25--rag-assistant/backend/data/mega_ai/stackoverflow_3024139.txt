How do I store a cookie value as a String?

I am having problems storing a cookie value as a string for an iPhone project. Currently, I am retrieving the value of the cookies this way: NSString *somevalue; for (NSHTTPCookie *cookie in cookies) { NSLog(@"Name: %@ : Value: %@, Expires: %@", cookie.name, cookie.value, cookie.expiresDate); somevalue = cookie.value; } Now, in theory this SHOULD store cookie.value as string 'somevalue'. I can do an NSLog of 'somevalue' and it retrieves the correct value. However, when I pass this through to: ASIFormDataRequest *request = [ASIFormDataRequest requestWithURL:[NSURL URLWithString:fullUrl]]; [request setPostValue:someValue forKey:@"profile_id"]; [request setPostValue:@"1" forKey:@"start"]; [request setPostValue:@"10" forKey:@"end"]; and then check the response, it is passing in the entire cookie (this is what it looks like): a%3A5%3A%7Bs%3A10%3A%22session_id%22%3Bs%3A32%3A%221fcd876dc0240ac4a59f3630b8f630fe%22%3Bs%3A10%3A%22ip_address%22%3Bs%3A7%3A%220.0.0.0%22%3Bs%3A10%3A%22user_agent%22%3Bs%3A50%3A%22Doubletake+1.0+%28iPhone+Simulator%3B+iPhone+OS+3.1.3%3B%22%3Bs%3A13%3A%22last_activity%22%3Bs%3A10%3A%221276270293%22%3Bs%3A5%3A%22email%22%3Bs%3A18%3A%22tim%40domain.com%22%3B%7D5f9c567d5832013183d511dba8910cf3 Is the value actually getting stored? Why is this happening?
