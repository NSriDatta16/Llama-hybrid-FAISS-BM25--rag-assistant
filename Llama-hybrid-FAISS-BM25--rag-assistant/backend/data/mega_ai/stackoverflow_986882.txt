I don't see S#arp Architecture as a framework or even an "architecture" but an awesome starting point for developing an application using MVC and Fluent NHibernate. The project and files are well organised based on the Visual Studio template it provides. That by itself is worth a ton to get one up and running fast. I suggest looking over the Northwind sample source that comes with the source of S#arp Architecture to see what's possible.
