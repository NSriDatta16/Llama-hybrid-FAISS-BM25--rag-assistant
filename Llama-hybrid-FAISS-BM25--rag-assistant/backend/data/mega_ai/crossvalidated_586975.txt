What does error code "outcome = variable_name > 0 predicts data perfectly" indicate when using logistic regression in Stata?

I have a longitudinal dataset and I am trying to create two variables that correspond to two time periods based on specific date ranges (pre- and post-) to be able to analyze the effect of each of those time periods on my outcome. However, when I tried to create these time period variables as exposures to use with my outcome using logistic regression, I get this error message "outcome = variable_name > 0 predicts data perfectly." This is how I created my time period variables: **Period 1:** bysort id_variable: gen pre-period = binary_outcome if (date_of_eval mdy(5,4,2020)) Does anyone know what this error code means or if I have incorrectly coded my variables? Thank you!
