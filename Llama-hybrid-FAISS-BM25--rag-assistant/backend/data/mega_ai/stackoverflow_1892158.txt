I've found that optimizing the uses clause of units helps with compilation speeds. Where possible, remove references to units in particular cases where, for example, unit1 uses unit2 in it's interface section and unit2 uses unit1 in it's implementation section. There is a good free uses clause analyzer that points out unneeded uses references at http://www.peganza.com/products_icarus.htm .
