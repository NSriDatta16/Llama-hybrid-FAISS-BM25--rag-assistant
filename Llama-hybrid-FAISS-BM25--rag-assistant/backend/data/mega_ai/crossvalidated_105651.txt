You are looking for time series clustering . As you already noted, this consists of two steps: Defining an appropriate distance measure between time series, which should take the particular structure of time series (autoregression, seasonality, ...) into account Using one of the many clustering algorithms, possibly adapted specifically to time series I personally do not like kmeans very much, I'd rather use DBSCAN (you don't have to prespecify the number of clusters or use some additional algorithm to determine the optimal $k$, and DBSCAN can deal with outliers, i.e., data points that do not belong to any cluster), but everyone has their own favorite here. Here is a discussion of time series clustering in R. Here is a scholarly survey.
