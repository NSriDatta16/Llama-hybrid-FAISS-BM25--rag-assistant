The answer is that All of the methods can be used for the above problem. Well, two things should be noted in these kinds of simple problems. Is it a classification or a regression problem? You might have already guessed that it is a classification problem. Are there any categorical values in the input features? If yes, does the chosen algorithm work with categorical variables. The examiner may expect the answer that neural networks, SVM etc. don't work with categorical variables. But in fact you can encode a categorical variable as a series of binary variables. For example if the variable age group takes values {child, young, old}, then you may change this single variable to three binary variables; is_child, is_young and is_old. This way you can use svm or neural network. Again linear regression looks like an unlikely candidate for a classification problem. But they can be used for classification as well. You don't expect any mentionable performance though.
