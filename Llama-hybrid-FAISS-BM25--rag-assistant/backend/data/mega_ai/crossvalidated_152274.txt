Kernels for Categorical or Mixed Data

It appears that when data sets have a combination of categorical and continuous attributes, the common way to apply kernel algorithms to such data sets is to use a one hot encoding scheme for each categorical variable - this requires replacing a categorical variable with K levels with K dummy indicator variables. I am interested in unsupervised applications of kernel methods. I tried the above idea (performing PCA) on a data set with mixed attributes using an RBF kernel but the eigenvalues I got did not have the desirable scree plot look. I am aware of Multiple Correspondence Analysis, I am just curious if there is a way to do this using kernel methods - perhaps a better encoding scheme or better choice of kernel etc. I'd appreciate any insights in solving this problem with kernels.
