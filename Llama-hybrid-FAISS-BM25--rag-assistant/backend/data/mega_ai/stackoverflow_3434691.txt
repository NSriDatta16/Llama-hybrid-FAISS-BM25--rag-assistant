Errors in finding the Product of two double values in VS8 C#

I am using C# on VS8 professional. I have a piece of code I originally wrote in Pascal then C then C# so has been used without a hitch until now. The fragment of code looks like this:- *bool InverseTransverseMercator(coord enl) { double nu, rho, k0; double x, y, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6, x7; double phif, phi, cosphif, sinphif, lam, n, n2, n3, n4; double t, t2, t3, t4, t6, nu2, nu3, nu5, nu7, neta2; double a0, a1, a2, a3, p7, p8, p9, p10, p11, p12, p12a; coord cc; //has a structure public double x, y, z; cc = enl; x = cc.x; y = cc.y; x2 = x * x; x3 = x * x2;//I stop the debugger at the start of this line and examine some values. ...* Here are the values from the debugger that have me really confused:- x = 23500.0 - original value x * x = 552250000.0 (right hand side of x2=x * x correct) x2 = 552249984.0 (left hand side of x2 = x * x INCORRECT!) As you can see the x * x value is correct yet the value in the variable to which it is assigned (X2) is not. In fact the answers differ by 16. These are all double variables and I would have expected rounding at the 16th significant digit. I have tried renaming the variables, using Math.Pow(x,2) , using the 'decimal' type and all have the problem that the value for x2 is not what it should be. I tried rearranging the lines and adding in more dummy lines without a difference. Searching through my code I have no global property name x2 . Interestingly the value does change to near the exact answer as if a colossal rounding error was being done. I must be doing something rather dumb and stupid here but I just can't see it. I would be most grateful for any advice from someone on this issue.
