Creating objects using LINQ

I have an xml file that looks like this; Burt Reynolds Bad Ass Employee Header 1 Employee Paragraph 1.1 Employee Paragraph 1.2 Employee Header 2 Employee Paragraph 2.1 Employee Paragraph 2.2 /PublishingImages/2nav_bg.png /PublishingImages/down_carat.gif http://sandbox/RichMedia/Robotica_720.wmv The Employee tag goes 1 to n. The EmployeeStoryHeaderParagraph tag goes 1 to n. The EmployeeParagraphs tag goes 1 to n. I am trying to create an object and add it to a list using this data but I am stuck on grabbing the header and the paragraphs. Currently the code looks like this. XDocument employeeXML = XDocument.Parse(e.Result); employeeList = (from employee in employeeXML.Descendants(ns + "Employee") select new Employee(employee.Element(ns + "EmployeeName").Value, employee.Element(ns + "EmployeeTitle").Value, employee.Element(ns + "EmployeeImage").Element(ns + "include").Attribute("externalPath").Value, employee.Element(ns + "EmployeeSigImage").Element(ns + "include").Attribute("externalPath").Value, employee.Element(ns + "EmployeeVideo").Value, headers, content )).ToList(); Employee is a class I have created that takes this as a contructor; public Employee(string _employeeName, string _employeeTitle, string _employeeImage, string _employeeSigImage, string _employeeMovieUri, List _employeeHeader, List _employeeContent) When I get to headers in my Linq statement above I need it to go through and create a List of headers from the current employee it is on, when it gets to content I need a List of string arrays containing the EmployeeParagraphs associated with that header. So header[1] would be the header of content[1] string of paragraphs. I don't know how to do this in Linq, can I just add code to where header and content appears above to create a new list or do I do it before I get into this list? Maybe there is a straight up better way to this than I am currently trying?
