Yes. For any machine learning problem, you are learning an objective function mapping from your input to your output. In google's case the inputs be controlling parameters and outputs be energy consumption, while in yours they are building parameters and cost. You can do it in a standard supervised learning framework. Or you can put it in a reinforcement learning framework in which you treat the cost as reward signal, if you have enough data or have some simulation software to generate data.
