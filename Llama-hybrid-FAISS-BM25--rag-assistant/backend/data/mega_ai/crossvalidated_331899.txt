What's the intuition for ABA' in linear algebra?

I've seen the pattern ABA', where A and B are matrices, and ' stands for the transpose, many times so I want to know if there is an intuition for this pattern. I did some development to see what the resulting matrix would look like and I got this: Let A be a matrix of dimensions (l,m), B be a matrix of dimensions (m,m) and R = ABA' with dimensions (l,l) Then: Is my development correct? When does this pattern occur? (I've seen it a lot in machine learning). One context where I've seen this pattern is in the equations of the Kaman filter (taken from wikipedia ) :
