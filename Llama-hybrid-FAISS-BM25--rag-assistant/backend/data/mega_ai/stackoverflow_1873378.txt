Clientside going serverside with node.js

I`ve been looking for a serverside language for some time, and python got my attention somewhat. But as I already know and love javascript, I now want learn to code on the server with js and node.js. Now, what books and what subjects do I need to learn to understand the serverside world better? (let me know if Im to vague)
