I added the following and it seems to work. I'll caveat this with the acknowledgement that I'm also struggling with ivy and a lot of the stuff I have working is pretty much black-box working... i.e. it does the job so I stop fiddling! My understanding is somewhat less advanced I'm afraid to say. Anwyay, in settings.xml I added: Which I think tells ivy to use its intelligence to work with these modules. That intelligence possibly includes checking of updated versions of the module at resolve time. Also, on the resolvers I added checkModified and changingPattern . Apparnntly it's important to do this both on the actual resolver and the wrapping chain (if you have one): ... The checkModified hopefully does what it says on the tin. And I gather that the changingPattern tells ivy to check whether artifacts containing this pattern have a new update in the repo. I'm personally using a maven repo where modifiable stuff always has -SNAPSHOT appended to it so that's why I use that (fairly common I think). I guess you could replace this changingPattern with ".*" or something that suits you better.
