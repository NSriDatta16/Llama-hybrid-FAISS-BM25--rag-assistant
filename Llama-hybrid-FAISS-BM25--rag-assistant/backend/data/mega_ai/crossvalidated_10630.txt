If you are happy with your confidence interval on the unknown proportion of a single success, then just plug both of those values into the above formula. Since k and n are known constants (rather than random variables) and the probability of k or more out of n is monotone, you can just transform the ends of your confidence interval to get a confidence interval on the transformed parameter (and your probability above is just a transform of the parameter). If you want to get fancier you can do a full Bayesian analysis with the Beta-Binomial and get the posterior distribution of the next observation (I think there is a more formal name for it, but that could be what you want).
