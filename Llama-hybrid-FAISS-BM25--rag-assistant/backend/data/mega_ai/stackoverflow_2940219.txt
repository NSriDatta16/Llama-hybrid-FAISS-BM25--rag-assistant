jQuery UI dialog not obeying position option on open

My code used to work, but I recently updated jQuery UI to 1.8 and jQuery to 1.4 because some things weren't working. Once I did that, those things started working, however, now I notice this one dialog is positioning itself top-center, instead of middle-center. Let me explain the code a bit first. The code queries an Ajax request every x minutes to see the last time the session was hit. If it's been 10 minutes since they last hit their session, a jQuery UI dialog div appears, with a warning that their session is about to expire, and there is a button that lets you re-hit your session via a separate in-line Ajax GET request without reloading the whole page. Here's the actual trouble. After 15 minutes or more, it's supposed to close the warning dialog (it checks if it's already open, which in this situation it 'likely is') and then creates a new dialog with an in-line login form that lets you re validate your log-in without reloading the page (and losing any unsaved, half-way filled out forms). Here is the function that is supposed to close the warning, create the re-login div: function renderReLogin() { if ($("#logOutWarning").dialog("isOpen")) { $("#logOutWarning").dialog("close"); // Close warning dialog as session has already expired } if ($("#logOutReLogin").dialog("isOpen") != true) { $('#noticeContainers').html(' '); } $('#logOutReLoginText').html("This session has expired. In order to protect the integrity of you and your clients, we must limit sessions. To resume this session (and not lose any unsaved work) you must revalidate your credentials by logging in below. " + ' '+ ' '+ ' E-mail: '+ ' '+ ' Password '+ ' '+ ' ' ); $('#logOutReLogin').dialog( { width: '50%', modal: true, show: 'scale', hide: 'scale', draggable: false, resizable: false, position: 'center', buttons: { "Re-Login": function() { retryLogin(); }, } } ); } Now like I said above, the warning opens fine, and then closes fine. But the re-login dialog snaps to the very top-center of the view-port, rather than the middle-center. When I manually call $("#logOutReLogin").dialog("option", "position", "center" ); via Firebug in Firefox after it's already opened, it does go to where it should be. It just seems to be the open behavior within the function above.
