In one-class SVM the notion of accuracy is out of place. One-class SVM is designed to estimate the support of a distribution . Basically, it's output for a given instance is a measure of confidence of that instance belonging to the data that was used in training the model. When constructing a one-class SVM model, you have to decide how much of your data can be considered outliers (e.g. rejected by the model). You can tune kernel parameters using a cross-validation approach. I am getting 49% accuracy and my training set has no outlier data. So, does this actually mean 98% accuracy in real world scenario? I don't really understand the question here. It sounds like you are using one-class SVM for a binary classification problem, which is a bad idea.
