A few things to fix, hopefully one will get you moving: Move your controller from indexController.php to IndexController.php . On case-sensitive systems, this very well could cause the controller not to be found. Have you defined a layout file? (e.g. advancedcatalog.xml). Your file defines advancecatalog.xml , which seems like it might be a typo, though it could work if you defined that file. Do you have any views defined? loadLayout will try to load a layout handle for the page and render blocks accordingly. This is where you'll have to specify your advancedcatalog/advancedcatalog block. If you do have a layout and templates, please post those. Don't use camelcase for the block name, it will confuse Magento. The block will need to be defined as advancedcatalog/advancedcatalog , but that will resolve to mywebwow_AdvancedCatalog_Block_Advancedcatalog (note no second cap). This will be an issue. Fix those and see if it starts working, let me know if you still have trouble. Thanks, Joe You don't necessarily need a model unless you are invoking one. As for #4, it's up to you whether you want to use mixed case on that one. In your config file, you specified the prefix for AdvancedCatalog blocks to be mywebwow_AdvancedCatalog_Block , so the mixed case shouldn't be a problem. Conversely, though, you may want the tag inside of blocks to be lowercased, so that when you invoke your models you can stick w/ the existing Magento convention of lowercase. Do this: mywebwow_AdvancedCatalog_Block ....
