Don't forget about touchesCanceled. Add this function/method and NSLog it when a touch ends up there I think you'll find some missing touches. If you're looking for a tap count - tapping in the same place more than once without moving the finger much - you can get it via: -(void)iPhoneTouchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; CGPoint touchPosition = [touch locationInView:self]; lastTouchTime = [touch timestamp]; myTouchCount = [touch tapCount]; But I also do it manually using touchesMoved to see how FAR it moved and canceling the ability to double/triple tap if any of the taps moved too far, and counting taps as long as you're in a valid tap state.
