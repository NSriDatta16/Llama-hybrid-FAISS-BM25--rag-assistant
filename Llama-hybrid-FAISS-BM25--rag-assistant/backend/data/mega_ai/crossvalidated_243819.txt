Normalize function for train, test, and validation sets

I am trying to normalize data for a neural network task. I want to normalize the training set using this function: normalize so I can then use it in this way: trainData1 I am new to writing functions in R and need a function to save the min/max from each column in the pre-normalized training set to then use in normalizing each column in the testing and validation sets. My idea would be to write a function like: normalize where trainData is already defined as a data.frame and has the same column names as the test data set. When I run the function I get: testData1 Anyone have any ideas?
