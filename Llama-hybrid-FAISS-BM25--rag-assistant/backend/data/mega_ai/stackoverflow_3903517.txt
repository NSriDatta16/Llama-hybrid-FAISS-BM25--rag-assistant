This fish simulation in Javascript (source code available) simulates fish movement in two dimensions; however, it would be easily modified to three dimensions. You should let the system evolve the fish neural network brains in order to see the full effect or watch the video posted on the page. The fish move in a similar way as tank with two treads, where two speed variables are given allowing the fish to rotate or move forwards depending on the difference between the speed variables. Some parameters are given so the fish can't turn overly sharply. For each time step the fish acceleration values are given by a neural network (trained by evolution) for each of the "treads" which using Newtons laws effects the tread speed of the fish. Instead of using a neural network you could do something more random; however you would need to reduce the amount the fish can turn to a very small range.
