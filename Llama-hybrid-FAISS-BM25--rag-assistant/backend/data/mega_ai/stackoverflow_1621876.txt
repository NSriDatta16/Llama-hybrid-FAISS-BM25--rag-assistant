For each category's model entity, create a model view that filters properties according to current market, possibly create a dictionary of unfiltered properties on the fly or signal the view some other way which properties to ignore/not to ignore. - If filtering per property is too much, you can use a separate model-view per market (using a dictionary). You can also use separate views, however that would leave you with loads of views - one dynamic view that loads the correct view-model according to the view (finds the model-view via the controller) and takes the view-model's filters into consideration would be more elegant.
