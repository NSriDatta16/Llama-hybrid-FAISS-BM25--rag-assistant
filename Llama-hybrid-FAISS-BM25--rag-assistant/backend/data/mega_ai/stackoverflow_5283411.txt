Despite the 'web' part of Java Web Start , it might suffice to supply an applet (yes, I did mean applet not application) on the CD that is launched using JWS. As of Java 1.6.0_10+, applets can be dragged from the web page (on the CD) where they reside. If a dragged applet is configured by JNLP (installed using JWS), it will then install itself into the user's system. Further, JNLP offers a way for even sand-boxed apps. to use the printer. See my demo. of the JNLP PrintService for more details on that.
