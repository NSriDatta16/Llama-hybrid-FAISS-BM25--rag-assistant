Sql Server Collation

The book I am reading says that SQL Server supports two kinds of character data typesâ€”regular and Unicode. Regular data types include CHAR and VARCHAR, and Unicode data types include NCHAR and NVARCHAR. The difference is that regular characters use one byte of storage for each character, while Unicode characters require two bytes per character. With one byte of storage per character, a choice of a regular character type for a column restricts you to only one language in addition to English because only 256 (2^8) different characters can be represented by a single byte. What I came to know by this is, if I use Varchar then I can use only one language(For ex. Hindi, an Indian Language) along with English. But When I run this Create Table NameTable ( NameColumn varchar(MAX) COLLATE Indic_General_90_CI_AS_KS ) It shows me error "Collation 'Indic_General_90_CI_AS_KS' is supported on Unicode data types only and cannot be applied to char, varchar or text data types." So where have I misunderstood the author? Thanks
