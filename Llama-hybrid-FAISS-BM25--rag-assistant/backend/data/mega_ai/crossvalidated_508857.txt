post-hoc (Tukey) on adonis (permanova)

I have a bray-curtis distance matrix and found significant associations on a grouping variable with adonis (permanova) using R package vegan. Now I would like to perfrom a post-hoc test to test between groups using Tukey with agricolae . However, the function works only with aov and lm class objects , while adonis is of another class: class (permanova_species_staging) "adonis" Is there a possibility to coerce it to run with Tukey test of agricoale? Or is there another possibility of pairwise comparison post-hoc test?
