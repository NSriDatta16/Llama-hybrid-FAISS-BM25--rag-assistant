In terms of algorithms, I cannot suggest any without a sense of the data i.e. does it decompose well into trend, seasonality and remainder effects or how it is affected by other variables etc. But since the question has an r tag, I would recommend the prophet package ( documentation ). It performs better than packages like forecast and other standard algorithms when it comes to time series with a lot of variation (eg. finance data). It also gives good directional accuracy as demonstrated in this blog .
