Machine Learning approach to solve this selection problem?

I have a set of items S. items can be joined to groups consisting of up to x items. For a group of items i can derive a score Y using some unknown performance measure. What would be the most efficient way to find the "best" performing group without doing an exhaustive search, that is, try all possible combinations? Would this be a candidate for a simple genetic algorithm? Thanks
