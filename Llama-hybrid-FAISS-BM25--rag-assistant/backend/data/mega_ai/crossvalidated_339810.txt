Whenever possible, I would like to have a baseline and end of experiment value in any controlled experiment. Whether you then analyze the final value or the change from baseline is the same thing sas far as the difference to the control group is concerned, if you adjust for the baseline. The difference to the control group is what matters, while the change from baseline may occur for any number of reasons. Sometimes reporting one or the other (change or final value) might be considered more useful by some, but that's usually personal preference. However, sometimes you can only measure something once, e.g. organ weight after dissecting an animal, SAT score at end of school career etc.
