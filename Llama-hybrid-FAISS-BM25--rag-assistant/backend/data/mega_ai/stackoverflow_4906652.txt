The reason is the column with the large padding has expanded it's container, but the expansion is then hidden but overflow:hidden; but with the use of the fragment it is being scrolled into the position of the fragment, effectively chopping off anything above that. You can use javascript and set scrollTop to 0 and it scroll it back to the normal position. Basically a wierd edge case which browsers do not seem to handle very well.
