There are (at least) two broad approaches that you might consider. First, you could try to summarize each variable length row of your data into a fixed length row. In your case you might include a count of how many 8-element sublists it had, a count of how many 10-element sublists it had, the average of all the 8-element lists, the standard deviation of the means of each 8-element list and so forth. This would give you a simple representation of your data that would easily fit into standard algorithms. Alternatively, you could try a generative modelling approach where you specify what the joint probability distribution of your dataset and labels is and attempt to estimate that distribution. You can then predict a label by conditioning the distribution on a particular row of your dataset.
