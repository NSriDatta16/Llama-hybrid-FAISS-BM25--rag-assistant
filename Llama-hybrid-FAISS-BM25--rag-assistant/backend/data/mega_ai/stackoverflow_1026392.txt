If you are using Word 2003 or 2007 you can convert xhtml documents to Word Xml documents using xslt. If you google for html to docx xsl you will find many examples of the opposite (converting docx to html) so you might one of those examples as a basis for a conversion. The only challenge would be downloading and embedding the images in the document, but that is also possible .
