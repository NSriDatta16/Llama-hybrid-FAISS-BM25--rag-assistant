I've used preprocessor programming successfully to get a macro of this kind: DEFINE_ENUM(Fruits, (Apple)(Mango)(Orange)); It does a tad more than just printing the names, but it could easily be simplified to 2 switches if necessary. It's based on Boost.Preprocessor facilities (notably BOOST_PP_SEQ_FOREACH ) which is a must have for preprocessor programming, and I find it much more elegant than the X facility and its file reinclusion system.
