Building personal CMS - classes and libraries

I'm building my personal CMS and need your advice organizing core functions and classes. I have folders: /shared /classes DB.php Session.php Config.php ... /libraries Arrays.php DateTime.php Email.php ... The files in 'classes' folder contains core classes (one class per file). Now the question is about /libraries/ - they contain functions that may be used in any class, and sometimes they use some other function from another library, and sometimes they need to access some core class. Should i just write them as functions, or make them static and wrap in some class? Basically i need them everywhere, but keep them organized.
