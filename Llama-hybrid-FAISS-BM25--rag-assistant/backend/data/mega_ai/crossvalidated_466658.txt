1) "Making a time series stationary" is only required if you want to do something that assumes the time series to be stationary. As you correctly state, not everything you may want to do (such as clustering time series) requires this. 2) Technically, stationarity is a very strong assumption, and what is usually referred to as "making a time series stationary" in fact normally only can make it appear stationary, or rather remove obvious indications of non-stationarity. That the resulting time series is very often referred to as (truly) "stationary" after this kind of transformation seems inappropriate to me, although my point here is that this is inappropriate wording, not that as a course of action it'd be inappropriate (because apparent /approximate stationarity is the best we can get anyway).
