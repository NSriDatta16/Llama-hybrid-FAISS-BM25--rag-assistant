The easies option would be to create an on demand workflow on the contact entity (organization scope). The workflow simply updates the contact main address fields with the primary customer (account) address fields. The users can then navigate to the contacts associated views from within the account entity, click on the workflow toolbar button and select the cascading address workflow for all existing contacts. The disadvantage of using this approach is that you rely on user interaction. Deciding on a convention as Daniel suggested is the right way to go. I would simply disable the contact main address fields so they can only be changed via your plug-in and teach the users to use the more addresses feature when they need to enter individual contact addresses.
