You just have to disable centering if it is an iphone or an ipod: /*if its iphone or ipod disregard alignment and dont center*/ if((navigator.userAgent.match(/iPhone/i)) || (navigator.userAgent.match(/iPod/i))) { return ; } Just add the following code to the top of the $.fancybox.center function in jquery.fancybox-1.3.4.js This will prevent the box's bouncing on iphone and ipod touch. but you have to change the url of the script to point to this file or you have to repack this code.
