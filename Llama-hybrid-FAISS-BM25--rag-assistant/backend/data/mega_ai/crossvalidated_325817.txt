Machine learning - PCA and KNN on rgb images are too slow

I work with python and images of tables (taken from above). My aim is to take a photo of a random table and then find the most similar tables to it in my database. Obviously, the main feature which distinguishes the tables are their shape (square, rectangular, round, oval) but there are also other details. For now, I am just running a PCA and a KNN on rgb images of tables to find the most similar tables in the database for each of the tables of the database. The problem is that when I increase the number of rgb images of tables e.g. from 400 to 500 the processing time significantly increases. My final goal is to run this program with 2000 or even 4000 table images so I need a more efficient machine learning algorithm for my task. Can you recommend me another more efficient machine learning algorithm for this task?
