What does the "weighted" mean? Im trying to learn logistic regression

eating_disorder Please help, these are the r codes I used to analyze the data, but the result shown extreamly high standard error for "eating_disorder"=11084.3781, it does not look right to me. Am I treating the "weighted" correctly?
