When dealing with large amounts of memory, you have to look at two things, lifecycle, how often you create and recreate this buffer. As memory gets fragmented, there can come a time when you try to allocate a buffer of say, 512MB, and you can't, because your allocator cannot find 512MB of contiguous address space. This is why @onebyone's idea of using vectors is sometimes better. If you can reduce your footprint to byte-sized (not literally) chunks, you gain flexibility in how you manage your memory. That said, I would almost NEVER recommend keeping a large static buffer around. It's asking for trouble.
