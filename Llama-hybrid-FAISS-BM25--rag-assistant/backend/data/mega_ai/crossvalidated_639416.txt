How to diagnose the number of bootstraps I need?

I am running an XGBoost model to predict the global economic cost of invasive species. My training set is only about 3000 data points. I am bootstrapping my predictions, and went with the default 1000 samples. I see other questions in which answers recommend at least 1000 samples ( Rule of thumb for number of bootstrap samples ). My problem is that the hyperparameter grid search is going too slow, and the whole thing is estimated to take a month to run. I don't have access to a bigger computer now to increase parallelization. If a co-author or reviewer tells me to change anything in the model it will take another month to run again. So far I have run 43 samples, and calculated the mean R-squared for increasing number of samples (plotted bellow). I see the mean R-squared is close to stabilizing at 43. Could I get away with only 50 or 100 bootstraps if I show the R-squared doesn't change much after this, or are there other reasons I should run it 1000 times?
