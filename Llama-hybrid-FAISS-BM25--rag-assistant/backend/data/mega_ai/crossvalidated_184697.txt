Orthogonality of the basis in factor analysis

I have been studying principal component analysis (PCA) and then I have gone up to factor analysis (FA). I understood that PCA seeks orthonormal basis, but I am not so sure if this is the case for factor analysis. It seems that if my code is correct, the basis it finds is not orthonormal. Is it true that the basis is not orthonormal in factor analysis? What is the theory behind it?
