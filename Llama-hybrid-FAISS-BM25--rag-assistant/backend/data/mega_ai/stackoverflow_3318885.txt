EDIT Concatenation will give out false answers as pointed out in the comments ('Roberto Neil' vs 'Robert ONeil'. Here is an answer that eliminates the concatenation issue. I found out the non duplicates and eliminated them from the final answer. WITH MyTable AS ( SELECT 1 as ID, 'John' as FirstName, 'Doe' as LastName UNION SELECT 2 as ID, 'John' as FirstName, 'Doe' as LastName UNION SELECT 3 as ID, 'Tim' as FirstName, 'Doe' as LastName UNION SELECT 4 as ID, 'Jane' as FirstName, 'Doe' as LastName UNION SELECT 5 as ID, 'Jane' as FirstName, 'Doe' as LastName ) SELECT Id, FirstName, LastName FROM MyTable SelectTable WHERE Id Not In ( SELECT Min (Id) From MyTable SearchTable GROUP BY FirstName, LastName HAVING COUNT (*) = 1 ) OLD SOLUTION Use GROUP BY and HAVING.. check out this working sample WITH MyTable AS ( SELECT 1 as ID, 'John' as FirstName, 'Doe' as LastName UNION SELECT 2 as ID, 'John' as FirstName, 'Doe' as LastName UNION SELECT 3 as ID, 'Time' as FirstName, 'Doe' as LastName UNION SELECT 4 as ID, 'Jane' as FirstName, 'Doe' as LastName ) SELECT ID, FirstName, LastName FROM MyTable WHERE FirstName + LastName IN ( SELECT FirstName + LastName FROM MyTable GROUP BY FirstName + LastName HAVING COUNT (*) > 1 ) This will result in the following ID FirstName LastName ----------- --------- -------- 1 John Doe 2 John Doe
