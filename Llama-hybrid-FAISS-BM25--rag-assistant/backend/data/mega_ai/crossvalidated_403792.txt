How effective is SVM over big datasets?

I have a dataset of 800,000 observations and 11 features that I am using for a classification problem. I tried to optimize my model many times but in vain. The one thing I haven't tried is using SVM. I heard SVMs are only practical with smaller datasets. My concern is: shall I give it a try or is it going to take days to train the model?
