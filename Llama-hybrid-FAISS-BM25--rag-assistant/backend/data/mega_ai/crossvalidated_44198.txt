Please read the correct answer from the other post, as mentioned there, this answer incorrectly assumes a rate matrix instead of a transition Matrix. You can always get a continuous time version of a discrete one by simply "Poissonizing" it. For example, if you have a discrete time Markov chain with transition matrix $T$ you get a continuous time version by considering $$P_t = \sum_{n\geq 0} \frac{t^n}{n!}\exp(-t)T^n $$ Hence the above definition makes sense in the context of continuous time Markov chains.
