Update: The new question is basically "Can WCF Data Services restrict access?", Yes. These questions are hard to answer because you haven't posted your requirements, SLAs, or security needs. WCF Data Services are fine for my LoB but may no be for yours depending on all sorts of details you haven't posted. Two Thoughts: 1) WCF Data Services are REST only and don't have the same security of options as a hand rolled WCF Service. Do you have to lock everything down like the Kremlin? WCF Data Services may not be your cup of tea. 2) WCF Data Services are perfect for for read-only, "SELECT TOP 50 * FROM PRODUCT" type service methods. Normally you'd have to write a couple of WCF Service methods for each entity type of your app. By leveraging WCF Data Services on top of a normal WCF service you can save yourself a lot of time writing the same read methods over and over again.
