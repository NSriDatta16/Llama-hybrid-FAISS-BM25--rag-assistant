Short answer: Your data likely do not contain the answer to your question and there is no general way to make up for it with statistics. Long answer: As you said, any differences in sales can be easily attributed to inherent differences between the cars, not the intervention. There is no general way to decouple these inherent differences from the differences in marketing. Your data simply are not very informative (in particular, there is no "A/B test" - that would be if you had multiple sales points, only some of the running the intervention). The only way out of this is to make strong assumptions about the way sales are determined. Your post implies you are willing to assume that the inherent differences have a linear effect on sales (they simply change the scale of the time series). If the intervention is supposed to change the shape of the time series (e.g. the intervention adds a peak at the beginning, but does not affect the tail), you might be able to detect it. A simple way to do this would be to run a linear regression to predict the test car sales for each day from the sales of the control cars. Then look at the residual error over time and see if there is some systematic trend. A more thorough way might be to use Bayesian statistics and fit a spline or a Gaussian process to the time series (one curve for all the control cars together, one curve for the test car + a separate scale coefficient for each car) and then look at the distribution of the differences between the two curves. You might also need to treat weekends/holidays in a special way. This will likely require a custom model coded in Stan or similar language, although the brms package might have you covered. But the assumptions made above are almost certain to be false: inherent differences may have (at least partially) non-linear effect and the intervention will have (at least partially) a linear effect. Also most models will assume Gaussian noise in the sales which might not be plausible. You need to be very careful and use your judgement to check if it all makes sense - there is IMHO no general way to even guess the size of possible error. Combining sales from different times is also tricky, at the very least you need to take into account weekends and holidays.
