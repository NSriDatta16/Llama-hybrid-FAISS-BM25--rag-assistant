Is Spring Webflow suitable for async. flows?

I've got my first impression of Spring WebFlow 2.1 from studying the reference app and reading the manual. Before going further, I would like to ask for the impression of this community. Actually, I plan my site to consist of only one single web page. Everything (login/logout, adding elements etc.) else is supposed to be updated via async. communication. However, my first impression of Spring WebFlow is that it glues the flow of successive webpages, not their fragment. Hence, two questions: Would anyone recommend Spring WebFlow for such a page? Is Spring MVC capable of such a strategy? Thanks in advance
