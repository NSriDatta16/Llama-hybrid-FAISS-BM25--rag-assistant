Depending on what statistical test you are trying to use, in many cases a difference in sample size or even a small sample size will not actually stop you from carrying out the statistical test. However, you are unlikely to get a 'statistically significant' result, because your sample size is too small to detect a difference even if one exists. A pragmatic way to get round this may be to combine some of your categories of restaurants into larger groups. Your choice of groups is likely to be subjective, but it would be one way to even out the sample size of your groups. Or only compare groups that you have a reasonable sample size for. It's difficult to say more without knowing what statistical analysis you're trying to carry out. Your answer to ReneBt's comment suggests that you may be dealing with scores that can only take fixed values along a rating scale - e.g. 3, 3.5, 4. Have you taken this into account in your choice of analysis?
