PCA on a rank-deficient matrix using SVD of the covariance matrix

I have a high-dimensional data matrix X where sample size is smaller than the variable size. I want to use PCA as a dimensionality reduction method, but I cannot call it directly in R since the matrix X is rank-deficient. I saw below technique in an R code to get the principal component representation from a rank-deficient matrix: 1) Get U from svd(XX T ) 2) Get the principal component representation C by solving X = UC I am new to PCA, and I have no idea how that makes sense. Could someone clarify how those 2 steps is equivalent to applying PCA on X ?
