Cross Validation with Panel Data of Variable Length

I have a problem of wanting to predict $y_t$ from $x_t$ and some lags given a series of $\{(y_t, x_t)\}_{t=1}^T$ . To build my prediction algorithm I was hoping to use cross validation techniques such as the ones recommended by Rob J Hyndman is some of the other posts shared here on this stack exchange. Unlike normal time series, however my data has another component to it: a basic unit of analysis. In this case my data goes from what I mentioned before to $\{(y_{it}, x_{it})\}_{t=1}^{T_i} \quad \forall i\in \{1,...,N\}$ . Put into English, each time series is of an individual and each time series has a different length $T_i$ . Because of this, I worry that if I want to predict for any given interval at a specified time $t$ , cross validation procedures that work like moving windows will have some leakage if they're done at the individual level. I.e. my first thought was to use TimeSeriesSplit in the Scikit-learn package on each individual's series and then take the first partition of every individual as my training data. But then I realized that some partitions will be at e.g. $t=5$ and others will be at $t=6$ and thus some of the covariates $x_{i,t=6}$ could provide leakage for $x_{j,t=5}$ even though you wouldn't be able to perfectly predict one from the other. So basically my question is this: is this something I should be concerned about, and if so how should I handle it when I do cross validation?
