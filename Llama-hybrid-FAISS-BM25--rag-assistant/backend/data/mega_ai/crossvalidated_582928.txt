First, have you prepared some visualizations of your data? Plotting the data points should always be the first step, this helps to gain insight into your data. A trivial pair-plot ( in R e.g. pairs() ) could be a first step. Next some comments on your approach with a mixed effect model: You say that you expect the relationship to be nonlinear, so I am wondering whether you have tried some nonlinear basis functions in your linear model? Your data visualizations might give you some clues as to what might work. And if your errors are indeed not normal, there are generalized linear models (in R e.g. the glm function , glmm for mixed effects , or glmnet for regularization) that could help with this issue. Some GAM regression might be beneficial, too. If you want to leave the realm of linear models for sure, there are many possibilities to consider next, e.g. some nonlinear fitting with nls() or some Bayesian approaches with e.g. rstan . Once you tried all those and other model-driven approaches and you are not yet satisfied, you could explore those data-driven models like xgboost or random forest , as you have already mentioned. Deep neural networks also fall into this category. Given enough data, they are often very good at predicting but don't give much insight. You mentioned concerns w.r.t. the one-hot encoding for SVM or RF, but I don't see any problems here, this is a plausible approach.
