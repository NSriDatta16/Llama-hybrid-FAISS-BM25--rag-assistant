sklearn SVM really slow

I'm working with sklearn SVM and I have a problem. When I run the method sklearn.SVM.SVC.fit() using a database with only a few features ( 100) it takes just a few seconds. I'm using a polynomial kernel and this problem only appears when the degree is >= 3. And it is also weird that if I use only a few features, but I add 50 features with 0s in all the samples, it works fine! I have tried the following experiments: fit() with all the features and any kernel degree. Works fine. fit() with a few features and kernel degree fit() with a few features and kernel degree >= 3. Very slow. fit() with kernel degree = 3, a few features but adding 50 features with 0s in all the samples. Works fine!! My question is, how can I solve this? Does my trick of adding features with 0s affect the classification?
