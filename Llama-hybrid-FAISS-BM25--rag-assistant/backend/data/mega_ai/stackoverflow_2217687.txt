Magento - Adding to the Layout

I have this section in one of my layout files: This first block shows a post and the second block shows some social bookmarking icons. The problem is the section which displays the post also displays the 'add comments' section. I want to add the social icons between the post and the comments. How can I do this? Ie. add the Social block in the middle of the Post block? Thanks!
