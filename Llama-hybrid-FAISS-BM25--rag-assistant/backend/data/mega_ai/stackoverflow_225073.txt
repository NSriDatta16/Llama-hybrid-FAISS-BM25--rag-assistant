Testing what's written to a Java OutputStream

I am about to write junit tests for a XML parsing Java class that outputs directly to an OutputStream. For example xmlWriter.writeString("foo"); would produce something like foo to be written to the outputstream held inside the XmlWriter instance. The question is how to test this behaviour. One solution would of course be to let the OutputStream be a FileOutputStream and then read the results by opening the written file, but it isn't very elegant.
