Can anyone suggest reasons as to why the default Build Agent would be unavailable in TeamCity?

I'm in the process of setting up a proper CI environment and am currently evaluation TeamCity. (So my TeamCity experience is non-existent.). I've performed a default install of TeamCity 5.0.1 Professional in a clean Windows XP (for now) VM. I've created my project and pointed it to my source repository and queued up a build. However, I don't see any Build Agents installed/available via the Team City web interface. I've checked and there is a 'Team City Build Agent' service installed and it's running. I've also reviewed the log files in the buildAgent folder and don't see anything that would lead me to an error. Is there a step or concept that I'm missing here on getting the default Build Agent to become available to Team City? I'm not trying to do anything complicated with the build. (at this point, I just want to pull my source down from the repository)
