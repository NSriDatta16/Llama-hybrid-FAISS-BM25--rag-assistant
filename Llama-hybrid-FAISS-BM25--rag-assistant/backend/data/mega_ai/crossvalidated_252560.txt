Logistic regression when independent variable has both continuous and categorical data

I'm working on a regression. The dependent variable is binary, and most of my independent variables are continuous, except one. For about 40% of the "age" variable, the data only says "> 5". How in the heck do I treat that? Replace with the mean? Treat age as a dummy variable (really don't want to do this)? Consider it missing (ditto)?
