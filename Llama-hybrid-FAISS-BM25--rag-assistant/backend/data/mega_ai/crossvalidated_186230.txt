Building somewhat on previous answers: Yes, there would. In regression analysis, you suppose that your regressors $X$ are orthogonal to each other. If you consider $IQ$, income, number of years of schooling, race of the parents, you will end up with regressors that are strongly correlated. It will cause your estimates for both $x_1$ and $x_2$ to be imprecisely estimated (large standard errors.) and you may wrongly conclude that they are not significant. For a discussion on the effect of correlated regressors, see this link . Basically, in a choir, it is hard to know who sings what. Possible combinations: sum, average, first principal component of the two (or more) series. You would have to justify your choice here. In the case of years of schooling, you could add both numbers and declare it "parents' education." What exactly do you mean ? No, you can do it with any type of variables. See the example with years of schooling. Be advised that any aggregation of data leads to a loss of information. It is your job as a researcher to weigh the pros and cons of such choice.
