Learning curve on Magento is pretty steep, unfortunately. There was a recent post on the Magento Blog that should be helpful: http://www.magentocommerce.com/blog/introduction-to-magento-dataflow/ As for general Magento learning, Alan Storm has some excellent articles that lay bear the architecture: alanstorm.com/category/magento as well a good post here on Stack Overflow: stackoverflow.com/questions/576908/how-does-magento-code-work On top of this post is an ERD of the database structure: www.magentocommerce.com/boards/viewthread/7359/#top and over here is a diagram of the request flow: www.magentocommerce.com/wiki/doc/magento-architecture Specific questions can sometimes be found on the Magento forums, and the the basic interfaces can be found in the docs at docs.magentocommerce.com . Hope this is helpful. Happy Trails!
