If you want to take into account your intuition that a $16-14$ victory in a best-of-${31}$ match could easily have happened by chance from a probability of winning of about $\frac12$, possibly even less than $\frac12$, you could take a Bayesian approach: start with a sensible prior $\pi_0(p)$ density for the probability $p$ of Player A winning an individual game; update with the $16$ wins from $30$ observations with likelihood proportionate to $p^{16}(1-p)^{14}$ to get a posterior distribution; and use the calculation probability for the next best-of-$31$-games match $\mathbb P (\text{win match}\mid p)= \sum_{i=0}^{15}{15+i \choose 15}p^{16}(1-p)^i = \sum_{j=16}^{31}{31 \choose j}p^{j}(1-p)^{31-j}$ combine these three steps, which (dividing through by constants) will give $$\mathbb P (\text{win match}\mid \text{seen }\tfrac{16}{30}; \pi_0) = \dfrac{\int_0^1 \pi_0(p)\, p^{16} (1-p)^{14} \mathbb P (\text{win match}\mid p) \, dp}{\int_0^1 \pi_0(p)\, p^{16} (1-p)^{14} \, dp}$$ Typical $\pi_0$ priors often used for $p$ are (a) uniform, which would give an estimate of about $0.59567$; (b) Jeffreys, with a density proportional to $\sqrt{\tfrac{1}{p(1-p)}}$, which would give an estimate of about $0.60258$; or (c) improper, with a density notionally proportional to ${\tfrac{1}{p(1-p)}}$, which would give an estimate of about $0.60512$. All of these are close to each other and rather lower than $\mathbb P (\text{win match}\mid p=\frac{16}{30}) \approx 0.646$ and may better fit your intuition But in any case $0.646$ is not a particularly high number: it clearly has to be more than $0.533$ and playing more games increases the change of the better player winning overall. This table shows how with $p=\frac{16}{30}$ the probability changes with the length of the match bestof probwinoverall 1 0.5333333 3 0.5499259 5 0.5623151 7 0.5725935 9 0.5815471 11 0.5895695 13 0.5968908 15 0.6036588 17 0.6099757 19 0.6159151 21 0.6215324 23 0.6268706 25 0.6319637 27 0.6368391 29 0.6415194 31 0.6460237 Considering a higher probability: To have a $95\%$ probability of the better player winning the match where winning each game has an independent probability of $\frac{16}{30}$ would require a best-of-$607$-games match To have a $95\%$ probability of the better player winning a best-of-$31$-games match would require winning each game to have an independent probability of over $0.643427863$
