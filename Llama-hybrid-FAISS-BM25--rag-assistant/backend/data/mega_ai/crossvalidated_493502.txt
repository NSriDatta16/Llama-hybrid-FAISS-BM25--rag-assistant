Find statistic values for linear regression

I have a difficulty understand the solution to my coursework, it was explained to me but I still dont understand it so I hope someone please help me? The question is A clothes shop manager records the weekly sales figures, £ s, and the average weekly temperature, t °C, for 6 weeks during the summer. The sales figures were coded so that w = $\dfrac{s}{1000}$ Statistic given are $S_{ww} = 50$ I need to find value for $S_{ss}$ The solution of this problem is $1000^2 * S_{ww}$ I got that I can isolate s from code above as $s = 1000w$ and I understand that the equation to find $S_{xx}$ but I dont understand why the solution drop w from 1000w and why do I need $S_{ww}$ ? Hope you can explain this to me please Thank you
