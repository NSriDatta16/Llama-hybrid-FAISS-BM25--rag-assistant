As I understand it, you have set of possible values $x \in S$ of size $|S| =N$ . Because of some computational issues, you want to make $N$ much smaller by somehow "ignoring" the values of $x$ that come with small probability $p(x)$ . The simple solution that comes to my mind, is to select subset $S_0$ of the $N_0$ values that come with largest probabilities, and for all the other values assume same probability, that is equal to the average their probabilities. Now your distribution $p_0$ is defined in terms of $N_0+1$ unique probabilities: $$ p_0(x) = \begin{cases} p(x) &\text{if}& x \in S_0 \\ c &\text{if}& x \in S -S_0 \end{cases} $$ where $c=\frac{\sum_{x'\in S -S_0} p(x')}{N-N_0}$ is a constant. This makes $p_0$ exact for the most probable values, and approximate otherwise.
