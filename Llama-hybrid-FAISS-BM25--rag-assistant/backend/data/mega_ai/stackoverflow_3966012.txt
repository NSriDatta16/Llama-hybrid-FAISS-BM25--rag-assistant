Sort Divs every X amount of seconds with JQUERY

I have 5 divs, each having count down timers. The following numbers would obviously be be divided by 's , but for the sake of the example I am trying to be as clear as possible :-) Example before sort 4.39 3.45 2.11 3.56 1.11 Example after sort 4.39 3.56 3.45 2.11 1.11 And each countdown counts to 0 obviously. I had in mind, that when a timer reaches 0, that div is sorted automatically sorted and put down in the last position, and then starts again. I was looking at Jquery's website, and the ones I found are drag related, meaning you have to click on the DIV, and move it yourself. I would like to achieve that animation automatically, by a method that sorts out DIVS according to the timer. Anyone have a code snippet, one which I didn't find already, that I might find handy? :-) All help is greatly appreciated!! Thanks!!
