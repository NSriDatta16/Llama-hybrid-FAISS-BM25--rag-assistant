A series is not automatically non-stationary if it has a seasonal pattern. For example, Rob Hyndman shows that a cyclic pattern may exist that makes it unpredictable. There is also a good explanation on towarddatascience.com on that topic. Instead of directly performing the ADF test I would first consider ACF/PACF plots to see if a single series may be stationary or not, that normally clears out a lot of questions. The correlogram is the first plot to be conducted to get a first glance. Normally this is the starting point in checking if you need additional tests. See here (you have a lot of scrolling to do). However, I believe there is no harm on using the ADF on a non transformed series, because you should already have insights from your ACF. If you don't have any insights, well I once developed a genetic algorithm which fits on a VAR/VECM in R. These approaches normally need a unified level of variables in the model. Thus if there is one variable that is stationary and one that is not, you should log transform and difference all variables, or difference them a second time, you need a unified level. This is also a sign for me in no harm, as we try to measure before and after logging and differencing with the ADF. In addition, believe in Stata it is also one of the first tests conducted on non transformed variables before the KPSS as this comes after the ADF: If your original variable already has a unit root, then it is non stationary. In the end you want to look at the real data. Further, what if we try to handle the seasonality within the unit root test. For example, in ADF test, we include seasonal dummies (just like we include a trend variable to handle deterministic trend)?. But even if this is correct, we wouldn't have the right critical values for it, right? It is possible to do seasonal differencing, search for it with the tag: Rob Hyndman, the master of time series ;-) I do not believe you do it with dummies, you do seasonal differencing and then you can normally interpret ADF.
