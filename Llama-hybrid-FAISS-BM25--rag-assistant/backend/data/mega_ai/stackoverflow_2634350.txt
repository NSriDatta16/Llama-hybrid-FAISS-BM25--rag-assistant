One of the most important uses of inner classes in Java are listeners. Instead of writing an entire separate class for an ActionListener or similar, you create it in-place: button.addActionListener(new ActionListener() { public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) { ... your code here ... } } These inner classes typically call functions in the outer class (they capture a pointer to the object they were created in), and lead to much tidier code than having a single callback with some logic that has to figure out which button etc. was clicked. You also don't have to modify code in several places when you add or remove a button, since the inner class is created where you create the button. It's quite elegant.
