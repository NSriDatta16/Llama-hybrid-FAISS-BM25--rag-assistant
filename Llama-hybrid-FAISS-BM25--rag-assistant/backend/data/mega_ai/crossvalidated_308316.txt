Orthogonal linear combinations of x that have highest correlation with y

I am reading about canonical correlation analysis (CCA), and I understand that it is a technique to find linear combinations of a set of variables X that have the highest correlations with linear combinations of variables Y such that the canonical weight vectors are all orthogonal to each other. If I have only one variable in the set Y, however, I can only come up with one canonical vector. Is there a related technique for finding multiple linear combinations (i.e. rotations) of a set of X's such that they are orthogonal to each other and such that they "maximize" the correlation between X and Y? I am trying to use this as a dimensionality reduction technique for visualizing a highly nonlinear multidimensional mapping from $\mathbb{R}^D$ to $\mathbb{R}$, where $D > 2$. My goal is to choose 2 "optimal" linear combinations of the $D$ X's so that I can generate a three-dimensional visualization, in which the first two axes are the new X's and the third axis is Y.
