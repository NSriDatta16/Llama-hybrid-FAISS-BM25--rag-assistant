Regression points and regression table on bayesian model

I used bas.lm() function to build a bayesian model in R, but when it comes to run the get_regression_table(model) and get_regression_points(model) , it says "Only simple and multiple linear regression models are supported. Try again using lm for your models as appropriate". I have a linear model in the form of $y=a+b_i X_i$ , my variables are counted in rates (values from 0 to 1). What should i do? my code is: model my data are: https://i.stack.imgur.com/wFTRV.png
