Try: CategoryType animalType = (CategoryType)Enum.Parse(typeof(CategoryType), pCategory); When you need the type of something you know statically (at compile time), use the typeof operator. The GetType method is meant for runtime type information in cases of polymorphism (in which case you'd do something like pCategory.GetType ). Lastly note that Enum.Parse can throw - So you might want to take a look at Enum.TryParse .
