UIViewController subclass not receiving touchesBegan iphone ipad

So I subclassed UIViewController and in the nib I have a UIView, and in it a tableview. It is my understanding that both UIViewController and UIView are subclasses of UIResponder, so they should receive the - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event method. However, this is not the case, and my view controller subclass is not receiving that method. I'd really like to not subclass the UIView, if that's allright. I am trying to implement this , but my - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { [textfield resignFirstResponder]; } Is not getting called.
