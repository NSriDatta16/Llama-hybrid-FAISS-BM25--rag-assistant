I'd go with your first option. These are in-memory objects so the computation on what you're doing is going to be extremely fast. Further, if you created a dedicated property for this (e.g., average_count) then you're going to have to add more code to re-calculate this in the setter for both the time and the count. As a side note (since you're asking about best practice), you should be using Pascal casing in C# which is initial caps and no underscores.
