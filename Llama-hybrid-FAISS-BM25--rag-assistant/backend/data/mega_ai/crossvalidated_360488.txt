Using the average implicitly rescales $\lambda$. This means that choosing the average or the sum isn't really consequential, because whatever the optimal $\lambda$ is on the mean scale has an equivalent choice of $\lambda$ on the sum scale, and vice versa. $$ \begin{align} \lambda \sum_i w_i^2 &= \lambda\sum_iw_i^2 \\ &= {n\lambda} \left[\frac{1}{n}\sum_iw_i^2 \right]\\ \end{align} $$
