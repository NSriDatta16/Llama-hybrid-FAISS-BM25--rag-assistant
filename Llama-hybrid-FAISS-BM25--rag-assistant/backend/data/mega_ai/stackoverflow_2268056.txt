I don't see why you couldn't handle touches in your game loop. Just record the touch events to a data structure (a list or something) in the views touch handlers. Then in the game loop just process what ever events have been recorded to the data structure. Just make sure that only one thread changes the data structure at a time. You don't even need to record the events if more simplified data is enough in the game loop. In simple cases you could just update variables like touchX, touchY and touchState (none, began, moved, ended) in the touch handlers and read these variables in the game loop. In this case you may want to make sure that the game loop can react to to both began and ended events in a sensible way. Ie. began and ended states should always last for exactly one tick.
