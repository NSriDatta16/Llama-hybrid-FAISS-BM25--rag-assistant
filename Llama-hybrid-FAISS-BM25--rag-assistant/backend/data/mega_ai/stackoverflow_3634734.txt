I take a pragmatic approach for deployment merge+minimise core application scripts (aka the global components), and then merge+minimise the per-section or per-page scripts (the local components). This leaves you with typically two or three scripts to download not including your JS library (read: jquery). You rarely want to dump everything on one big file of death because it's generally unlikely that your visitor is going to visit every page and need every bit of code in their, so it's false economy to think that giving them everything in one hit is faster than giving them what they need in a few distributed hits, especially when you consider the downloading executing profile of scripts (i.e. blocking). And I hope it goes without saying that you do all of this for deployment only . Always, always do your dev with modular scripts, let the build process handle the merge.
