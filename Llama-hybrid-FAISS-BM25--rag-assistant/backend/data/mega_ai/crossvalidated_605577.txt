How is ETS method equivalent to the MEAN method when $\alpha$ =0?

I am learning time series analysis from Forecasting: Principles and Practice by Hyndman & Athanasopoulos. In chapter 8 , the ETS (Error, Trend, Seasonality - a state space implementation of Exponential Smoothing) model is written as $$\hat{y}_{T+1|T} = \alpha y_T + \alpha(1-\alpha) y_{T-1} + \alpha(1-\alpha)^2 y_{T-2}+ \cdots$$ where $\alpha$ is a smoothing parameter that takes the value between 0 and 1. When this $\alpha$ is 1 the ETS is equivalent to the NAIVE method and when this parameter takes on the value of 0, the ETS is equivalent to the MEAN method. While I understand how ETS = NAIVE method when the value of $\alpha$ is 1, I fail to fully understand how this method becomes equivalent to the MEAN when $\alpha$ takes on the value of 0. There is explanation for why this is, in the given chapter but I find it a bit tricky to understand. I would appreciate it if someone could explain how come when $\alpha$ =0, the ETS method is equivalent to the MEAN method.
