I think that the error is not in the design. Is not in the EF. Is in Sql Server relations. Read the EF message: The relationship 'FK_Order_Customer' uses the set of foreign keys '{CustomerId, CompanyId}' that are partially contained in the set of primary keys '{OrderId, CompanyId}' of the table 'Order'. The set of foreign keys must be fully contained in the set of primary keys, or fully not contained in the set of primary keys to be mapped to a model. ERROR Actualy the relation betwen Order and Customer use only one field (probably you dragged with the mouse the field "CustomerId" from teh Order table to the "Id" of the Customer table) SOLUTION Right click on the wire that connect Order and Customer and in the relation add also the CompanyId PS: The design is correct. Putting the CompanyId in each table is rith solution in multi-tenant architecture because help to scale (usualy always want to select only records from the loggedIn company).
