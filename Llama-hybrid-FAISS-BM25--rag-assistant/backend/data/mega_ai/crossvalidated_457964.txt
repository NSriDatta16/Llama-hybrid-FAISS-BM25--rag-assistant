Time Series Forecasting with (week)day data in R

I was hoping to ask this community for a little advice. I’m doing a bit of daily forecasting, and, because it has always served me so well, I’m using Prof. Hyndman's now famous 'forecast' package. At a high level, I’m simply feeding auto.arima a timeseries object of frequency 5 (I’m only using business days), along with 2 columns of simple exogenous regressors—a dummy variable for “Holiday” and a dummy variable for “last business day of the month”. For most of my product forecasts, this works quite well, but for the odd product or two, I’m not quite satisfied with the model output. My questions, then are: 1. Do you think that I should add additional dummy variables for things like “Monday” or “Tuesday after a holiday” or perhaps every day of the week (save one)? I’m worried about overfitting, but I’m also worried about the seasonal AR/MA terms getting confused by situations where Mondays are either higher than the average weekday or zero (in the case of a holiday) 2. I only have 9 months or so of data…do you think I should try to add additional seasonality to the model, or wait until I have a full year?
