How to cache an HTTP POST response?

I would like to create a cacheable HTTP response for a POST request. My actual implementation responds the following for the POST request: HTTP/1.1 201 Created Expires: Sat, 03 Oct 2020 15:33:00 GMT Cache-Control: private,max-age=315360000,no-transform Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8 Content-Length: 9 ETag: 2120507660800737950 Last-Modified: Wed, 06 Oct 2010 15:33:00 GMT ......... But it looks like that the browsers (Safari, Firefox tested) are not caching the response. In the HTTP RFC the corresponding part says: Responses to this method are not cacheable unless the response includes appropriate Cache-Control or Expires header fields. However, the 303 (See Other) response can be used to direct the user agent to retrieve a cacheable resource. So I think it should be cached. I know I could set a session variable and set a cookie and do a 303 redirect, but I want to cache the response of the POST request. Is there any way to do this? P.S.: I've started with a simple 200 OK , so it does not work.
