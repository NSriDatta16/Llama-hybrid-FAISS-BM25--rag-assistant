A couple places come to mind: 1) PASS (Professional Organization for SQL Server) has a yearly conference with the best content you can get on SQL Server. You have to register (for free), but you can watch old recorded sessions there. http://www.sqlpass.org/LearningCenter/SummitOnDemand.aspx 2) Microsoft does free SQL 08 webcasts from some of the best SQL trainers (like Kim Tripp). You need a Windows Live account: http://www.microsoft.com/events/series/technetsqlserver2008.aspx?tab=webcasts&id=42572 Those are 2 places I would go for webcasts.
