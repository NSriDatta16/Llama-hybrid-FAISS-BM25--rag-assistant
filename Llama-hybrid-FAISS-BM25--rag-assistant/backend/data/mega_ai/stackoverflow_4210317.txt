Thanks for the answer! I think I found a solution for listing all the activities in an application too, not the most elegant though... //the method gets all activities for an application private void getAppActivities() { PackageManager pManager = getPackageManager(); Intent startIntent = setStartIntent(); List apps = pManager.queryIntentActivities(startIntent, 0); int count = apps.size(); for (int i = 0; i activities = pManager.queryIntentActivities(intent, 0); } }
