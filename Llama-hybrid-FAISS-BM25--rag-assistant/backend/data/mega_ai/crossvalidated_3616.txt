What is the best statistical test for a time series?

I have a simple time series with 5-10 data points per data set at regular intervals. I am wondering what is the best way to determine whether two data sets are different. Should i try t-tests on each data point, or look at the area under the curves or is there some kind of multivariate model that would work better?
