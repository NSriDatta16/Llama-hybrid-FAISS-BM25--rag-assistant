You're attempting to train the network to give output values 1,2,3,4 as far as I understood. Yet, at the output you use a sigmoid ( math.tanh(..) ) whose values are always between -1 and 1. So the output of your Neural network is always between -1 and 1 and thus you always get a large error when trying to fit output values outside that range. (I just checked that when scaling your input and output values by 0.1, there seems to be a nice training progress and I get at the end: error 0.00025 ) The Neural Network you're using is useful if you want to do classification (e.g. assign the data point to class A if the NN output is 0). It looks like what you want to do is regression (fit a real-valued function). You can remove the sigmoid at the output node but you will have to slightly modify your backpropagation procedure to take this into account.
