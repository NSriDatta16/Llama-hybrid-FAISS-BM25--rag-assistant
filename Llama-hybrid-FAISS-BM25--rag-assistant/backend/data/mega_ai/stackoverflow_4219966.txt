Magento - add percentage on top of calculated price

not sure if anyone can help with this? We need to add a percentage on top of a calculated price and not the base price. e.g. Base Price = £10 Selection 1 Option 1 + £10 Option 2 + £20 Selection 2 Option 1 + 10% Option 2 + 20% We need to calculate baseprice + (option 1 from selection 1) and then on top of that subtotal we need to add (option 1 from selection 2) to that subtotal price and NOT the baseprice. Is this at all possible as from what we’ve seen so far all percentages are worked out on the baseprice and not subtotal.
