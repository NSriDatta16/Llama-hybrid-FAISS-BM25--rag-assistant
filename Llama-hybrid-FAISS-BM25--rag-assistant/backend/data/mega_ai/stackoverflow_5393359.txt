Which screen size / density combinations should I support for bitmap background image?

I'm writing an application where I will need a number of full screen bitmap backgrounds. Based on my naive reading of Supporting Multiple Screens in the Android documentation, to cover all my bases I should probably have 16 versions of each bitmap: all pairs of [ small, normal, large, xlarge ] and [ ldpi, mdpi, hdpi, xhdpi ] . This should reduce the work the CPU has to do for scaling the images, but will come at great storage cost. However, this seems wildly inefficient for two reasons: Not all of these combinations are found in practice. As I'm just rendering vector art for each physical size (without respect for DPI), pairs like large/mdpi and normal/hdpi (which are both ~ 480x854 pixels) are duplicate files. So, should I just provide really large images and let the system scale them down? Bite the bullet and provide a lot of duplicate images? Avoid the issue altogether and cobble some code solution with raw resources? Any other ideas? Thanks. EDIT: Apparently you can create XML bitmap drawables which alias an actual bitmap. That solves the second inefficiency argument. Still, I wonder, what combinations of these do others provide in practice?
