For a new project I would strongly recommend the slf4j project which provides generic frontend to several logger frameworks. The {}-syntax described by Steve B is present in slf4j too (same author) so you get all the benefits regardless of backend, and STILL get the backend independency. Also a log4j bridge is available so existing code transparently can use slf4j. It is really nice. For actual backend, logback is nice but you may already have invested in log4j - this is easily leveragable.
