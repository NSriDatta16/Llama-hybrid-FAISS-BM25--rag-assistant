People have been routinely incorporting nonlinear relationships in binary, ordinal, and polytomous logistic regression since the early 1980s using regression splines. It is not a good idea to use some statistical test to screen the model (which distorts operating characteristics). It's a better idea to pre-specify which continuous predictors are not known to act linearly, and to allow them to be nonlinear. This will result in valid compatibility intervals and p-values. I cover this in detail in RMS .
