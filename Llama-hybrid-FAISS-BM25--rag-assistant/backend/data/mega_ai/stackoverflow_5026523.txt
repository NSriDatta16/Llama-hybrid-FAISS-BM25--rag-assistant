Yes, you can definitely write your own optical character recognition (OCR) software. It's robustness depends entirely on the effort you put into it. For example, recognizing characters of an exact size and font could be as simple as region matching against known character shapes; more general strategies might require some sort of statistical matching or even machine learning techniques. OCR is still an active area of research at top-tier computer science universities and institutions (e.g. Google), so don't expect to find any quick-and-easy solutions.
