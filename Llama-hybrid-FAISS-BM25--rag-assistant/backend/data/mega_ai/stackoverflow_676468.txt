I divide JS files by its functionality. Most common functions that used almost everywhere go to one file, Other classes and methods go to their own files. For CSS, I have one common file for the whole site. If I have sections that are visually different than others, I separate CSS files to per section. Also, I have a tabbed div control, it has a separate CSS file. I do not mix the files. For components, embedding resources look good, but sometimes it's good to fix bugs with only deploying JS files.
