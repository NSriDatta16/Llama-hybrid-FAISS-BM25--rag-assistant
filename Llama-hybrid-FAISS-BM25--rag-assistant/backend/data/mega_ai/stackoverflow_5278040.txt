Java join collections using functor

2 collections are given with the same number of elements, say List . What are elegant ways in JAVA to apply a functor on each 2 elements of collections with corresponding indexes? Say, one example could be: List = { "APPLE", "PEAR" }; List = { "BANANA", "ORANGE" }; A predicate that joins string together will result in the following List : List = { "APPLEBANANA", "PEARORANGE" };
