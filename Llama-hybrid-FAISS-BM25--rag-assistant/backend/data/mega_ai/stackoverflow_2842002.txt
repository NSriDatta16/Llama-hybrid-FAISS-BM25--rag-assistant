It's worth looking at the B Method ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-Method ). It's a slightly more pragmatic descendent of Z. The idea is that you can actually discharge a bunch of proof obligations through refinements steps (with the help of a theorem prover that is hiding behind the scenes) and then eventually generate code directly from your specification. I believe it has been used in a number of "real world" projects.
