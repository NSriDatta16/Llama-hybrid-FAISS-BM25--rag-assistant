In a case-crossover study, the referent time periods are randomly sampled from the person-time at risk of each individual. Therefore, the odds ratio in a case-crossover estimates the incidence density ratio that would have been obtained in a cohort study - it is just an efficient sampling scheme, similar to an incidence density or risk set sampled case-control study, albeit one that doesn't require any reference people and automatically accounts for between-person confounding and within-person non-time-varying confounding. So, when you use conditional logistic regression your $\beta$ estimates are odds ratios which are in turn estimates of the incidence density ratios, which is what the $\beta$ parameters of your Poisson time-series are.
