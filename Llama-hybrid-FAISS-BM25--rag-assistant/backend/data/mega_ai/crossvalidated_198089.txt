The advantages of using MAE instead of MSE are explained in Davydenko and Fildes (2016) , see Section 3.1: ...Some authors (e.g., Zellner, 1986) argue that the criterion by which we evaluate forecasts should correspond to the criterion by which we optimise forecasts. In other words, if we optimise estimates using some given loss function, we must use the same loss function for empirical evaluation in order to find out which model is better. Fitting a statistical model usually delivers forecasts optimal under quadratic loss. This, e.g., happens when we fit a linear regression. If our density forecast from statistical modelling is symmetric, then forecasts optimal under quadratic loss are also optimal under linear loss. But, if we stabilise the variance by log-transformations and then transform back forecasts by exponentiation, we get forecasts optimal only under linear loss. If we use another loss, we must first obtain the density forecast using a statistical model, and then adjust our estimate given our specific loss function (see examples of doing this in Goodwin, 2000). Letâ€™s assume we want to empirically compare two methods and find out which method is better in terms of a symmetric linear loss (since this type of loss is commonly used in modelling). If we have only one time series, it seems natural to use a mean absolute error (MAE). Also, MAE is attractive as it is simple to understand and calculate (Hyndman, 2006)...
