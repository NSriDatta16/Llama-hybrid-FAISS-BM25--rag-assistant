When do we do sensitivity analysis in biostat and how do we do it?

I have two questions below. I have seen people doing sensitivity analysis in observational study papers for the model to check sensitivity to assumptions in bayesian context for selection of priors. I am not sure what is exactly sensitivity analysis as it has not popped up in the books I have read other than those involving bayesian methods. Strangely, I was never formally taught anything on sensitivity analysis. When should one perform sensitivity analysis? Is there any good theoretic and applied book on sensitivity analysis? How should one do sensitivity analysis in biostat in general?
