I've found the problem... Even though I was using the AssemblyResolve method to load the dlls at runtime, this wasn't enough. Putting the DLLs in the "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office12" folder (along with MSAccess.exe) solved the problem. Now I just need to come up with a more elegant solution than that...
