Yahoo Movies API Documentation

I'm trying to use the new unpublished Yahoo Movies API, but can't find any documentation, official or unofficial, about it. Does anyone know if any documentation exists for this? sample API call: http://new.api.movies.yahoo.com/v2/listMovies?title=Transformers EDIT: The API can no longer be accessed. I'm not sure what Yahoo's plans are with this API. Any info would help.
