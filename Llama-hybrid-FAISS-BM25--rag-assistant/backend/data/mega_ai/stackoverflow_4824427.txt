If the user has iOS 4.2+, you can use AirPrint, which is part of the iOS SDK. You can also detect at runtime if it's available with code like this: Class printControllerClass = NSClassFromString(@"UIPrintInteractionController"); if (printControllerClass) { [self setupCanPrintUI]; } else { [self setupCannotPrintUI]; } That way your app can still work on previous iOS versions, although it won't be able to print from them. If you draw a long string (such as the entire contents of a text file) into a graphics context and put that into a PDF data format, you can print it. Check out Apple's docs on UIPrintInteractionController and this blog post for more details.
