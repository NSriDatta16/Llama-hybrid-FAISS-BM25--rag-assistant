Adding a WCF reference to a j2me project

I have a wcf serivce I want to consume from a j2me application (blackberry). I have been going crazy since the tools that work fine for the j2SE used for consuming web services do not work all that well for j2me. At least not with my service. I found a useful tutorial at http://www.netbeans.org/kb/60/mobility/mobile-dilbert.html While it uses an old asmx service style to explain it. I was able to follow the steps and use my wcf reference and I was able to make the connection. The drawback, this solution uses a j2ee proxy to get the reference to work. Is this the way to solve the incompatibilities between .net and java? I read that a big reason why this happens is that Microsoft generates non-standard wsdl files for services. My question is: is this the solution generally used for consuming .net web services from java, or is there a better way? Any reference pointers will be greatly appreciated.
