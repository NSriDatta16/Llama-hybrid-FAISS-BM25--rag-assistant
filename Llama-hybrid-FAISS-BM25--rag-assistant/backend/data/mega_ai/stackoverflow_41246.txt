When doing a reorg of an index, if the index is spread across two or more physical files the data will only be defragged within the data file. Pages are not moved from one data file to another. When the index is in a single file the reorg and reindex will have the same end result. Some times the reorg will be faster, and some times the reindex will be faster depending on how fragmented the index is. The less fragmented the index then a reorg will be faster, the more fragmented the slower the reorg will be, but the faster a reindex will be.
