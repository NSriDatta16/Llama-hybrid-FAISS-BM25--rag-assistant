Well there are several approaches to this: You could use the data as is and simply try different time series models as you already did. You could also try a random forest or gradient bossted trees but I think the number of observations is to low for them to produce good results.Still, whether a method works well or not can only be answered empirically. Thus, just go for it ( I would recommend to use the caret package) Another approach would be to change the target variables and to generate a dummy indicating whether demand increased or decreased. You can again use any model that can handle a binary target variable (regression/logistic regression/tree based method/naive bayes and so on) Moreover, I would suggest that you should spend some time on feature engeneering. You can easily add holidays...time before/after holidays and so on. You can use any expert knowledge or simply common sense to come with new features. I hope this helps.
