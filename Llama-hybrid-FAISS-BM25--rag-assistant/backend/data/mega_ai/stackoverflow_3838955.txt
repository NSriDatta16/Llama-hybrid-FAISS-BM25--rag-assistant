This may sound cheap but I think I have a answer for you in this questions thread: svn folder structure organization As long as you stay within your own repository I wouldnt consider svn:externals as harmful as stated. Just don't overdo it. Deployment with this strategy is also a piece of cake since it is ALL in one tag (checkout, run it, profit). Your directory structure remains the same on all layers, branches, tags, trunk. By directing externals to tags (and making tags read-only on the svn server) you can be 100% sure you get the library you expect.
