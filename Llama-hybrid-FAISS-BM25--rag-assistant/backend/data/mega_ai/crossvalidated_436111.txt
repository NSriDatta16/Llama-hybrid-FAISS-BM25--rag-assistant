In biostatistics, time-dependent responses are often inspected in terms of the area under the curve. This is not to be confused to be the AUC of the ROC which is a classification metric. For instance, in an oral glucose challenge, blood is drawn hourly to see the glucose concentration over a period of time. Because diabetes and its complications are caused by cumulative concentration of blood sugar, the AUC of 2hOGTT blood sugar describes how effectively the body produces insulin. https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Comparison-of-the-area-under-the-curve-AUC-values-of-blood-glucose-levels-obtained-from_fig1_273472980 Here the AUC reduces an overly complex question into a simple one: does the intervention reduce the time-averaged risk in one group versus another? In doing this, we are able to exonerate ourselves from making strong and possibly incorrect assumptions about the dependence structure. With imbalanced data, the curves can be estimated using splines over a reasonable range (restricted mean). For instance, if the curve in Group A does not "peak" as largely as that in Group B, but remains elevated over a long period of time, none of the modeling approaches proposed above will correctly estimate the standard deviation of the conditional response, and yet AUC simply addresses why Group B might be preferred (a less sustained response).
