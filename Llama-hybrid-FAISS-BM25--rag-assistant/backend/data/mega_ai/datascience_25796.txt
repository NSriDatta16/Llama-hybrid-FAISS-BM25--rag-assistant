Yes. It can be. For reinforcement learning you need States, Actions and Rewards to run a reinforcement algorithm on a situation. States are seats, Actions are moving a person from a seat to another seat, and Rewards are born from specified rules. For example, moving a baby to a windows seat could have $-\infty$ reward (or you can prevent to do this action and exclude it from the possible action).
