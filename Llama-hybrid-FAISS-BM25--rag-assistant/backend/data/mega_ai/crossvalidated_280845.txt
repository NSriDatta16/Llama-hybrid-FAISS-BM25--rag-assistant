Why is selection of one amongst the group of highly correlated variables by lasso is stated as its disadvantage?

I have seen PCA being used to eliminate variables for dimensionality reduction, but LASSO's ability to eliminate variables for the very same purpose is often described as a disadvantage. My intuition is that in PCA we still retain some of the information in the reduced dimensions as the newly formed features are linear combinations of the old variables, whereas in LASSO we just completely drop some of the original variables by setting the coefficients of non selected features to zero. Is my intuition correct? If not, then why is dimensionality reduction a drawback in one scenario and an advantage in the other?
