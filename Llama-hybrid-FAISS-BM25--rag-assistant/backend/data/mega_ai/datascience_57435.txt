How is the cross-product transformation defined for binary features?

I am reading the paper on Wide & Deep learning and for the wide component, it states that one of the most important transformations is the cross-product transformation. This is defined as follows: $$\phi_{k}(\mathbf{x})=\prod_{i=1}^{d} x_{i}^{c_{k i}} \quad c_{k i} \in\{0,1\}$$ Then, the authors argue that for binary features, a cross-product transformation (e.g., “AND(gender=female, language=en)”) is 1 if and only if the constituent features (“gender=female” and “language=en”) are all 1, and 0 otherwise. But how does this relate to the given formula? And how can I think of the cross-product transformation in general?
