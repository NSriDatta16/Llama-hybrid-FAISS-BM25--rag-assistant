That's a matter of your project politics. Either and Both have their respective places. If you feel open and friendly, use $_REQUEST . If you feel fascist, allow only what you expect. If you feel hacky, use both and differentiate, say allow to preserve semi-persistent config by encoding it in GET and encouraging to bookmark the page, while filling POST with strictly volatile stuff. One reason why you might really, really want to disallow GET is password fields and the like. You don't want your users to (unknowingly) store their sensitive data in browser history, so don't encourage them to do so by allowing GET. OTOH, you can "GET" from a plain so if you export any APIs for "anyone to use", provide either GET alone or both.
