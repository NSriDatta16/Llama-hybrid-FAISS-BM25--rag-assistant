Chow test or not?

I am trying to set up an automatic screen to detect structural breaks in large numbers of time series. The time series are weekly and represent behaviour of customers. I have set up a Chow test. I use the most recent 4 weeks and compare it to the preceding 22. I want to know if their recent behaviour has significantly diverged from the preceding behaviour. My question is this: Is the Chow Test the most appropriate test for this question? If this is not the most appropriate test how can I determine what test is the most appropriate one?
