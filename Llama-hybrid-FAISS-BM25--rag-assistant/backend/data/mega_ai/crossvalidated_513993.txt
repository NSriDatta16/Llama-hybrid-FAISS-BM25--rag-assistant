Your question is vague. LDA models you have suggest to me you are modeling topics. Topics is distribution over words that are present in text where relevant words do have higher probability. These topics are common for all text and should be $z$ . It is important to distinguish LDA from a simple Dirichlet multinomial clustering model. It is because LDA can do many things: Dimensionality reduction for document representation Search for similar documents in the corpus Document clustering Generation of coherent texts on particular topic Well you can do LDA with Dirichlet multinomial clustering in which case you will be using this Dirichlet prior. $p(\theta)=\operatorname{Dir}(\theta \mid \alpha)=\frac{1}{B(\alpha)} \prod_{k=1}^{K} \theta_{k}^{\alpha_{k}-1}$
