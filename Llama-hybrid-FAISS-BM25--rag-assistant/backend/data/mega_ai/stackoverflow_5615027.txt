Check which resource directory your drawable/icon is in. Android 1.5 doesn't support multiple screen dpi resolutions. Android 1.5 only looks for application icons in the resource directory res/drawable. If you are seeing the icon in 1.6, but not 1.5, my guess is that you have the icon in a resolution-specific directory, such as res/drawable-mdpi. Try making a second copy of the icon in res/drawable/icon.png.
