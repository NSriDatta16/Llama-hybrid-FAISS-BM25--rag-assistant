Can we calculate AUC for deep learning based regression task

There is a paper [ref.attaced ] , where they used a deep learning based regression and evaluated using mse and AUC. The targets are continuous values such as 1,2,3 up to 16 and has been normalized before training. Is it possible to calculate the AUC for regression task.?
