looking for classification algorithm that maximize good results

We are looking for statistic / machine learning algorithm that will yield the “best” results for the following supervised classification scenario We have a sample of around 300 rows, each row with 55 parameters and a result that can be either 1 or -1 - binary classification We want to maximize the number good results minus number bad results and we don't need to classify all the samples. For example, an algorithm that classify correctly 20 good results and 0 bad results is better than algorithm that classify 100 good results and 90 bad results Already try various machine learning algorithm without success, probably due to the fact that there are only 300 rows in the sample. Logistic regression yield good results in training but bad results for the testing here is a sample file https://gist.github.com/shasho/8354d8fc22ad78b163f64f4ff32718ef
