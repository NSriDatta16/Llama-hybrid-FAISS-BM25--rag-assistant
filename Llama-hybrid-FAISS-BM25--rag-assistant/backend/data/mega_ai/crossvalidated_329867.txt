What is meant by the distribution of an image dataset?

In the context of image-based deep learning methods, a reference is often made to the distribution of a dataset without explicitly defining the random variable. I'd like to check if my interpretation of the distribution of an image dataset is correct. Assuming a dataset of grayscale images with width w and height h , I think it makes most sense if the images in the dataset form a subset of the sample space of all the possible images, each image is a sample outcome and a multivariate random variable is defined such that it assigns a w*h dimensional vector to each image where elements correspond to pixel values in the image. Is this correct?
