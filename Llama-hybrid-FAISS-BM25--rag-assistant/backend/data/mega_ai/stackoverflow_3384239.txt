Javascript does in fact support getters and setters now. John Resig has a good blog post about them here . John's article does a good job at mentioning several different ways of defining getters/setters on Javascript objects, but doesn't do a good job at describing when each method is applicable. I believe that is much more effectively accomplished in a more recent blog post by Robert Nyman: Getters and setters with JavaScript (this article also introduces the ECMAScript Standard Object.defineProperty )
