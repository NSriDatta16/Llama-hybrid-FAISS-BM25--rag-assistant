If you wanted to write your own, one obvious solution would be to break your record set into fixed number-of-points chunks, for which the value would be the average (mean, median, ... pick one). This has the probable advantage of being the fastest, and shows overall trends. But it lacks the drama of price ticks. A better solution would probably involve looking for the inflection points, then selecting among them using sliding windows. This has the advantage of better displaying the actual events of the day, but will be slower.
