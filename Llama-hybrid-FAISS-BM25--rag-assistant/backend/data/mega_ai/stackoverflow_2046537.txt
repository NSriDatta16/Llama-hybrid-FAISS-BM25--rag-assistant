How to make UITableView(Controller) catch multitouch events?

I have a subclass of UITableViewController that works as expected. I'd like to capture multitouch events for the whole table to do something with them. The way I understand it, I should make the tableView of the controller be a subclass of UITableView. In that class I could capture the touchesMoved etc events. But I also understand that UITableView is a subclass of UIScrollView which hijacks all the touch events so that I never see them. So, is there some way to still get to those multitouch events for my table? Specifically I'd like to implement something like two-finger pinch/zoom and one-finger horizontal dragging. Since those touch events are all passed to table cells, perhaps I should do this at table cell level? The only question there is, is this compatible with multitouch? (So that I can aggregate events from different cells as multitouch events and process those...) EDIT: tried with cells and was able to see some horizontal events. All the vertical events, though, are completely hijacked by the UIScrollView as table scrolls. I wouldn't want to hack this if there's any way at all to make the UIScrollView un-hijack these events...
