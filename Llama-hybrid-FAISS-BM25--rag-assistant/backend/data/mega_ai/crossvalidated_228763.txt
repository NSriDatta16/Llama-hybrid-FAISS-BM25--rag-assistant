Regularization methods for logistic regression

Regularization using methods such as Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet is quite common for linear regression. I wanted to know the following: Are these methods applicable for logistic regression? If so, are there any differences in the way they need to be used for logistic regression? If these methods are not applicable, how does one regularize a logistic regression?
