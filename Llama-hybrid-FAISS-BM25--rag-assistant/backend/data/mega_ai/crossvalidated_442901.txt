Cox regression vs logistic/simple regression

I understand cox regression is used to calculate a risk ratio while logistic regression calculates an odds ratio. Does that mean that in retrospective cohorts I would use cox regression while in prospective cohorts I would use a logistic/simple regression? Thank you
