What is the correct way to do this using TDD principles?

I'm new to TDD, and I'm trying to learn the right way to do things. So I have to make a javascript class for a web browser extension that stores the user's information to HTML5's localStorage (I'll call this class UserInfoStorage ). However, I want to make my extension cross-browser compatible, and the way to interact with localStorage is different across the browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari). Should I make another class called Storage that is specific for each browser and have UserInfoStorage use this to store stuff to localStorage ? How would I unit-test this without tying the test for UserInfoStorage to the implementation of Storage ? Thanks!
