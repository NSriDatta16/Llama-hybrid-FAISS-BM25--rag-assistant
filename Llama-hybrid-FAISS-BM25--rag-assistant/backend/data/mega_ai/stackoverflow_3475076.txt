Retrieve the fragment (hash) from a URL and inject the values into the bean

I am looking for a way to inject values from the fragment (#) of a URL into bean(JSF), in the same way query-parameter values are injected. I am using Ben Alman's Bookmarkable jQuery plugin ( http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-bbq-plugin/ ) to create the URL fragments. I was hoping that Custom regex patterns from prettyFaces could be a way to solve my problem but until now I have been unsuccessful. ( http://ocpsoft.com/docs/prettyfaces/snapshot/en-US/html_single/#config.pathparams.regext ) I would like to define here my situation and if any one has an idea, i would love to try them out. I am using RichFaces: 3.3.3, Spring: 3.0.2.RELEASE, Hibernate: 3.5.3-Final, JSF: 2.0.2-FCS, PrettyFaces: 3.0.1 The web application generates, following kind of URL where parameters are listed after a hash(#). The idea is to have an ajax based Bookmarkable URL. So every time I click on an element that changes the state of the system, the value is sent to the server via ajax and the URL after the hash is rewritten. There can be 1 to 3 parameters after the hash, the number of parameters are optional. My goal is, when the user bookmarks the URL (with hash) and than revisits the saved page, the page should inject the correct values into the system and visualize the page in the previous state (like query-parameter). Below, I have a regular expression that would catch all the parameters after the hash. //URL: http://localhost:8080/nymphaea/workspace/#node=b48dd073-145c-4eb6-9ae0-e1d8ba90303c&lod=75e63fcd-f94a-49f5-b0a7-69f34d4e63d7&ln=en //Regular Expression: \#(\w*\=(\w{8}-\w{4}-\w{4}-\w{4}-\w{12}))|\&(\w*\=(\w{8}-\w{4}-\w{4}-\w{4}-\w{12}))|\&(\w*\=\w{2}) I know there are websites that some how send the URL fragment into there server side logic, http://maps.yahoo.com/#mvt=m&lat=36.952736&lon=-95.84758&zoom=11&tt=starbucks&tp=1&ioride=us http://www.cbc.ca/video/#/Shows/Death_Comes_to_Town/ID=1365210427 Is there anyway to inject values from the URL fragments into server side beans?
