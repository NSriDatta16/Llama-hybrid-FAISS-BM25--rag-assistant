packing and unpacking variable length array/string using the struct module in python

I am trying to get a grip around the packing and unpacking of binary data in Python 3. Its actually not that hard to understand, except one problem: what if I have a variable length textstring and want to pack and unpack this in the most elegant manner? As far as I can tell from the manual I can only unpack fixed size strings directly? In that case, are there any elegant way of getting around this limitation without padding lots and lots of unnecessary zeroes?
