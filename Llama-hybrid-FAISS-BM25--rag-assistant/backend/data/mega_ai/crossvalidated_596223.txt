I recommend fitting a logistic regression model. It could be much more complicated than this, and could incorporate more seasonality components if desired. $$\rm \ln\left(\frac{\frac{orders}{clicks}}{1-\frac{orders}{clicks}} \right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 type + \beta_2 week + \beta_3 month$$ where $\beta_1$ is a coefficient on type={0,1}, $\beta_2$ is really a family of coefficients on a dummy encoded week, and $\beta_3$ is a family of coefficients on a dummy encoded month. Here is how that is accomplished in R: require(lubridate) # simulate data set.seed(18093) data $orders orders * data $clicks) data$ rate $orders / data$ clicks data $type date, label = TRUE) %in% c("Sat","Sun"), "Weekend", "Weekday")) data $month date, label = TRUE)) data $week date)) # fit a generalized linear model glm1 $website)), type = factor("Weekday", levels = levels(data$ type)), week = factor(7, levels = levels(data $week)), month = factor("Feb", levels = levels(data$ month))), type = "response") #> 1 #> 0.09054071 Created on 2022-11-18 with reprex v2.0.2
