How to use two instances of the same .ascx in the same page in ASP.NET MVC?

I have two instances of an Address.ascx control in an ASP.NET MVC page. Shipping Address Billing Address Of course, with the code exactly like this I'll end up with the same IDs for each field in the address. I can easily append a string to the ID of the fields so I'd have 'Street1_billing' and 'Street1_shipping' , but I'm not clear how to map this to the model. Whats the best solution to mapping a model to an array of items (in this case only 2). I'm not aware of any ASP.NET 'out of the box' solution for this. Note: This is slightly similar to this question and I could use this solution from Scott Hanselman , but its not exactly what I want. In my case I know I have two items, so its essentially a 2 item array but I'm wondering if there is a slightly more elegant solution. PS. I'm sure this has been asked many times before, but I just cant seem to put in the right search terms. Please link this question if you're aware of dupes!
