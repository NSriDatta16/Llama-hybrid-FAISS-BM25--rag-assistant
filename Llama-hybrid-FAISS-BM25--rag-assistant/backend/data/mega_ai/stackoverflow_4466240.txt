From UIGestureRecognizer class reference for reset method: The runtime calls this method ( reset ) after the gesture-recognizer state has been set to UIGestureRecognizerStateEnded or UIGestureRecognizerStateRecognized. (...) After this method is called, the runtime ignores all remaining active touches; that is, the gesture recognizer receives no further updates for touches that have begun but haven't ended. So, yes, it's because you're setting the state to UIGestureRecognizerStateRecognized in touchesBegan . EDIT As a workaround, you can make two recognizers, one for touchesBegan and the other for touchesEnded , and then add both of them to the target view: UIGestureRecognizer *recognizer1 = [TouchDownGestureRecognizer alloc] initWithTarget:self action:@selector(handleGesture:)]; UIGestureRecognizer *recognizer2 = [TouchUpGestureRecognizer alloc] initWithTarget:self action:@selector(handleGesture:)]; [self.view addGestureRecognizer:recognizer1]; [self.view addGestureRecognizer:recognizer2];
