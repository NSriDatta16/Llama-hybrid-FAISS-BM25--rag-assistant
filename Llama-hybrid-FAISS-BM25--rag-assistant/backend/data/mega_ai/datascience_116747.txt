Difference between class_weight and loss_weights arguments in TensorFlow/Keras

I am creating a neural network using TensorFlow (v2.9.2) for an imbalanced image dataset. While doing so, I noticed that model.compile() method has an argument loss_weights , and model.fit() has an argument class_weight . I know that the loss_weights argument would transform the loss function to a weighted one and propagate the loss proportionately. But I am confused about the class_weight argument. My questions: 1. In what way do they differ from each other, specifically in terms of affecting the training process? 2. Should the value of class_weight argument be the same as loss_weights argument, considering that the distribution ratios among the categories remain the same throughout the process?
