You have to show us some code, but anyway you need to set the encrypt_name when uploading the file: $config['encrypt_name'] = TRUE; EDIT: Based on your update, your code should read: $profilBilledNavn['profile_picture'] = $this->upload->data('file_name'); $this->db->where('username', $this->input->post('username')); $this->db->update('users', $profilBilledNavn); EDIT 2: Please note that $this->upload->data() would return an array holding info of the file uploaded, refer . So what you need to do is: $file_array = $this->upload->data('file_name'); and then use: $profilBilledNavn['profile_picture'] = $file_array['file_name']; Now Pay attention for the documentation: file_name The name of the file that was uploaded including the file extension. orig_name The original file name. This is only useful if you use the encrypted name option. So since you are using encrypt_name you should use the first option ( file_name ) to update your DB.
