For your purpose, seeking to know whether a price change is notable relative to historical prices, the above are fine approaches. I concur with the prior poster that you should look at price changes. Another idea is to look at prices relative to a peer set of competitors, if that is easily determinable from the data ("this item is 33% cheaper than its peers!") But from an econometrics perspective, "significance" as we learn it in college stats (i.e. based on sample standard deviation of past price change data) while okay as qualitative threshold for this application, fails pretty quickly with price time series data. The problem is that while we might think prices are discrete observations of an underlying continuous process, they are actually discrete observations of a fundamentally discrete process, and have a very long-tail distribution (so not amenable to assumptions of normality). An engaging book to read is "The (Mis)behavior of Markets" by Benoit Mandelbrot. The pioneer of fractal theory looked at financial data from a wide variety of fields, sparked by the observation that price changes fall outside the 3-sigma and even 10-sigma far far more often than you would expect from past price change data. A digest appeared as a main article in Scientific American Net net, for method (2) in the original post, you can use historical standard deviations of price changes to set a threshold using the same formulae as significance tests, and even call it "significant" in marketing collateral, just put an asterisk explaining the methodology in a footnote, and don't count too much on its statistical rigor.
