This would be my answer for my question if someone would ask me. With no further knowledge, what the solotion would look like, though I already now the solution because it's part of the previous mentioned paper (page 237), I would argue like: (it's going to be a quite long answer, but in my opinion necessary to explain all the details) The solution, for the sets of three alternatives, i.e., for all ordered sets composed of $\alpha,\beta$ and $\gamma$ is given by Manski with: $P_\sigma(\alpha\in^c (\alpha,\beta,\gamma))=\frac{1}{2}$ $P_\sigma(\beta\in^c (\alpha,\beta,\gamma))=\frac{1}{2}$ $P_\sigma(\gamma\in^c (\alpha,\beta,\gamma))=0$ $P_\tau(\alpha\in^c (\alpha,\beta,\gamma))=0$ $P_\tau(\beta\in^c (\alpha,\beta,\gamma))=0$ $P_\tau(\gamma\in^c (\alpha,\beta,\gamma))=1$ It's obvious that the sum $\sum_{a\in C}P_t(a\in^c C)$ needs to be $1$ for any $C$ and any $t\in T$. If we calculate the utility-vectors $W_{Ct}$ for any $C$ and $t\in T$, i.e., for any ordered choice set $C$ composed of three alternatives $\alpha,\beta$ and $\gamma$ and any order choice set $C$ composed of the two alternatives $\alpha$ and $ \beta$ we will get: $\bar W_{(\alpha,\beta,\gamma),\sigma} = \begin{pmatrix} 1.5\\ 0.5\\ 1\end{pmatrix}$ for any combination of $(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)$ and $t=\sigma$ $\bar W_{(\alpha,\beta),\sigma} = \begin{pmatrix} 1.5\\ 0.5\end{pmatrix}$ for any combination of $(\alpha,\beta)$ and $t=\sigma$ $\bar W_{(\alpha,\beta,\gamma),\tau} = \begin{pmatrix} 1\\ 1\\ 2\end{pmatrix}$ for any combination of $(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)$ and $t=\tau$ $\bar W_{(\alpha,\beta),\tau} = \begin{pmatrix} 1\\ 1\end{pmatrix}$ for any combination of $(\alpha,\beta)$ and $t=\tau$ If we have a look at $t=\sigma$, with no further knowledge but the information that a decision-maker is a utility maximizing agent, we would think that in any case, i.e., for any choice set $C$ of three or two alternatives, the agent would always choose the alternative $\alpha$. Similarly the agent $t=\tau$ would choose $\gamma$ in any case in which he picks a alternative from set composed of three alternatives. For the case in which he picks alternatives from a set composed of two alternatives he would be indifferent between $\alpha$ and $\beta$. If we have a look at formula (1) these ideas would translate into: $P(\bar W_{(\alpha,\beta,\gamma),\sigma} | r_{(\alpha,\beta,\gamma),o}, s_{\sigma,o})=\frac{\frac{2}{36}}{6\frac{2}{36}} = \frac{1}{6}$ for any of the six possible orderings of the vector $\bar W_{(\alpha,\gamma,\beta),\sigma}$, i.e., for each of the six ordered choice sets $C$ whose elements are $\alpha,\beta$ and $\gamma$. $P(\bar W_{(\alpha,\beta),\sigma} | r_{(\alpha,\beta),o}, s_{\sigma,o})=\frac{\frac{1}{12}}{2\frac{1}{12}} = \frac{1}{2}$ for any of the two possible orderings of the vector $\bar W_{(\alpha,\gamma),\sigma}$, i.e., for each of the two ordered choice sets $C$ whose elements are $\alpha$ and $\beta$. Similarly we get $P(\bar W_{(\alpha,\beta,\gamma),\tau} | r_{(\alpha,\beta,\gamma),o}, s_{\tau,o})=\frac{2\frac{2}{36}}{6\frac{2}{36}} = \frac{1}{3}$ $P(\bar W_{(\alpha,\beta),\tau} | r_{(\alpha,\beta),o}, s_{\tau,o})=\frac{2\frac{1}{12}}{2\frac{1}{12}} = 1$ Comments: The reason for the $2$ being a part in the denominator of $P(\bar W_{(\alpha,\beta,\gamma),\tau} | r_{(\alpha,\beta,\gamma),o}, s_{\tau,o})$ and $P(\bar W_{(\alpha,\beta),\tau} | r_{(\alpha,\beta),o}, s_{\tau,o})$ is, that we only observe three distinct vectors of $W_{C,\tau}$, though we've six different orderings of the choice set $(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)$. For instance, for the two cases $C=(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)$ and $C'=(\beta,\alpha,\gamma)$, we will observe the same vector $W_{C,\tau}$. Since, by formula (1), we need to count how often we observe $W_{\tilde C, \tilde t} = \bar W_{C,t}$, this is what the $2$ in the denominator essentially does. If we calculate (2), for a certain size of $C$ (like $|C|=3$), we need to consider all the values of $P(\bar W_{C,t} | r_{C,o}, s_{t,o})$ for which a value $\bar w_{a,t}$ is at least as big as all the other values $\bar w_{\tilde a, t}, \tilde a\in C$. If we do that, we will get the following values: (all probabilities will be the same for any ordering of $(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)$. The "$\in^c (\alpha,\beta,\gamma)$" only adresses the set we are currently looking on) $P_\sigma(\alpha\in^c (\alpha,\beta,\gamma))=6\frac{1}{6} = 1$ (there are six distinct cases of $W_{C,\sigma}$ in which the value $\bar w_{\alpha,\sigma}$ is greater then all the other values ) $P_\sigma(\beta\in^c (\alpha,\beta,\gamma))=0$ $P_\sigma(\gamma\in^c (\alpha,\beta,\gamma))=0$ $P_\tau(\alpha\in^c (\alpha,\beta,\gamma))=0$ $P_\tau(\beta\in^c (\alpha,\beta,\gamma))=0$ $P_\tau(\gamma\in^c (\alpha,\beta,\gamma))=3\frac{1}{3} = 1$ (there are only three distinct cases of $W_{C,\tau}$, hence the $3$ ) For $|C|=2$ we will get: $P_\sigma(\alpha\in^c (\alpha,\beta))=2\frac{1}{2} = 1$ $P_\sigma(\beta\in^c (\alpha,\beta))=0$ Now the forumla (2) seems to fail for $t=\tau$, since the imposed condition not only accounts for the cases in which $\bar w_{a\tau}$ is greater then $w_{\tilde a,\tau}$ but also if the equality between those two quantities is true. In this particular case, $|C|=2,t=\tau$ all the values of $w_{\tilde a, \tau}, \tilde a\in C$ are equal. So by the definition of (2) we would count all the cases of $P(\bar W_{(\alpha,\beta),\tau} | r_{(\alpha,\beta),o}, s_{\tau,o})$ for each alternative. Here we only observe one possible value of $\bar W_{C,\tau}$, i.e., $W_{(\alpha,\beta),\tau}=W_{(\beta,\alpha),\tau}=\begin{pmatrix} 1\\ 1\end{pmatrix}$. So by (2) we would get: $P_\sigma(\alpha\in^c (\alpha,\beta))=1$ $P_\sigma(\beta\in^c (\alpha,\beta))=1$ ,since the condition "$\bar w_{a,\tau} \ge w_{\tilde a, \tau}, \tilde a\in C$" is true for both cases, i.e., for the summation of $a=\alpha$ and $a=\beta$. But this cannot be true because $\sum_{a\in (\alpha,\beta)}P_\tau(a\in^c (\alpha,\beta))=2\ne 1$. I would suggest the following work arround : Instead of (2) I would suggest we could use $(3) P_t(a\in^c C) = \sum_{\bar w_{a,t} > w_{\tilde a, t}, \tilde a\in C}P(\bar W_{C,t}|r_{Co},s_{to}) + \sum_{\bar w_{a,t} = w_{\tilde a, t}, \tilde a\in C}\frac{P(\bar W_{C,t}|r_{Co},s_{to})}{2}$ This equation would, in my optinion, better adress the issue of a agent being indifferent between all possible alternatives. The former mentioned issue, leaving all the other results unchanged, would be, by using (3) instead of (2): $P_\sigma(\alpha\in^c (\alpha,\beta))=\frac{1}{2}$ $P_\sigma(\beta\in^c (\alpha,\beta))=\frac{1}{2}$
