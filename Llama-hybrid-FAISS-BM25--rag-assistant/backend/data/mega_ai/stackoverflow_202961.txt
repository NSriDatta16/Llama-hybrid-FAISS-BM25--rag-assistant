RRDtool is designed to store and aggregate log data. You configure a sampling interval and feed data into it, then it returns time-based results. It's optimized for fixed-size storage, and starts aggregating past results after a time. For example, suppose you have a round-robin database with a 5-minute time interval. Even if you send it temperature data once per second, it still only stores the results in 5-minute increments. After a week, it averages those results into hourly values. After a month, hourly results are averaged into daily numbers, and so on. RRDtool is commonly used as the backend for tools like Cricket and MRTG to track network and environmental data for months and years at a stretch.
