Weird result from lm function in R

I have some data, linked here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rGgny-SZHzkjwj7xTSuEbLEhvx_JoVraG3udWqk-zN0/edit?usp=sharing I tried to do a simple lm . My code is: testLM The results I observed are 1.653e-02 for the variable (p-val This is an impossible result because from the plot, it is quite clear that the gradient should be positive and the data is quite good linearly speaking. I tried to use online tools and it is proved. I attached the picture. What's wrong with my R code? Thank you.
