You could use Html.RenderPartial to insert an HTML fragment somewhere in the page. If you want to insert it in a place not available to the view but only on the master you could place a placeholder inside the master and in the view simply override it and insert the partial. If placing such a placeholder is not acceptable you could use AJAX like: $('#adminHolder').load('/home/admin'); , but I would probably go with the previous approach as it will work in case the user has javascript disabled.
