Best decision tree type, when data has strong initial empirical assumptions, but future "nearby" outliers may be possible?

Best decision tree type, when data has strong initial empirical assumptions, but future "nearby" outliers may be possible? I've been confused about this relative to the algorithms available, like Random Forest, Boosted Trees, ... They prefer to estimate goodness and produce goodness of fit through some "mathematical measures". But in this case I have strong empirical measures, but which may contain deviation, when/if new observations contradict them. This suggests that methods that perform "automatic sensing of goodness of fit" might well perform worse than applying good intuitionistic empirical rules for splitting, corrected by possible future outliers. Because do the "automatic measures" understand the empirical phenomenon? It's also possible that the automatic method would reject the new observations as outliers, even if they would provide meaningful evidence. So what model could be for this kind of scenario? Example: I know that by dividing feature A with a split at 40% ( -1 and >= 40% -> 1) of range it models well the empirical observations. However it's possible that in the future there will come observations: (32%,1), (36%,1), (41%,-1), (43%,-1), ... that contradict the labels assigned originally, although they're still somewhat near to the 40% -rule. But based on the distribution of these new observations or their mean deviation, this could suggest readjusting the original 40% rule. E.g. since there's deviation of (8+4)/2=6 units to left and (1+3)/2=2 units to right, then this could suggest e.g. move 40% $\rightarrow$ 37% (since ratio of left:right is 3:1). If we'd apply some automatic method to this, then it's possible that it would not set the original rule at 40%. It's also possible that by not doing this, it would retrain differently on future observations, since the reference point was different. OTOH, if we'd set the 40% manually, then how what model retrains relative to it?
