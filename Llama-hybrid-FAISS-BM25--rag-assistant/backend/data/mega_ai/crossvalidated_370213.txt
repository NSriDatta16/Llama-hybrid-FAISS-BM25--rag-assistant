Help with notation p(y|x, w, beta)

In a Machine Learning course the notation used is the following: I understand the normal (I think) on the RHS, but I can't figure out what this p is. Is it: Conditional distribution? If yes, why are there 3 parts after the | . I've only seen $f_{X|Y}(x|y)$ sort. Parametrized distribution of the $f(x; \theta)$ type? What is $\theta$ ? Also, is it $p( (y|x), w, \beta)$ ? Like is it y given x ? or is it y given all of $x, w, \beta$ ? This notation is prevalent in Bishop, PRML. Here is a section where the book describes this: I've been learning stats on my own from All of Statistics ( pdf ), and I can't find equivalent notation (granted, I'm only on page 70). Being a newbie to stats, I would appreciate any tips on this.
