Your question has nothing to do with causality per se, it is actually about the mechanics of OLS. So let me leave the causal part to the end. Thus, first, regarding the two approaches of fitting an OLS model, your second approach of regressing residuals on the variable of interest is related to what we call the FWL theorem. Your only mistake is that you also need to regress "action" on "other_features", and only then you would regress the residuals of "outcome" on the residuals of "action". As it is, your "attempt 2" is not correct, since it is not fully adjusting for your "other_features". If you residualize both treatment and outcome, then "attempt 2" will give you numerically the same results as your "attempt 1" (barring corrections on the actual degrees of freedom). Now, regarding the causal interpretation, first you need to decide whether "other_covariates" satisfy the back-door criterion. Second, you need to make sure a linear model is good working approximation, otherwise linear regression will not do the proper adjustment (or you need to reinterpret the coefficient as weighted average of causal effects, see Mostly Harmless Econometrics, Chapter 3 ).
