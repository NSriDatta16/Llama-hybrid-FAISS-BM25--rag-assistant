how to deal with skewed data in structural equation modeling?

I'm trying to do some simple factor analysis in Lavaan, using 2 factors to explore the relationships between a few variables. However, each time I try to fit the model, it fails to converge. Upon examining the histograms of the dataset, it seems like a few manifest variables (glu and hdl) are skewed right. Based on that, I tried some of the robust estimators in Lavaan but those too failed to converge. mod2 = sim.model here is the output: Warning messages: 1: In lav_model_vcov(lavmodel = lavmodel, lavsamplestats = lavsamplestats, : lavaan WARNING: could not compute standard errors! lavaan NOTE: this may be a symptom that the model is not identified. 2: In lav_object_post_check(lavobject) : lavaan WARNING: covariance matrix of latent variables is not positive definite; use inspect(fit,"cov.lv") to investigate. If I investigate further, I get: inspect(fit2,"cov.lv") F1 F2 F1 1.000 F2 345.993 1.000 Is this an an identification problem? I have 6 manifest variables, therefore 6 * 7 / 2 = 21 unique data values. I am trying to learn 8 + 6 + 1 parameters (paths, residuals and latent variable covariance), therefore I should have 21 - 15 = 6 df. path diagrams Just for reference, here are the path diagrams I am trying to fit. Before fitting the model is structured like this: semPaths(mod2) After fitting, these are the weights: semPaths(fit2, 'std') I'm new to SEM modeling and am really just trying to get some practice building models using my Lab's datasets. Would really appreciate some pointers for how to resolve convergance and the positive definate problem.
