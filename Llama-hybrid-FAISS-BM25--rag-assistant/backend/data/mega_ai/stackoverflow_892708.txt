Database/data storage for high volume of simple transactions

I have written a PHP application which requires storage of millions of integers between 0 and 10,000,000 inclusive. Each number is incremented by one very frequently (on average 100 values are updated every second) and read very frequently (20,000 reads per second). The numbers are reset to 0 either nightly, weekly, monthly or annually. I've got a fairly good handle on MySQL but it feels like overkill, and not very efficient in the process. Has anyone had to deal with this before, and/or could shed some light on a suitable data storage system?
