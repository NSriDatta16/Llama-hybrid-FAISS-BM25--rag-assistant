SQLite treats your dates as strings, simply sorting them as it would sort strings. SQLite does not have a specific data type for DATE. You need to store your date values in line with SQLite's date / time functions. From the SQLite documentation: SQLite does not have a storage class set aside for storing dates and/or times. Instead, the built-in Date And Time Functions of SQLite are capable of storing dates and times as TEXT, REAL, or INTEGER values: * TEXT as ISO8601 strings ("YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.SSS"). * REAL as Julian day numbers, the number of days since noon in Greenwich on November 24, 4714 B.C. according to the proleptic Gregorian calendar. * INTEGER as Unix Time, the number of seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC. Applications can chose to store dates and times in any of these formats and freely convert between formats using the built-in date and time functions.as Unix Time, the number of seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC. See Datatypes In SQLite Version 3 and Date And Time Functions
