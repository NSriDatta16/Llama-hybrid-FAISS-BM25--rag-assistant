Deep learning on cloud

I am trying to implement some deep learning models with large amount of data around 10gigabyte. Although, my Laptop and Collab-free crashes when it tries to load them. Do you think it worths to buy collab-pro? Do you suggest any other solutions? But my worries are mostly about buying collab-pro is only for US and Canada while I am from Europe. Thanks in advance.
