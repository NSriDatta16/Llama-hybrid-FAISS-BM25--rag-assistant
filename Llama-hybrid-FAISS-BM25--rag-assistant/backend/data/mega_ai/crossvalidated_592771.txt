How to compute Bayesian estimate of a mean using data?

I'm trying to learn Bayesian statistics, but I'm having a lot of trouble actually applying theoretical concepts to data. I'd appreciate any feedback on my line of reasoning. Say I have historical data containing independent observations of a continuous random variable $X$ , where $X$ doesn't follow a normal distribution. Then, I record new data on an individual of interest, $D = (x_{1},\dots, x_{n})$ , where $D$ is also not normally distributed. My goal is to give an estimate of the "true" mean of this new individual's data. To do this, I understand I need both a prior distribution and a likelihood function. What are the next steps here to find the posterior with the given data? Do I have to estimate the distribution of the prior using the population data? Then, how would I use the new data $D$ to specify a likelihood function? I suppose this is a very broad question; I would just appreciate some general direction. I think the part that is giving me trouble is that the distributions don't lend themselves to this "conjugate prior" situation I've read about, where there is an easy relationship to refer to between the prior, the new data, and the posterior distribution.
