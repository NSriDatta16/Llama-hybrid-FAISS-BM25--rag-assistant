Release/Debug Configurations with Flash + AS3

I recently ran into an embarrassing situation with some Flash coding where I had to accidentally sent clients a build where not all my debugging flags and variables were unset. (It was sending requests to the debug instead of release server, etc...) Part of this was poor code organization on my part; I've resolved that. However, Flash doesn't seem to allow one to set different build configurations, and the Actionscript Compile settings hosts a variety of switches arranged in such a fashion that forgetting to check/uncheck something (OMG, I forgot to disable debugger support!) might just happen, as it did with me. In any case, I find that manually jumping between my release config and debug config to be easy to screw up. So, other developers, what techniques do you use to error-proof jumping between your testing config, and the build config that you issue to your boss/clients/whoever? I know I should probably slow down but I would much prefer setting up something to where I could just flip a switch. I'm just jumping back into Flash after a long hiatus (Flash MX + a bit of 2004). Oh, and I'm aware of the futility of disabling debug support and setting import passwords and all that, my goal is to simply keep the script kiddies out of my project. Decompilers trump all that so..... Anyways, Thanks!
