question about struct and pointers

let us consider following code #include #include using namespace std; typedef struct bf_{ unsigned x:4; unsigned y:4; unsigned z:4; unsigned w:4; }bf; int main(){ unsigned short i=8; unsigned short j=9; bf* bitfields=(bf *)&i; bf*bit=(bf*)&j; bitfields->w=12; printf("%d\n",bitfields->x); printf("%d\n",bit->y); printf("%d\n",bitfields->w); return 0; } this fragment unsigned short j=9; bf*bit=(bf*)&j; printf("%d\n",bit->y); i have add after guess some interesting characteristic of this code for example after this place bf* bitfields=(bf *)&i; when we write printf("%d\n",bitfields->x); which prints 8 i understand that using pointers and references value of i will be granted to x and so it prints 8 for instance when we write bitfiled->y it writes 0 so i decided to introduce second element variable j create new instance of bf structer and make reference of j after which statement bit->y should write 9 because as i understand it is order definition but it gives me 0 why? please explain me how this code works?i am not english speaker so please sorry for my bad english
