In a nutshell : the problem is having samples that are all-zero. Widely varying abundances and missing taxa are not so much of a problem. Read on for how I tackled this sort of analysis recently. First I would highly recommend reading this source: Clarke, K. R., & Warwick, R. M. (2001). Change in Marine Communities: An Approach to Statistical Analysis and Interpretation (2nd ed.). Plymouth: PRIMER-E. ( PDF ) They outline a step-by-step method for analysing the sort of data you have collected (don't worry about the marine examples, its exactly the same with terrestrial species). Their recommendations: Use MDS over PCA (for 2 reasons outlined in that paper). Use Bray-Curtis for calculating (dis)similarity matrices rather than euclidean distance. They advocate euclidean distance only for constructing matrices with environmental variables, not species abundances (for reasons in that paper). I have been following this process for analysing my own data which is similar to yours (I struggled at first). I've been using PRIMER-e software but its possible to do this in R. If you have access to PRIMER-e and the user guide / tutorial then I would highly recommend you read it. Organise data as species-as-rows, samples-as-columns. Depending on your data and the questions you are asking it may be appropriate to sum replicates together, or to keep them separate, or both. Standardise your data. If your sampling effort is uneven you will need to standardise your data - this is outlined in the above source. I didn't need to do this because I used the same number of traps, in the same places, left out for the same amount of time during my project. Transform your species abundance data. Typically, raw abundances are transformed prior to analysis. Usually you will use square root, fourth-root, log(X+1), or presence-absence (square root being least extreme, P/A being most). I would start with square root. Normalise any environmental data. Normally, for each variable you want to subtract the mean and divide by the standard variation for that variable. This is so that different variables with wildly different data ranges can be compared on the same scale. For example temperatures of 10-20 degrees can't be compared to numbers of saplings in the hundreds. Construct species abundance dissimilarity matrices with Bray-Curtis. If your data contains samples that are all-zero you will run into the double zero problem. This can be overcome by using a zero-adjusted Bray-Curtis coefficient, which is sometimes referred to as a 'dummy variable' which damps down the similarity fluctuations between samples that are both zero (undefined). They explain the zero-adjusted Bray-Curtis method in a paper here . Construct an environmental dissimilarity matrix using euclidean distance (if you have environmental data like climate, vegetation measurements etc). Carry out agglomerative, hierarchical clustering (Chapter 3) to determine any natural groupings. Carry out MDS (Chapter 5). For your purposes, you would add 'trailside' and 'interior' as factors, and then plot the MDS with those factors as different symbols. Interpret the MDS plots. They suggest overlaying the cluster analysis at different similarity levels to identify clusters. You can also turn the MDS into a 'bubble plot' by overlaying different environmental variables which you can add as factors. From here you can do things like find out the best combination of environmental variables that explain the abundances (BEST function in PRIMER-e) or compare two different matrices (for example 'species abundance' and vegetation presence-absence' - RELATE in PRIMER-e). Good luck! It can be difficult to understand the appropriate method from the outset. I would recommend seeing someone with a statistical background (or even better, ecology and stats). They will most likely be able to point you in the right direction and answer the sorts of questions you are likely to have.
