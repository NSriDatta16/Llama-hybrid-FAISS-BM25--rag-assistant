Reading file from Object Storage in IBM DSX

I'm just getting started with DSX. I have two files in my Object Storage that I want to read in my Jupyter notebook: Warehousing-data.json Warehousing-sales_data- nominal_scenario.json I have the credentials. Now I need the calling sequence. Here is what have on my local copy of the notebook. resource_path= "C:\\...\\warehousing\\" Warehousing_data_json = "Warehousing-data.json" Warehousing_sales_data_nominal_scenario_json = "Warehousing-sales_data- nominal_scenario.json" resp = client.execute(input= [ {'name': Warehousing_data_json, 'filename': resource_path + Warehousing_data_json}, {'name': Warehousing_sales_data_nominal_scenario_json, 'filename': resource_path + Warehousing_sales_data_nominal_scenario_json}]) ... What is the equivalent when the files are located in Object Storage?
