Why are derived features used in neural networks?

For example, one wants to predict house prices and have two input features the length and width of the house. Sometimes, one also includes 'derived' polynomial input features, such as area, which is length * width. 1) What is the point of including derived features? Shouldn't a neural network learn the connection between length, width and price during the training? Why isn't the third feature, area, redundant? In addition, sometimes I also see that people run genetic selection algorithms on the input features in order to reduce their number. 2) What is the point of reducing the input features if they all contain useful information? Shouldn't the neural network assign appropriate weights to each input feature according to its importance? What is the point of running genetic selection algorithms?
