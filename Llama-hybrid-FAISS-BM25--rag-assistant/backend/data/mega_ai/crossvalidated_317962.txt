Poisson Distributions: Have Daily Rate and "peak rate", how to figure out hourly rate?

I know that the daily average number of customers per 11 hours is 610 and during the highest peak of the day (from 12 to 1) 100 customers are served with the second peak (from 6 to 7) 50 customers are served. How can I figure out the average rate per each hour of the day? The first mode is from 11 am to 4 pm and the second mode is from 4 pm to 10 pm. Both modes are assumed to conform to a Poisson distribution respectively.
