Image load timeout in Internet Explorer

I have a page for an internal app that displays document images streamed from a document storage system using a web service. The problem I am having is that when a user does their search they may get hundreds of hits, which I have to display on one large page so they can print them all. This works fine in Firefox, but in IE it stops loading the images after a while so I get a hundred or so displayed and the rest just have the broken image symbol. Is there a setting somewhere that I can change this timeout?
