I'm late to the party, but I think the definition given on Pearl's Causality , 2nd edition (2009, p. 16) is clearer: A path in a graph is a sequence of edges (...) such that each edge starts with the vertex ending the preceding edge. In other words, a path is any unbroken, nonintersecting route traced out along the edges in a graph, which may go either along or against the arrows. If every edge in a path is an arrow that points from the first to the second vertex of the pair, we have a directed path . The paragraph following it clarifies that he excludes a self loop ( $X \rightarrow X$ ), but not a directed cycle ( $X \rightarrow Y$ , $Y \rightarrow X$ ), from the definition of a directed path: Directed paths may include directed cycles ( e.g. $X \rightarrow Y$ , $Y \rightarrow X$ ) (...), but not self loops ( e.g. $X \rightarrow X$ ). So in your example, the path $X \rightarrow U \rightarrow Y$ is a directed path, thus violating condition 1 for the front-door criterion to apply.
