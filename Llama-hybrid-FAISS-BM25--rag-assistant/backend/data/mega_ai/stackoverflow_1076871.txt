Leverage .Net to deal with 133 textBoxes?

I have a 19 X 7 table with a textBox in each cell. Some textBoxes need to be read only, depending on the data that is loaded into them. On saving I have to examine each textbox and see if the value needs to be saved. Having to list 133 textboxes by hand takes a long while. I would be ecstatic to get it down to a row level, so I would only need to deal with 7 textBoxes and let .Net duplicate my effort 19 times. Is there better way to leverage .Net? The repeater looks promising, but I don't know how to reference a control that has been repeated, more over a group of controls.
