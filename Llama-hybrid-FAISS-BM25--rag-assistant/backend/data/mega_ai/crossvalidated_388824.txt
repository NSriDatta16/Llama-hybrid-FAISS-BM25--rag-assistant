I don't think there's a common definition of what constitutes a statistical model. From my experience in the industry it seems to be a synonym to what in econometrics is called a reduced form model. I'll explain. Suppose, that in your field there are established relationships or "laws," e.g. in Physics this would be $F=m\frac {d^2x}{dt^2}$ stating that force is proportional to the acceleration (aka "2nd law of mechanics"). So, knowing this law you could build a mathematical model of a cannon ball trajectory. This model will have what Physicists call "constants" or "coeffiecients", e.g. an air density at a given temperature and elevation. You'll have to find out what are these coefficients experimentally. In our case we'll have ask the artillery to fire the cannons under many different, tightly controlled conditions, such as angles, temperature etc. We collect all the data, and fit the model using statistical techniques. It could be as simple as linear regression or averages. Once got all the coefficients, we now run our mathematical model to produce the firing tables. This is neatly described in the unclassified document here , called "THE PRODUCTION OF FIRING TABLES FOR CANNON ARTILLERY." What I just described is not a statistical model. Yes, it does use statistics, but this model uses establishes laws of Physics, which are the essence of the model. Here, statistics is a mere tool to determine the values of a few important parameters. The dynamics of the system are described and pre-determined by the field. Suppose, that we did not know or did not care for the laws of Physics, and simply tried to establish the relationships between cannon flying distance and the parameters such as firing angle and temperature using a "statistical model." We'd create a big data set with a bunch of candidate variables, or features, and transformations of variables, maybe polynomial series of temperature etc. Then we'd run a regression of sorts, and identified coefficients. These coefficients would not necessarily have established interpretations in the field. We'd call them sensitivities to square of temperature etc. This model may actually be quite good at predicting the end points of cannon balls, because the underlying process is quite stable.
