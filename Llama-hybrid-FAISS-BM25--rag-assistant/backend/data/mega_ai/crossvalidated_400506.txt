How to find a transformation of a random process X to make it distributed as a reference process Y?

I am thinking how to use GAN or KL Divergence as a loss function to enforce specific specific distribution on the feature space: Let $X \sim D$ where $D$ is some distribution. Assume we know a reference asymptotic distribution $Y \sim D_2$ . We would like to find a polynomial transformation of $X \to f(X)$ such that $f(X) \sim Y \sim D_2$ . For the case of $Y \sim D_2=N(0,1)$ the network potentially will find the z-score normalization or some mapping $f$ , so $f(x) \sim Y$ . I would like to get advice how to formalize this problem in order to be able to solve it using Neural Network. Someone mentioned something like: Quantile Transforms , but I want to use neural network.
