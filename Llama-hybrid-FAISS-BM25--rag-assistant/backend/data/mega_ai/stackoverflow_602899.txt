We have run into the same problem using Infragistics controls. Our solution has been to keep a blank licnenses.licx file in our source repository (Source Gear Vault) and then change the properties of the file to Read Only false on our local workations. This way we do not end up stepping on each other with that file and it is generated with the proper keys off of our workstations. Of course this is a bit of a manual work around that may not be suitable for you, but that is how we have been doing it.
