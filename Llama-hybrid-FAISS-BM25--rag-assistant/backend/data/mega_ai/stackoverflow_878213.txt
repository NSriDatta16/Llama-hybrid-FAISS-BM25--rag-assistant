Reordering UITableView sections on the iPhone by dragging (like reordering rows)

Is there anything currently in the SDK that allows for re-ordering of tableView sections? As in, move the entire section below or above an adjacent section? This is plausible with individual UITableViewCells. Haven't seen it done for sections though.
