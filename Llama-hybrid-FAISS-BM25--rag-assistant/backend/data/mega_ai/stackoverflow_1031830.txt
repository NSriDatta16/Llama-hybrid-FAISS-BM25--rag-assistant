How do I handle drag-and-drop in the designer?

I've created a control, DataGridViewContainer , that fakes partial-line scrolling in a DataGridView - basically it's a panel and a scrollbar and a few event handlers. I'd like to be able to use DataGridViewContainer at design time, dragging a DataGridView onto it to set its .DataGridView property to the dragged control. How do I handle drag-and-drop in the designer?
