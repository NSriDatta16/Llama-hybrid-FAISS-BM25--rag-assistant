I think it would be perfectly reasonable to use a GLMM/mixed logistic regression model for this problem, i.e. $$ \begin{split} y & \sim \textrm{Bernoulli}(\mu) \\ \mu & = 1/(1+\exp(-\eta)) \\ \eta & = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \textrm{docgender} + \beta_2 \cdot \textrm{patage} + \beta_3 \cdot \textrm{patpain}_1 + \beta_4 \cdot \textrm{patpain}_2 + \epsilon_{\textrm{doc}} \\ \epsilon_{\textrm{doc}} & \sim N(0,\sigma^2_{\textrm{doc}}) \end{split} $$ where the variables in the $\eta$ equation are dummy variables (we need two separate dummy variables for patient pain, e.g. $\textrm{patpain}_1$="mild vs. moderate pain" and $\textrm{patpain}_2$="mild vs. severe pain" since the predictor variable has three possible levels) or in lme4 notation y ~ docgender + patage + patpain + (1|docID) Note that the 'raw data' you gave isn't quite raw enough to solve this problem; aggregating across doctors to get the summary table loses the among-doctor variation, e.g. some doctors may be more likely to prescribe surgery across the board. In principle since every doctor reads all the vignettes you could estimate the among-doctor variance in response to the vignettes (not just in the average propensity to choose surgery), via y ~ docgender + patage + patpain + (1+docgender+patage+patpain|docID) but with 270 doctors and a Bernoulli response I think it would be a little optimistic to think you could estimate the 5x5 variance-covariance matrix implied by this formula (this is what's recommended by Barr et al in their "Keep it maximal" paper ...). Maybe worth a try. Oops, now I notice that you're also interested in interactions. It would be reasonable to try y ~ docgender*patage*patpain + (1|docID) According to Frank Harrell's ( Regression Modeling Strategies ) rule of thumb, you should try not to have more than one parameter per 10-20 'data points', where in this case 'data points' corresponds to the minimum of the number of yeses and nos in your data set - there seem to be approx. 400 no values, so 20 parameters are OK, this interaction model has (2x2x3+1)=13 parameters, so seems reasonable.
