Hmmm... not so sure... If you install Magento from scratch with the default template, the home page is a 3 column layout : http://demo.magentocommerce.com/ Anyway, if you see a template that has a 2 column layout whereas the default layout of catalog.xml is a 3 column it certainly means that there is a custom layout in the CMS page of the home page. In the backend, see CMS > Pages > Home. Then on the "Design" tab, you may find that the "Layout" dropdown is set to "2 column with [...] bar". Setting it to "3 columns" would do the trick. To put it theoretically : xml layout files are used for generic layout for each area/module of the site (catalog, customer, checkout, search...) but can be overwritten on a per-page basis thanks to the Custom Layout feature that you will find in CMS Pages, Categories and Products edition pages.
