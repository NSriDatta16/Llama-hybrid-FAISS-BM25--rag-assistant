As the comments point out, you have to deal with the possibility that the treatment combinations themselves affected germination. If you can rule that out adequately, then you might be OK with your approach. It would be more reliable to model the germination process directly. One possibility related to your proposed logistic regression would be an ordinal model that takes into account the necessary progression through germination before you can have a death. Then you would have 3 ordered outcomes: no germination, germination without death, and germination followed by death. Sal Mangiafico's R Companion outlines how such an ordered outcome can be modeled. That said, a multi-state survival model that takes time into account would probably make more efficient and informative use of your data.
