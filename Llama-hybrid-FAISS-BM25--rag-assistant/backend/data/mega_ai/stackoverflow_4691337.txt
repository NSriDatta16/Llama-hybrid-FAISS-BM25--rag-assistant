Storing regularly used Grails commands for later use in NetBeans?

I regularly use right mouse button > " Run/Debug Grails Command... " from within NetBeans. When I do so, it's cumbersome b/c I have to wait for " Reloading Grails commands... ", then I have to choose the command and manually type all parameters e.g. " unit:spock -coverage ExampleController ". I'll have to compose the commands everytime I restart NetBeans. Is there a better solution to this ? Also, everytime I run "test-app" complete Grails restarts - is it possible to leave Grails running and just execute the tests in question via a click again , and again, and again ... ?
