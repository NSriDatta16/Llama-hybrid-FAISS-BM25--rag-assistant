I agreed with the first paragraph of answer 1. That would be the first option I would look to correct the problem. The second option would be, restoring the master secret server. See below; Open a command prompt - Navigate to C:\Program Files\Common Files\Enterprise Single Sign-On\ Type in command - ssoconfig -restoresecret SSOXXXX.bak (Where XXXX is a randomly generated name created with SSO was installed. This is the SSO back-up file) Enter the password - (Again you entered/created/accepted this when configuring SSO in the BizTalk configuration.) Additionally you should create a new backup file if you have changed the account the SSO service runs under. To create a new back-up file - ssoconfig -backupsecret latestbackup.dat
