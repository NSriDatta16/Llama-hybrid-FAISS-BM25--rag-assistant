Efficient storage/retrieval method for replayable comet style applications (Google Wave, Etherpad)

I am considering a web application that would have the same kind of multi user, automatic saving, infinite undo / replay capabilities that you see in Google Wave and Etherpad (albeit on a drastically smaller scale and userbase). Before I go away and reinvent the wheel, is this something that has already been addressed as either a piece of technology or library, or even just a design pattern. I know this isn't necessarily the best Stack Overflow question as there is probably not a "right" answer, but my Google-fu has failed me and I'd just like a reading list! Ordinarily I would be developing under python/django but this is not a firm requirement just a preference :)
