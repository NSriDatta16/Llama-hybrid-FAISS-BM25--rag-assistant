Can you store it as a BLOB or possibly even FILESTREAM. I know BLOB's have a size limit of 2 GB and are probably less than the ideal depending on the average size of the file you expect because of the hit to the log file. FILESTREAM's were added in SQL SERVER 2008 to handle large files by writing them directly to the filesystem by setting an attribute on the varbinary type.
