The posterior predictive is approximated by the average of the sampling densities over the MCMC sample $$p(y|y^\text{obs})\approx\frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^T p(y|\theta^{(t)})$$ To simulate from this distribution, one need pick one of the $\theta^{(t)}$ at random and simulate $Y$ from the corresponding $p(y|\theta^{(t)})$ [and not for all the $\theta^{(t)}]$ .
