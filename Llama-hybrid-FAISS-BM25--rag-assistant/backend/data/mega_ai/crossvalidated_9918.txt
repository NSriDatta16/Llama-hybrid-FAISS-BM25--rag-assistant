How to compute correlation between/within groups of variables?

I have a matrix of 1000 observations and 50 variables each measured on a 5-point scale. These variables are organized into groups, but there aren't an equal number of variables in each group. I'd like to calculate two types of correlations: Correlation within groups of variables (among characteristics): some measure of whether the variables within the group of variables are measuring the same thing. Correlation between groups of variables: some measure, assuming that each group reflects one overall trait, of how each trait (group) is related to every other trait. These characteristics have been previously classified into groups. I'm interested in finding the correlation between the groups - i.e. assuming that the characteristics within in group are measuring the same underlying trait (having completed #1 above - Cronbach's alpha), are the traits themselves related? Does anybody have suggestions for where to start?
