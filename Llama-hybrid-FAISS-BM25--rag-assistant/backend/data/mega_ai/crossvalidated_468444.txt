Multilinear regression with nominal predictors - Bayesian

I have four nominal predictors and one metric predicted variable. I would like to know which one of predictors have more influence on the predicted variable. For doing so, I am curious to know if I can use multiple regression. My reservation is that predictors are nominal, and not numerical, which might make it impossible to use regression. That being said, I am also curious to use Bayesian methods for regression, the main reason of which is the correlation among predictors. If regression is in fact a proper method for my data, can I use multivariate normal distribution for predictors in the Bayesian regression model? Any help is highly appreciated!
