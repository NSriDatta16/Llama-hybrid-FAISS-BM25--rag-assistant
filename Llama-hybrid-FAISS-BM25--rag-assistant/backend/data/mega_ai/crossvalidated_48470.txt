Interpreting the output of a neural network

I've implemented a neural network for prediction, and for the input data, I've used the following formula to normalize data: Data_normalized_i= [Data_i - Min_data]/[Max_Data- Min_data] I've some questions: How do I interpret the output of my network according to my inputs? Must I use the real data input to compare it with my outputs? If I have to do some transformation of my outputs, how should I go about doing it? For the test error in this case, will be it calculated from the output or from the transformed outputs?
