Suppose I have an event $Y$ that can occur as a result of events $X_1$, $X_2$, $X_3$......$X_n$. Let us assume that I have already observed past historical data on the co-occurrence of $Y$ and the $X_i$s. As a result I have conditional probabilities on the occurrence of $Y$|$X_i$ and $Y|X_i, X_j$ ($i{\neq}j$), $Y|X_i, X_j, X_k$ ($i{\neq}j{\neq}k$) etc. Now at a certain time, I observe that certain $X_i$s and $Y$ actually occurred. How do I attribute the occurrence of $Y$ to the individual $X_i$s? In other words, let's say at a certain point in time, $Y$ occurs together with $X_1$, $X_3$ and $X_{10}$. How do I attribute the occurrence of $Y$ to each of $X_1$, $X_3$ and $X_{10}$? Here is a concrete example: Let's say the variable of interest ($Y$) is whether a car is stolen or not. Let's say that I also observe 3 attributes of the car - it's color (red or not red), origin (domestic or not) and the type of car (SUV or not). I observe 10 cars and their statuses and the data is as follows: | S No | Color | Type | Origin | Stolen? | |------|---------|---------|---------------|---------| | 1 | Red | Not SUV | Domestic | Yes | | 2 | Red | Not SUV | Domestic | No | | 3 | Red | Not SUV | Domestic | Yes | | 4 | Not Red | Not SUV | Domestic | No | | 5 | Not Red | Not SUV | Not Domestic | Yes | | 6 | Not Red | SUV | Not Domestic | No | | 7 | Not Red | SUV | Not Domestic | Yes | | 8 | Not Red | SUV | Domestic | No | | 9 | Red | SUV | Not Domestic | No | | 10 | Red | Not SUV | Not Domestic | Yes | Now let's say I observe a new car that is red, a SUV and domestic being stolen. How could I assign the extent to which each of these factors caused this PARTICULAR car to be stolen. Note that I'm not talking about the aggregate, but a scheme to attribute the observed factors to the status of this particular car. Any pointers would be helpful, even if they are keywords that I can search for. Edit : Bad example. Let's say a red SUV that is not domestic is identified as stolen, how would would you credit each of the attributes with a contribution for being stolen? The issue at hand here is that the logistic regression model would provide the probability of the car being stolen based on the factors. But we already know that the car is stolen. In other words, I would like a proportion for each of the factors Color=Red, Type=SUV and Origin=Not Domestic. Those proportions should sum to 1.
