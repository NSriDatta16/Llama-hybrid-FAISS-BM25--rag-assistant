In a project, I am currently involved with, we are doing some content-based routing to dynamically subscribed/unsubscribed agents by keeping track of them in our own routing table. We have wrapped the IBus in a decorator (by using Windsor's support of decorators, as described here ), that sees if the message implements a special IRoutableMessage interface, that allows the decorator to route the message by explicitly specifying the destination endpoint via bus.Send(destinationEndpoint) . This was a little bit complex to get right, and I would recommend going with NServiceBus' built-in routing as far as possible. But is is possible to explicitly route messages to any endpoint.
