Your prior belief is that the average of a typical dataset with $C$ samples is equal to $m$. Your real dataset has $n$ samples $x_1,\ldots,x_n$. Therefore, combining your prior belief with this dataset you would have $C+n$ samples with a sum equal to $Cm+\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i$. Therefore, the average of your dataset considering the prior belief would be equal to $$\bar x=\frac{Cm+\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{C+n}$$
