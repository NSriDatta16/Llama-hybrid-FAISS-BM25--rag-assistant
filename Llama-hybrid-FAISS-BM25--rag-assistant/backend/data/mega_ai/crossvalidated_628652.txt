Additive property of the regression coefficients (slopes)

If $y_1$ , $y_2$ , and $y_3$ are time series such that: $$y_1=y_2+y_3$$ Suppose all those variables were regressed against index $x$ , so we get coefficients $r_{y_1}$ , $r_{y_2}$ , and $r_{y_3}$ . In general, it should then hold that: $$r_{y_1}=r_{y_2}+r_{y_3}$$ I expect they should not equate since variance itself is not additive, as discussed in this post here . If so, does that mean that regression is not a linear operator?
