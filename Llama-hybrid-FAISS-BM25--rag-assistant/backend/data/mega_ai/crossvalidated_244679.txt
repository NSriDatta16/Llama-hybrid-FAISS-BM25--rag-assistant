https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis Principal component analysis (PCA) is a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components. It does completely different thing to logistic regression. PCA is not a substitute for logistic regression. You could actually even use them together. PCA can be used to remove dimensions that have strong correlations before PCA transformation. PCA has actually a problem that it only looks into the dimensions, not into categories and for that reason there is linear discriminant analysis (LDA). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_discriminant_analysis LDA is not a substitution for logistic regression, but a variant to do PCA-like things for data that needs to keep categories separated, for example to make logistic regression faster/simpler.
