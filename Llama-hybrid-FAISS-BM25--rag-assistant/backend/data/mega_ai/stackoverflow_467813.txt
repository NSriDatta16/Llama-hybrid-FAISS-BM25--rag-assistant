Flash if statement satisfies true and false

I have the following code: if(pickedUp == true){ trace("released and picked up" + pickedUpNum); this.storedClick = false; this.onMouseMove = null; this.onMouseDown = null; this.onMouseUp = null; this.onEnterFrame = this.refresh; pickedUpNum++; if( pickedUpNum > 60) pickedUp = false; } if(pickedUp == false){ trace("released and not picked up"); this.storedClick = false; this.onEnterFrame = this.refresh; this.onMouseDown = this.onStoreDrag; this.onMouseUp = this.onClearStoreDrag; this.onMouseMove = null; } And I get this output around 60: released and picked up59 released and picked up60 released and not picked up released and picked up61 released and not picked up How is this possible? I must be missing something simple. The project I am working on is actually trying to simulate picking up a piece of paper and moving it around, then setting it back down. I am trying to modify the flash page flip code to create this effect.
