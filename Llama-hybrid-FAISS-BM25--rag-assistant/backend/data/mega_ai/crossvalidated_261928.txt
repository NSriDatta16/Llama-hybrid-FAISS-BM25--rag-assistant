Can I use bootstrap to deal with extremely small sample size?

I have two groups, each with 3 sets of data. For each dataset I train an SVM classifier to get a decoding accuracy, which I want to compare across groups. However, I only have 3 samples for each group - can I still run a t-test, or is it valid to bootstrap a distribution of decoding accuracies for each data set individually, and then compare the 6 total distributions?
