Support Vector Machine or Artificial Neural Network for text processing?

We need to decide between Support Vector Machines and Fast Artificial Neural Network for some text processing project. It includes Contextual Spelling Correction and then tagging the text to certain phrases and their synonyms. Which will be the right approach? Or is there an alternate to both of these... Something more appropriate than FANN as well as SVM?
