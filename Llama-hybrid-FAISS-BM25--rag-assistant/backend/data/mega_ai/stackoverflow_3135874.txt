Probably not. Though you could create your own subclass of UIView which implements - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event (and other similar methods). Though it's likely that this is exactly what UIButton does for you anyway. If a UIButton isn't fast enough, try a subclass. But I don't think it will be much different.
