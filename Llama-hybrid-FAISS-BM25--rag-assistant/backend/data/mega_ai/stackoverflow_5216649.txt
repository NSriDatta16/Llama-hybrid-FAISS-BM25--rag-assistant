All callbacks receive two arguments: The original browser event and a prepared ui object, view below (if you name your second argument 'ui'), you can do: ui.helper - the current helper element (most often a clone of the item) ui.position - current position of the helper ui.offset - current absolute position of the helper ui.item - the current dragged element ui.placeholder - the placeholder (if you defined one) ui.sender - the sortable where the item comes from (only exists if you move from one connected list to another) You can also get this info from the UI documentation. http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/
