How determine the bandwidth of a gaussian kernel such that k nearest points represent a certain % of sum weight

I have a dataset to which I am applying a gaussian kernel. I want to determine the bandwidth (sd) of the kernel such that, on average, the k nearest points will represent a specified proportion of the resulting weights. For example, say I have a hundred observations with m=0.5 and sd=0.25, how do I determine the bw of a gaussian kernel such that, for any given point, on average the 10 nearest points will represent 95% of the sum of all weights?
