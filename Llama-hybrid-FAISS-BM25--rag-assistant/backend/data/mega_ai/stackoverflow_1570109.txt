Going forward and into the future, the HTML5 Doctype would be my recommendation. In practice, the HTML validators pay far more attention to a page's doctype than browsers do anyway. UPDATE: For those commenters that question the statement immediately above, here is my source for that statement: Webkit Blog . It says: ...beware, the validator looks at your doctype instead of the MIME type, unlike browsers. Also, FWIW, the recommendation of the Webkit people in the above linked blog is to use an HTML 4.01 transitional doctype, served with mime-type text/html and validated as HTML, not XHTML.
