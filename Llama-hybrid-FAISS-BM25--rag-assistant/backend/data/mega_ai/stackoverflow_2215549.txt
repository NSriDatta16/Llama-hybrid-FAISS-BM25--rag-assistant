How to use/link gdLibrary (libgd) with MS Visual C++ (e.g. 2008 Express Edition)? Getting LNK2019 errors

I have to use the gdLibrary ( http://www.libgd.org ) in a C++ App on MS Windows XP Prof. SP3 32bit - and I'm trying and googleing for two days now without success. Does anyone of you use libgd with MS VC++ 200x EE? My problem: It has to to compile with MS Visual C++ (e.g. the 2008 Express Edition - fixed 3rd party condition)... but currently the linker crashes, with 11 of the following LNK2019 errors: Linking... codereate.obj : error LNK2019: An undefined external symbol "_gdImageDestroy" was found in "public: virtual __thiscall CodeCreate::~CodeCreate(void)" The other smybols are _gdImageColorExact , _gdImageCopyResized and some other gd-functions. It seems that the VC++ linker does not work correctly with the bgd.lib provided by the package I downloaded from http://www.libgd.org/releases/gd-latest-win32.zip . What I did/tried: Extracted gd-latest-win32.zip to c:\users\johndoe\cpp\libgd . Defined c:\users\johndoe\cpp\libgd\lib als additional library dir (global VC++ setting) Defined c:\users\johndoe\cpp\libgd\include as additional includes dir (global VC++ setting) Defined c:\users\johndoe\cpp\libgd\include\lib\bgd.lib as additional linker\input dependency (project setting) I even added #pragma comment(lib, "libgd.lib") into my codecreate.h to be on the save side. Any suggestions? What am I doing wrong (e.g. have I forget to install something)? Is there any "trick" to get a VC++ 2008 compatible bgd.lib ? Additional notes: Running on Linux/g++, everything works fine, no warnings with -pedantic -ansi -wAll . The program does its job an generates some barcodes. It works when using DevC++ for Win32. Therefore it is no Windows issue, "just" a VC++ issue. For DevC++ I did: I just downloaded http://www.libgd.org/releases/gd-latest-win32.zip , extracted it to c:\users\johndoe\cpp\libgd added c:\users\johndoe\cpp\libgd\lib\bgd.lib as additional obbject in the linker-projects settings. defined c:\users\johndoe\cpp\libgd\lib als additional library dir, defined c:\users\johndoe\cpp\libgd\include as additional includes dir happy about some barcode stuff If I can't get It working, I'm really in trouble... becoming really desperate right now :-(
