In VC++ what is the #pragma equivalent of /O2 compiler option (optimize for speed)

According to msdn , /O2 (Maximize Speed) is equivalent to /Og/Oi/Ot/Oy/Ob2/Gs/GF/Gy and according to msdn again, the following pragma #pragma optimize( "[optimization-list]", {on | off} ) uses the same letters in its "optimization-list" than the /O compiler option. Available letters for the pragma are: g - Enable global optimizations. p - Improve floating-point consistency. s or t - Specify short or fast sequences of machine code. y - Generate frame pointers on the program stack. Which ones should I use to have the same meaning as /O2 ?
