As far as I know there is no ide out there that will let you "drag and drop create" standard win api windows like you would with C#. Personally for that kind of application I always recommend Borland C++ Builder (Which is now Codegear Rad studio) Although it is not standard API, it allows you to drag an drop and static linking is very easy, so you dont have to worry about redistributables
