IN Magento, how can I replicate the creation of a URL rewrite across multiple stores?

This is my thinking so far: Create Custom module which is fired by an event listener when Admin Magento Website triggers event: controller_action_predispatch_adminhtml_urlrewrite_save So far so good... QUESTION 1 How do I get the methods from the observer class which relate to the data I need to be able to replicate this request across every active store? QUESTION 2 I realise I will need a Helper class to fetch all the websites which need to be As a secondary question is there a magento class/function which fetches list of websites in an install? QUESTION 3 Apart from adding logic to check if the chosen product/category has an associated product/catalog in each of the store which is getting the new rewrite, are there any other checks I should make?
