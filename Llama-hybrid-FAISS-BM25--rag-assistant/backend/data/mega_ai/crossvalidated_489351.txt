ANOVA with small sample (duplicate)

I have a study with only a duplicate sample. I would like to know if there are differences between the 5 averages, each group has two samples. In another case, I have 3 averages and each group has 3 averages in the same case, two samples. Can I take the ANOVA test? I auditioned for Lillie and Hartley and everything is fine. In the research area where I do the study it is common to have duplicates, due to the cost. The analysis is about an application in the biotechnology area.
