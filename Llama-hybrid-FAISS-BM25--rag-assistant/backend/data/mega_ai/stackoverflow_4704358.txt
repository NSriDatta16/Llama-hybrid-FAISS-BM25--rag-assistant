Drag and Drop ListBox for WPF

I'm looking for just a simple ListBox with build-in Drag & Drop. I think that Silverlight 4 Toolkit has something like that . The BoxList should be able to: reorder by dragging & dropping items drag item from one BoxList to another display preview (ghost version) of dragged item show drop location (like a line between items where the dragged will be inserted) I hope there is some solution from microsoft (in toolkit for example), but if not I all be happy with any working solution. For example I wander what control was used in DataGrid column headers reordering (by dragging and dropping them) implementation. Thank you for any suggestions EDIT: Please do not suggest commercial controls. This is not for a commercial project and I don't want to buy it. Thank you
