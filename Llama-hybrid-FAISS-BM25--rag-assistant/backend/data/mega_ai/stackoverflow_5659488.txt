It seems, there isn't any problem with code coverage test of the library that is invoked by proprietary software. One should only pay attention to compile all components with the same version of the compiler and use corresponding gcov version. In my case the library (in Fortran) was compiled with f77 (gcc-3.4.6), the component of it was compiled with newest gcc (gcc-4.4). The wrapper for the library used by ADAMS was compiled again with gcc-3.4.6 and gcov used was 4.1. Using gcc-3.4.6 for all components delivered very appealing code coverage test results. Consider the topic closed, but should anyone have questions, please ask. I'll gladly share my experience.
