I think extension methods help to write code that is clearer. Instead of putting a new method inside your class, as your friend suggested, you put it in the ExtensionMethods namespace. In this way you maintain a logical sense of order to your class. Methods that don't really directly deal with your class won't be cluttering it up. I feel extension methods make your code clearer and more appropriately organized.
