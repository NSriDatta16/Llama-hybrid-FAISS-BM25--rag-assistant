The Expectation-Propagation algorithm for Bayesian inference, especially in Gaussian Process classification, was arguably a significant breakthrough, as it provides an efficient analytic approximation method that works almost as well as computationally expensive sampling based approaches (unlike the usual Laplace approximation).
