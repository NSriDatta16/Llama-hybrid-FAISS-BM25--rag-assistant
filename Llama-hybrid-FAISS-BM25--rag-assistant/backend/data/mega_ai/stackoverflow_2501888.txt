I agree with porneL. Attach one event handler to the and let bubbling work its magic. Most frameworks provide a way for you to find the element that caused the original event (usually referred to as a "target"). If you're making lots of elements using document.createElement(), you can add them to a DOM fragment. When you append the fragment to the page, it appends all the child nodes attached to it. This operation is faster than appending each node one-at-a-time. John Resig has a great write-up on DOM document fragments: http://ejohn.org/blog/dom-documentfragments/
