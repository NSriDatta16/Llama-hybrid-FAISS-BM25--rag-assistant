You just need to give the proper bounds in the for statements. It's important to pay careful attention when applying the low and high functions to multi-dimensional arrays. For the current example (a 2-dimensional array), low(grid) and high(grid) will return the limits on the first dimension (row), whereas low(grid[0]) and high(grid[0]) will return the limits on the first column ( assuming it exists ). Note the changed for limits below: program Play_console; {$APPTYPE CONSOLE} uses SysUtils; {$R+} procedure play; var grid: array of array of boolean; x, y: integer; begin try setLength(grid, 3, 8); grid[1, 5] := true; for y := low(grid[0]) to high(grid[0]) do begin for x := low(grid) to high(grid) do begin if grid[x, y] then write('X') else write('.'); end; writeln; end; readln; except on E:Exception do Writeln(E.Classname, ': ', E.Message); end; end; begin play; end. I tested this and it seems to do exactly what you want.
