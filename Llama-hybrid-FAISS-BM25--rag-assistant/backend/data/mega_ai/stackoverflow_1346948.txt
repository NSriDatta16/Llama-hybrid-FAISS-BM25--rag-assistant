JQuery Sortable & Clone

I got stuck into problem since 2 days. Here we have drug and drop and we want to do clone items from right box to left. If i use draggable, it works, but all droped items is no more possible to delete after drop ??? If i use both sortable, there is not posible to clone (sortible dont support clone) ??? How can i resolve this. is it bug or am i doing something wrong. Gol is to have "read only" items in right side with possibility to drag and drop to left side and after to manipulate left list with sort and delete. Tnx in advance http://slusajonline.com/dragdrop7/untitled4.html
