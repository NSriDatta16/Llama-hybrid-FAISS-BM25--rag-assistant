Appropriate distance measure between two finite state Markov chain models?

I am empirically creating Markov chains similar to this question . I end up with several finite state Markov chain models with the same nodes but varying transition probabilities. I want to calculate a pairwise distance between those models. What are appropriate distance measures to compare two Markov chains? In my case the state space are user actions in a computer system and the transition probabilities are the observed transition frequencies between different actions.
