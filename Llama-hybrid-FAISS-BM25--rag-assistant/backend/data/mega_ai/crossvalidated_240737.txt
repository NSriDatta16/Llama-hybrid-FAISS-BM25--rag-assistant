If you mean decomposing the series into a trend and an ARMA-GARCH part and then modelling them separately (the focus being on the ARMA-GARCH part in this part of the question), then this is commonly done and discussed in time series textbooks, e.g. Hyndman & Athanasopoulos "Forecasting: Principles and Practice" Chapter 6.6 "Forecasting with decomposition" or Anderson & Semmelroth "Statistics for Big Data For Dummies" (arrived at via a website on "Time Series Analysis: Forecasting with Decomposition Methods" ). Not sure, I am not familiar with wavelet thresholding. What is "correct" can be debated, but the strategy of (1) decomposing the series, (2) predicting the components, and (3) adding the forecasting of the components to form the forecast of the original series can be useful and is widespread.
