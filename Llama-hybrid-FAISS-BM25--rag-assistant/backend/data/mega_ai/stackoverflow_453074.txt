Implementing an efficient system of "unread comments" counters

I am trying to find an optimal solution for the following problem: there is a need to design a database (postgres-based), the system of triggers and counters in it, which will form a system of efficiently querying, updating and storing information on 'how much unread comments exist in each article (or blog entry, or smth. similar), that is displayed on the page'. Every solution that comes to the head, has some serious disadvantages, either in querying, or the storing, or the updating part. I.e. it needs too much storage, or too much updates, or too costy queries. What about your expirience? Maybe there is an already formed nice solution for this kind of problems?
