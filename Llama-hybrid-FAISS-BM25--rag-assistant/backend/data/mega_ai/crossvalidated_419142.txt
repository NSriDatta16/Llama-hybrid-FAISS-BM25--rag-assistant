How to calculate a -step transitions of a Discrete-time Markov Chain for Figure 17.1 (b) in book "Machine Learning - A Probabilistic Perspective"

chapter 17 of the book "Machine Learning - A Probabilistic Perspective" gives this figure which is the probability of getting from i to j in exactly n steps. Obviously A(1) = A. In the case of Figure 17.1 (b), the probability of getting from node 1 to node 3 in exactly 2 steps is $A_{13}(2) = A_{12}(1)A_{23}(1)$ Is that correct?
