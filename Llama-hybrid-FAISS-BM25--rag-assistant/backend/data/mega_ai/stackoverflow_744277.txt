Quite a difficult task to do, as there might be other reasons why they are using IE6 until this date (other, conflicting software which relies on IE6). The first thing to do would be to identfy the problem that stops IT from doing the migration - if it's not lazyness. Maybe it is easier to ask them whether they would consider an "alternative browser" to be installed (which wouldn't affect the IE6 installs). But most administrators don't like that idea, because Firefox doesn't share data/configs with Windows Servers, but trade-offs might be made in favor of money. Should there be no real obstacle, you might show them a real-life example how an average day for an IE6 developer would look like. Choose an UI-feature (combine all merits of IE6 to create one) that will work to cause the required issues for the next few steps. Show them how everything looks fine in ALL Browsers. Show them how it doesn't look fine at all in IE6. Make it IE6 compatible. Show them how every other browser now produces a different/unwanted result. Fix it (with heavy workarounds) so that it now looks "ok" in most of the browsers. Tell them that you will have to put this effort into ALL of your components/features and that they will have much higer production costs. Make sure to point out, that this would even happen if you would just compare IE6 to IE7. They may not ever switch to Safari.
