Predictions when multiple outcomes

Background and Setting I have data of this format: on each subject the list of exposure to some subtances, some demographics and then a multiple response (whether the subject developed a disease or not and if so then what type of disease). For example: Subject1 was 15 years old male living in city C; he was exposed to subtances A, B and C and the outcome: subject had skin cancer. Subject2 .... outcome: subject had psoriasis... Subject3 .... outcome: subject was healthy...etc Question I would like to be able to make predictions from these data, to estimate what disease a new subject is likely to develop given his demographics and exposure history. I tried to play around with logistic regression, but the response is not binary, it could be a multitude of outcomes/diseases (including cases of absence of disease). How can i proceed to have my predictions - if at all possible? Thanks
