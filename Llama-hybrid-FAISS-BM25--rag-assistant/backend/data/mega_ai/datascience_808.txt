Statistics + Computer Science = Data Science?

i want to become a data scientist . I studied applied statistics (actuarial science), so i have a great statistical background (regression, stochastic process, time series, just for mention a few). But now, I am going to do a master degree in Computer Science focus in Intelligent Systems. Here is my study plan: Machine learning Advanced machine learning Data mining Fuzzy logic Recommendation Systems Distributed Data Systems Cloud Computing Knowledge discovery Business Intelligence Information retrieval Text mining At the end, with all my statistical and computer science knowledge, can i call myself a data scientist? , or am i wrong? Thanks for the answers.
