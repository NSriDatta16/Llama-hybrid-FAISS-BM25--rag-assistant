2 GB is the max size for the XML data type. I've done XML Parameters with 20MB worth of text that result in 1000 rows inserted and this takes a quad xeon box that averages 500 user spids w/ connection pooling that sits around 25% cpu, w/ 16 GB of ram about 10 seconds. Edit: What XML method are you using with your SQL Select that is having the issue? XQuery? XPath? Open XML? If you could provide more of your T-SQL it would help.
