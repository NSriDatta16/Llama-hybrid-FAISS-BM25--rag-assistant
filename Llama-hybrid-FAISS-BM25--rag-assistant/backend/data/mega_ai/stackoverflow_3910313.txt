Lou is right, this is the case for 'Bayesian Inference'. The best tool/library to solve this is the R statistic programming language (r-project.org). Take a look at the Bayesian Inference Libraries in R: http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Bayesian.html How many people are in the "10% of the sample"? If it's below 100 people or so, I would fear that the results of the analysis could not be significant. If it's 1000 or more people, the results will be quite good (rule of thumb). I would fist export the data to R (r-project) and do some data cleaning necessary. Then find a person familiar with R and advanced statistics, he will be able to solve this very quickly. Or try yourself, but R takes some time in the beginning.
