The best way to help this situation is to file bugs. If you have a particular project or environment which is having a significant slow down I highly encourage you to file a bug. Often times real world customer scenarios are very instructive in tracking down performance problems in products. F#, like the rest of the languages in visual studio, process customer bugs filed via Microsoft's connect website. http://connect.microsoft.com (EDIT: In the specific case of F#, you are also welcome to email fsbugs@microsoft.com.)
