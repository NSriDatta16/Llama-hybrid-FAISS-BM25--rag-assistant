Many ways you can do Normalize the features, normalization will help reduce the "effect" of certain feature, for example in the housing prediction data, some features range between 0 and 1, but if one feature is range between 0 and 1000, that will "weight" more on that feature, so you first need to normalize the features and make them all between 0 and 1. (minmaxscaler) If the problem still persists, you might need to introduce regularization, depending on your neural network, you can add L1 or L2. Using dropout layers, this will randomly turn the features on and off, which will remove the effection of neural network depends on single features.
