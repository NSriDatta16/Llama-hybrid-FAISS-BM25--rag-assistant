Is it necessary to report the bivariate correlations when reporting logistic regression?

I am writing up a logistic regression that looks at parenting factors (ie., parental depression, anxiety and stress) as predictors of the presence of a child anxiety disorder diagnosis. What is the protocol re. reporting the bivariate correlations (accoridng to APA6- or even just generally)? Is it advised to include a table of the correlations before the logistic regression write-up? And if so, should this include the categorical DV- even though such correlations aren't very meaningful? I have never written up logistic regression and am having trouble finding many examples. Thanks for your help :)
