The access specifiers are really just labels (as in those used by goto ). People generally don't indent labels, or outdent them one level with respect to the surrounding code. So I would say this is not inconsistent at all. The Standard also uses this style for access specifiers. Example from Chapter 10, paragraph 2: class Base { public: int a, b, c; };
