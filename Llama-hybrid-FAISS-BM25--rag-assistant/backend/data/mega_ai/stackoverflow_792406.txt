The regex 'S(.{2,6}?)N' will give you only matches with length 2 - 6 characters. To return the shortest matching substring, use sorted(s1, key=len)[0] . Full example: import re p=re.compile('S(.{2,6}?)N') s='ASDFANSAAAAAFGNDASMPRKYNSAAN' s1=p.findall(s) if s1: print sorted(s1, key=len)[0] print min(s1, key=len) # as suggested by Nick Presta This works by sorting the list returned by findall by length, then returning the first item in the sorted list. Edit: Nick Presta's answer is more elegant, I was not aware that min also could take a key argument...
