Like deceze is saying, we do it using the layout, although I find our solution a bit more elegant :) In default.ctp: if(isset($cssIncludes)){ foreach($cssIncludes as $css){ echo $html->css($css); } } if(isset($jsIncludes)){ foreach($jsIncludes as $js){ echo $javascript->link($js); } } Then, in our controller actions, we define these arrays: $this->set('cssIncludes',array('special')); // this will link to /css/special.css $this->set('jsIncludes',array('jquery')); // this will link to /js/jquery.js For files that need to be loaded in each view, we simply add the same type of link "statically" to the top of the layout, like: echo $javascript->link('global'); echo $html->css('global'); This works really well for us. Good luck!
