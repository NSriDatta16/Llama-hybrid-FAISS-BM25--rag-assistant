Comparing two rates: Poisson test or Fisher test (or logistic regression)

I have a setting in which I want to compare the rate of two count quantities under two different conditions. This can be achieved in two ways: either using a Poisson test, comparing the cases and using the controls as offset ( T argument in R poisson.test() ), or using Fisher's test (or equivalently a logistic regression if data is unaggregated). The effect size is similar (OR being obviously higher than RR), but statistical significance changes, with Fisher having a slightly lower p value. Which is the correct approach? EXAMPLE: Number of treatments for hospital infection on the total number of treatments in two different years: Fisher test: matrix(c(1715, 1569, 9126 - 1715, 9059 - 1569),byrow = T, ncol = 2) %>% fisher.test() Fisher's Exact Test for Count Data data: . p-value = 0.01034 alternative hypothesis: true odds ratio is not equal to 1 95 percent confidence interval: 1.023483 1.192391 sample estimates: odds ratio 1.104698 Poisson test: poisson.test(c(1715, 1569), c(9126, 9059)) Comparison of Poisson rates data: c(1715, 1569) time base: c(9126, 9059) count1 = 1715, expected count1 = 1648, p-value = 0.02028 alternative hypothesis: true rate ratio is not equal to 1 95 percent confidence interval: 1.012629 1.162666 sample estimates: rate ratio 1.085028
