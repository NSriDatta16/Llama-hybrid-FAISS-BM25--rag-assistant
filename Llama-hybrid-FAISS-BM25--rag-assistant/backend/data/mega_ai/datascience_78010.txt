Dataquest is a great place to start. It will help you bridge the gap from just learning to actually coding as a data analyst, data engineer, or data scientist. Unlike most online courses, there are no videos, and they provide an interactive coding and learning environment that makes it very easy to learn the practical techniques you'll actually need to work on real-world data and problems. The best part about Dataquest is their guided projects that are part of every topic you learn. If you want to eventually get a job as a data analyst, scientist, or engineer, you are going to need a portfolio of projects to show what you know, and Dataquest helps guide you through the entire process. fast.ai is another great place to learn about machine learning, and deep learning in particular, all for free. They teach using a top-down approach that will get you working on your own projects and data in no time.
