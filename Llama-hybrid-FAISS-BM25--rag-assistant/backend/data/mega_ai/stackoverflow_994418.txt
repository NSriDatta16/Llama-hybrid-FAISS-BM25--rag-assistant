You just drag the library from the directory onto your Xcode project, best into resources but it does not matter (I believe). I tried with and without checking the 'copy files into bundle' and it work in both cases, not sure if you need to include it in bundle for deployment. I've tested this with sqlite3 and cocoa application (cocoa-touch).
