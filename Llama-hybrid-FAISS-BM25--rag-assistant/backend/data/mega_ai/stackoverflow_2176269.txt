Rad upload Java applet and z-index

I'm using Rad upload for drag and drop upload. It's working perfectly except I'm having a problem with the z-index. I'm also using jquery UI on the site and the overlay doesn't cover the applet. Any ideas on how to control the z-index. It would be nice if there where a setting like in flash where you control wmode. But I've tried z-index on the div that controls it and no result.
