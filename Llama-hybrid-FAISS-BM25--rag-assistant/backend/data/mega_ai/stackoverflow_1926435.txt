Yes this is possible, using the LoadFromAssembly(..) method you've already found. ... but it will only work if you have an specialized model (i.e. EDMX) for each distinct type of client application. This is because EF (and most other ORMs) require a class for each entity in the model, so if some clients don't know about some classes, you will need a model without the corresponding entities -- i.e. a customized EDMX for each scenario. To make it easier to create a new model for each client application, if I was you I'd use Code-Only following the best practices laid out on my blog, to make it easy to grab only the fragments of the model you need actually need. Hope this helps Alex
