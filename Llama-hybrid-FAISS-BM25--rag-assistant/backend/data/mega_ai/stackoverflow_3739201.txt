From your description, I would highly recommend looking into PyTables . It's not a relational database in the traditional sense, it has most of the features you're likely to be using (e.g. querying) while allowing easy storage of large, multidimensional datasets and their attributes. As an added bonus, it's tightly integrated with numpy.
