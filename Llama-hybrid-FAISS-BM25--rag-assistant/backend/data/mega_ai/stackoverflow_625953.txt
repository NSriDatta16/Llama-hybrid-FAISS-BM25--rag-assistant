Persisted properties - asynchronously

In classic ASP.NET I’d persist data extracted from a web service in base class property as follows: private string m_stringData; public string _stringData { get { if (m_stringData==null) { //fetch data from my web service m_stringData = ws.FetchData() } return m_stringData; } } This way I could simply make reference to _stringData and know that I’d always get the data I was after (maybe sometimes I’d use Session state as a store instead of a private member variable). In Silverlight with a WCF I might choose to use Isolated Storage as my persistance mechanism, but the service call can't be done like this, because a WCF service has to be called asynchronously. How can I both invoke the service call and retrieve the response in one method? Thanks, Mark
