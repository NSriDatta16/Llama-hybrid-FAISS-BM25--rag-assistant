How to interfere some text in a html link string in python

In the company I am working they use the above command to construct a link from a list of data we are holding on a map link=a % firstUpper(b) which produces something like foo I would like to alter the link string and add a title attribute to it so it becomes like foo my thought was to alter add the title in 3rd character which looks to be "most" of the times a space, but in my mind is not the most elegant solution.
