1.6 MB of memory seems like a lot but it could be the case that the memory is so badly fragmented that it can't allocate such big block of memory in one go (still this does sound very strange). One common cause of OOM while using image resources is when one is decompressing JPG, PNG, GIF images with really high resolutions. You need to bear in mind that all these formats are pretty well compressed and take up very little space but once you load the images to the phone, the memory they're going to use is something like width * height * 4 bytes . Also, when decompression kicks in, a few other auxiliary data structures need to be loaded for the decoding step.
