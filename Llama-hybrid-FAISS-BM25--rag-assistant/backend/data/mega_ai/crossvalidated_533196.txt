Your example look like longitudinal data (also called panel data), that is, many short time series . There is usually not a requirement with equispaced observations for longitudinal data models. On this site, look through panel-data . You could also, in your example, fill in the zeros. Then you have an intermittent time series, see intermittent-time-series . There is also many posts on unevenly-spaced-time-series . But for your example, maybe look into mixed models for longitudinal data. Forgetting about twin births, you will have Bernoulli data, so maybe a binomial mixed model. Or another possibility: Look at the interevent times!
