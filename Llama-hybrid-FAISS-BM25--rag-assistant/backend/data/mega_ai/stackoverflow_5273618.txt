Depending on where your files are stored you can use: Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(); or: Environment.getDataDirectory(); Both will give you the root path to their respective data. i.e. getExternalStorageDirectory() will gives me /mnt/sdcard/ on my Evo 4G since my SD card is registered as external storage for the device. After that you have to know where your files are and make your way to that folder.
