Regardless of the interaction term, this procedure isn't going to estimate the average p, because logit is a nonlinear function so the mean of the logit isn't the same as the logit of the mean. If you want to calculate the expected proportion of positive outcomes in a sample, the easiest way is to calculated the predicted p for each individual and average them.
