Ok this is what you do. When you want to subclass an object you create .h and .m files for it so. Create a file called SwipeableTextView.h and insert this code inside: #import @interface SwipeableTextView : UITextView { } @end Then create a file SwipeableTextView.m and inser this into it: #import "SwipeableTextView.h" @implementation SwipeableTextView - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { [super touchesBegan:touches withEvent:event]; [self.superview touchesBegan:touches withEvent:event]; } - (void)touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { [super touchesMoved:touches withEvent:event]; [self.superview touchesMoved:touches withEvent:event]; } -(void)touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { [super touchesEnded:touches withEvent:event]; [self.superview touchesEnded:touches withEvent:event]; } @end To use this new sublass in your project do the following. import the header: #import "SwipeableTextView.h" and then instead creating the UITextView normaly you would create SwipeableTextView like this: SwipeableTextView *sTextView = [[SwipeableTextView alloc] init]; That's it. Hope it helps.
