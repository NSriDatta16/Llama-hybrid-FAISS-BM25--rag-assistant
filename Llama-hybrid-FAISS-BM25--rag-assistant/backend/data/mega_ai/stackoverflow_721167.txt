Use O(1) storage to remember a "last node visited" pointer. You can initialize it to 0 or some unknown value. To walk the tree, start at the root node. Look at both of the node's children. If your "last visited node" is equal to the RIGHT node, then step to the parent node. If the "last visited" is equal to the LEFT node, then step to the right node. Else step to the left node. Repeat until you've finished walking the whole tree. The only real cleverness is using the one variable to remember where you're coming from in order to decide where to go next. This makes the traversal deterministic. You'll end up taking O(n) steps. You'll visit every middle node three times, and every leaf once, so you're still O(N). Storage is O(1).
