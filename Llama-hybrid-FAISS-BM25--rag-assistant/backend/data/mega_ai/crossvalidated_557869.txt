I may not be understanding your question correctly, so apologies if my answer is off topic. Using predict_proba to construct a point prediction is acceptable. However, to make a reliable probabilistic prediction (i.e. understand the accuracy of your prediction) you need to form a predictive p-value or construct a prediction interval. For example, a 75% prediction interval constructed from a sample of size $n$ will cover the next observed result 75% of the time in repeated sampling regardless of the unknown fixed true model parameters. This type of probabilistic prediction is easiest to construct when the prediction target is a continuous endpoint. When the sample space is discrete as in a logistic regression the possible error rates of the prediction interval will only come in discrete chunks.
