How to use a delay in a swing application

I am building a swing application. At some point, I have to start an "animation": ... jpanel1.setBackground(Color.Black); Delay(milli) jpanel1.setBackground(Color.White); ... and so on. The gui itself and all the logic behind it work.It is just this time depended color-changing that does not. I have read, that swing is not thread safe, but all the examples I found showed me how to start another thread (for example in the background) but never how to stop the current swing-gui thread. Edit: The application should work as following: configuration files are read, jframe is set up. some simple questions are beeing asked a dialogue is opened, which explains the animation. after the user clicked "ok" the animation - some color flashing - is started. the color and the delay between the color-changing is depended on the configuration another dialogue is opened and the programm continues -> new jpanel inside the jframe, buttons and so on. the online thing that does not work are the delays between the color-changing. I understand now why it does not work and I am trying to build a timer, which activates a actionlister, which then changes the color and stops the timer... it just seems so much work for a simple delay... and I have to reorganize the entire animation in the application.
