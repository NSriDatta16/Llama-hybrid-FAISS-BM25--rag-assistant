I have used the brms package, which is Bayesian. It supports the Weibull, exponential, lognormal, Frechet, and other families and (left/right/interval) censoring so implements AFT models. It also includes random effects which are known in survival models as "frailty", and a host of other regression options like gam-style smoothers. Since Bayesian approaches use MCMC sampling, it's slower than glm , gamlss , or survreg , but it's also a comprehensive regression solution, and being Bayesian has other advantages. (I love it's stanplot , which provides a host of illuminating diagnostic plots.)
