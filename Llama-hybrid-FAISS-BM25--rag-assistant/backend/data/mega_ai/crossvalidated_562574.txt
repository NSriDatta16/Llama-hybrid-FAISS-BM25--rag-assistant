Modern MMM implementations?

I have been working with my company's Marketing Mix Modeling solution for years now. We are looking to update our modeling methodology and are looking at different options. What are the current 'up-to-date' methods being used for MMM? For instance, when we built our current MMM solution, Bayesian methods were not really being used, while now it seems that they are very important in the space. What are the various 'state of the art' model options for MMM in 2022?
