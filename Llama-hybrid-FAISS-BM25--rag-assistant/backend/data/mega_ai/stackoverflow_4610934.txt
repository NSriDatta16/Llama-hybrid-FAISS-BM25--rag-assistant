Advice needed to properly indexing a table with many fields to be searched on

I have a user table that has many columns, it looks roughly like this: dname: { type: string(255), notnull: true } email: { type: string(255), notnull: true, unique: true } email_code: { type: string(255) } email_confirmed: { type: boolean, default: false } profile_filled: { type: boolean, default: false } password: { type: string(255), notnull: true } image_id: { type: integer } gender: { type: enum, values: [male, female] } description: { type: string } dob: { type: date } height: { type: integer(3) } looks: { type: enum, values: [thin, average, athletic, heavy] } looking_for: { type: enum, values: [marriage, dating, friends] } looking_for_age1: { type: integer } looking_for_age2: { type: integer } color_hair: { type: enum, values: [black, brown, blond, red] } color_eyes: { type: enum, values: [black, brown, blue, green, grey] } marital_status: { type: enum, values: [single, married, divorced, widowed] } smokes: { type: enum, values: [no, yes, sometimes] } drinks: { type: enum, values: [no, yes, sometimes] } has_children: { type: enum, values: [no, yes] } wants_children: { type: enum, values: [no, yes] } education: { type: enum, values: [school, college, university, masters, phd] } occupation: { type: enum, values: [no, yes] } country_id: { type: integer } city_id: { type: integer } lastlogin_at: { type: timestamp } deleted_at: { type: timestamp } I have created a form that contains most of the fields (enums, country , city) which alows the user to generate a where statement based on the fields they selected. So if someone selected smokes: no and country_id: 7 then sql where statement could look like this: SELECT id FROM user u WHERE u.deleted_t IS NULL AND u.profile_filled IS NOT NULL AND smokes = 'no' AND country_id = 7; Because user could select any combination of fields to filter by, I'm not sure how I should go about indexing this table, should I just create a single column index on all fields that can be filtered? What would you advise?
