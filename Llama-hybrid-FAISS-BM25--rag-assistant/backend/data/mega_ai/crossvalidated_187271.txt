What is the result of violated exclusion restrictions?

I have a question regarding exclusion restrictions in instrumental variable design. If I have an instrumental variable, which is also somewhat related to the outcome, would that (and how) cause problems? Does it bias the local average treatment effect in a way? Also, how is this LATE effect estimated? I am utterly confused. A simple numerical example would really help me understand.
