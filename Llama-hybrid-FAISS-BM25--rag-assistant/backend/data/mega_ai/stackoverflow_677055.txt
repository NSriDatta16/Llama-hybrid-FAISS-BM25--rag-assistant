You can use the UI library from jQuery where you'll find the draggable elements with grid . Besides that you only need to set and read some cookies that determine the position of each of the boxes. Let's say your layout has 4 s. Just save each id and position in a cookie (from javascript or by performing an AJAX request to a php/asp page). Displaying the page is also pretty easy, you have to have 2 possibilities: when the user has a cookie defined, or else (this would be the default). If the user has a cookie defined, read it and position the s like the cookie says, it shouldn't be too hard to do this.
