I'm not a C# guy. Mind if I use Java? The principle is the same. I used this concept in a game. I calculate the armor value of different monsters very differently. I suppose I could have them keep track of various constants, but this is much easier conceptually. abstract class Monster { int armorValue(); } public class Goblin extends Monster { int armorValue() { return this.level*10; } } public class Golem extends Monster { int armorValue() { return this.level*this.level*20 + enraged ? 100 : 50; } }
