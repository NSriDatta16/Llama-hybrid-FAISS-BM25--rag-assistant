Anaysis of survial data with time varying covariates

I have the survival data like following: ----------------------- ID time death var1 var2 1 1 0 3.4 5 1 2 0 4.2 6 ... 1 1092 0 5.0 2 1 1093 1 4.1 3 2 1 0 8.1 3 2 2 0 1.4 1 ------------------------ Number of unique ID is only 10, but I have thousands records for each ID. My questions are: 1: What analysis should I do when my interest is to estimate the effects of var1 to death, at each time? I am assuming the effect of var1 to death varies over time. Problem is that when table is sliced at each time, I have only 10 observations and it is difficult to do logistic regression. 2: Can I do multiple regression, time as response variable and var1 as explanatory variable? Here I use time as response, so I am afraid I cannot estimate time varying effect of var1, since time would be used for both as a response and an interaction term. 3: Are there any analysis that efficiently uses within subjects records which are time varying, other than survival analysis? Survival analysis seems to compress within ID recods to 1 record, so currently I do not think using it.
