Use of PCA to model variance for dependent variables

I am working on a math problem with some friend and there is some disagreement on the meaning of what we are doing. We have 3 independent variables measured tens of thousands times and we have a model that defines 5 dependent functions that depend on the three independent variables. In other words, call X,Y,Z our independent variables, then we create M1, M2, …, M5 which are all functions of X,Y,Z (M1 = M1(X, Y, Z), etc…). My friend claims that we can apply a Principal Component Analysis on the 8 variables (X, Y, Z, M1, …, M5) and find three principal components that will contain all the variance observed in X, Y, Z. I agree with this statement, but I don’t understand whether this is truly useful or not. Indeed when finding the principal components we are not reducing any dimensionality and we are also using it on functions that depend on X, Y, Z, which I am not sure is legitimate. So my question is this: does the application of the principal components method make any sense in our case and what do the three principal components that we find really mean?
