How to speed up web development with correct Apache caching headers setup?

Despite various measure ments to setup correct caching code in htaccess file, I still get this error: Specify a cache validator : All static resources should have either a Last-Modified or ETag header. This will allow browsers to take advantage of the full benefits of caching. Is there anything wrong with my htaccess caching settings? If you have improvements for these settings i will be very happy to hear. Thank you very much for your suggestions. Header unset Pragma FileETag None Header unset ETag ExpiresActive On ##### DYNAMIC PAGES Header set Cache-Control "public, max-age=3600, must-revalidate" ##### STATIC FILES Header set Cache-Control "public, max-age=604800, must-revalidate" Header unset Last-Modified ##### ETERNAL FILES Header set Cache-Control "public, max-age=7257600, must-revalidate" Header unset Last-Modified
