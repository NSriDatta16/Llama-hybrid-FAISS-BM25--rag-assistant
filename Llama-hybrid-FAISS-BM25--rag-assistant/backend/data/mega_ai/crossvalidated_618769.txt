It is only true in the most vacuous of senses, ie. if your neural network or logistic regression or k-NN outputs a score, there is the identity linear transformation from the neural network score to the actual score. But for things like bounded regression, logistic regression, etc. - it is not really true. With k-nn regression it is again somewhat vacuously true, if you have the scores weighted by the distance as a 'transformed feature', you can average/sum them with the linear transformation.
