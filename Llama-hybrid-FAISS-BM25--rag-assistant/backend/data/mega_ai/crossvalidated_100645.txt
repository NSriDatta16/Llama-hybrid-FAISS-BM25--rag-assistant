Normalization with error in denominator

I am trying to come up with a proper way to normalize my data. Using a microscope I want to count the percentage of green cells in a population. However, only ~0.1% of all cells are green. I decided I want to count 30 green cells, this would mean that I need to count roughly 30,000 cells to find 30 green ones. However, I do not want to manually count 30,000 cells. So I came up with a short cut. I know the exact area of a single frame under the microscope. So if I know how many cells are in a single frame, and I keep track of how many frames I imaged, I do not need to count individual non-green cells. To estimate the number of cells/frame I counted 10 random frames, this allows me to estimate an average (+/- stdev) number of cells per frame and this gives me the denominator I need. However, I am stuck at the next step. So I count green cells and have an extrapolated total number of cells. When reporting the % of green cells, I would normally # green cells/total cells. But now, I need to keep the error of the estimate into account. I am not sure how I would do that. Furthermore, I am treating these cells with different drugs to see whether the number of green cells changes. What statistics should I use, or does the variation of the denominator not matter? thanks!!
