Track changes on a database

I am not sure whether this has been asked before; I did a few searches but nothing appropriate showed up. OK, now my problem: I want to migrate an old application to a different programming language. The only requirement we have is to keep the database structure stable. So no changes in my database schema. For the rest of the application I am basically reimplementing everything from scratch without reusing old code. My Idea: in order to verify my new code was to let users do certain actions or workflows, capture the state of the database before that and after that and then maybe create unit tests with the help of this data. Does anyone know an elegant solution to keep track of these changes? Copying the database (>10GB) is pretty expensive. I also can't modify the code of the old application in which the users will be performing these sample actions. I have to keep it on the database level. My database is Oracle 10g.
