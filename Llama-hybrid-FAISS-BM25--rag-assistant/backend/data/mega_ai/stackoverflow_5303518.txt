object name as string

Is there any way in jQuery to get the name of an object as a string? i.e. if I have markers.events = { click: function(event){}, drag: function(event){} }; I would like to get a string "click" or "drag" Is this possible inside a $.each(myObj, function(){}) ? I need to do the following (hopefully) on the object stated above: $.each(markers.events, function(i, event){ google.maps.event.addListener(marker, "click/drag", event); })
