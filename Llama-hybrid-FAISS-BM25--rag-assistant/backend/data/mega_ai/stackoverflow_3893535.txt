Clean up Browser Cache

IÂ´m programming Java App. and get an error, because browser don't connect to server to take new values, just renderize from cache... I make something like this: It works fine, but when i click on a link and then click on BACK button from browser it dont call server... I tried something like: response.setHeader("Pragma", "No-Cache"); on Java and on html, but nothing make it work... anyone have a suggest?
