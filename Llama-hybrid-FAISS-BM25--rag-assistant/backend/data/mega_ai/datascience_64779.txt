Feature Selection on Aggregated Targetdata

I have a question about feature selection on a dataset where the target variable is aggregated by the sum of different data points. I want to predict the number of sales depending on a variety of features like: week price per unit store country store city 2-3 other categorical meta-data other features I am aware that this data should be interpreted as time series but because of the lack of available historical data, no model can compete with the naive approach. The problem I am facing is, that the target variable is the sum of grouped features like month, price, country and city. If I add or remove one of the grouped features I will get some identical data points and the dataset will be inconsistent, so I have to perform a grouped aggregation (sum) to get consistency back. This operation will change the target variable and the number of data points. I have no idea how to validate regression models trained on different subsets of the features because the underlying dataset is not equal. I know there are other feature selection techniques than wrapper methods like filter or embedded which provides workarounds but I would like to know if there are techniques to resolve this issue. Example: week price_per_unit store_country sales 0 1 3.0 C1 30 1 1 3.0 C2 32 2 1 4.0 C1 23 3 2 3.5 C1 19 4 2 3.5 C2 27 5 2 6.5 C1 35 6 3 2.0 C1 17 7 3 3.0 C1 15 8 3 4.0 C2 7 9 4 2.0 C1 19 10 4 5.0 C1 41 11 4 5.0 C2 21 After dropping the column store_country: week price_per_unit sales 0 1 3.0 30 1 1 4.0 23 2 1 3.0 32 3 2 6.5 35 4 2 3.5 19 5 2 3.5 27 6 3 2.0 17 7 3 3.0 15 8 3 4.0 7 9 4 5.0 41 10 4 2.0 19 11 4 5.0 21 Now there are duplicate data points and the sale column is wrong because I need the sum so after aggrgation I have: week price_per_unit sales 0 1 3.0 62 1 1 4.0 23 2 2 3.5 46 3 2 6.5 35 4 3 2.0 17 5 3 3.0 15 6 3 4.0 7 7 4 2.0 19 8 4 5.0 62 Let's assume I want to perform forward or backward selection with linear regression. In every step a column will be added or removed. So the number of rows depends on the feature which is selected. I can't think of a metric to compare these regression models.
