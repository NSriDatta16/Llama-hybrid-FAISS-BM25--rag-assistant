Silverlight Toolkit TreeView Drag and Drop

Does any know how to implement drag and drop in the silverlight toolkit's treeview? I saw the drag and drop manager for silverlight but supposedly you can put containers around the items you want to drag and drop but I wonder how I would do this on another treeviewitem exactly? Maybe there is a better way or custom way? Thanks!
