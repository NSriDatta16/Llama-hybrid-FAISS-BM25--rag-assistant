How does today's (Jules Verne) Google's Doodle work?

I am sure many of you have already checked on today's (2011-02-08) Google's doodle ( link to article on CNN if doodle changes ). It was awesome and I tried figuring out about its implementation in Firebug , some things I found out was that it has about 3 layers of images (for 3D effect) which are pan and rotated ( -moz-transform:rotate() ), etc. What I didn't found about were (and my questions): How it hid our mouse cursor when you hold on the handle, I know it's cursor:none in CSS but I still saw this CSS for the handle: #verne-drag { background: url("logos/2011/verne-hp.png") no-repeat scroll 1000px 1000px transparent; cursor: pointer;/*here its pointer not none*/ height: 150px; left: 565px; position: absolute; top: 15px; width: 150px; z-index: 700; } How it allowed dragging of handle so and swapping between 9 images according to position at the same time. Shed some light on its Javascript (I didn't find one in firebug...only that usual script for search, and this little code which just calculates mod (what about possible code other tasks) google.doodle.mod = function (a, n) {return a % n;}; 2 /* !eval(new String("google.doodle.mod = function(a,n);)) */ So simply point me out how its implemented (I have mentioned 3 but include other points which might not be that obvious). Image Resources for reference: Link to other 3 images (They were so long that was not feasible to show here) Big Fishes, shark Giant Tail Under water fauna Sky Update Myles Gray here has made a great contribution by re-implementing (and making it more readable) the Javascript Code, CSS and HTML to show us how Doodle was implemented.
