Project management for remote collaboration in prediction

Are there any tools for remote collaboration in prediction or machine learning settings? I am looking for a computing environment that includes appropriate source control, keeps track of how different datasets are being matched to different algorithms, and facilitates blending of various predictions. What tools would be useful for this?
