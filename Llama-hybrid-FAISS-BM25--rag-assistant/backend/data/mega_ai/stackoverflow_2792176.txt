Sessions aren't bad per se . But they should not be abused neither. You must especially avoid the "Oh, I need this piece of information here and here, let's store it in the session and reuse it later". Instead of doing a proper OO design where information is passed around correctly in parameters, the session is used as a global unorganized storage -- which leads to potential mess. Such global state also impedes the testability. A big unorganized session also leads to increased memory usage. An alternative to session state can be the viewstate, for instance. (I don't know if you speak about the session state, or the whole concept of session. If it's the latter, my answer is not really appropriate)
