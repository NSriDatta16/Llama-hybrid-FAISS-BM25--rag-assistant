How To Utilize Inputs in a Neural Network?

I am using neural networks (keras in python) in order to forecast electrical demand for the next day. My model is working ok, however it is really struggling with weekends as electrical demand is lower on Saturday and Sundays. My data is half-hourly and the model takes in the previous 3 days data and the value of that hourly load from the exact same hour the previous week; and then makes a day ahead (48-step) prediction. The reason I am using the value from the previous week as there is an extremely high autocorrelation between values and their week-before value. My question is how I should utilize my inputs for maximum prediction effectiveness? One example of an idea that I had would be: given the previous week value, tweak that value using the previous 3-days data. How can I use my input data to benefit what I'm trying to achieve here, and in general? What effect does changing the positions of the two input values, layers between them, etc., have? My current model is the following: where input_121 corresponds to the week before value.
