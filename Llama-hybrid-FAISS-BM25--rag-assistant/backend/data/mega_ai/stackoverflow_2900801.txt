Wanting a type of grid for a pixel editor

I am currently trying to develop a basic pixel editor application to build up my programming experience with Java. I am designing it so the user has several colour options on, they click on an option and then they can drag over the cells in the grid and they change colour (like a typical image editor, but with a sort of snap on to each grid cell) Any idea of what Java component, if any, is able to implement this type of grid in Java? I had thought of each cell being a JButton, but this seemed terribly inefficient and I don't think it would be possible to change the colour of each cell(button) with out individually clicking on each one. Any help appreciated.
