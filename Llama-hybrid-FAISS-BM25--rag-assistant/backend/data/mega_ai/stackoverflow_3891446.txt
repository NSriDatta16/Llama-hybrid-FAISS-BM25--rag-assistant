Common tasks in Activities methods - how to organize them?

I have some common actions fired in onPause() and onResume() methods. (Like registering and unregistering BroadcatsReceivers ) Now I put them in abstract classes and extend Activity classes. After creating some abstract classes with common actions I end up with situation when I can't extend Activity because of Java's lack of multiple inheritance. How you deal with such things? Do you duplicate code or do something smarter? I'm wondering if it's wider problem - not only concerning Android, but Java language.
