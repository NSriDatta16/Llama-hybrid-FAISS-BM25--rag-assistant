For personal projects I sometimes use names of big cities, like New York, Berlin, Tokyo etc. It' both convenient since I feel the project isn't bound to a specific technology or function and can involve into whatever it might be, while at the same time it can be a bit difficult remembering if it was Tokyo or Oslo which was doing "that" cool thing.. At work we have a tradition for more simple and descriptive names. For instance an application that uploads files according to a schedule is called ScheduledFileUploader. And then there's FileOrganizer, MailSender, DiskSpaceMonitor et.c..
