Nonclustered index with include vs nearly same Nonclustered index without; Multiple query coverage

I have two existing indices in a DB as below CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IndexTable1 ON Table (fkAnothertable) CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IndexTable2 ON Table (fkAnothertable) INCLUDE (pkTable) I had a hunch and my research seems to point that any queries that call #1 would be satisfied by #2 and that #1 is wasteful. I couldn't find a definitive answer though. Is this assumption correct and can I drop #1 and potentially improve performance?
