Cocoa: Call App Delegate Method from another Class

I'm currently trying to get the path of a file from a drag and drop operation inside of a custom view, and then pass that path to my app delegate. I'm currently using the following: - (BOOL)performDragOperation:(id )sender { NSPasteboard *pb = [sender draggingPasteboard]; NSString *type = [pb availableTypeFromArray:[NSArray arrayWithObject:NSFilenamesPboardType]]; NSArray *array = [[pb stringForType:type] propertyList]; //access the app delegate NSApplication *myApplication; myApplication = [NSApplication sharedApplication]; [myApplication uploadFiles:array]; return NO; } However, I keep getting a message that says that my app delegate doesn't respond to the "uploadFiles" method. It is declared inside of my app delegate. Am I accessing the NSApplication in the correct manner? Thanks.
