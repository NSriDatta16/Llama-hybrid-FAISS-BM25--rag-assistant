a) fit each variable with the ordinal variable with something like: Y~ measurement value + 1|subject where Y is the ordinal value score, measurement values are continious numeric, Subject is self explainatory. From this I will try to see the dependance/effect between Y and measurement value. b) After suitably aggregating the measurement variables I'll then try to make a bigger model containing more variables. This seems like a stepwise procedure and would be best avoided. A better approach to variable selection, especially is to choose your variables of interest a priori , giving due consideration to confounding. Why do you want to aggregate the measurement variables ? clmm in the ordinal package would be a good place to start. You can also consider MCMCglmm pakcage for a fully Bayesian approach. Regarding the condition number, if the model has converged without warnings, then everything should be OK, even with a high condition number. Even when it is ill-conditioned, a matrix can still be invertible. The problem is that very small changes to the matrix may make it non-invertible. If the model is taking a long time to converge, or generating warnings/errors and has a high condition number, then you may be able to overcome this by centering and/or rescaling some of the data.
