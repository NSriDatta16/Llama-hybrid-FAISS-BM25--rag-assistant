Partially answered in comments: You have a mixed design. Perhaps it would be best to write this up as a linear mixed model rather than thinking about it in ANOVA terms. You have one source of variance which is not of substantive interest to you/which you regard as random, namely the differences between your replicates. You are interested in the effects of time (factor), type of organism (factor) and treatment (factor), your fixed effects. Hence a basic model: Y ~ random intercept for replicate + time x organism x treatment. You could add random slope, allowing treatment effects or the interaction to vary across replicates. â€“ Ben
