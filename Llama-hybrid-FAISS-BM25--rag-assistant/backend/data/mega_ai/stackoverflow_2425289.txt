In browser can I get the image color where my mouse is pointing at?

There is a web application for me to build, and rather than image map, I would like to try something more elegant. The story is, there gonna be a global map where different continents are denoted by different colors. Say Australia is red and Asia is green. Will there be a way that when my mouse is hovering on the shape of Australia that my code will tell me that I am hovering on Australia by checking for the color where my cursor is currently pointing at? I know I can check for mouse coordinates on image or something else, but I really want to get something that is not depending on pre-defined values/shapes/margins. Any idea and suggestion would be much appreciated. Thanks a lot in advance.
