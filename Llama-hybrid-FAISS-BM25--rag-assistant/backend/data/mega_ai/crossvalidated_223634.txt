Be careful with just arbitrarily setting the prior odds to 50/50, and be careful with using the Bayes factor as a decision rule for model comparison. If there is some knowledge that the prior odds are not 50/50, but it's uncertain, then the uncertainty is different than assuming exactly 50/50 prior odds. For a detailed example, see this blog post: http://doingbayesiandataanalysis.blogspot.com/2015/12/lessons-from-bayesian-disease-diagnosis_27.html
