I'd like to highlight two possible options for multiclass performance metrics under class imbalance: Kohen's Kappa (see here for details in scikit.learn), and Computing one ROC curve and area under the curve (AUC) per individual class (see here for details in scikit.learn). For the latter: as you have $N$ classes, and ROC/AUC are conceptually designed for 2-class-problems, you will likely need to calculate one ROC curve and AUC value per individual class. This could be done e.g. in a "1-vs-all" manner, where you test for each class how much it is confused with other classes. The thereby obtained $N$ metrics can be used to e.g. look at the distribution of AUC values (e.g. boxplots or similar) to compare and select a best suited model from multiple models. If this process needs to be done fully automated, consider computing the mean/median and sd/mad of AUC over all classes (the first indicates the "average" performance over classes, the latter the performance spread). By doing this for all models you obtain scalar values which you could use to select a model suited for your problem.
