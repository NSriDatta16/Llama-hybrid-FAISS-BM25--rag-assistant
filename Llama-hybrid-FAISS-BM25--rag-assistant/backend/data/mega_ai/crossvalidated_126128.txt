Your question is very general. For information on what is MCMC I recommend you two great books by Robert and Casella, one with examples in R and the second, very detailed, handbook . More information on MCMCglmm package you can find in its documentation and vignettes . You can find examples of Metropolis-Hastings - one of the "classic" MCMC algoruthms - on CV, e.g. here , the same with Gibbs sampling . Those are the basic examples.
