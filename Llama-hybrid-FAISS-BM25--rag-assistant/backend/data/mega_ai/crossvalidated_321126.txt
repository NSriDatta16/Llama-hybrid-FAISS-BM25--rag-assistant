Hitting a wall with a seemingly unforecastable time series: how to deal with it?

I have a time series for which I can't seem to get any good results. I've tried multiple ARIMA models and exponential smoothing models and none of them give good results. I have 104 weeks of weekly data, and I'm trying to forecast over the next 7~8 weeks. The best I can get is a MAPE of 35%. I want to get it to 20% or better. (I've not tried Croston's because sparsity/intemittency isn't an issue). I' wondering whether there is any benefit to trying more advanced models (and the only more advanced models I can think of are NNets) or not. If ARIMA doesn't give good results, would a more complex algorithm give any better results? Or is the series just not forecastable ? What are the approaches for dealing with such a time series? Is there a way of knowing whether 35% is the best accuracy possible with the series? (I realize that the question is broad. Although I am trying to solve an immediate problem, I am also look for more general answers, as text books don't seem to address this problem).
