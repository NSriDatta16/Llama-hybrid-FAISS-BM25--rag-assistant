Determine dependent and independent variables in the data without using a priori knowledge

I have a spreadsheet with seven parameters and their values for 9000 samples. I need to determine which are dependent parameters and which are independent, i.e. which parameters control the changes in the other ones. Please let me know which algorithm might be helpful. I have thought of PCA and regression but I did not understand how I can use them to determine the independent and dependent parameters.
