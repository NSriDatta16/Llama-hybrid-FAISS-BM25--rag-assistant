Using IIS6, how can I place files in a sub-folder but have them served as if they were in the root?

Our ASP.NET 3.5 website running on IIS 6 has two teams that are adding content: Development team adding code. Business team adding simple web pages. For sanity and organization, we would like for the business team to add their web pages to a sub-folder in the project: Root: for pages of development team Content: for pages of business team But We would like for users to be able to navigate to the business team content without having to append "Content" in their URLs, as described below: Root : Default.aspx ( Available at: www.oursite.com/default.aspx ) Content : Popcorn.aspx ( Available at: www.oursite.com/popcorn.aspx ) Is there a way we can accomplish for making a config entry in an ISAPI rewrite tool for every one of these pages?
