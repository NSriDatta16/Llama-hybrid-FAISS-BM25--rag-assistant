My recommended approach will be based on Agile methodology best practices... So, you have what in Agile terms is called a "backlog" defined- that's great - and an important first step. A good Agile pace that is commonly used is a 2-3 week iteration length...and at the end you have a set of releasable features. This will establish the "heartbeat" of your development process. Next, you'll decided how to organize and group the features into Stories and Tasks. You'll want to grow the underlying architecture and let it naturally emerge based on the ordering of the Stories and Tasks that you select from your backlog. Its important to mitigate risks early - so you'll want to select early those items that are either performance or implementation unknowns that might pose the largest risk - and could result in the largest rework impact. For example - establishing the messaging infrastructure - might be an early architectural feature that might be included if you select a Story that required a persistent message to be delivered to complete a unit of work. Can you group the set of features into functional categories that might naturally evolve to describe the 1.0 release as a System of Systems? For example, the Administrative functions, the User Profile Management, Reporting, external integration layers, Database Access Objects, etc. What are the simplest Story / Use Cases that you can write - that will map to some of the ~1,000 features / requirements you've defined? Select a set of Stories (or individual Tasks from a Story - if the Story itself is too large to implement in a single interation). It will take some additional effort - but recomposing your requirements into a set of Stories/Tasks is important. You'll find that you will refactor during subsequent interations - but that your steady 2-week heartbeat iteration schedule will keep delivering real functionality. At various points you may want to schedule an architecture iteration just to focus on some cleaning-up / refactoring - and that's ok too.
