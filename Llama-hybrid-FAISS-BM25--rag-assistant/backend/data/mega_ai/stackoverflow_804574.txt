If it doesn't need to be exact there's no reason you can't use a simple word count function to determine an appropriate place to break the page (at the nearest paragraph I suppose). You could go so far as to reduce the words per page based on whether there are images in the post, even taking the size of the images into account. That could get ugly fast though, I think the best way to do it is to allow them to manually set the page dividers with a tag in the article that you can parse out. Something like [pagebreak] is pretty straightforward and you'll get much more logical and readable page breaks than any automated solution would achieve.
