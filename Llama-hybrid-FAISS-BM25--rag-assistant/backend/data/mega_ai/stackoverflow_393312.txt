My suggestion would be to do both as if you are doing only web development, then console or Windows applications may not be meaningful to complete. Another point is that there may be parts of C# that are specific to Webforms such as AJAX functionality to name one example though the ASP.Net MVC may be another worth looking at to some extent. I would start with the simple, "Hello World!" example(Which can be done in a few ways in the web case and it is worth knowing all of them, e.g. straight HTML that doesn't have anything fancy, a Response.Write in the .aspx file, a Response.Write in the code behind, and using the " " tags for the last form) and then expand on that by using storage in files or databases and work towards building up various skills around a core of seeing C# used within web stuff.
