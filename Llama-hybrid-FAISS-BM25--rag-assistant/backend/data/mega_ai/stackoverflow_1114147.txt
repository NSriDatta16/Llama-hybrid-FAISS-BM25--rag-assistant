You can't easily do this as the Javascript based Google Analytics script will not be run by the end user (unless of course, they are including your API output exactly on their display to the end user: which would negate the need for a fully fledged API [you could just offer an iframable code], pose possible security risks and possibly run foul of browser cross-domain javascript checks). Your best solution would be either to use server side analytics (such as Apache or IIS's server logs with Analog, Webalizer or Awstats) or - since the most information you would be getting from an API call would be useragent, request and IP address - just log that information in a database when the API is called.
