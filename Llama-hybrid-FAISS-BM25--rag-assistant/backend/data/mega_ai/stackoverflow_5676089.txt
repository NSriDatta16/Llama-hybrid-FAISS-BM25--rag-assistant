It's not supported out of the box and you might end up messing between the different flavours I strongly suggest, for such a goal: - to use either centralised (svn) or distributed (git, hg) SCM - to use continuus integration with 3 agents, each one in a different platform (can be VM or physical computer). You can use hudson or cruise control This way: - you develop locally, on whatever platform you prefer - you push / commit / submit your changes - the buildbox compiles on all platforms (while you can still work on the next feature) - ideally, you run your unit tests as well - once all builds on all platforms are finished, you got a status and a build on all targets This is fairly useful when wanting to deal with more than one version of Qt or compiler : the return value is definitely worth the time invested in the setup (and it scales well)
