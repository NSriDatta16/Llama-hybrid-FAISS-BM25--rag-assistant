Having looked around I can see that it is possible to protect a directory via the .htaccess by adding these lines: Order allow,deny Deny from all This apparently protects the directory so that only local non web-access is possible. This allows me to keep my includes in a subdirectory of the main site directory which is good for organisation and it can be used on the projects where I do not have access to folders outside the web root. Does anyone else use this method? Just for good measure I've put the directory permissions to execute only. And the include extension is PHP as suggested by others.
