The Hibari database app is definitely OTP-based. The server is broken into several OTP apps, including a small one for managing config and logging (gmt), a big one for the server itself (gdss), a small one for native Erlang clients (gdss_client), and separate OTP apps for each of the server-side protocol handlers (e.g. JSON-RPC, UBF, EBF/BERT). Sometimes a picture is worth at least a few hundred words. I've got some screen captures from the Erlang "appmon" (application monitor) app that shows the supervisor-and-worker process tree. Sorry, the protocol handler apps aren't shown in image #01, but they would be if I had had them running when I captured the image. The link is here: OTP 'appmon' screen shots -Scott
