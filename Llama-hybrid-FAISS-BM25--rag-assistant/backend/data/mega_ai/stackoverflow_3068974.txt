Drag and Drop from another application with mouse button down does not fire event

I am trying to drag and drop a file onto a control in my application. The problem is that when you hold the mouse button down (i.e. dragging from widows explorer), my app does not fire any of the form events. They all work fine if the mouse is not down. Is appears that I need to enable the 'AllowDrop' for the application (it is enabled on the form) What am I missing? I am developing in vb.net 2008 in windows 7 environment
