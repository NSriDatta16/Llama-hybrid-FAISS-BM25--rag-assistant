How to perform GUI task in Java

I am moving to Java from C#, and for my curiosity I like to ask question, in C# adding UI objects was drag and drop task and also changing and setting the object property was easy. How to do the GUI tasks in Java? are they like C#? and which IDE to use for it, as I have used Visual Studio 2008 for C#. Thanks
