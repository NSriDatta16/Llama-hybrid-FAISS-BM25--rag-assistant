R Logistic regression and correlation

I'm having trouble understanding the output of this logistic regression in R. Data dat Regression: fit |z|) (Intercept) -47.79642 3650.08385 -0.013 0.990 var1 22.03545 1825.04048 0.012 0.990 var2 0.08264 0.05621 1.470 0.142 (Dispersion parameter for binomial family taken to be 1) Null deviance: 145.993 on 111 degrees of freedom Residual deviance: 45.062 on 109 degrees of freedom AIC: 51.062 Number of Fisher Scoring iterations: 18 From the results, the var1 has a very high p value, so my understanding is that in contribute poorly in predicting the 'outcome'. But when I look at the correlation between the 2, they are highly correlated. And the inverse is true, var2 has a lower p-value but not a good correlation with 'outcome' Can anyone explain, why ? This is probably trivial, but I can't find the answer. cor(dat) var1 outcome var2 var1 1.0000000 0.8671209 0.1029565 outcome 0.8671209 1.0000000 0.1587125 var2 0.1029565 0.1587125 1.0000000
