What is the best way of graphical or visual representation of confusion matrix?

I have classified the 15 classes dataset using machine learning algorithms. I don't want to put confusion matrix table since it is 15x15 matrix, instead, I want to represent it in a graphical way, which is more pleasant to visualize. Would you kindly recommend any technique? It would be better if it is using ggplot. Thank you so much. Waiting for your reply.
