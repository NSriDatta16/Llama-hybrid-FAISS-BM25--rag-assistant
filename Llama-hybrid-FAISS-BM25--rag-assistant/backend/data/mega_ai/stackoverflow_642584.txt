WPF Grid Question, can I determinate the absolute position of something, which is positioned automatically in a WPF Grid?

I like to use a grid to position some objects in WPF, because it cares about the position and stuff. In addition, however I also like to be able to draw accross the cells with a Canvas. I figured out that this can be done by embedding the grid in a canvas. However in order to connect two elements, I need then the absolute position in pixels.. any ideas?
