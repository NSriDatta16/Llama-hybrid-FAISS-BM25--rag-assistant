How's frequent pattern mining in data mining?

I am reading a paper Frequent pattern mining:current status and future directions . From this paper I learned that a lot of people did some interesting jobs in this field. But this review is published in 2007. And as the size of data becomes bigger and bigger, in my opinion, frequent pattern mining which based on sparse data may not compete with Neural Network anymore? Hope someone can tell some recent news about frequent pattern mining.
