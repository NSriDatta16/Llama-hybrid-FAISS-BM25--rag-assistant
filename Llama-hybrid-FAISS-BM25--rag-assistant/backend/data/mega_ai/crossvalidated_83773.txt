Continuous time Markov chain forward equation

This is a homework question and I need suggestion how to approach it. We have given the transitions $\ i\rightarrow i+1$ with rate $\lambda(i)$ where $\ i \ge 1$ $\ i\rightarrow i-1$ with rate $\mu(i)(i-1)$ where $\ i \ge 2$ I am starting the forward equation like this: $$\ p_j(t) = [1-(\lambda_jh+\mu_jh +o(h))p(t)]+ \lambda(j-1)p(j-1)(t)h + ...$$ and I cannot really continue from here. I need to get to the point where I can show that $$\ G(z, t) = \sum P(N(t)= j|N(0) = a) z^j $$ satisfies $$\frac{\partial G}{\partial t} = z \left( z-1\right) \left(\lambda\frac{\partial G}{\partial z}- \mu\frac{\partial^2 G}{\partial z^2}\right)$$
