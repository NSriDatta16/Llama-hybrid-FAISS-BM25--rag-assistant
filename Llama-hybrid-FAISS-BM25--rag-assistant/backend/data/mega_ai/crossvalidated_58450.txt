I don't think the $u_i$s will go to infinity. If $C$ is set to zero this effectively disables the inequality constraints, so the optimisation problem is just to minimise the squared norm of the weights, which has a trivial solution at $w = 0$. Substituting this into $y_i(w \cdot x_i + b) \geq 1 - u_i$ gives $y_i b \geq 1 - u_i$ which is satisfied by $u_i = 1 - y_i b$. This means there will be a solution where the $u_i$ are finite, provided a sensible choice is made for $b$. Whether the software actually finds this solution is another matter though; however as setting C=0 is effectively telling the SVM to completely ignore the training data, it is perhaps not too surprising that the programmer didn't consider this!
