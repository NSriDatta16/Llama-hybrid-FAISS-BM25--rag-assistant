Why are Winsorized random variables independent?

While studying trimmed mean I understood that if I have some random variables $X_1, X_2, .., X_n$ by ordering them and trimming, the variables are no longer independent. However it is said that "by re-writing the trimmed mean as the average of independent variables" one can re-use the standard estimation of variance. This re-writing I know that proposes Winsorizing the values. The trimming consists of eliminating a given percentile of values from the sample. The Winsorized sample is the one which has values less then a given percentile censored, and to an upper percentile censored also. It is clear that the trimmed mean is not the same as the Winsorized mean. But how can one conclude formally that the variables after Winsorizing the variables are independent? [Later edit] The question arise during the study of the book "Fundamentals of Modern Statistical Methods, Substantially Improving Power and Accuracy, 2nd edition - Rand R. Wilcox". The following quotes are from pages: 149-151. [my note: as an introduction we have a $X_1,X_2,..,X_n$ i.i.d. standard normal variables, they are trimmed and a trimmed mean with $20\%$ is built. It follows a discussion on estimating variance of trimmed mean.] Consequently, the method we used to determine an expression for the variance of the sample mean is an average of dependent variables. (In fact, there is yet one more complication: The variances of the ordered variables are not equal to $\sigma^2$. A major theoretical advance during the 1960s was the derivation of a mathematical technique that leads to a convenient and practical method for estimating the variance of the sample trimmed mean. The method consists of rewriting the trimmed mean as the average of independent variables so that the strategy used to determine the variance of the sample mean can again be employed. The mathematical details are not given here; [..] [my note: next follows an description of how to build an Winsorized sample variance and concludes with the estimand] $$ VAR(\bar{X_t}) = \frac{s^2_w}{(1-2\gamma)^2n}$$ [my note: where $X_t$ is trimmed variables, $s^2_w$ is Windsorized sample mean, $\gamma$ is the trimmed quantity ($0.2$ in this case), $n$ number of sample values]
