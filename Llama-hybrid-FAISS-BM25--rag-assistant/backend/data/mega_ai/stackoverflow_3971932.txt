If your compiler supports this just put the declaration inside the for statement: for (unsigned i = 0; i This is as elegant and efficient as it can be. Modern compilers can do loop unrolling and all that stuff, trust them. If you don't trust them, check the assembler. And it has one little advantage to all other solutions, for everybody it just reads, "do it twice".
