Best Programming Language for Data Science

I'm learning JS, HTML and CSS, but I doubt JS is very good at Data Analysis. So, what would you guys recommend me learning to start my "career" in Data Science? What's the best programming language for processing data? P.S. I love statistics and programming so I think this will be fun.
