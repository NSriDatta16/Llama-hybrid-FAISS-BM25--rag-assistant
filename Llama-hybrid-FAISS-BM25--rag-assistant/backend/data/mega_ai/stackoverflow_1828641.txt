How to parse a URI like this in Java

I'm trying to parse the following URI : http://translate.google.com/#zh-CN|en|你 but got this error message : java.net.URISyntaxException: Illegal character in fragment at index 34: http://translate.google.com/#zh-CN|en|你 at java.net.URI$Parser.fail(URI.java:2809) at java.net.URI$Parser.checkChars(URI.java:2982) at java.net.URI$Parser.parse(URI.java:3028) It's having problem with the "|" character, if I get rid of the "|", the last Chinese char is not causing any problem, what's the right way to handle this ? My method look like this : public static void displayFileOrUrlInBrowser(String File_Or_Url) { try { Desktop.getDesktop().browse(new URI(File_Or_Url.replace(" ","%20").replace("^","%5E"))); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } Thanks for the answers, but BalusC's solution seems to work only for an instance of the url, my method needs to work with any url I pass to it, how would it know where's the starting point to cut the url into two parts and only encode the second part ?
