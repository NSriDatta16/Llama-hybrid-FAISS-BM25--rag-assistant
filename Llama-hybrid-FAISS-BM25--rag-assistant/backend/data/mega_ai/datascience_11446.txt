Anomaly detection in Time Series Data - Help Required

I am looking for algorithms on Anomaly detection for time series data. It is uni-variate analysis, considering single parameter (inlet pressure) of air compressor sensor data. The objective is to detect if there is any significant deviation in parameter value in real time. If any one has worked on similar projects, please share your thoughts.
