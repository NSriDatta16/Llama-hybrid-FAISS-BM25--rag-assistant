Is there a GLM likelihood for tables of counts conditioned on row and column sums?

Multinomial logistic regression corresponds to the setting where each data point has a vector of counts whose total we condition on. The logistic/softmax link + multinomial likelihood is appropriate here. However, I have a setting where every data point corresponds to a table of counts $y_{ij}$. Is there a likelihood which conditions on the row sums $y_{.j}$ and column sums $y_{i.}$? (i.e. the assumption made by Fisher's exact test for example). I know one way to approach this would be to consider every individual count as a data point and include a fixed effect for every row & column, but this isn't appealing since I have >1e5 data points.
