This depends somewhat on how your server expects the data, which in turn depends on what language / framework you're using server-side. If your server can easily handle multiple fields with the same name, it's very straightforward. (This example uses jQuery for simplicity.) function onAddMore() { var $form = $("#myForm"); var $foo = $form.find("[name=foo]").eq(0); // the first (original) foo $form.append($foo.clone()) $foo.val(""); } When the user submits the form normally, your query will look something like foo=bar&foo=baz&foo=quux . Here's an example of how to iterate over the values in Python CGI . form = cgi.FieldStorage() for foo in form.getlist("foo"): # do something with foo Or in PHP (note that for PHP, the field must be named foo[] ). for ($_GET["foo"] as $foo) { // $_POST would work the same way, of course // do something with $foo }
