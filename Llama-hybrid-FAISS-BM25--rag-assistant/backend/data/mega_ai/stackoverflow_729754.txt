I second Marc suggestion. Do not go the XML route. You probably don't know when/how will your app grow. With xml you don't have transactions, check constraints to guard integrity of your data, .... Databases are not just dumb storage. Use some free express db version. This way you could easily migrate to more professional DBMS versions.
