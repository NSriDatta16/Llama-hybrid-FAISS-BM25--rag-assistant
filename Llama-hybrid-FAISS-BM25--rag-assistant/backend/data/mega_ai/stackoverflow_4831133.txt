Those are the possible solutions I came up with-- however, I cannot store my index on FSDirectory (project specs do not allow this) and for RAMDirectory, there are going to be thousands of Person objects we'll need to search through so I don't know if in-memory storage is ideal for this situation. Is there any other sort of fuzzy match algorithm I can use that will be efficient for large sets of data?
