Calculating power for a logistic regression analysis

I'm wanting to calculate the level of power achieved in a logistic regression analysis in G*Power using alpha of .05 and two-tailed test. My research question was looking at whether scores on an IAT (IV1 - normal distribution) could predict insufficient or sufficient levels of exercise engagement (binary DV), over and above 2 explicit measures of motivation (IV2; IV3 - negative skews) and whether this relationship was moderated by another variable (Mod - normal distribution; including the interaction term in the analysis). Total number of covariates in the analysis was 6 (including the interaction term). With a sample size of N = 99, I found the model was a significant fit Â²(6, N = 99) = 23.85, p
