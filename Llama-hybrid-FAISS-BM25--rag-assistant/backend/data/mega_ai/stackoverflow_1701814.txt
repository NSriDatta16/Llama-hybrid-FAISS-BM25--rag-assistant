The Really Elegant way to do this is NOT to use associative arrays at all: make an array of objects. Turn your element into a Class which has a constructor, and title, cat_title, and sec_title as fields. Then make them private and use setters (or use a constructor) where you will check the data and perform any validation or transformation you need.
