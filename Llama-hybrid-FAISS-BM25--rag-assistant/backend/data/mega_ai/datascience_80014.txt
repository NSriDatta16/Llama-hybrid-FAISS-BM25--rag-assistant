NotFittedError says this StandardScaler instance is not fitted yet while using inverse_transform()

I have a dataset and i have used Support Vector Regression .So i needed to use StandardScaler module from sklearn.preprocessing fro Feature Scaling. After training my model when i came to predict it was giving a prediction which was Feature scaled.That's why i used inverse_transform from StandardScaler() and getting a error saying NotFittedError: This StandardScaler instance is not fitted yet. Call 'fit' with appropriate arguments before using this estimator. I have tried several solutions but it's getting the same error. What can i do now? My dataset Here is my code : import numpy as np import pandas as pd import seaborn as sbn import matplotlib.pyplot as plt df = pd.read_csv('Position_Salaries.csv') x = df.iloc[:,1:2].values y = df.iloc[:,2:].values from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler x = StandardScaler().fit_transform(x) y = StandardScaler().fit_transform(y) from sklearn.svm import SVR regressor = SVR(kernel = 'rbf') regressor.fit(x,y) y_pred = regressor.predict(StandardScaler().fit_transform(np.array([[6.5]]))) y_pred = StandardScaler().inverse_transform(y_pred) Error log :
