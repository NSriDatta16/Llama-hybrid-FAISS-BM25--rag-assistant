You need something like: var paragraphsQuery = xDoc.Elements("novel") .Elements("paragraphs") .Elements("paragraph") .Select(p => p.Elements("choice") .Select(c => c.Value) .ToList()) .ToList(); In other words, at the top level you want one item per "paragraph" element. Then for each item, you want to find the values of the "choice" elements, and turn them into a list. (That will use lists rather than arrays - you could use arrays if you really want, but lists are usually simpler to work with.)
