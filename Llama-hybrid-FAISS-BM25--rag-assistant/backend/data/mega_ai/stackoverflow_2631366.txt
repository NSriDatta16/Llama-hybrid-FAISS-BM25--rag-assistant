Custom cases of product in Magento?

Setting a Magento store for a winery. They well bottles of wine, but you can only order bottles in cases of wine. There are 12 bottles of wine in a case, and you can make a custom case. So user could pick 4 Chardonnay, 6 Merlot and 2 Shiraz to make a case of 12. But they could not just choose 4 Chardonnay and 6 Merlot. Orders have to be in multiples of 12. Is there any way in Magento via default functionality or an extension to enforce this requirement in my Magento store? thanks
