The reasons to use dynamic storage include (but probably not limited to) Manual control of the objects lifetime - the object will live until you explicitly destroy it Creating as many objects as necessary, when the final number of objects is only known at run-time (like number of nodes in a tree or number of elements in an array). Run-time control of the object's type (like actual type of polymorphic object). When it makes no difference, it is always better to create the object using your t3 method. Don't use dynamic memory unless you have to. But sometimes you really have to (see the reasons above).
