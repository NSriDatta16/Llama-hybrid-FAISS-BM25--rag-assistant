Is there any elegant way in LINQ to bucket a collection into a set of lists based on a property

i have a collection of cars. I want to bucket this into separate lists by a property of the car . . .lets say brand. So if i have a collection of some Ford, some Chevy, some BMW, etc, i want a seperate list for each of those buckets. something like: IEnumberable myCarCollection = GetCollection(); List > buckets = myCarCollection.BucketBy(r=>r.Brand) does something exist like this or do i need to do this "manually" through loops
