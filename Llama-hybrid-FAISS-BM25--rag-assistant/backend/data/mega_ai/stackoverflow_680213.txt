A First Chance Exception

've been running through the MSDN help documents to get a hang of Visual Basic. After trying out the example using timers --one drags a label and timer component into the designer and adds the following to the components subroutine Label1.Text = My.Computer.Clock.LocalTime.ToLongTimeString The output for the immediate window during debug is the following A first chance exception of type 'System.InvalidCastException' occured in Microsoft.VisualBasic.dll A first chance exception of type 'System.InvalidCastException' occured in Microsoft.VisualBasic.dll The same error occurs on a previous MSDN example using a context menu component. Should I Try...Catch...Finally this error and try to move on? Or, am I dealing with something much more serious?
