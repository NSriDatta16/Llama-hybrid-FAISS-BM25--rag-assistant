Speaking of prior knowledge can be misleading, that is why you often see people speaking rather about prior beliefs . You do not need to have any prior knowledge to set up a prior. If you needed one, how would Longley-Cook manage with his problem? Here is an example from the 1950s when Longley-Cook, an actuary at an insurance company, was asked to price the risk for a mid-air collision of two planes, an event which as far as he knew hadn't happened before. The civilian airline industry was still very young, but rapidly growing and all Longely-Cook knew was that there were no collisions in the previous 5 years. Lack of data about mid-air collisions was not a problem to assign some prior to it that lead to pretty accurate conclusions as described by Markus Gesmann . This is extreme example of insufficient data and no prior knowledge, but in most real life situations you would have some out-of-data beliefs about your problem, that can be translated to priors. There is a common misconception about priors that they need to be somehow "correct", or "unique". In fact, you can purposefully use "incorrect" priors to validate different beliefs against your data. Such approach is described by Spiegelhalter (2004) who describes how a "community" of priors (e.g. "skeptical", or "optimistic") can be used in decision-making scenario. In this case it is not even prior beliefs that are used to form priors, but rather prior hypotheses. Since when using Bayesian approach, you include both the prior and data into your model, information from both sources will be combined. The more informative is your prior comparing to data, the more influence it would have, the more informative is your data, the less influence would your prior have . Eventually, "all models are wrong, but some are useful" . Priors describe beliefs that you incorporate in your model, they do not have to be correct. It is enough if they are helpful for your problem, as we are dealing only with approximations of reality that are described by your models. Yes, they are subjective. As you already noticed, if we needed prior knowledge for them, we would end up in a vicious circle. Their beauty is that they can be formed even when confronted with shortage of data, so to overcome it. Spiegelhalter, D. J. (2004). Incorporating Bayesian ideas into health-care evaluation.
