After along time, now I'm back again in order to answer my own question maybe somebody in the future ( or maybe in the past ;) can get intuition from that. The reason for the fact that my training error become almost flat and doesn't get improved is the nature of my data . After examining thoroughly into my data I found that outputs of my neural network are close together and for this reason machine can't learn anymore. Suppose you are training a model on images and all the pixels in the image has close value in RGB together. I hope this would be helpful.
