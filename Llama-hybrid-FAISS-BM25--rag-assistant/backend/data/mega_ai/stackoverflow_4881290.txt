The problem is that curl's --data parameter sends the text exactly as you provide it, but you are not url-encoding reserved characters (specifically, the [ and ] characters), so the server will not be able to match up the value of the helpdocid field correctly. On a side note, don't include the "submit=Go" field in your posted data. Only fields with both names and values get submitted. Try this: curl --data "searchcontent=&helpdocid=%5Bdocid%5D&searchtext=121315" http://www.ausstats.abs.gov.au/ausstats/searchclass.nsf/(Searchattmnt)?openagent
