Using doc2vec embeddings as model input our perhaps similarity comparison?

Doc2vec is an extension of word2vec, which creates vector representations of documents. One can use this representations as input to some classifier/regression(Logistic Regression, XGboost, LightGBM ...). What about using the similarity as a prediction. Let's say you define some typical examples of classes through clustering or by choice and than you similarity to these examples as a prediction. Is that a decent plan? Is it something that is used with doc2vec/word2vec.
