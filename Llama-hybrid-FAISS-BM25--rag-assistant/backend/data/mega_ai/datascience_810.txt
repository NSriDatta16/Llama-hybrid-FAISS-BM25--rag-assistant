Should I go for a 'balanced' dataset or a 'representative' dataset?

My 'machine learning' task is of separating benign Internet traffic from malicious traffic. In the real world scenario, most (say 90% or more) of Internet traffic is benign. Thus I felt that I should choose a similar data setup for training my models as well. But I came across a research paper or two (in my area of work) which have used a "class balancing" data approach to training the models, implying an equal number of instances of benign and malicious traffic. In general, if I am building machine learning models, should I go for a dataset which is representative of the real world problem, or is a balanced dataset better suited for building the models (since certain classifiers do not behave well with class imbalance, or due to other reasons not known to me)? Can someone shed more light on the pros and cons of both the choices and how to decide which one to go choose?
