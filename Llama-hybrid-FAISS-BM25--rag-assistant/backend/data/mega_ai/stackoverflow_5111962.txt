Efficiency Problems with Finger Drawing

I want to develop an app to draw touching the iPhone screen an searching how to do it I have found an example recipe (09-Paint) into the chapter eight of the Erica Sadun iPhone Developers Cookbook 3.0 Code Samples . In the example, as you could see under this lines, the touches over the screen are stored into an NSMutableArray to later be drawn using the UIView method drawRect . With this solution I have a problem when the points array keeps an important number of points. How can I solve this problem? How can I call the drawRect method without clearing the UIView and just adding the last line (between the already painted line and the last point of the points array)? // Start new array - (void) touchesBegan:(NSSet *) touches withEvent:(UIEvent *) event { self.points = [NSMutableArray array]; CGPoint pt = [[touches anyObject] locationInView:self]; [self.points addObject:[NSValue valueWithCGPoint:pt]]; } // Add each point to array - (void) touchesMoved:(NSSet *) touches withEvent:(UIEvent *) event { CGPoint pt = [[touches anyObject] locationInView:self]; [self.points addObject:[NSValue valueWithCGPoint:pt]]; [self setNeedsDisplay]; } // Draw all points - (void) drawRect: (CGRect) rect { if (!self.points) return; if (self.points.count Thanks for reading.
