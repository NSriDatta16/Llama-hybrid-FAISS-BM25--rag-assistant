How to treat predictor time series when their length is smaller than the value to be forecasted and it is not possible to increase it?

I want to use EUR/USD historical data as a predictor for stock return in my Machine Learning project. But I have data for the stock since 1986. At the same time, the data for the currency pair is from around the time the Euro was introduced as a currency - 1999. I would like to know how to deal with this missing data since it is obviously impossible to "invent" it on my own.
