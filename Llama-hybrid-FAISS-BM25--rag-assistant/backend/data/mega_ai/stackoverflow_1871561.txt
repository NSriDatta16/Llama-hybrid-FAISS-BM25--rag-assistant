I'd hack it. bus_id int path varchar(max) If a bus goes through the following stations (in this order): 01 03 09 17 28 Then I'd put in a record where path was set to '-01-03-09-17-28-' When someone wants to find a bus to get from station 03 to 28, then my select statement is select * from buses where path like '%-03-%-28-%' Not scalable, not elegant, but dead simple and won't churn through tables like mad when trying to find a route. Of course, it only works if there's a single bus that goes through the two stations in question.
