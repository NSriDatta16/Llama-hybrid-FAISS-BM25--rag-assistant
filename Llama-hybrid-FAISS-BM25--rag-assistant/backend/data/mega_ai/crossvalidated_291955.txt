Bayesian Biased Prior Formula

I know that for a Bayesian uniform/flat prior, the formula is 1/n (and n=1), as each value has an equal chance of being chosen. However, is there an equation for when the prior is biased/informative? For example, so that the prior is skewed to the left or to the right?
