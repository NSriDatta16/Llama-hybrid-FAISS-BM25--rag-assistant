Motivated by Prof. Guo's paper & Prof. Kim's course materials (see links in the comments below), I've found the answer to this question. I'll post it below in case other folks run into similar questions. The maximum value of $E[Var(X+Z_1\mid X+Z_2)]$ is $3/2$ and is indeed achieved by $X\sim N(0,1)$, as speculated in Remark #3 in the question. The proof is outlined below. First, note that $E[Var(X+Z_1\mid X+Z_2)]$ is the (average) MMSE of estimating $X+Z_1$ based on observation of $X+Z_2$. Clearly, for any distribution of $X$, the MMSE cannot be greater than linear MMSE, or LMMSE. For any given distribution of $X$, the LMMSE $= \sigma_U^2-\frac{Cov(U,V)^2}{\sigma_V^2}=2-\frac{1}{\sigma_X^2+1}\leq 3/2$, independent of the distribution of $X$! ($U$ & $V$ denotes $X+Z_1$ & $X+Z_2$, respectively.) Therefore, $E[Var(X+Z_1\mid X+Z_2)]\leq 3/2$ for any distribution of $X$. Moreover, if $X\sim N(0,1)$, $X+Z_1$ & $X+Z_2$ will be jointly Gaussian. It's well known that in this case MMSE is identical to LMMSE. So the maximum expectation is achieved by Gaussian distribution of $X$.
