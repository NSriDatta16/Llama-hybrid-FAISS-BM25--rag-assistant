Will the fact that my Italian son is going to attend a primary school change the expected number of Italian children to be present in his class?

This is a question stemming from a real-life situation, for which I have been genuinely puzzled about its answer. My son is due to start primary school in London. As we are Italian, I was curious to know how many Italian children are already attending the school. I asked this to the Admission Officer while applying, and she told me they have on average 2 Italian children per class (of 30). I am now at the point in time where I know that my child has been accepted, but I have no other information about the other children. Admission criteria are based on distance, but for the purpose of this question, I believe we could assume it's based on random allocation from a large sample of applicants. How many Italian children are expected to be in my son's class? Will it be closer to 2 or 3?
