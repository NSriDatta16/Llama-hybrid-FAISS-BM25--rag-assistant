It sounds simply like your model was simply projected to consider a bivariate relationship between a single regressor and your outcome. The additive assumptions of the GLM ensure that the conditional mean relation between a first regressor and the outcome does not vary for other levels of the second regressor. The second regressor merely functions like a intercept term to obtain that conditional mean relationship. For instance, suppose I model cancer risk $E[Y]$ as a function of age $X_1$ and smoking $X_2$. Suppose further I obtain a model $E[Y|X_1, X_2] = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2$ from logistic regression. If I turn my attention to predicting cancer risk for a participant of a particular age, say 45, then the model simplifies as the following: $E[Y|X_1= 45, X_2] = (\beta_0 + \beta_1 45) + \beta_2 X_2$ Where for this conditional logit model, $\beta_0 + \beta_1 45$ functions like a predicted intercept.
