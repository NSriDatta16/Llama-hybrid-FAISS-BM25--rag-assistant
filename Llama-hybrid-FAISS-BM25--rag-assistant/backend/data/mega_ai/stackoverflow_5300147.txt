Are there any issues with deeply nested master pages in ASP.NET?

I'm using ASP.NET nested master pages on my site, but I actually have more than one level of nesting. All of the examples out there generally address a simple scenario of a single master page ("M") and several nested master pages ("A", "B", and "C") that derive from "M". In my case, I'd really like to have many more deeply nested levels. M => A => A1 M => A => A1 => X M => A => A1 => Y M => B => B1 M => B => B2 etc. Is this the right way to organize my master pages? Are there any performance penalities to having deeply nested master pages?
