How should I store user agent data?

When we detect these items for visitors: Browser name Browser version OS name OS version Screen resolution Screen depth Flash enabled ... Should these all be stored in the database in separate columns or should I be storing it all as a user agent string and then breaking it down in the application? And should I use varchar(255) for this just to be safe or are there well-defined datatypes for these items? I use MySQL and PHP
