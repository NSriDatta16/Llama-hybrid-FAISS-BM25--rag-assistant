There are several different ways you can achieve smaller sizes. Your data seems to have large runs of small changes. You could also try doing your polynomial fit, and using single float precision. Write the first value out using 8 bits, than encode all others using a fixed-size 4-bit delta encoding; due to size changes this unfortunately menas that you can only capture +/-7 in terms of value. A variant on this would be that if the value is +/-7, that you then encode the rest of the delta in a subsequent value. Another variant would be to write out the sign of the delta using 1 bit and then using a VInt style encoding for smaller number of bits (e.g. outputing 1 or 2 bits in each shortend-VInt). Encode your data as a series of sequences. There can be two forms of sequences, one would be raw, the other would write out an average value (8 bits) and delta's (3 or 4 bits depending on another 1 bit output). Then there would be an indicator of length of sequence, then the encoding of the sequence itself. Of course, if you want to get it much smaller you can use LZ compression, Huffman / Range encoding etc.
