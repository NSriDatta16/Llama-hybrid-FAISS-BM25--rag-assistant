It may help you to read my answer here: Difference between logit and probit models , which discusses GLiM links somewhat extensively. The basic way of explaining this issue is laid out clearly by @BlainWaan, and Wikipedia: The actual parameter (e.g., $p$ for a binomial response--i.e., logistic regression) cannot range from negative infinity to positive infinity, but your predicted parameter will. The second big reason is that without a properly specified link, the variances of your residuals will not be constant (a required assumption for inference with an Ordinary Least Squares estimate) or handled correctly. Another way to go at this issue is that by using the identity link (this is another way of saying / thinking about 'not using' a link function) means that you are thinking about your situation incorrectly in a way that necessarily distorts the picture of your situation that you derive from your analysis. For example, unless the true probabilities that you are trying to model (again for logistic regression situations) exist only in the middle of the range (where they are fairly linear), and the range of $X$ you are examining is centered on the point where $p=.5$ , your betas will be biased and your predicted $\hat p_{x_i}$ 's will be far from the true values. In addition, your inferences will be distorted as well (e.g., the type I error rate won't equal $\alpha$ ).
