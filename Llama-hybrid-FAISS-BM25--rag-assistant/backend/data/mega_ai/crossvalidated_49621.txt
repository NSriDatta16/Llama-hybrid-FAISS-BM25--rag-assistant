If you have infected and uninfected individuals and a level of exposure (in this case Cytokine levels) you should be able to calculate a relative risk, and an appropriate 95% CI after adjustment. These can then be used in a plot that looks very similar to a boxplot if your levels are organized categorically, or a line diagram if your cytokine levels are more continuous. For example, but with categorical levels rather than studies on the X-axis. I'll post an example for continuous variables once I get off a train and have a working copy of R.
