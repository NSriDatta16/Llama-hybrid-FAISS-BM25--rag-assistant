What you have is K (5) Groups where you have a dependent (water temp) and an independent series(air temp). This problems is called Pooled Cross-Sectional Time Series Analysis. Construct a separate Transfer Function (ARMAX) model for each of the K groups. Identify a common model (outlier resistant) that would be appropriate. Estimate that model globally using all of the data and then perform an F test to test the hypothesis of a common set of parameters. Upon finding a statistically significant F value examine the coefficients to determine which groups (of the K) that are similar. My current research has been to develop an automatic test for this and we have it operational in a current Beta Version of AUTOBOX ( http://www.autobox.com ). I would be glad to demonstrate this for you, please post your data. Upon finding out how AUTOBOX conducts this test you might be able to program it yourself or at least have a "destination". Hope this helps. ADDITIONAL COMMENTS USING KATE'S DATA: I took the first 4 Groups ( depth of .5,4,6 and 8) and used the first 52 values to construct this example analysis. Following are 4 graphs depicting the Y (water temp) and the X (Air temp) over time for the 4 depths; depth1 ; ; depth 2; ; depth 3; and depth 4; . An analysis of the within relationship of Y versus X yielded a typical model of the form . I elected to add another AR term to the noise for purposes of a more general expression. All four examples are significantly influenced by anomalies so one might argue/suggest that one should continue with outlier-adjusted series or intervention-scrubbed series i.e. "cleansed series". For presentation purposes here this was not done. We now proceeded to estimate the "typical model" for each of the 4 data sets AND for the composite. This yielded . The F test is simply the Chow Test for constant parameters http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chow_test which yielded a significant F. The Chow test simply sums the error sos from each of the 4 cases (each with 52 values) and compares it to the error sos for the composite (208 values). Hope this helps.
