Over the years I have realized that understanding Statistics well would enable you to solve a large number of business problems and is very important too as a first step. You could take Khan Academy Probablity and Statistics Course https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability For Machine Learning you could read "An Introduction to Statistical Learning by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani". Wonderful book. It feels almost like a novel and is beatifully written with examples and code in R. I would also recommend Andrew NG course on Machine Learning. For Deep Learning, I took the CS231 course by Andrew Karpathy but I liked this brilliant free online book by Micheal Nielson more. http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/ For more insight into business problems you can take up the course analytics Edge by eDX https://www.edx.org/course/the-analytics-edge For time Series forecasting books by Rob J Hyndman are the best before you go on and solve them https://otexts.org/fpp2/ Also, I did learn a lot from blogs on Analytics Vidhya. https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/ The best way to learn is taking part in hackathons and getting hands on.
