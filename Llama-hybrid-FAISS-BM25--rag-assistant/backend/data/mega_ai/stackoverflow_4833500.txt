There is more to formatting (turning off word wrap) than you think. If the output is a result of a formatting operation, then you should go by those rules to reverse engineer the original. For instance, the test you have there is This should all be on one line since it's one sentence. This is a new paragraph that should be separate. If you removed just the single newlines only, it would look like this: This should all be on one line since it's one sentence. This is a new paragraph thatshould be separate. Also, other formatting such as intentional newlines will be lost, so something like: This is Chapter 1 Section a Section b Turns into This is Chapter 1 Section a Section b Finding the newline in question is easy /(? but, what do you replace it with. Edit : Actually, its not that easy even to find standalone newlines, because visually they sit amongst hidden from view (horizontal) whitespaces. There are 4 ways to go. Remove newline, keep the surrounding formatting $text =~ s/(? Remove newline and formatting, substitute a space $text =~ s/(? Same as above but ignore newline at beginning or end of string $text =~ s/(? $text =~ s/(? Example breakdown of regex (this is the minimum required just to isolate a single newline): (?
