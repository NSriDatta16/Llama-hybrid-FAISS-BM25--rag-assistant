Based on your questions and follow-up comments, you're looking for a way to test for differences in the failure rate for two different components. In your specific example, you have the observed number of failures for two different products over a 14 month span. Let's take a look at your data: Here we encounter our first issue -- the plot of the data suggests that the failure rates for both products do not remain constant as a function of time. Testing equivalence of multiple Poisson rates We can test this observation more rigorously using a form of the $\chi^2$-test. Let $Y_{k}$ denote the number of events observed in the $k$-th month, and let us define the test statistic $Q$ as $$ Q = \sum_{k=1}^{K} \frac{(Y_{k}-\lambda N t_{k})^{2}}{\lambda N t_{k}}, $$ where $N$ denotes the number of items in the population subject to failures, $t_{k}$ denotes the length of the $k$-th month in days, and $$ \lambda=\frac{\sum_{k=1}^{K}Y_{k}}{N \sum_{k=1}^{K}t_{k}}. $$ If the failure rate is constant across all $k$ bins, then the test statistic $Q$ will be approximately $\chi^{2}$-distributed with $K-1$ degrees of freedom. Using Product 1 as an example, we find $\lambda = \frac{2719}{(4323)(426\ \text{days})} \approx 1.476 \times 10^{-3}\ \text{failures/item/day}$, and $Q = 728.4$. Since $\chi^{2}_{13,0.95}=22.4$, we can reject the hypothesis that the failure rate for Product 1 is the same across all 14 months. A similar analysis reaches the same conclusion for Product 2, with $\lambda' = \frac{387}{(1644)(426\ \text{days})} \approx 0.553 \times 10^{-3}\ \text{failures/item/day}$ and $Q'=174.2$. Comparison of two Poisson rates -- rate ratio approach Given that it appears the failure rates for both products are changing over time, drawing comparisons between the failure rates of the two different products will depend on the timeframe in question. For the sake of discussion, let us assume that the failure rates remain roughly constant over the span of a single month. We begin by computing the rate ratio $$ \hat{\rho}=\frac{\hat{\lambda}_{1}}{\hat{\lambda}_{2}}=\frac{Y_{1}N_{2}t_{2}}{Y_{2}N_{1}t_{1}}, $$ where $Y_{i}$ denotes the observed counts for Product $i$, $N_{i}$ denotes the population at risk, and $t_{i}$ is the amount of time at risk. We can then compute a confidence interval for $\hat{\rho}$ using the formulae $$ \begin{align} \rho_{\text{lower}} & = \frac{Y_{1}N_{2}t_{2}}{(Y_{2}+1)N_{1}t_{1}} \;\big/ \;F\left((1+\alpha)/2, 2 Y_{2}+2, 2 Y_{1}\right) \\ \rho_{\text{upper}} & = \frac{(Y_{1}+1)N_{2}t_{2}}{Y_{2}N_{1}t_{1}} \times F\left((1+\alpha)/2, 2 Y_{1}+2, 2 Y_{2}\right), \end{align} $$ Where $F(\delta,n,d)$ denotes the 100$\delta$-th percentile of an $F$-distribution with $n$ degrees of freedom in the numerator and $d$ degrees of freedom in the denominator. To demonstrate this approach using the March 2014 data, we estimate the ratio of the two failure rates to be $$ \hat{\rho}=\frac{(106)(1644)(31)}{(17)(4323)(31)}=\frac{58\,088}{24\,497}\approx 2.37, $$ with a 95% confidence interval given by $$ \begin{align} \rho_{\text{lower}} & = \frac{(106)(1644)(31)}{(18)(4323)(31)} \;\big/ \;F\left(0.975, 36, 212\right) \approx 1.41 \\ \rho_{\text{upper}} & = \frac{(107)(1644)(31)}{(17)(4323)(31)} \times F\left(0.975, 214, 34 \right) \approx 4.22. \end{align} $$ Since this confidence interval does not include 1, we may reject the hypothesis that the failure rates for the two products were equal during March 2014. Additional considerations Since the failure rates for both products are changing with time, it might be more useful to study the form of the empirical survival function using the Kaplan-Meier estimator. This would require data giving the age of each product at the time of first failure. (Given that the items are repaired/serviced, the times to second failure, third failure, etc. could also be of interest.) In addition to highlighting differences in the expected lifetimes of the two products, comparison of the empirical distributions for the two products would also highlight infant mortality or wearout issues with one or both products, if present. Further reading The presentation of the two hypothesis tests used in this answer are drawn from Section 10.1 of Applied Life Data Analysis by Wayne Nelson. Although the book is becoming a bit dated, it contains a broad range of practical examples. You might also find the book An Introduction to Reliability and Maintainability Engineering by Charles Ebeling to be a useful reference -- it provides fairly broad coverage of statistical techniques for the analysis of reparable systems at a reasonably accessible level. For a more statistically-oriented text, you might consider Statistical Methods for Reliability Data by Meeker and Escobar.
