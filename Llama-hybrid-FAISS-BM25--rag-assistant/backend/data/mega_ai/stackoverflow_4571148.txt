Note: SQL Server Best Practices state that indexes with less than 10,000 pages do not usually benefit from performance gains. See http://technet.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/cc966523.aspx http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/2008.08.database.aspx?pr=blog Here's a little snippet to identify when your DB needs defragging.In our product, we reduced this to 2000 and chose >20% fragmentation. You can easily modify the script to tell you which indecies in particular. SELECT COUNT(*) AS fragmented_indexes FROM sys.dm_db_index_physical_stats(DB_ID(), null, null, null, null) as p WHERE p.avg_fragment_size_in_pages = 20 AND p.page_count > 2000;
