Not really a programming related answer; but the betting styles for Razz or Stud is different from Hold 'em in several ways. 1.) There are no blinds; rather antes 2.) The person opening can either bring-in or complete the bet 3.) There are more rounds of betting You have a pretty good start. You'd probably want to create a List which has List inside it. Otherwise you'll have a huge list of rounds without being able to tell when one hand started/ended and another one began. I think you probably need to define out your action types, and then things will probably start to fall into place. Here's what I would have for types: Check Bet Fold Call Raise (essentially a call and bet) Might also want to think about implementing something like "Prior Action" on your action class; as each player is reacting to the action before them. You'd also want to address some nuances of the game; where player a bets 500 and player b goes all in for 250; since except in this instance, the call needs to match the prior bet.
