Cluster analysis on time series samples

In the follow-up to this Ways to understand 2-dimensional time-series data I'm working on 2D time series data where two attributes are depth and temperature. When I plotted depth-vs-temp curve and saw its variation over time, the fluctuation occurs at few places only. Lets say temperature is dependent on depth and it varies at few depths over time. Would doing cluster analysis on each time sample and comparing it with the next one be good? The point is to statistically identify changes across timestamps. And then decide which are significant timestamp samples. What models/papers should I study to get insights out of the data?
