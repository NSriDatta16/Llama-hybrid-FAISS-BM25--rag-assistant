How do I programmatically scroll a winforms datagridview control?

I'm implementing some drag drop features in one my controls inheriting from a datagridview. Basically I'm dragging a row from somewhere in the DGV and dropping it somewhere else, reordering the rows. I've run into a problem though. If the DGV is too large such that there's a scrollbar, how can I have the DGV scroll up or down while the user is in the middle of a dragdrop? I know how to get the current mouse position and also get the position of the dgv rectangle and such. So, I can easily find out if i'm in the top or bottom half of the rectangle... I just need a way to programmatically scroll the dgv. I'd prefer if I don't have to keep changing the selected cell to do this. Any suggestions? Thanks Isaac
