Is it normal for principle components to have the same SD?

I'm trying to determine outliers of a PCA by calculating the sd of the eigenvectors - however it returns the sd as equal for each PC. 1) Is this normal and 2) Is this the right approach for calculating the sd of a PCA? Should I be using the eigenvalue instead? I have attempted a few different means of calculating the SD and they each return the same ## calculate PCA sd and determine outliers library("matrixStats") PCA
