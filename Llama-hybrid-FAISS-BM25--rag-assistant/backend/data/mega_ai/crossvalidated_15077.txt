Averaging correlation coefficients is a meaningless operation. Correlation is $$\rho = \frac{\mbox{Cov}[X,Y]}{\sqrt{\mbox{Var}[X]\mbox{Var}[Y]}}.$$ You cannot even average the components of it (the covariance and two variances), unless the means of all groups on both variables are the same. If they are not, your population variance/covariance will be larger than/different from the (weighted) sum of variances/covariances due to between-group differences.
