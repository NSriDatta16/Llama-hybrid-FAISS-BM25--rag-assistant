I would use the #if DEBUG // ... #else // ... #endif approach, however, I'd only use this for Exception catching in the "Main" method: If debug, then don't catch (so the debugger can catch any uncaught exceptions), if release, then show an error page. These don't change the flow of the program, just don't do that, there be dragons :) If you look at connection strings, for example, I'd just put them in web.config.
