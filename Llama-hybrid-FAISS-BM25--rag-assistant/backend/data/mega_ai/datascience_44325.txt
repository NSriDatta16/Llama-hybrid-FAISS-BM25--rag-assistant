Make embedding more Gaussian-like

I am trying to train a neural network to find a mapping(embedding) to a lower dimensional space. I would like for my dataset, once mapped to the lower dimensional space, to appear gaussian-like distributed. Does anyone have any idea what form of regularization I could use. I have been reading-up on KL-divergence but that seems to require a parametrized gaussian (rather than samples). Any help would be tremendously appreciated!
