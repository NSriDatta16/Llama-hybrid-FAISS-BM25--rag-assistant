First question: how many hours are you coding per week? Second Question: who do you know in real life who DOES get it? Go talk to them!!! ... Object oriented programming is a way of programming that organizes and minimizes repeating yourself. This makes for less code, and easier to alter code (because everything is only on one spot). You are having problems with it, so I can assume you aren't grokking the need for inheritance. Inheritance is a way to reduce repeat code. And the other main part of OOP is classes. The point of classes is to group things in ways that keeps them nicely organized, and also keeps them encapsulated to reduce coupling (thus making changing code easier!) That's pretty much all there is too it. Now go out and program stuff 24/7 and find anyone in real life who really understands this stuff and talk their ear off. Good luck.
