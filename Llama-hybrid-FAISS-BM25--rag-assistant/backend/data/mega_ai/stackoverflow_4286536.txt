Duplicating attribute in Magento

What would be the proper way in Magento v1.4 to programmatically duplicate a (product) attribute? I'm fairly new to Magento and trying some things out to get to know it :) I've so far come up with the following, $attribute = Mage::getModel('catalog/resource_eav_attribute')->load($id_of_attribute_to_copy); $data = $attribute->getData(); $data['attribute_id'] = ''; $data['attribute_code'] = 'new_attribute_name'; $attribute->setData($data); $attribute->save(); but attributes seem to exist as a relation between two main tables, eav_attribute and catalog_eav_attribute . When I execute the code, only an entry for catalog_eav_attribute is created resulting in a Foreign Key error for eav_attribute (in which a new record doesn't yet exist). Hope someone can help.
