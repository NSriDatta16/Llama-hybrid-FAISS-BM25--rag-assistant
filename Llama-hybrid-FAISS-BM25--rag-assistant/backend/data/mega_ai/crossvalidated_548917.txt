Determine if two groups differ for a series of binary variables - logistic regression

I am trying to determine how to analyze my dataset. I have two stimulus categories (Type 1 and Type 2) and then a series of variable observations that are binary (did respond/didn't respond, did approach/didn't approach, etc). I want to find out if the responses differed based on the stimulus type (1 or 2). I was thinking of attempting a multivariate logistic regression but I can't tell if that's the recommended way to handle this dataset. My dependent variables would be all of my binary response variables. I don't want to build a model that would predict which stimulus type has occurred based on the response, necessarily. I just want to test if the responses differ significantly for each stimulus and I'm not sure how to interpret multivariate regression results.
