Does a variable with different range for rows affect the classification model

I am trying a binary classification on a Time Series data using XGBOOST and have sales variables with different currencies for different customers. Will different currencies (basically variable with different range) have a significant impact on the model? The two solutions I could think of is: Conversion for all rows for sales variable in a single currency. Adding a region of sales/currency as a categorical variable. Will the second solution work or I should stick with the first one.
