Quantitative variable are easy to interpret in GLM, categorical ones can be quite tricky without prior experience. As mentioned to you in some comments already, you must always interpret the exponent of the coefficients (e.g. e b 0 , e b 1 etc.) and never the raw estimate. For continuous variables, the interpretation is always the same: e b i is the average change in the probability parameter of your Bernoulli event for 1 unit of increase in variable x i (ceteris paribus).
