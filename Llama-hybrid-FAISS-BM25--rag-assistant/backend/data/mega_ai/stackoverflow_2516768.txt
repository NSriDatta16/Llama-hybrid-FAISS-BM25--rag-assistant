How to do something after effect animation ends in Flex?

I'm a beginner in Flex so there must be more elegant way of doing this. //move effect private var m:Move = new Move(); //this function creates labels with some text and starts move effect on them public function moveText(i:int):void { var myLabel:Label = new Label(); myLabel.text = "some text"; m.target = myLabel; ... m.play(); } Method moveText is called in a loop so I guess that labels don't get "garbage collected". What I want to do is to remove Labels created in moveText method after play animation ends. Another way of doing this is maybe creating some kind of "pool" of labels which I would use to move arround text. I don't know how would I return labels in to "pool". The question is how to do something after effect animation ends?
