How does bagging reduce variance?

I read this answer. Was still unable to understand how bagging reduces variance. Is there any other way to explain it mathematically to a newbie ? Edit Can anybody explain me this excerpt from the other answer? by averaging the outputs of $B$ trees, the variance of the final prediction is given by $p \sigma^2 + (1 - p)\sigma^2/ B,$ where $p$ is the pairwise correlation between trees.
