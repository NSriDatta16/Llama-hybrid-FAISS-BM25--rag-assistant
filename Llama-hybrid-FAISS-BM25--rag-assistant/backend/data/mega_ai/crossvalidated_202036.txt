Is there any situation where PCA performs better than SVD?

It's for a text clustering application. There are around 25 documents and 50k features (from TF-IDF), so I was expecting SVD to be a better choice. I am using sklearn's PCA and TruncatedSVD functions before I cluster the data. I am using Hierarchical Clustering (ward linkage), also from sklearn. PCA seems to result in more sensible clusters, it's unsupervised so I am not entirely sure but when visualise it, the clusters formed after PCA seem to be tighter and far apart.
