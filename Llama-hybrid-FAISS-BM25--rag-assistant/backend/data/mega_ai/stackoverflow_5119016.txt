Knowing offline storage is supported by all the major browsers now, I put up a jQuery plugin for handling form state. http://www.jasonsebring.com/dumbFormState and the source is small and easy to understand. I recommend the approach to do serialization using Douglas Crockford's JSON2.stringify : https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js to take an object in JavaScript and turn it into a JSON string. Then you can save that to either window.sessionStorage or window.localStorage easily like so: // setting data window.sessionStorage['mydata'] = JSON.stringify(someObject); // getting it back someObject = jQuery.parseJSON(window.sessionStorage['mydata']); Another thing to think about is namespacing your keys. For what I was doing, I wanted it automatic so key names were saved based off 'dumbFormState-' + window.location.pathname + '-' + form index to ensure the keys were automatically unique then you could loop through them later do delete them by checking the prefix 'dumbFormState-' matching they keys as you don't want to delete any other stuff on there that people may use. Hope that helps a bit.
