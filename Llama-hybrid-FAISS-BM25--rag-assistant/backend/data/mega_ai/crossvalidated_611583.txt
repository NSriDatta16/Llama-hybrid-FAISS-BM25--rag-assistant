change point detection of time series

Currently, I am working on a research project that involves forecasting electricity consumption using data mining. In my analysis, I have detected the change point for time series using the changepoint package for my data sets using the "AMOC", PELT," and "BinSeg" methods. For each method, I have used var, mean, and meanvar. However, I have encountered a problem in identifying a change point that occurred during the pandemic period in 2020. library(readxl) library(changepoint) tsdata these code doesn't identify the visible change point as when run the above code for differentiated time series it clearly indicate there is a change point in 2020 march, isnt it should be indicate for original data set too? if so how should I detect the change in 2020 statistically?
