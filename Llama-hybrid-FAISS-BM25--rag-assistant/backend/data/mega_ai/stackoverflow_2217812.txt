Weather forecast using a neural network

I am trying to write a program for weather forecasting using backpropagation . I am a beginner in this field. I have historical data with different parameters like temperature, humidity, wind speed, rainfall etc. I am confused about how to provide this data to the input layer. Is each input node to be given the whole of the data for a given day, or do I need to have a different network for each parameter? I am also confused about the output layer.
