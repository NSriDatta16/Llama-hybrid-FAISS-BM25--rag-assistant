Sorry for the resurrection, but there's another factor to consider that I don't think has been mentioned: Users can tamper with config to their hearts content - which means that you either have to validate the values in there, or ensure that whatever uses them doesn't care if they're nonsense. I doubt resources files are incorruptible either - I know it's possible to extract values from them, but whether or not it's possible to replace them without recompiling, I don't know. In any case, if you don't want the user changing those values without a concerted effort, go for resources. If you want to enable or even encourage after-market tweaking of settings, go for app settings.
