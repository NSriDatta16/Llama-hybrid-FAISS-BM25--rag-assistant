Flat window removal from time series

I have a time series that I'm using for forecasting and I'm facing an issue with a flat period. In my time series, I have the following dynamic: In the past the quantity was stationary (red part), almost intermittent but there's some data; however after some time the series started to pick up and behave like a regular more "normal" time series. I could visually inspect all series individually and remove this flat period for each one of them, but I would like to know if there's some way to so it systematically or some specific technique that I can use, since I have more than 1500+ time series.
