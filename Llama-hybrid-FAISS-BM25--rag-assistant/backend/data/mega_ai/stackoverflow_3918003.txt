My completely gut-based thought would be that some protocols, such as NFS, would in some circumstances be somewhat and maybe even significantly faster than HTTP. But I wouldn't think that's enough data to go by. I think you need to just figure out how much of a difference would matter to you, and then run some quick tests. Better yet, make a gut call on which one's a better fit for your needs — HTTP is certainly much easier to get through firewalls and over the open internet, and maybe even over a VPN — and just try that first. If you hit a wall, experiment with other options. Update: right after I posted this, I remembered that Backblaze , the online backup service, uses HTTPS for all its internal data transfer to and from their storage appliances. This is documented in this post: Petabytes on a budget: How to build cheap cloud storage — jump down to "A Backblaze Storage Pod Runs Free Software". There's some good thinking there on the advantages of HTTPS over a lower-level protocol. And they have to transfer a lot of data, quickly. So if it works for them, there's a good chance it'll work for you.
