I feel fairly courageous to claim that most Continuous Integration Engines such as Hudson (for Java) provide such capability either natively or through plugins. In Hudson's case there's a few code coverage plugins available already and I think it does basic graphs from unit tests automatically by itself. Oh and remember to configure the CI properly, for example our Hudson polls CVS every 10 minutes and if it sees any changes, it does all the associated tricks (get updated .java files, compile, run tests, verify dependencies etc.) to see if the build is still OK or not.
