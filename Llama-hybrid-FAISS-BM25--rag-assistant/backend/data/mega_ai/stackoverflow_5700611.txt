What is wrong with this statement

for {set count 0} {$count My problem is with the line #$tcp$count set fid_ $count When I try to execute it it says can't read "tcp": no such variable while executing "$tcp$count set fid_ $count" ("for" body line 4) invoked from within "for {set count 0} {$count It says Can't read tcp, well it shouldnt read tcp it should read it as tcp0 in the first iteration and tcp1 in the second and so on. What amI doing wrong? thanks EDIT: I tried using arrays, thanks for the TIP. It worked for most parts but in one specific case when I did this: for {set count 0} {$count It gives me the following error: Came here 0 (_o180 cmd line 1) invoked from within "_o180 cmd target _o99" invoked from within "catch "$self cmd $args" ret" invoked from within "if [catch "$self cmd $args" ret] { set cls [$self info class] global errorInfo set savedInfo $errorInfo error "error when calling class $cls: $args" $..."
