One hot encoding to allow non numerical features on all data. Split data into training and validation sets. Preferably stratify the sets for the outcome distribution. Account for gaps in data(Imputing) based on the training set only and apply the same imputation on validation set. Imputation procedures can be seen as parts of a machine learning model. Feature selection/algorithm selection/hyperparameter tuning in the training set. Then proceed to fit on the training set and evaluate performance on the validation set.
