Bayesian Estimation: Bernoulli and Quadratic Loss Function

I am trying to understand a solution to this problem (I am a very beginner in Bayesian statistics) and I am terribly confused so I would appreciate it if someone could explain to me how exactly this risk function was obtained. I would also appreciate any pointers/advice on the literature where I can encounter similar problems and a good explanation of the core concepts: $$ X_{1}, . . . X_{n} $$ is Bernoulli with unknown parameter $ \theta_{0} $ $$ \hat\theta_{1} = \bar X $$ $$\hat\theta_{2}=\dfrac{n\bar X + a}{n + c}$$ and $ a The risk for $ \hat\theta_{1} $ is $$R\left(\hat\theta_{1},\theta_{0}\right) = \frac{1}{n}\theta_{0}(1 - \theta_{0}) $$ The risk for $\hat\theta_{2} $ is $$R\left(\hat\theta_{2},\theta_{0}\right) = \frac{1}{(c+n)^2}[(a -\theta_{0}c)^2+n\theta_{0}(1-\theta_{0})] $$ So my problem is, I think I understand how the bias was derived but I do not really understand why the variance is multiplied by n , i.e. $n\theta_{0}(1-\theta_{0})$? Actually, when I square the Bias, I do not understand what happens to $ n{E}[\bar X] $ and $ - \theta_{0} $ when I plug $\hat\theta_{2}$ in $ ({E}(\hat\theta) - \theta_{0})^2 $ . Are they equal? If so, why are they equal? And I am also confused by this result for $$ \hat\theta_{1} = \frac{n\bar{X}+\sqrt{n}/2}{n + \sqrt{n}} $$ which corresponds to $$ a= \sqrt{n}/2 \text{ and } c = \sqrt{n} $$ and which has a risk equal to $$ R(\hat\theta_{1},\theta_0) = \frac{1}{4n} \frac{n^2}{(n + \sqrt{n})^2} $$ When I plug in these values in $R\left(\hat\theta_{2},\theta_{0}\right)$, I do not understand where $n^2$ in the numerator and $4n$ in the denominator come from. Thank you in advance for any advice/recommendations.
