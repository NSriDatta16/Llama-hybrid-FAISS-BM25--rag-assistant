A nodequeue is probably your best bet (remember that you can also do a view over a nodequeue, which makes them a little easier to use). If your gallery is a content type, and a photo is a content type, then you can have your gallery noderef the photos. Set it up so that the noderef uses autocomplete text fields, and you can then drag-and-drop the ordering on the gallery edit page.
