While there's been many solutions presented... none of them is as elegant as: typedef boost::variant key_type; typedef std::map map_type; Yep, that's all. A boost::variant is naturally ordered first by type and second (when types are equal) by the values they carry (if they can be compared). I challenge anyone to find a simpler solution ;)
