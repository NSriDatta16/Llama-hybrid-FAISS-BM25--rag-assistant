First of all, if you want to use R language, there is a very useful package (actually not only one) to do your analyses: "kohonen". The most simple function for unsupervised Self Organizing Maps (I think it's your case) is "som". Now suppose your trained som is called mySom . That said, comparing the sum (or average) of the distances of inputs from the related centroids is a good way to say if two soms have a similar quality: index In order to see if they produce similar results you should see the how the codebooks (vectors) are similar from a SOM to another ( mySom$codes ). I think you could make the average difference between codebooks. The "final" way is to see the distributions inside the codebooks. Using the parameter type inside the plot function you can represent the SOM is many ways. The most useful are: type = "mapping", "property" .
