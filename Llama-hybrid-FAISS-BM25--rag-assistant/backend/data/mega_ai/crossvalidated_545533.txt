What is the probability that every variable of combination of random variables is greater than a specific value?

Suppose there are $N$ positive random variables. Each variable follows an exponential distribution with parameter $\lambda_i$ . Now, we choose $n$ variables among the $N$ variables. What is the probability that, among the $n$ variables chosen, there are at least $k$ ( $n \geq k$ ) variables that has a value greater than a certain constant $C$ ? For example, we have $N=5$ variables $X_1, \ldots, X_5$ , each follows an exponential distribution with parameter $\lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_5$ . Now, I want that among the $n$ variables I choose, there will be at least $k=2$ variables that has $X_i>C$ . Let $P_i=P(X_i>C)$ . Note that since $\lambda_i$ are differrent, $P_i$ are also different for each $i$ . If I choose the $n=2$ variables, then the probability that both $X_i>C$ is $P=P_1P_2$ . If I choose the $n=3$ variables then $P=P_1P_2+P_1P_3+P_2P_3+P_1P_2P_3$ . This will be much longer as $n$ increases. Thus, I want to ask if there is any approach to calculate this probability more efficiently? Is there any feasible/elegant bounds? Thank you.
