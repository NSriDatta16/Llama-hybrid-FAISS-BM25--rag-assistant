Split xml file with result document and javax.xml.transform.Transformer

I have a XSLT which will split large xml file into multiple xml file with the use of following xslt code. then i have used that XSLT in my code to split input XML file using javax.xml.transform.Transformer. TransformerFactory tFactory = TransformerFactory.newInstance(); Source xslSource = new StreamSource(xsltfilepath); Transformer trans = tFactory.newTransformer(xslSource); trans.transform(new StreamSource(xmlFileName), new StreamResult(splitfilesfolder)); Here i want to give same path for new Streamresult as it is in result document path how can i transform multiple xml file using result doucment and javax.xml.transform.Transform ?? Can anybody please give me a solution ? Thanks in advance.
