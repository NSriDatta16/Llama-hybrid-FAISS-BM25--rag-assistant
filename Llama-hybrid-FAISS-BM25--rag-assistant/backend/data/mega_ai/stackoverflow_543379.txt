Editor showdown: Maintain newlines at the ends of sentences

When editing non-WYSIWYG (LaTeX, HTML, etc) prose you probably want to have newlines at the ends of your sentences. This has several advantages: Easier to rearrange sentences. Easier to comment out sentences. Easier to spot run-on / overly long sentences. Easier to comment on sentences. For example: % The following isn't strictly true; maybe excise or comment out for now: After all, people who use Word or other WYSIWYG editors are aiding and abetting terrorists. And probably the most important advantage of all is that it makes collaborative editing under version control much easier. Otherwise you end up with conflicts where it just informs you "the following two versions of this huge paragraph are in conflict". But maintaining newlines at the ends of sentences is easier said than done... As you edit the prose it will get all chopped up, like this. Normally you'd do a "reformat paragraph" to clean it up, but then you lose the newlines at the ends of your sentences! The following question asks about how to solve this problem in emacs: How do I get Emacs to fill sentences, but not paragraphs? I'd like to know how people deal with this in other editors, including vim, TeXShop, TextMate, and any others you think would be useful to collect here. Advice on soft vs hard wrapping is also welcome.
