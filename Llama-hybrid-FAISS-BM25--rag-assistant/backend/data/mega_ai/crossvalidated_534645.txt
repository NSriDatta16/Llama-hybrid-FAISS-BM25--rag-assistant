If you are planning to use Gradient Boosting and/or Neural Networks, they you do not need to worry about feature selection because the model will do it for you. On the other hand, I do not understand why I cannot directly run methods to do that, due to the unbalanced nature of the dataset. The following plot is from a toy example on feature selection. If we are using PCA to do feature selection (which I do not recommend because PCA will not consider the class, but only the variance of the feature.) No matter the data is balanced or unbalanced, the algorithm will highlight the important feature (by variance). unbalanced data does not make too much difference on feature selection.
