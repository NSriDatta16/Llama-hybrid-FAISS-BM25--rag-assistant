The first thing to keep in mind when addressing this sort of problem is that, when you are interested in two different properties of your data (in this case frequencies and amounts), it may require two quantities to accurately describe them. Saying that customer X spent \$6000 in the last year could mean both that customer X spent \$6000 one time or \$500 twelve times, and there is no way to distinguish these cases without reporting further information. That said, a basic process for analyzing your data, given the information you provided, is as follows: Create (very basic) summary statistics for each row of your data, specifically the frequency of transactions and the mean amount in each row. Make a scatterplot of frequency versus amount for the set of summary statistics. If there is no trend in the scatterplot, report the average of the frequencies and mean amounts as your "average" customer. If there is a trend, report a simple linear relation, describing how the mean amount of transactions increase (or decrease) as transaction frequency varies.
