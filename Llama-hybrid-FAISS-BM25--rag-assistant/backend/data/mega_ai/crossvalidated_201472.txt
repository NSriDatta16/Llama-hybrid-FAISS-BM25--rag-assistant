If your DV is scored "none" and "some" (which it appears to be, unless I've misunderstood what you wrote) then it is a dichotomy and you should use logistic regression. However, this will not predict the presence of the DV, it will be about the relationship between the IVs and "some" vs. "none". Also, since you have only 29 people who said "some", a model with 5 IVs is likely to be overfit. You either need more data or a simpler model.
