If your dataset has a time series character you can have a look at this paper comparing methods for univariate time series imputation in R: http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.03924 But actually I guess you caption is misleading, usually you speak of univariate data if you have just one attribute What I understood is, you have 52 attributes (1 numeric, 51 binary). So you do not need special algorithms for univariate imputation. The MICE package should be alright for this task. (even with 40% missing data) Perhaps you can post your MICE code, that we see what is going wrong.
