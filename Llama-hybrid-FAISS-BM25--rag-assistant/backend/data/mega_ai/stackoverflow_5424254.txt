Debugging - skip code with a breakpoint

You know how you can click the yellow arrow on a breakpoint and drag it down to skip execution of lines of code? Well, is it possible to create a "When Hit" macro (or something similar) that skips execution of the line containing the breakpoint? So instead of writing code like if(!Debugging) Response.Redirect("LoginFail.aspx"); I could sit a breakpoint on the Response.Redirect() line and "When Hit" will skip it.
