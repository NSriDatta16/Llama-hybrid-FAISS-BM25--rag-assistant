Transform multiclass classification to binary - benefits?

I have 400 instances which must be categorized into 4 classes. Using WEKA, I tried out a couple of multiclass classifiers like J48 and Random Forests, but never made it above Kappa 0.6 and ~65% correctly classified instances (10-fold X-V) Then I thought about transforming the problem into a 1-vs-all classification, which usually yields accuracies of ~90%. I would then remove the one "single" class and keep the merged ones. Then, again, having only instances with 3 classes, I would perform 1-vs-2 and remove the instances classified as belonging to the single class, ending up with a binary classification problem. As I said - I always have like 90% correctly classified instances, but I fear that the 10% incorrectly classified instances add up and propagate through the splitting and dataset reduction process --- so in the end I would maybe end up with the same garbage output I'd have when performing the original multiclass classification?! What's the stand on this approach? Does it have any benefits at all?
