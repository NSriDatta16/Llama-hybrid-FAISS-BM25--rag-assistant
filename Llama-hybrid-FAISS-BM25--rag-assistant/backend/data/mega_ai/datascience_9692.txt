create a company to make money by winning Kaggle competition

I am thinking of creating a data science company (team) that aims to make money by winning Kaggle competitions. It will be actually a onsite data science learning service but I want to create the company's brand identity like a sport team instead of as a "school." Have you ever heard of such an idea?
