If you have a binary dependent variable you should/must use logistic regression by setting the family argument to logit: family=binomial(link="logit") Controlling works by entering the variables as independent variables, independent of whether or not they are binary/nominal/continuous. However, I don't know how to specify a repeated measures factor with glm as those need a special error structure. Update: For me it is really difficult to wrap my head around your design as you are reverting the role of independent and dependent variables! If you want to find out how the treatment affects your measurements of weight gain, you should do it the normal way. That is, you should run a separate regression for each dependent variable and assess if you independent variables are significant. A perhaps better approach is to use multiuvariate testing. However, I have never done so in R. But probably others.
