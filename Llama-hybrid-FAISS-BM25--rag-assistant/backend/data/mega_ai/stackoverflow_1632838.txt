Managed local storage for blobs

The general consensus these days seems to be that you do not store binary large objects in your relational database, as its not really optimised for that sort of thing, and instead put it into a dedicated storage engine. Can anyone suggest a solution for the .Net platform, along the lines of the Microsoft Azure Blob Storage engine, but kept local to the organisation?
