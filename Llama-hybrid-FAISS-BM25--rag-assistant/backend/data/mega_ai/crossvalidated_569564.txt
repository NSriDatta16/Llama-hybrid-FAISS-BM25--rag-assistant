R: how to interpret the gray bars in the plotted output of the decompose function for time series?

In order to do some time series analysis, I used the decompose() function, to retrieve the adjacent plot. However, I was asking myself about the meaning of the gray bars at the right side. If the show the importance of each time series component, then I do not understand, why there is also a gray bar for the original time series in the plot. Maybe some does know it. Could not find it in any documentation.
