jQuery UI Sortable - Determine which element is beneath the element being dragged

I've implemented jQuery UI's Sortable plug-in on a simple unordered list. Is there any way to determine which element is beneath the element being dragged? In this screenshot Row 3, column 1 is hovering over Row 2-3, column 1 . In this case; I would need to get hold of Row 2-3, column 1 . (source: roosteronacid.com )
