Regarding 10 fold cross validation

I am bit confused regarding the application of 10 fold cross validation steps. To be specific, I have made a multiple regression model (except model validation) and the model does not predict reasonable. So I think I have to do model validation for the prediction. I know that 10 fold cv method will split the data into 90% (training) and 10% (test). After that it will take 10 different attempts and then I need to take the average of that MSE of the 10 folds. I want a step by step procedure for the application of Multiple regression for prediction or you can suggest me any link for that.
