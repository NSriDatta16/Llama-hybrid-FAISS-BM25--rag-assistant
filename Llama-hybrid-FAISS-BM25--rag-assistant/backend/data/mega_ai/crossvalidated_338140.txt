is it possible to improve prediction accuracy based on this sample data set?

Question: I have a sample dataset that contains a number of features, and a price. I am trying to predict the price. So far my accuracy has been terrible, with a MSE of 350,000 which is huge, relative to the price distribution. I know its a lot to ask, but as Im in the process of learning machine learning , it could speed my work up greatly or help me avoid wasting time. is it worth continuing to refine this or is the feature set too sparse? pointer on what to try next. Details: The dataset is real, but with names masked as i requested by the data owner. Each row is an accommodation, displaying the number of beds, how energy efficient the accommodation is, overall size, number of bathrooms and the asking price for a set period of time, duration same for all rows. Locations are set out as Districts. District 1 is broken into the towns in that district, as it is very large. I am doing prediction against District 1 in isolation also, as it may be too different from other districts due to its size. I initially thought i could use basic regression, but there is no correlation between size, efficiency , beds and price. The only real predictor is the district. On seeing this i tried decision tree & forrest regression, but this did not reduce the MSE very much. Sincere thanks for any advice. Link to DataSet
