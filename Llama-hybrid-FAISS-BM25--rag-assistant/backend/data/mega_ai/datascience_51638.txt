How do I group similar type of skills together?

Suppose that I have a file which has thousands of skills starting from A-Z. Now, I would like to create a model that can group similar skills together (example neural network and SVM can group together). I know that I can use NLP for this problem, but I'm not sure about the algorithm that I can use to get the best result. I'm new to NLP so any help is greatly appreciated.
