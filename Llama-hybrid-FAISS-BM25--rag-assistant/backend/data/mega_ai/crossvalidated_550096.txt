Any binning will be suboptimal compared to (possibly nonlinear) regression. There are plenty of threads on this site and elsewhere that discuss the dangers of the dichotomization of continuous variables. Instead of looking for some complicated, suboptimal procedure that produces results that could be explained to execs, fit the best, most principled model you can, and then look for ways to explain it to execs simply. So instead of binning your data and fitting a model to those bins, fit the model to continuous data, and then present it to execs as your model predicts # of trips is for a person with an income 10k, 20k, 50k, 80k ... Or you can plot a graph with an income on the x axis and the number of trips on the y axis, showing pointclouds, regression line or quantile lines with some arrows, labels, and captions that explicitly explain important observations fivethirtyeight style, or you can just walk them through it. You probably don't want to just look at the average number of trips, since the number of trips will be IMO very skewed.
