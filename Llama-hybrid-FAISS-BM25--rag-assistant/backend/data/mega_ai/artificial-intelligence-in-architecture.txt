Artificial intelligence in architecture is the use of artificial intelligence in automation, design, and planning in the architectural process or in assisting human skills in the field of architecture. AI has been used by some architects for design, and has been proposed as a way to automate planning and routine tasks the field. Implications Benefits Artificial intelligence, according to ArchDaily, is said to potentially significantly augment the Architectural profession though its ability to improve the design and planning process as well as increasing productivity. Through its ability to handle a large amount of data, AI are said to potentially allow architects a range of design choices with criteria considerations such as budget, requirements adjusted to space, and sustainability goals calculated as part of the design process. ArchDaily said this may allow the design of optimized alternatives that can then undergo human review. AI tools are also said to potentially allow architects to assimilate urban and environmental data to inform their designs, streamlining initial stages of project planning and increasing efficiency and productivity. The advances in generative design through the input of specific prompts allow architects to produce visual designs, including photorealistic images, and thus render and explore various material choices and spatial configurations. ArchDaily noted this could speed the creative process as well as allow for experimentation and sophistication in the design. Additionally, AI's capacity for pattern recognition and coding could aid architects in organizing design resources and developing custom applications, thus enhancing the efficiency and the collaboration between both architects and AI. AI is thought to also be able to contribute to the sustainability of buildings by analyzing various factors and following recommended energy-efficient modifications, thus pushing the industry towards greener practices. The use of AI in building maintenance, project management, and the creation of immersive virtual reality experiences are also thought as potentially augmenting the architectural design process and workflow. Examples include the use of text-to-image systems such as Midjourney to create detailed architectural images, and the use of AI optimization systems from companies such as Finch3D and Autodesk to automatically generate floor plans from simple programmatic inputs. Early adopters such as architect Stephen Coorlas, have actively challenged the boundaries of architectural practice through artificial intelligence. His early experimental initiative, Speculations on AI and Architecture, confronts the discipline's traditional workflows by training text-to-image AI tools such as Midjourney, Luma AI, and PromeAI to generate more nuanced architectural illustrations including construction documents, architectural details, and assembly sequences for various structures. Coorlas inputs precise terminology and architectural language to provoke the AI into producing axonometric drawings that resemble conventional documentation, then experiments with animating the outputs using AI generated depth maps and other AI image-to-3D wireframe tools. Stephen's inventive process invites architects and designers to reconsider authorship, automation, and the future of visual communication in the built environment. Rather than treating AI as a peripheral tool, Stephen has advocated for AI to be a speculative collaborator capable of engaging with discipline-specific challenges. His work contributes to the growing discourse on generative design, parametric optimization, and the philosophical implications of machine-assisted creativity raising urgent questions about how such technologies will reshape architectural agency, precision, and pedagogy. Another prominent advocate is Architect Andrew Kudless, whom in an interview to Dezeen recounted that he uses AI to innovate in architectural design by incorporating materials and sc
