Meaning of predict.fixed and predict.Subject values in 'predict' function of nlme

As discussed in this SO thread, I am using the predict function in nlme to derive predictions for each participants' fourth day score in my own dataset, based on their previous scores and a mixed-effects model. So I am wondering which column of predicted values to use. Here is an example of how the predict function works using the Orthodont dataset and code supplied by the nlme package manual library(nlme) fm1 So if we specify levels as 0:1 the predict function gives two columns of predicted values for each participant. One is the marginal predictions, when we 'set the random effects to 0' or 'average across random effects'. The other column is the conditional or subject-specific random effects for each individual, where we 'hold the random effects constant' If the population estimates are for the average subject, why are they all different? i.e. in what sense are they average? I have been trying to get a sense of this for a while. Are the extrapolated population predictions for each subject derived from some combination of fixed group-level effects and from fitting a slope for each individual from the previous measurement occassions and then using that 'individual slope + fixed group effect' to come up with the estimated value?
