I would say that it's fine to reference a well defined set of core 3rd party DLLs in every project of an "enterprise application" solution (or any application that needs flexibility). I see nothing wrong with having a dependency on at least the following in every project that needs it: A logging framework (e.g. log4net) Some IoC container (e.g. Autofac) The fact that these aren't part of the core .NET framework shouldn't stop us from using them as liberally. The only possible negatives I can see are relatively minor compared to the possible benefits: This may make the application harder to understand for the average programmer You could have version compatibility problems in the future which you wouldn't encounter if you were just using the .NET framework There is an obvious but minor overhead with adding all of these references to every solution
