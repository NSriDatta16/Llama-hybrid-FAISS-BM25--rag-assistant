It would be so nice if the regression machinery could just pick up the lack of a relationship. Unfortunately, all it does is see potential explainers of the variability, and the algorithm figures out the coefficients that result in the smallest sum of squared errors. That can result in fitting features to the noise (error term). This is related to, if not a light version of, the “overfitting” discussed in machine learning circles.
