SQLMetal fails to create DBML from SQL Server 2005 database

As the title already says, am I trying to create an dbml-file by using SQLMetal . The background for this action is to create a C#-Codefile which contains all tables, function, views, stored procedures and so on for using it in an MVC-Application . Now to the problem. When i am starting SQLMetal from command it takes so time, shows some minor warnings and breaks in an Error (DBML1057). As I read the error-message, SQLMetal is trying to extract a stored procedure, that is not existing. I looked at the database a dozen times but could definetly not find such a procedure. Maybe this procedure was called so long before. i.e. you create a SP named " GetGameDatesDesc " and later you rename it to " GetGameDates ". SQLMetal (in my case) is looking for " GetGameDateDesc " I think. But where has SQLMetal this information from? I can't find a word in database. I looked over all views, functions,... bot no avail. This function isn't part of the database anymore. Edit -------------- 02/14/2011 -------------- Here are the warnings from SQLMetal: Error DBML1042: The member attribute ' CCode ' in the Column element of the Type element ' GetGameDatesDesc ' has been used already. Error DBML1057: The storage attribute or its default value ' _CCode ' in the Column element of the Type ' GetGameDatesDesc ' has been used already.
