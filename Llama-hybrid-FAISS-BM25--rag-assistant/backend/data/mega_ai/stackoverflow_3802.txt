How do you typeset code elements in normal text?

What is the best way to typeset a function with arguments for readibility, brevity, and accuracy? I tend to put empty parentheses after the function name like func() , even if there are actually arguments for the function. I have trouble including the arguments and still feeling like the paragraph is readable. Any thoughts on best practices for this?
