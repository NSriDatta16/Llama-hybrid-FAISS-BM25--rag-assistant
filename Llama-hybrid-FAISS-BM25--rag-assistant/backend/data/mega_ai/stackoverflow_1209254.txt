Overloading new & delete makes it possible to add a tag to your memory allocations. I tag allocations per system or control or by middleware. I can view, at runtime, how much each uses. Maybe I want to see the usage of a parser separated from the UI or how much a piece of middleware is really using! You can also use it to put guard bands around the allocated memory. If/when your app crashes you can take a look at the address. If you see the contents as "0xABCDABCD" (or whatever you choose as guard) you are accessing memory you don't own. Perhaps after calling delete you can fill this space with a similarly recognizable pattern. I believe VisualStudio does something similar in debug. Doesn't it fill uninitialized memory with 0xCDCDCDCD? Finally, if you have fragmentation issues you could use it to redirect to a block allocator? I am not sure how often this is really a problem.
