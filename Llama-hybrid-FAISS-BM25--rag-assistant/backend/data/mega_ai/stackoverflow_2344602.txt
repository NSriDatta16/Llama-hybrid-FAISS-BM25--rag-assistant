Recent, I've released a shopping cart plugin for CakePHP called Kaching found at http://code.google.com/p/kaching-php/ . It's a middle ground between Magento and Bakesale. I found Magento tried to make every store fit into the same mold and Bakesale lacked features. With Kaching you create the store's look and feel by interacting with Kaching's controllers. There is no need to build a store administration because one is provided.
