msts is a data type for multiply seasonal time series, it is not a model. BATS, as implemented in the bats() function, is a forecasting model for multiple or complex seasonality. Time series that exhibit any kind of seasonality are by definition nonstationary, because their mean varies. BATS is explicitly aimed at treating this kind of nonstationarity. This also illustrates that there are multiple "kinds" of nonstationarity, and that differentiating is not a cure-all. After all, if you differentiate a multiply seasonal time series, the result is still seasonal, and therefore nonstationary.
