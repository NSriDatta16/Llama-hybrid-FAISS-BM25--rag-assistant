Treatment of outliers in annual time series data

I have an annual time series of data of a growth-rate variable $X$ for 50 years. Most of the values for the variable $X$ are less than 10%. The exception are two values that are around 30%. How do I treat these two values in the regression? I would like to seek your suggestions in this regard.
