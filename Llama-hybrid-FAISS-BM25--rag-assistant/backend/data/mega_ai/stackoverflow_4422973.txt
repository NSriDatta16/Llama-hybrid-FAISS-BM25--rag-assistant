How to include a page in PHP if it’s in the root folder?

So I have multiple PHP files organized in multiple folders and subfolders. I’we included the same PHP page into each page using include('sidebar.php') . My problem is that this sidepar.php contains link to pages from my site and if I click from a file from a subfolder the link is something like this: posts/posts/post.php instead of posts/post.php . How could I fix this? Oh and how it`s possible to include a file (include();) from the root folder to a files from different subfolders ?
