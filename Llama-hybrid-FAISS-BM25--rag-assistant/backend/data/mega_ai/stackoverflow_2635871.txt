encrypting assets (video files) in Adobe AIR

I am trying to create a video player in Adobe AIR. I want to encrypt the video files so that they are not sharable outside the player. I don't want to jump through hoops to create a rock-solid system but something simple that just prevents 90-95% of the users from sharing the content. I have been through a related question on SO at File Protection in Adobe AIR (Flex) However since the Video file size would definitely exceed 10 MB, the above does not seem to be the solution. There are a number of solutions to encrypt text strings but I have not found any that encrypt files. Any help or pointers will be appreciated. Many thanks. Update: We are trying to achieve this in the following manner: encrypt/jumble the first 50 binary characters of the video file and store on the hard drive. this makes the file unplayable. on runtime decrypt the first 50 characters to get the original file and copy it in a temp folder on the hard drive. on exit, delete the decrypted file and empty the temp folder. this solves most of our problems. It does not allow sharing by simple copy and paste. Is a simple solution, though maybe not very elegant. The problem we are facing now is that the temporary folder is not getting emptied. The file lands up in the recycle bin and can be easily recovered from there!
