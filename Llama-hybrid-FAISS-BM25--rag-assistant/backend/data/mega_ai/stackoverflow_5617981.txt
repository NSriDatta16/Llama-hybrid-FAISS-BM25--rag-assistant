nested form_for

I have the project organized in this way: User is the main resource, each user has one profile and each profile has one location as following: resources :users do resource :profile, :controller => "profiles" do resource :location end Now I have to build a form for insert all the profile information but the location information as well (address etc). If I write the following code, it doesn't take care about the location. {:action=>'update'}, :html => {:multipart => true}) do |f| %> Do someone have some suggestion for this situation ? Tnx
