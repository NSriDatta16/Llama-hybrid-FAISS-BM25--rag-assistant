I would guess that rspec is examining the stream to which it is writing output to see if it is a tty (ie the console) or not, and if it's not, disabling colour. Many commands do this - GNU ls and grep, for example. Since the stream from the child process to your script is not a tty, colour will be disabled. Hopefully, rspec has a flag which will force colour to be used, regardless of the stream type. If it doesn't, you will have to resort to some truly weird stty shenanigans.
