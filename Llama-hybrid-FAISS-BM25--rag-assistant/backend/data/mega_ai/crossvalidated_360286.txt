What is the relationship between the standard deviation of a random intercept and the value of the integer scalar?

I fit a mixed-effects logistic regression model in R with the following formula: glmer.traditional The standard deviation for the random intercept is really high: Random effects: Groups Name Variance Std.Dev. LEMMA (Intercept) 400.4 20.01 Number of obs: 438, groups: LEMMA, 174 When, however, I use the following formula, the standard deviation plummets: glmer.traditional Random effects: Groups Name Variance Std.Dev. LEMMA (Intercept) 27.28 5.223 Number of obs: 438, groups: LEMMA, 174 The nAGQ is the scalar that is used for approximating the log-likelihood. Higher values for this argument produce more accurate approximations, but come at the expense of speed. I have two questions about this: How does the value of the integer scalar affect the standard deviation of the random intercept? I don't know how the Gauss-Hermite quadrature works. Are there guidelines on the interpretation of standard deviations for random intercepts? E.g., is a really high standard deviation a warning sign of some kind?
