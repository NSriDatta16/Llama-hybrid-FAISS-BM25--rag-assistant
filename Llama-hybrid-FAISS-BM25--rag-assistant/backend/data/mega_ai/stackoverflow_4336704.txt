Coldfusion Error: cannot find file /CFIDE/administrator/index.cfm

Right, I know you can google this question and get lots of answers on it, but none of them seem to work for me. I've got a brand new RHEL5 server, with the latest LAMP installation on it, and I've just installed Coldfusion 9. When I visit my site, i get the Coldfusion error saying File not found: /index.cfm If I navigate to a html or php page it's fine, they server properly. And the error I'm getting is the blue/grey coldfusion one, so the coldfusion server is working. And I've narrowed the problem down to this... /var/www/vhosts/site.co.uk/index.cfm - this gets served but my site root is really /var/www/vhosts/site.co.uk/httpdocs/index.cfm - coldfusion cannot see this file! I found this /var/www/vhosts/site.co.uk/index.cfm in the cfserver.log. But I can't find anywhere that references "/var/www/vhosts/site.co.uk/" as the root. jrun-web.xml has a system path set to /var/www/vhosts/site.co.uk/httpdocs , and inside "bin/coldfusion" the DOCROOT is set to "/var/www/vhosts/site.co.uk/httpdocs" This is a section of the httpd.include file: # ATTENTION! # DO NOT MODIFY THIS FILE OR ANY PART OF IT.
