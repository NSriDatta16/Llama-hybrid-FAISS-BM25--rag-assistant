You got it wrong, there is not integral from -inf to +inf. It is a discrete distribution p(c_k | x), and in case of logistic regression you have two classes c=1 and c=0. The model outputs the probability of belonging to class c=1. If you subtract p(c = 1 | x) from 1, you get the probability of the other class: p(c = 0 | x) = 1 - p(c = 1 | x). Softmax regression extends this to more than two classes by applying the softmax instead of the sigmoid or logistic function.
