NLP was a couple years ago, but I believe without tagging the HMM could help determine the symbol emission/state transition probabilities of n-grams (i.e. what are the odds of "world" occurring after "hello"), but not parts-of-speech. It needs the tagged corpus to learn how the POS interrelate. If I'm way off on this let me know in the comments!
