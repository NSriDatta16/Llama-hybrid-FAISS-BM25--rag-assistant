Doesn't really sound very interesting. I'd prefer something like Toby Segaran's "Programming Collective Intelligence" Chapter 9: 'Advanced Classification: Kernel Methods and SVM'. It uses a matchmaker database to show you how to do it on different characteristics. I think this would be much more interesting. What you're recommending could be little more than looking up a percentage in an associative array that's generated by a random number generator.
