Averaging the data will result in a loss information and statistical power, so it is best avoided. Since you have repeated measures for websites, you can account the differences between websites (or equivalently, the non-independence of observations within each website, since observations on one website are more likely to be similar to each other than to observations on other websites), by fitting random intercepts for website ID in a regression model (a mixed effects regression model). This would look something like: apply_technique ~ treatment + (1 | website_ID) and you could fit such a model using lmer from the lme4 package. This way you will make maximal use of the data.
