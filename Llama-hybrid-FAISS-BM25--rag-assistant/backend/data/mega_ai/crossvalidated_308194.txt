The Wilcoxon rank sum test is not about scatter, it compares the ranks of the observations. The Test 1 points are very often above the reference points, so they ranks are structurally larger, i.e. the chance that the score of a randomly drawn sample is greater in the Test 1 group than in the reference group is significantly larger than 50%. This gets picked up by the paired Wilcoxon rank sum test. The Test 2 results are about as often above as below the reference, so their ranks are not significantly larger, hence the large P-value: this outcome is very likely if Test 2 results are on average not larger than reference samples. If you want a conclusion in terms of the mean, then you could just do a paired t-test and rely on the central limit theorem, or check if the location shift assumption holds.
