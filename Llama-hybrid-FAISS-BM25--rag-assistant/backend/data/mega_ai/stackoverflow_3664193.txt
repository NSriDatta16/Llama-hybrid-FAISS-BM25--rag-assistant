I am trying to build an application which should send the data as an xml file to the server and other user's should be able to see the info uploaded by another user. Embedding everything in xml file is done but now the question is how to push this information to the other user's so that they can see it in a particular format. Also how i can proceed towards making my own server to support this iphone app. Thanks,
