ios4 - Load new view on clicking a button

I am currently using XCode 3.2.3 and iOS4. I'm working on an app that simply starts with one screen and on a button click moves to the next. I have gone thorugh the ViewController programming guide and a post here. What I am doing is very similar to whats happening on the post. So let me explain the steps, I followed: In IB, drag and drop, a View from the library into the editor. I renamed the new UIView to myView. In my AppControllerDelegate, I added the new view "myView" as a property of the view controller (File's Owner). I synthesized it as well in the implementation. Now, in the implementation of the ViewController, within the button pressed action handler, I wrote the following lines of code: [self.view addSubView: myView]; On clicking the button however, I do not see a new screen or my new view. However if I do this, I get a new screen or new view: UIView *anotherView = [[UIView alloc] initWithFrame:self.view.frame]; [self.view addSubView: anotherView]; I do know that the best way is to do it with separate NIBs for each UIView. However, I am new to iPhone development and have not explored that path as yet. My question: What am I missing upto step 3?
