Have you had a look at TrueCrypt ? In general you shouldn't try to reinvent the wheel, especially with security requirements. This is a heavy topic and messing around with the file system on your own should be the last option to consider. TrueCrypt uses two different modes of operation: File-hosted (container) Partition/device-hosted Note: In addition to creating the above types of virtual volumes, TrueCrypt can encrypt a physical partition/drive where Windows is installed (for more information, see the chapter System Encryption). A TrueCrypt file-hosted volume is a normal file, which can reside on any type of storage device. It contains (hosts) a completely independent encrypted virtual disk device. A TrueCrypt partition is a hard disk partition encrypted using TrueCrypt. You can also encrypt entire hard disks, USB hard disks, USB memory sticks, and other types of storage devices.
