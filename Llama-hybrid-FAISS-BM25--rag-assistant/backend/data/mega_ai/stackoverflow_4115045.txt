Ruby: What does the snippet: (num & 1) == 0 exactly do?

I was watching a metaprogramming video from PragProg, and Dave Thomas showed this snippet of code: module Math class false puts Math.is_even? 2 # => true Now I understand what is going on here, but I don't know what exactly is happening with the (num & 1) part of the Math.is_even? class method. I know it is a bitwise operation but that is about it. Can someone explain to me what is going with that line of code? Thanks.
