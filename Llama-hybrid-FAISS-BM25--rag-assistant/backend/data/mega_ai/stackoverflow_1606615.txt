Is Silverlight appropriate for a big LOB application

So I'm at the proof of concept stage for a fairly large LOB application. The application will be deployed to many desktops (200+) in many organisations. It will contain lots of CRUD type screens (around 100), along with some pretty complex processes like invoice generation and financial ledger integration. It will also contain lots of reports. I've already done lots of homework and pretty much settled on a technology stack of: PRISM CSLA NHibernate All that's missing is the presentation layer and so my question is this: is Silverlight 3 an appropriate technology to build such a large application? Initially I was concerned about the lack of a reporting story for Silverlight but now there is a commerial reporting tool available that problem is solved. So now I'm wondering about the size of my application and what the performance will be like when they try to download it in their browser. With 100+ "screens" and a whole load of reports it isn't going to be lightweight by any means. Is Silverlight 3 a sensible option or should I be looking at WPF instead? The primary reason for SL3 was the problem of deploying to lots of desktops in lots of organisations.
