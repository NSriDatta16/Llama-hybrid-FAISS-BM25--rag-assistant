I suspect you will get lots of opinions here since a good introductory text is a subjective ask. That said, you might want to look at something like Weisberg's Applied Linear Regression . That is used by a number of graduate statistics programs I know and covers all of those issues. It is a little light on autocorrelations; however, you would want a proper time series book for that -- something like Box, Jenkins, and Reinsel's Time Series Analysis .
