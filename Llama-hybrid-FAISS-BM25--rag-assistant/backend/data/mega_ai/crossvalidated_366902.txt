Is it okay to include the dependent variable as an input variable to the higher-level regression model, in a hierarchical / multi-level setup

Let's say I have a hierarchical dataset with student scores (for each student) nested within schools. While modelling for a varying intercept, would it be okay to include the average of student scores within a school as an input variable while modelling the school-level intercept? Wouldn't this count as "data leakage"? In some sense, I am using the dependent variable as an input to predict the dependent variable itself.
