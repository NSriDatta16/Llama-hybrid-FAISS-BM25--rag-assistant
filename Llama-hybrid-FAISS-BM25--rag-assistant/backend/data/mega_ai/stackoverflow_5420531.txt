Applying De Morgan's laws (there are two of them, but there are symmetrical) will change: !(x>7) || !(y>5) into: !( (x>7) && (y>5) ) Which I assume is what option c is supposed to be, but the way you wrote it the external brackets are missing. You got almost everything right, you just forgot that the operator also changes. Here is the easiest way I know to handle De Morgan rules. Suppose you have something like this: ( (A) OP (B) ) where OP is either "or" or "and". Make sure you write all of the brackets, even if the external ones are redundant. Now the negate all the brackets and switch the operator "or" becomes "and" and vice versa. So what you get is this: !( !(A) OTHER_OP !(B) ) Now you usually end up having double negative which can be removed. But identifying the correct structure (the three brackets and the matching operator) is the key.
