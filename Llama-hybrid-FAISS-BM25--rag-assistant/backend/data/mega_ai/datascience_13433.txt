How can you determine the growth rate you need to achieve a certain customer base?

Say you have 12 K active customers every month in your platform in August 2016, how can you determine at what rate do you need to grow every month to achieve a certain total (say, 1.5 million) by next year, August 2017. Further, how can you generate different growth scenarios? Say, grow aggressively during the first quarter and then plateau. Are there any time series or optimization tools related to this kind of problem?
