How to apply dimensionality reduction to a data set with outliers?

I try to apply dimensionality reduction to a multidimensional data set (with numerical features) with significant outliers. I have managed to identify outliers with Isolation Forest but now I'm in a quandary how to handle them: As the features are on a different scale, I'm expected to do some normalization as a first step, but having these strong outliers usual methods like PCA are out of question as they're usually sensitive to outliers. Omitting the observation seems suboptimal as it increases bias and anyway, I'm going to work on a time series forecasting later on where each time step is expected to be filled in the given interval, I cannot leave out observations. Maybe I could do clipping/winsorizing on the individual features but I'm vary of this as it disregards feature correlation. Is there a good way in this situation? Maybe any dimensionality reduction method which is robust to outliers?
