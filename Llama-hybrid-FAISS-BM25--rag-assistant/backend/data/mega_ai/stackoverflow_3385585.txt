PHP: How to loop through a dynamic number of classes

I'm wanting to detect all objects(classes) defined in a php file (example: flavors.php). The number of objects will be defined dynamically, so I need to process the available objects with a function at runtime until the objects are exhausted. After the objects are exhausted the program stops. I have full control over the code, so if there is a better way to store the variables, and keep them organized using only php, please let me know. As a learning experience, I'm trying to make php manipulate a set of objects without knowing the number, or the names of the objects that exist in advance. This is the logic I'm trying to code: while(THERE ARE STILL CLASSES TO PROCESS IN FLAVORS.php) { $var = description_generator(CLASS_NAME SENT TO THE FUNCTION); print($var); } For context this is the entire program: flavors.php class vanilla { // property declaration public $color = 'white'; public $price = '1.25'; } class chocolate { // property declaration public $color = 'brown'; public $price = '1.50'; } main.php { function description_generator($class_name) { $selected_flavor_class = new $class_name(); $flavor_color = $selected_flavor_class->flavor_color; $flavor_price = $selected_flavor_class->flavor_price; return "$flavor_color"." "."$flavor_price"; } while(THERE ARE STILL CLASSES TO PROCESS) { print($var = description_generator(CLASS_NAME)); } To summarize, is there a way to make PHP process through an undetermined number of classes? Also is there a better way to create and organize objects that store multiple variables such as chocolate = 'brown', '1.50' without just using a simple array?
