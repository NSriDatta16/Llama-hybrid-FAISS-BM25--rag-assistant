This post was originally intended as a long comment rather than a complete answer to the question at hand. From the question, it's a little unclear if the interest lies only in the binary case or, perhaps, in more general cases where they may be continuous or take on other discrete values. One example that doesn't quite answer the question, but is related, and which I like, deals with item-preference rankings obtained via paired comparisons. The Bradley–Terry model can be expressed as a logistic regression where $$ \mathrm{logit}( \Pr(Y_{ij} = 1) ) = \alpha_i - \alpha_j , $$ and $\alpha_i$ is an "affinity", "popularity", or "strength" parameter of item $i$ with $Y_{ij} = 1$ indicating item $i$ was preferred over item $j$ in a paired comparison. If a full round-robin of comparisons is performed (i.e., a pairwise preference is recorded for each unordered $(i,j)$ pair), then it turns out that the rank order of the MLEs $\hat{\alpha}_i$ correspond to the rank order of $S_i = \sum_{j \neq i} Y_{ij}$, the sum total of times each object was preferred over another. To interpret this, imagine a full round-robin tournament in your favorite competitive sport. Then, this result says that the Bradley–Terry model ranks the players/teams according to their winning percentage. Whether this is an encouraging or disappointing result depends on your point of view, I suppose. NB This rank-ordering result does not hold, in general, when a full round-robin is not played.
