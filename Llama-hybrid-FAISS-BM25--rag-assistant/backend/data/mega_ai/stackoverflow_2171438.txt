Why would an image on a web page get repositioned after a few refreshs?

So I discovered this weird bug, it's so odd and I can't understand why is it doing this. I am using Firefox 3.5.7. It's not happening in Internet Explorer 8 though. So if you visit this website: http://www.ninjasliveclancodes.com/ and look at top right where it says "World War" and pay attention to it because after you refresh a few times you should see it's icon picture move down a little bit closing the gap between the picture and the word "World War". I found out they would all react this way if there was a space within the word. Anyone know why is it doing this? Also, how can I stop it from doing that by either eliminating the gap or have it stay? Edit: Either way, I would still like to know how can I close in the gap between icon and word. It looks exactly the way I want it in IE8, however, I can't reproduce that in Firefox 3.5.7 World War iMobsters Ninjas Edit2: Line-height allowed me to close in the gap. However, does anyone know a way around it?
