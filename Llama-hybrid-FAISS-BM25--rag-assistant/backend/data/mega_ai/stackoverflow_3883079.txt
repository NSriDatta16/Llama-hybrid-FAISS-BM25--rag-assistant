What is the right way to structure a large multi-application codebase in SVN

We've currently got a single repo with codesion, http://John.svn.cvsdude.com , with a single SVN project http://John.svn.cvsdude.com/MyProject , which contains a few subdirs for individual Visual C++ solutions This all started as one application and though we did split off separate library projects for future re-use, it's still all the same SVN project. Lets say we aim to have multiple applications with some overlap in libraries used, what's the right/best way to set this up in SVN? Of course one could just keep one SVN project and put app-projects and library-projects as sub-dirs, but it hardly seems right somehow. Say we have App1, App2, App3 and LibraryA, LibraryB, LibraryC, LibraryD where these are all separate projects/solutions... how would you organise this under one (or more repos)? Is there a best-practice?
