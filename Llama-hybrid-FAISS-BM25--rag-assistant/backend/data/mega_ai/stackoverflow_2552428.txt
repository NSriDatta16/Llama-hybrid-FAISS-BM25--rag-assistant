Regex: Use start of line/end of line signs (^ or $) in different context

While doing some small regex task I came upon this problem. I have a string that is a list of tags that looks e.g like this: foo,bar,qux,garp,wobble,thud What I needed to do was to check if a certain tag, e.g. 'garp' was in this list. (What it finally matches is not really important, just if there is a match or not.) My first and a bit stupid try at this was to use the following regex: [^,]garp[,$] My idea was that before 'garp' there should either be the start of the line/string or a comma, after 'garp' there should be either a comma or the end of the line/string. Now, it is instantly obvious that this regex is wrong: Both ^ and $ change their behaviour in the context of the character class [ ]. What I finally came up with is the following: ^garp$|^garp,|,garp,|,garp$ This regex just handles the 4 cases one by one. (Tag at beginning of list, in the center, at the end, or as the only element of the list.) The last regex is somehow a bit ugly in my eyes and just for funs sake I'd like to make it a bit more elegant. Is there a way how the start of line/end of line characters (^ and $) can be used in the context of character classes? EDIT: Ok, some more info was wished so here it is: I'm using this within an Oracle SQL statement. This sadly does not allow any look-around assertions but as I'm only interested if there is a match or not (and not what is matched) this does not really affect me here. The tags can contain non-alphabetical characters like - or _ so \bgarp\b would not work. Also one tag can contain an other tag as SilentGhost said, so /garp/ doesnt work either.
