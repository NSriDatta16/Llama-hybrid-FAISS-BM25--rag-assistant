Lift - Page displays as XML in Firefox rather than HTML

I'm trying to get a simple Lift example running and I'm having a strange issue. I am using the Sonatype sample list project here . I modified the HTML slightly, but it wasn't working originally either. The issue I'm having is that when I run the local jetty server and try to access http://localhost:8080 it displays as XML in Firefox 3.6.10 rather than HTML. Note, it displays fine in IE8 but the Content-Type in IE8 is "text/html". I assume Firefox doesn't like the Content-Type "application/xhtml+xml" for some reason. The message in Firefox says: This XML file does not appear to have any style information associated with it. The document tree is shown below. Below are the response headers from Firebug: Expires Thu, 16 Sep 2010 03:55:04 UTC Content-Length 558 Cache-Control no-cache; private; no-store Content-Type application/xhtml+xml; charset=utf-8 Pragma no-cache Date Thu, 16 Sep 2010 03:55:04 UTC X-Lift-Version 2.0-scala280-SNAPSHOT Server Jetty(6.1.22) ..and the actual response: Lift Test Welcome to your project! Welcome to toto01 at Wed Sep 15 20:55:04 PDT 2010 // Any ideas as to what is going wrong? How would I change the Content-Type in Lift for Firefox if that is the issue?
