It depends what your target devices are for your app. Usually you'll want to target Android 1.5 if you want to cover all devices. Targetting 2.1 will still give you about 90% device coverage and is better if your app is very performance heavy; 1.5/1.6 devices are on the low end and probably wouldn't run these types of apps well anyways. This page shows the distribution of Android devices and their OS versions that are currently out there. http://developer.android.com/resources/dashboard/platform-versions.html
