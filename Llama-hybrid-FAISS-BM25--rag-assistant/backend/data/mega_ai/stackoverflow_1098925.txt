This article - " The Positive Legacy of C++ and Java " - answers your question directly. "C++ has both stack allocation and heap allocation and you must overload your operators to handle all situations and not cause memory leaks. Difficult indeed. Java, however, has a single storage allocation mechanism and a garbage collector, which makes operator overloading trivial" ... Java mistakenly (according to the author) omitted operator overloading because it was complicated in C++, but forgot why (or didn't realize that it didn't apply to Java). Thankfully, higher level languages like Scala give developers options, while still running on the same JVM.
