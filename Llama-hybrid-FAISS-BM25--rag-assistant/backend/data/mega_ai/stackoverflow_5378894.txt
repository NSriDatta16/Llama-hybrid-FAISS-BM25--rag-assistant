Unable to use drag Drop in radtreeview

I have binded all data to RadTreeView but unable to use drag-'n-drop. I used four properties as IsDragDropEnabled="True" IsDropPreviewLineEnabled="True" AllowDrop="True" IsDragPreviewEnabled="True" and I want to drop an item within same tree. But it doesnt work.
