The executable was signed with invalid entitlements

I am having a problem with ad-hoc distribution on my iPhone. I have developed an application with SDK 3.0. I have a developer's license. I have added certificates and provisioning profiles in my project. So, no problem with that. But, when I try to install the app on my iPhone, it compiles the project and then displays the error: "The executable was signed with invalid entitlements" in the Organizer window. Am I missing something? I have upgraded my iPhone from 2.2.1 and have downloaded latest SDK from Apple. Please help me with this issue.
