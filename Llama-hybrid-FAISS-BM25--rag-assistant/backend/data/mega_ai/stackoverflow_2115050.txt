You pretty much answered your own question. If you ever reach the stage where you want to add dynamic content to an HTML document, you're going to need to change the file extension, or alter the webserver configuration to have PHP process .html files. Generally, you will want every page to contain, if not dynamic content, then at least consistent content. Things like headers and footers, that require a massive amount of copy-pasting in straight HTML or a single include() in php. PHP allows for much cleaner organization and much less repetition, even if you're not after dynamic content for your pages.
