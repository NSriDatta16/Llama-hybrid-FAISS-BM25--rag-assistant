Can cache folder in Symfony be deleted without side effect?

As far as I know, the cache folder ( that's located along apps, config, data lib and other folders) in Symfony project are just storage folder. Can I choose not to check it into my source control? Will my action has adverse effect on the completeness of my check-in?
