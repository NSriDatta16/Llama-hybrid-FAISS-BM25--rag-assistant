From MSDN: View resolution When an SQL statement references a nonindexed view, the parser and query optimizer analyze the source of both the SQL statement and the view and then resolve them into a single execution plan. There is not one plan for the SQL statement and a separate plan for the view. There should not be any different performance. Views helps you organize, not any performance enhancement. Unless you are using indexed views. Only the definition of a nonindexed view is stored, not the rows of the view. The query optimizer incorporates the logic from the view definition into the execution plan it builds for the SQL statement that references the nonindexed view.
