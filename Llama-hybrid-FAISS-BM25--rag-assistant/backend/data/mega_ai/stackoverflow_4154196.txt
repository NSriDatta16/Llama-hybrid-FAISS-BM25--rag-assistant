In this particular case the clearest solution is the S.Lott answer But in some complex logical conditions I would prefer use some boolean algebra to get a clear solution. Using De Morgan's law ¬(A^B) = ¬Av¬B not (u0 u or u >= u0+step then if u0 > u or u >= u0+step: pass ... in this case the «clear» solution is not more clear :P
