GMail app accepts file:// Uris only if they are on the sdcard... and on an android 1.6 device I had even an issue with it accepting only file://sdcard/* Uris whereas the real external storage of this specific device is on another path. Anyway, I have a real better behavior with attachments since I provide them through a ContentProvider.
