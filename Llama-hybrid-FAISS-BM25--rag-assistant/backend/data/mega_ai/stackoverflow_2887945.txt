What kind of object are you trying to create?? First of all, all LDAP object always have a prefix, DC= for domain component, OU= for organizational unit, CN= for common name. Also, many LDAP objects have minimal requirements for what they need to be considered valid; e.g. a user or a group must have a unique samAccountName. So again - what are you trying to create?? If you wrap your creation code into a try..catch - do you get any exceptions? If so - what are they?? static void Main(string[] args) { DirectoryEntry root = new DirectoryEntry("LDAP://servername/OU=Services,OU=PCX,DC=q2q,DC=xenyq,DC=com", "Administrator", "pass"); try { DirectoryEntry newItem = root.Children.Add("CN=test_node", "valid_schema_class_name"); root.CommitChanges(); } catch(Exception exc) { string error = exc.GetType().FullName + ": " + exc.Message; } }
