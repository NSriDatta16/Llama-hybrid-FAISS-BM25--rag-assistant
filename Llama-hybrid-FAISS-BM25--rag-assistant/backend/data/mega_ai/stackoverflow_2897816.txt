T-SQL: How to know how much storage space is left in sql server express?

How is it possible to know how much of the "DB quota" imposed by SQL Server express edition (4GB in old versions, 10GB in 2008R2) is in use? Let's say I have a DB that is using 1GB, I want to know "9GB of free space". Is it there a T-SQL command for this?
