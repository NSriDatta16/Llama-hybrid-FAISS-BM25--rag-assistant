3D symmetry plane using PCA

I'm trying to compute the symmetry plane of a 3D mesh representing an animal footprint in R. I've ran a PCA on the 5755 points that are making up the 3D mesh (see below): The output of the PCA is the following matrix of variable loadings (i.e., a matrix whose columns contain the eigenvectors): The question is how can I now link these Principal Components to the symmetry plan (++=) that passes thought the centre of mass of the 3D mesh (i.e. mean x, mean y and mean z)? I've read many times the following post but unfortunately I couldn't find a solution to my problem: Fitting a plane to a set of points in 3D using PCA Here is my script (so far): library(Rvcg) library(rgl) path_ply $vectors eigen_values values eigen_vectors eigen_values a
