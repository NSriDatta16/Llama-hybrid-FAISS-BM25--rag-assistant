Mo Flanagan's answer is the best IMHO. Some more context. If you're using binding handles, there is no way of tracking state across RPC calls and the concept of a "client disconnect" is essentially meaningless - you still need to return from the RPC call. If you're using context handles, then the RPC runtime library will call the _rundown function when the client disconnects. When that routine is called, the server can clean up whatever it needs to.
