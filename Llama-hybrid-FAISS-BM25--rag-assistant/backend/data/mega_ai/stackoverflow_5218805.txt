Getting group name using gdata api

I am trying to access the group name of all entries in my contact list. How can I access the details of a group given the href link? This is the current output: 9 Albert Gandhi 2011-03-07T09:48:19.824Z I was thrown out of college for cheating on the metaphysics exam; I looked into the soul of the boy sitting next to me. albert.gandhi@company1.net Member of group: http://www.google.com/m8/feeds/groups/blah.blah%40blah.com/base/4c8d4c8d8d218d21 But I would like something like this: 9 Albert Gandhi 2011-03-07T09:48:19.824Z I was thrown out of college for cheating on the metaphysics exam; I looked into the soul of the boy sitting next to me. albert.gandhi@company1.net Member of group: GroupName Below is the code I am using to list the contact feed (taken mainly from the examples provided with the API) def PrintFeed(self, feed, ctr=0): """Prints out the contents of a feed to the console. Args: feed: A gdata.contacts.ContactsFeed instance. ctr: [int] The number of entries in this feed previously printed. This allows continuous entry numbers when paging through a feed.

""" if not feed.entry: print '\nNo entries in feed.\n' return 0 for i, entry in enumerate(feed.entry): print '\n%s %s %s' % (ctr+i+1, entry.title.text, entry.updated.text) if entry.content: print ' %s' % (entry.content.text) for email in entry.email: if email.primary and email.primary == 'true': print ' %s' % (email.address) # Show the contact groups that this contact is a member of. for group in entry.group_membership_info: print ' Member of group: %s' % (group.href) # Display extended properties. for extended_property in entry.extended_property: if extended_property.value: value = extended_property.value else: value = extended_property.GetXmlBlobString() print ' Extended Property %s: %s' % (extended_property.name, value) return len(feed.entry) + ctr
