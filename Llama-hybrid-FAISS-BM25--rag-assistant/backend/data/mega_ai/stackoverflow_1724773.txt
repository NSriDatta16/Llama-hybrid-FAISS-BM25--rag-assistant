Why is the usage of "#" comments frequently discouraged in PHP?

As far as I know, there are 3 types of comments recognized by PHP: /* A block comment */ // A single-line comment # Also a single-line comment However, many coding standards, for example, those of PEAR or Kohana , discourage the last type of comments with no explanation. The question is, why is it so? Is this syntax planned for deprecation anytime soon?
