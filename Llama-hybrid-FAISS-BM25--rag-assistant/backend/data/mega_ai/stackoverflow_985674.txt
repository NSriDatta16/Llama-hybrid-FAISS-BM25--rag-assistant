For modern implementations of support vector machines, the scaling of the training algorithm is dependent on lots of factors, such as the nature of the training data and kernel that you are using. The scaling factor of O(n^3) is an analytical result and isn't particularly useful in predicting how SVM training will scale in real-world situations. For example, empirical estimates of the training algorithm used by SVMLight put the scaling against training set size to be approximately O(n^2) . I would suggest you ask this question in the kernel machines forum . I think you're more likely to get a better answer than on Stack Overflow, which is more of a general-purpose programming site.
