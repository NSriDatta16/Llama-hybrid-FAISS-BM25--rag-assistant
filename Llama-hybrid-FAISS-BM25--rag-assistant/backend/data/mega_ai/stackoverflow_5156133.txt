Deploying Files to IsolatedStorage in Windows Phone 7

Hi everyone I would like to know if it's possible to deploy my app assets directly to Isolated Storage once the app get deployed. I'm currently extracting them from code but this make the app's first launch too slow and it will be declined once it's submitted to the marketplace. I'm wondering if there is a nice trick to make the process faster Thanks
