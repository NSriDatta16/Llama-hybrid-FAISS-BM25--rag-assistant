Of course you can but I suggest you to go with ARIMAX because when having hourly data, you won't be able to reach seasonnality effect so go with dummy variables for season effect for example or target a certain period of the time. 1.bis I don't know why you want to fit 336 ARIMA models for each hour ? You just do 1 model and then you do a prevision for t+h where h = 336. One ARIMAX and one linear regression basically, you compared both modeling with an error criterion like MAPE for example. ARIMAX is your best option here, but you could try VAR with water level, pressure and temperature (VECM if they are integrate). But first of all, before doing ARIMAX, you should question about stationarity of your time series before even considering modeling ARIMA(X).
