Using components from PCA as index / measurement?

I have used Principal Component Analysis to find main components that desribe the perceptions of the environment. The goal is to use those main components as index / measurement for another study. My problem is if I find a "parsimonious description of the variables" and use that as an index for the next study, how can I be sure that people what that term actually means (which variables it included)? So, I found that e.g. pleasant, comfortable, relaxing, welcoming etc. to be in the same component and decide to call them "positive perception" as use it in the next study as "How do you find those environments in terms of "positive perception"? How are people going to know that "positive perception" means pleasant, comfortable, relaxing and welcoming? Do I need another validation study to confirm that the new term I came up with is appropriately describing the variables? Would it be enough to ask a number of people what word they think would describe those variables best? Or what they think "positive perception" means? Many thanks in advance!!!
