First note that the model: mod.full is rather questionable because you include random slopes for E but no main effect. This means you implicitly assume the overall effect of E is zero. I don't like the procedure you use in step 2. A better approach is to start with the random structure that the underlying theory of the subject suggests is plausible. Then if there is a singular fit, look for the part(s) of the random structure that are causing the singular fit and eliminate them. This can usually be seen from the summary(model) output - there will usually be a variance very close to zero, or a correlation between random slopes and intercepts very close to, or indeed equal to, -1 or 1. In the latter case you can try a model that does not estimate the correlation between random slopes and intercepts by using the || notation. In the former case you can remove the relevant term. See these answers for further details on this: Dealing with singular fit in mixed models How to simplify a singular random structure when reported correlations are not near +1/-1 Then I reduce the fixed factors that are not critical to the study from the new model. It is not clear what you mean by this. If this is an observational study then variables should be included in the model using a priori knowledge about the subject, and with the aid of a causal diagram. Mediators should never be included and confounders should (but care should be taken to over-adjust) and so should competing exposures. Everything should flow from your research question. Then I compare the models. If those fixed factors do not differ from the new full model, I remove them. Don't do this. See the previous paragraph. After removing the fixed factors, I have a final full model. I use this to compare with models without the other fixed factors that I am interested in. Again, don't do this. I was also wondering whether the factors can be added up rather than reduced? Again, don't do this. If you have no idea of what factors should be included in the model, then you should refer to the appropriate literature. It is a very bad idea to use any kind of stepwise procedure for chosing variables in a model. Lastly, mod.final As per my answer to you other question , these models are all the same.
