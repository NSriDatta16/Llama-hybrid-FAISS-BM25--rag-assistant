What you are describing is one of the "standard" NLP problems faced in NLP and it usually referred to as "natural language inference" (NLI), or sometimes also as "textual entailment". There is plenty of research in this kind of task, and its variants, like cross-lingual NLI (XNLI). I suggest you have a look at nlpprogress ( link ) or paperswithcode ( link ) to understand the landscape of benchmark datasets and SoTA models in NLI.
