Are there pitfalls in using the output of machine learning model, such as a neural net as the input to a traditional GLM or similar?

To be more specific, loss reserving models in actuarial science, such as the chain ladder method, can be expressed as GLMs. I have developed a predictive model using neural nets which takes into account some aspects of the insured (it is an individual risk model). Can the output of this model be safely used as an input to the insurance company's existing loss reserve model?
