Indeed, this is well-trodden ground. You have most of the data necessary to estimate the probability of disease. In addition to the data you present, consider adding other variables that are associated with disease such as age or other disease-specific factors (eg, smoking). The measurement depicted and other factors associated with the disease can be entered into a logistic regression model, which can be used to estimate the probability of disease in patients similar to those for whom you have data. From the logistic model, most packages can estimate an AUC of ROC curve. True positives, false positives, etc. can also be estimated, but require you to create a dichotomy (high risk, low risk) from the spectrum of risk, which may be tempting to do but is rarely biologically plausible.
