I will try to explain proportional odds ratio model in this context since it was suggested and indicated in at least 2 answers to this question. The score test of a proportional odds model is equivalent to the Wilcoxon rank sum test. More precisely, the score test statistic for no effect of a single dichotomous covariate in a proportional odds cumulative logistic regression model (McCullagh 1980) for ordinal outcome was shown to be equal to the Wilcoxon rank sum test statistic. (Proof in An extension of the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test for complex sample survey data .) Just like Wilcoxon rank sum test, this test detect whether two samples were drawn from different distributions, regardless of the expected values. This test is invalid if you only want to detect whether two samples were drawn from distributions with different expected values, just like Wilcoxon rank sum test.
