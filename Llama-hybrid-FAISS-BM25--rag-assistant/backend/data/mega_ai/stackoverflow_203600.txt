It depends on what else that object contains -- if the "object" is just a bunch of functions then it's probably not the end of the world. But if the object contains a bunch of other objects, then instantiating it is gonna call all their constructors (and destructors, when it's deleted) and you may get memory fragmentation and so on. That said, it doesn't sound like performance is your biggest problem right now.
