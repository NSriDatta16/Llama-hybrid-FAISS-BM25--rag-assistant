Cannot open xls file in IE

We have JSF web application that generates XLS file and gives user link to thes file. All works fine if access this file via HTTP. But IE(8) cannot open/save this xls file via HTTPS. There is following error message: Internet Explorer cannot download ...466088C5C313F92808BDB0AFF3447 from testhost. Internet Explorer was not able to open this Internet site. The requested site is either unavailable or cannot be found. Please try again later. I can open the same document via HTTPS in Firefox and in Chrome. What can be the problem with IE?
