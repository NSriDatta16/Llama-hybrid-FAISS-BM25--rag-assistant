Selecting ARIMA orders based on ACF-PACF vs. auto.arima

I use R to fit an ARIMA model to a time series (yearly granularity): library(forecast) beer Based on the ACF and PACF, I fit an ARIMA(4,0,4) model. dif.ts_beer.fit It looks OK. But then I run auto.arima : auto.arima(dif.ts_beer) It gives: Series: dif.ts_beer ARIMA(0,0,0) with non-zero mean Coefficients: mean 70.1176 s.e. 17.0359 sigma^2 estimated as 5242: log likelihood=-96.4 AIC=196.81 AICc=197.67 BIC=198.48 So the manual ARIMA(4,0,4) is not a good choice for this case? If so, what ARIMA(p,d,q) model should I use?
