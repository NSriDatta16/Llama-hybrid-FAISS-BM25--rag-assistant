Saying that this is "quite an ethical dilemma" is probably blowing it out of proportion. You definitely want to code sign your executables, and I don't really see the problem with you signing it. For example, TortoiseSVN is signed by "Stefan Kueng, Open Source Developer". That said, it is probably a good idea to form some kind of legal entity for your project, and then get the code-signing certificate in the name of your project's entity . That way, rather than you personally signing the executable (and thus "taking all the credit"), your project's name shows up as the publisher. If you were in the US, I would suggest either forming a LLC or possibly a 501(c)(3) organization , which is exempt from income tax and allows individuals to make tax-deductable donations to the project. ( Many open source projects organize as 501(c)(3) entities, including WordPress and jQuery .) I see you're in Turkey, so you'll have to research your local requirements for forming some kind of legal entity; once formed, you'll be able to get a certificate from a CA in the name of your project's entity rather than your own.
