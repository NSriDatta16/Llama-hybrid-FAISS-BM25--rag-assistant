Scrolling of oversized view? (iPhone)

I imagine this is pretty dead-simple, but somehow I haven’t been able to get it to work: I need to display a View containing a group of controls (roughly 800px tall) -- which can be scrolled vertically by the user, as that view is too big to fit on the screen all at once. That’s it. I’d think that this might mean something like this: UIView [normal size] > UIScrollView > UIView [the oversized one] ... and then enabling vertical scrolling, etc. But somehow I'm missing something, as the best I've gotten is the first screenful to appear on-screen, without the ability to scroll down. ~~~ [Note: I know that this might often be done using a Table view, and vertical scrolling then happens for ‘free’. But this is a series of special-purpose controls (an odd assortment of various UISliders, UISwitches, UILabels, UIButtons, etc.) that wouldn’t readily fit into a standard table view without a bunch of customizing anyway. They’re also static as well (i.e., don’t need to be changed programatically) -- hence they can be completely built in IB, and that’s how I’d much prefer to do it for this situation anyway. I just need to allow the whole lot to be accessible via scrolling. I also know that they could be split up into multiple screens, and I'll do this if absolutely necessary; but they're a unified logical group, and so that's not the optimal choice in this instance.] Any suggestions? That (and/or a code fragment) would be VERY much appreciated. Many thanks in advance!
