I can't say what your predecessor was thinking. As Rex M said, sometimes political pressures result in strange implementations. A great many people who stuff a list of items into a single value in tables are trying to get around the restrictions of (old style) first normal form. The down side is that queries have to be done programatically in the app instead of using a simple citerion in a WHERE clause. About 10 years ago, Oracle added the capability of putting a table inside a value. About the same time, Date redefined 1NF so that all relations are automatically in 1NF. This includes rleations that contain other relations. Without that feature, the simplest and most powerful design is to break the repeated item out into a separate value, with one row for each item. (Example: a list of courses a student is enrolled in) In a lot of cases, the root coause is the designers ignorance or stubbornness. Again, I don't know what restrictions your predecessor faced. Don't imitate him unless you have to.
