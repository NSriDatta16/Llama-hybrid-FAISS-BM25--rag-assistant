How do I know if a model with a subset of the features of another model has lowest training/test error?

I'm doing the Machine Learning specialization from the University of Washington on Coursera, and I have to answer some questions in a quiz from the Regression course. They ask which model would have the lowest training error if the features of Model 1 are a strict subset of those in Model 2. How do I check this? In my point of view this is not enough information to say which model have the lowest training error, because I think the training error doesn't depend on the number of features, but on the number of observations. Am I wrong?
