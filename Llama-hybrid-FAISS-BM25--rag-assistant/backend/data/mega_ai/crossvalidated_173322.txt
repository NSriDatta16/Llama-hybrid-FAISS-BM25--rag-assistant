polynomial regression: what do large values of Y mean?

I have a time series of x:libor and y:money rates. using the following polynomial y=b0+b1(x)+b2(x)^2, i get values of y that exceed (or are sometimes negative) the coveriance/variance for large multiples of vector x. (i) Is my problem one of an asymptote? and (ii) is a regime switch appropriate?
