Why don't you start by reading the Swing tutorial ? There is a section that explains all about Layout Management as well as well what "absolute positioning" is. It also explains when you would use abolute positioning versus using a layout manager. Generally the only time you would use it is when you need to support drag components to a random position. The tutorial also has lots of other basic examples of using Swing components.
