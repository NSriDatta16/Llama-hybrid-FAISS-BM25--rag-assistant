Another name for contant variance assumption is homoskedasticity , and its opposite is heteroskedasticity . To find heteroskedasticity, you can both visually look at the relationship between the fitted values (predicted y ) and the residuals and perform the Breusch-Pagan test. In R: # generate a heteroskedastic independent variable x set.seed(0) n By looking at the scatterplot it already becomes apparent that y doesn't have a constant variance. You can then plot the linear model itself to get a plot of the relationship between the fitted values (predicted y) and the residuals: # fit a linear model lm1 Again, it becomes pretty clear that the variance of the residuals isn't constant. To get a quantitative measure of heteroskedasticity, perform the Breusch-Pagan test (requires the lmtest -Package): # load library library(lmtest) # perform test bptest(lm1) This gives: studentized Breusch-Pagan test data: lm1 BP = 12.2634, df = 1, p-value = 0.0004619 A high BP-Value with a significant p-value means that the Null-Hypothesis of fit and residuals being uncorrelated can be rejected, thus you have heteroskedasticity in your data (in this case).
