I would add a dynamic id attribute (or use the metadata plugin) using jQuery to identify the split paragraph. And based on the identified split string place the cursor before the tag. Do make sure to remove the id attribute (or some metadata) once you are done placing the cursor, so that any other splits or a backspace on the same doesn't result in unintended consequences Hope that helps
