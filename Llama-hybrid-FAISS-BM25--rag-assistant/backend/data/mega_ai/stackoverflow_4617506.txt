Placing TextView in grid in different resolutions

I need to make an Activity in Android that has a grid (20x8) drawn in the background with cells of different styles. I have 3 background images for the 3 ldpi-mdpi-hdpi resolutions. The problem is that I need to place a TextView in every cell but if I put it in an absolute position for a resolution (eg. ldpi) it is not in the right position for mdpi and hdpi. Which is the Android approach to solve it?
