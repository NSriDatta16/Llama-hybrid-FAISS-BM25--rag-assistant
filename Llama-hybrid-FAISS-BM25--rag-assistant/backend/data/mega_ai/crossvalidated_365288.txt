when is it possible to have OLS fits better than random forest and LASSO?

I ran several different models on a mini data set of about 100 observations with 90 features. When I tried OLS with backward selection the model is significant with many features significant (82 features selected). However, when I tried to use the same data on LASSO, all parameters shrank to 0 except intercept and the MSE is higher than the one by OLS. The same happened for random forest, I got negative % variance explained (please see below) and MSE much higher than OLS. Is this a typical case of overfitting? If so, why is that the backward selection of OLS failed to address this?
