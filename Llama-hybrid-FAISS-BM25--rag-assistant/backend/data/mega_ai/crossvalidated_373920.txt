With categorical response models, there might not be enough degrees of freedom to fit the variance components of an unconstrained residual covariance matrix, and even if you have, the fit is likely to be poor, which usually means more computation time and less reliability. Besides, such parameters are often not interesting. By fixing the residual variance, MCMC chains no longer have to explore the space in the residual variance parameter dimension, and can focus on the really interesting parameters. Yes, it's the same concept as in frequentist models. It probably won't change much the results. Having a look at Hadfield's discussion on fixing residual variances (from page 49) might be of use.
