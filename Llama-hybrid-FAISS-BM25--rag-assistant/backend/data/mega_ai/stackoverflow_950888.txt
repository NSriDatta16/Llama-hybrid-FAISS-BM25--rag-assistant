You may want to take a look at the answers to the following question, though the question is for Medium size, it could still be rather complicated: What are the basic questions to ask a person who wants his Medium sized website done? Have you asked the customer why diagrams or prototype screen shots are being discouraged? They may have their own reasons for this, such as trying to limit the amount of work done before the "real" work begins. As an idea, that isn't so bad assuming they have gone through making a spec with others before and are comfortable with that process. If this is new to them, then it may be worth discussing why you want to have those prototypes, e.g. sometimes words are open to interpretation and this is more easily resolved with a picture than the thousand words that the picture shows easily.
