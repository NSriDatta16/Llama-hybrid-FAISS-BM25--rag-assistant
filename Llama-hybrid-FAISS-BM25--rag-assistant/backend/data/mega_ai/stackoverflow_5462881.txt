how to replace a language identifier in a URL?

I need some help I have written the following preg_replace. The idea of the script is to get the language name from the domain name: If I have a http://www.domainname.com/nl/this/is/a/test/index.asp I would like to strip the (nl) part from the domain name. The nl is a variable for languages so it could be: http://www.domainname.com/nl/this/is/a/test/index.asp http://www.domainname.com/fr/this/is/a/test/index.asp http://www.domainname.com/de/this/is/a/test/index.asp The above domains represents language directories... I am only using the script where I know there will be a language directory. The script above also removes the this/a/test/ the (is) from the url. (which tells me the script is greedy. What would be the best method to grab the language from the url? Can someone please provide me with some guidence. Thanks This is the script I came up using the advice below: Exactly what I needed, or is there a more elegant way?
