Regression models are often capable of calculating standard deviations for their predictions. You could then build a confidence interval. In simpler problems like linear regression, this problem is quite easy. But I think your question is more related to more complex machine learning algorythms such as neural networks. Well, I am pretty sure it is possible to train them for that. With random forests, you can use what the 1st percentile of the predictions made by individual trees as your lower bound, but I think you would require a huge amount of trees for this to be reliable.
