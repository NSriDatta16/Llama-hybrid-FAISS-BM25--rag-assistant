How to perform bit shift without (" >") operator efficiently?

I am working on a OpenGL ES 2.0 shader and I have tightly packed data e.g. three 5-bit unsigned integers within a block of two bytes. To unpack this data I obviously need bit-shifting, but this is not supported in OpenGL ES Shading Language (see page 29 http://www.opengl.org/registry/doc/GLSLangSpec.Full.1.20.8.pdf ) Consequently I perform a number of *2 and /2 operations to emulate bit shifting. Does anyone know a more efficient/elegant way to do this? Is there a trick I am not aware of? Thanks!
