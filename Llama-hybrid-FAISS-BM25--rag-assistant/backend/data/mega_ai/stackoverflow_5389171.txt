It's hard to give an answer for the clustering part, because I have no idea what you're looking for in the data. For the neural network, beside interpolating there are at least two other methods that come to mind: training separate networks for each matrix feeding them all together to the same network, with a flag specifying which matrix the data is coming from, i.e. something like: input (timestamp, flag_m1, flag_m2, ..., flag_mN) => target (value) where the flag_m* columns are mutually exclusive boolean values - i.e. flag_mK is 1 iff the line comes from matrix K, 0 otherwise. These are the only things I can safely say with the amount of information you provided.
