Looks like you're missing a dependency, the development files for libpq . The relevant log part is here: In file included from psycopg/psycopgmodule.c:32In file included from psycopg/psycopgmodule.c:32: ./psycopg/psycopg.h:31:22: error: libpq-fe.h: No such file or directory Try installing libpq development files and then rerun easy_install. You may hit another missing dependency; pay attention to the first error that GCC spits out.
