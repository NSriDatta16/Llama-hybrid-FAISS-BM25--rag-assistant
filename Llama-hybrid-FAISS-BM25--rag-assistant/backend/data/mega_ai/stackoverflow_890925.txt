How can I resize an image to fit area with Image::Magick?

From command line with imagemagick, you can use: convert dragon.gif -resize 64x64^ -gravity center -extent 64x64 fill_crop_dragon.gif to resize and then crop an image so that it fills the area as much as possible. How do I do this from Perl's Image::Magick ?
