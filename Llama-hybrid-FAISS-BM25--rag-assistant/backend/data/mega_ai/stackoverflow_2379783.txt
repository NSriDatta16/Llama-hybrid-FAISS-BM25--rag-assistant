Generated an activation code can be as simple as generating a random number with a fixed number of digits. Personally I do this, then store the generated code in the users table of the database along with the username/password/email etc, so that it can be quickly verified when the link is clicked and your checking code run. I usually go with a 'long' data type and generate 9-digit random numbers, and store these raw (not encoded) in the database for easy retrieval. Passwords should be encoded, but an activation code is a single-use, throw-away value so no need for any special consideration.
