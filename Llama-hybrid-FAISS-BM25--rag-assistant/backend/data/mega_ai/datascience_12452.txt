One easy solution is to prepare a emotion dictionary first. Such dictionary can be found online easily such as http://www.psychpage.com/learning/library/assess/feelings.html . A simple workflow will be as follow: For each tweet, tokenize the tweet into a list of vocabularies For each list of vocabularies, count the (positive, neutral, negative) words Classify a tweet as (positive/ neutral/ negative) emotion by the counting Although this approach does not use any machine learning, the result is quite good. Another benefit is not need to prepare the labeled data set. Of course, we should keep checking any missing emotion vocabulary. The workflow of checking missing emotion For each tweet, stem and tokenize by StandordNLP (ex. "Happy" will converted to ("HAPPY", "JJ") where the tag started from JJ refer to adjective Filter the tokens to extract the absent words which are absent in the prepared missing emotion vocabulary and has tag started with "JJ" Do the word count on the missing adjective and sort by frequency in reverse order Manually add the missing adjectives if necessary
