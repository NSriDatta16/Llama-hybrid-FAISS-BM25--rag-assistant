How Do I Learn Neural Networks?

I'm a freshman undergraduate student (mentioning this so you may forgive my unfamiliarity) who is currently doing research using neural networks. I've coded a three-node neural network (that works) based on my professor's guidance. However, I'd like to pursue a career in AI and Data Science, and I'd like to teach myself more about these properly in-depth. Are there any books or resources that will teach me more about neural network structures, deep learning, etc? Are there any recommendations? Note: I'm proficient in Java, Python, Bash, JavaScript, Matlab, and know a bit of C++.
