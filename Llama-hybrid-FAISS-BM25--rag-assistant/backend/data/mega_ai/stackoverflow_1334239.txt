Data mining/BI/Analytics/ML : Can a mathematically challenged person move into this field?

I have recently become interested in the field(s) of data mining and machine learning. The idea of going through huge datasets and trying to correlate hidden patterns and trends is fascinating. So far I have done the following Used Weka to load simple data sets and generate decision trees Continously read books, wiki's, blogs and SO on the same Started playing around SQL Server DM and Python API's Have an idea on options of freely available data sets on the web(freedb, UN etc) What is hindering me is the minute I try to go beyond classification/associsciation and into priori/apriori algorithms I am stuck because understanding mathematical equations and logic is not(to put it modestly) one of my strong points. So my question would be are there anybody in the Data mining field(in the role of product owner or builder) who are not naturally mathematicians? If so, how would you approach in undestanding the field since free tools like Weka and Rapid-miner both expects some mathematical/statistical background? P.S: Excuse me if I made some mistake in the query like mixing Data mining and analytics when they are separate as I am still getting my feet wet. I hope my core question is clear.
