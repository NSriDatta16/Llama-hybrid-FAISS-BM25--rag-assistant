Change "Pulse notification light" / trackball light setting on Android (Nexus One only?)

On the Nexus One (at least in 2.1-update1, and I think in 2.1), there is a setting under Sound & Display: "Pulse notification light". This doesn't seem to be present on the "2.1 with Google APIs" emulator image. I've not yet checked any other devices. Pulse notification light: Pulse trackball light repeatedly for new notifications http://chris.boyle.name/images/20100206-pulse-trackball.png I want to set this programmatically without user interaction, in order to make a Locale plugin, so the device can grab my attention when I'm awake at my desk, without having it floodlighting the room when someone spams me at 4am. It's quite bright. I didn't see it in android.provider.Settings.System where many other things on this screen live, so I had a look in the platform source. There are some relevant parts in NotificationManagerService, in enqueueNotificationWithTag and updateLightsLocked . That goes off into HardwareService which seems well past the point of caring about user settings. I've no idea where this setting is implemented or how I might influence it. I fully expect the answer to be "there is no API for this" (perhaps related to it being Nexus One specific), and that the best I can do is to schedule (using Locale or something else) an Intent of ACTION_DISPLAY_SETTINGS to remind me to set the box manually, which would suck. I'm hoping that I've missed something, or that a Googler is reading this and can tell me that this is planned for addition to the API?
