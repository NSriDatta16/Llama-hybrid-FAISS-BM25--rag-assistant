Organizing Strings.xml

I'm making an android app and since I've just started I want to try get the most organised code/resources. In my strings.xml file so far I have this: GameController Stop Start Preferences Back All of the strings except app_name are used in an options menu. But since I will be adding much more strings I was thinking that it might be better to do something like this: GameController Stop Start Preferences Back Is it the best way or should I use another system?
