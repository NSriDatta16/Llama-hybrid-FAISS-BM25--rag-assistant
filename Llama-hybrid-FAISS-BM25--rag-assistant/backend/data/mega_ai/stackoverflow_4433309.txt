Database vs fstream access

I have a (local) database (MySQL 5.1 at Ubuntu 10.10) with some 15000 tables each with ~1 000 000 rows on average. Each table has 6 DOUBLE columns. The storage engine is MyISAM. I have a C++ application that loads the data one table at a time and performs some calculations. The way I retrieve the data from the database is simply by: SELECT * FROM table ORDER BY timestamp; (timestamp is the first column (DOUBLE) marked as UNIQUE) By far most of the time is spent in loading and fetching. It takes ~15s to load and fetch all the rows in one table (tried with the native C API, C++ Connector and MySQL Query Browser). When I load the same dataset from disk (plain text file) using fstream the same operation takes only ~4s. Is it possible for MySQL or any other database (SQLite?) to get anywhere near this value? Although, I have mostly simple SELECTS and INSERTS (+ one simple JOIN) I like the idea of database because it is somewhat easier to manage large data sets, so I would stick with it even at cost of some performance loss, but 15/4s per table is way too much given the number of tables. I would be fine with 6/4s though... Thanks. Petr
