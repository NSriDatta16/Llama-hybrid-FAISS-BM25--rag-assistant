Apparently, the mice package has an option pool.compare . The help file cites the following publication by Meng, Rubin "Performing Likelihood Ratio Tests with Multiply-Imputed Data Sets" in Biometrika 1992. I cannot access this with my limited research library. However, looking at the source code for pool.compare suggests that the implementation is a very clever trick indeed. The outcome, of any scale, is compared to a binomial likelihood by creating $Z = (Y - \min(Y))/\text{range}(Y)$ and taking a logistic inverse transformation of the linear predictors $E[Z|X] = \mbox{logit}^{-1} (\mathbf{X}\hat{\beta})$. Two log likelihood ratios are defined for each dataset, the $D_L$ which uses the pooled coefficient estimate, $\bar{Q}$ and the $D_M$ which uses the coefficient estimates from each dataset. The $D_L$ and $D_M$ are averaged together, and some algebra is done to create the test-statistic. Namely, $r_m$ is defined as $$r_m = \frac{m+1}{k (m-1)} (D_M - D_L)$$ $$T = D_L/(k (1+r_m))$$ which has a $\chi^2_{df}$ distribution with $df = 4(mk-4)(1+(1-2/(mk))^2)$ if $mk>4$.
