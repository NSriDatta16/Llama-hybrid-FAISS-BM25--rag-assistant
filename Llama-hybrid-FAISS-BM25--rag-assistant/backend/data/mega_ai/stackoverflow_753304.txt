Any time you can change your code to data you're making a step in the right direction. Coding anything as data means that your code itself is more general and reusable. It also means that your data may be specified in a language that fits it exactly. Also, an XML file can be read into a GUI or some other tool and easily manipulated pragmatically. How would you do that with the code example? I'm constantly factoring things most people would implement as code into data, it makes what code is left MUCH cleaner. I find it inconceivable that people will create a menu in code rather than as data--it should be obvious that doing it in code is just plain wrong because of the boilerplate.
