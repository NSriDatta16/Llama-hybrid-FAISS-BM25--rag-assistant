First, I think you should phrase your question avoiding the word "significant", which often gets in the way of clear thinking. You propose to test the null hypothesis that the mean of reach exchange is zero. But you know for sure that the cost is never zero, so why test that? Is your goal to ask whether there is evidence that different exchanges have different costs? Do you need data to answer that? Aren't the costs specified up front? If you do need to test with data, you'd need multiple values from each exchange. Then you could run one-way ANOVA to ask if there is evidence that the average costs are not all the same. I doubt that question is really of interest.
