How to calculate accuracy of identification using embedings and corresponded labels?

I'm trying to implement deep speaker embeding system and after getting voice embeddings I need to somehow calculate accuracy. But there is no mention in deep speaker paper about how they calculated accuracy for person identification (at least I've not found it). So in general I have array of embeddings (shape [N, 512]), corresponded labels (shape [N]) and some function f(a, b) which calculate distance between embeddings. In order to calculate accuracy (and other metrics) we need to find array of predictions. Currently I'm using nearest neighbor approach: for each emb1 find nearest emb2 and set label of emb2 as label for emb1 . I also tried to use mean of embeddings of specific class instead of emb2 , but this approach yields worse result. Also come is mind some clustering approach: divide embeddings into k clusters and check if all items in each cluster have same label. Where k is number of unique classes.
