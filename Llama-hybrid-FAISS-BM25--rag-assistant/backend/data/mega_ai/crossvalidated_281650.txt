An ordered logit model is more appropriate as you have a dependent variable which is a ranking, 7 is better than 4 for instance. So there is a clear order. This allows you to obtain a probability for each bin. There are few assumptions that you need to take into account. You can have a look here . One of the assumptions underlying ordinal logistic (and ordinal probit) regression is that the relationship between each pair of outcome groups is the same. In other words, ordinal logistic regression assumes that the coefficients that describe the relationship between, say, the lowest versus all higher categories of the response variable are the same as those that describe the relationship between the next lowest category and all higher categories, etc. This is called the proportional odds assumption or the parallel regression assumption. Some code: library("MASS") ## fit ordered logit model and store results 'm' m You can have further explanations here , here , here or here . Keep in mind that you will need to transform your coefficients to odds ratio and then to probabilities to have a clear interpretation in terms of probabilities. In a straightforward (and simplistic manner) you can compute these by: $exp(\beta_{i})=Odds Ratio$ $\frac{exp(\beta_{1})}{\sum exp(\beta_{i})} = Probability$ (Don't want to be too technical)
