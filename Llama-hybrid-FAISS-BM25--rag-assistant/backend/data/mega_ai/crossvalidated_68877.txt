Statistical notation in plain English

I have a very limited understanding of statistics, and am having trouble translating an answer to this question from quant.SE, " Separating the wheat from the chaff ", the answer being: Larry Harris has a chapter on performance evaluation in Trading and Exchanges . He states that over a long period of time, a skilled asset manager will consistently have excess returns whereas a lucky one will be expected to have random and unpredictable returns. Thus, we start with the portfolio's market-adjusted return standard deviation: \begin{equation} \sigma_{adj} = \sqrt{\sigma^2_{port} + \sigma^2_{mk} - 2\rho\sigma_{port}\sigma_{mk}} \end{equation} where $\rho$ is the correlation between the market and portfolio returns. For a sample size $n$ (generally number of years), the average excess returns, and the adjusted standard deviation from above, we have a t-statistic : \begin{equation} t = \frac{\overline{R_{port}} - \overline{R_{mk}}}{\frac{\sigma_{adj}}{\sqrt{n}}} \end{equation} Now we can simply determine the probability that the manager's excess returns were luck by plugging this t-statistic into the t-distribution 's PDF with degrees-of-freedom $n - 1$. The lower the probability, the more we can believe the manager's excess returns were from skill. At this point, I now understand the top formula, though this was based on the finding the book's the section on topic referenced in the answer above on Google Books. What I don't get now is this formula: \begin{equation} t = \frac{\overline{R_{port}} - \overline{R_{mk}}}{\frac{\sigma_{adj}}{\sqrt{n}}} \end{equation} I understand it's somehow related to the t-distribution 's "Probability Density Function" but I have no idea what the R or "overline" notation means, or for that matter, where the values are R-port and R-mk come from; "port" being portfolio, and "mk" being market. If it matters, since it took me a bit to figure this out "adj" just flags the sigma (standard deviation) as the "portfolio's market-adjusted return standard deviation." Any suggestions?
