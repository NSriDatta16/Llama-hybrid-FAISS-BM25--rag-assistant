If you really need to avoid guids, have you considered using something based on date/time and then leveraging partition keys to minimize the concurrency risk. Your partition key could be by user, year, month, day, hour, etc and the row key could be the rest of the datetime at a small enough timespan to control concurrency. Of course you have to ask yourself, at the price of date in Azure, if avoiding a Guid is really worth all of this extra effort (assuming a Guid will just work).
