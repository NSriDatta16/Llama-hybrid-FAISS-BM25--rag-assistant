py-amqp/flopsy: Waiting for a single AMQP message in Python

I have a similar question to this one : It's very easy in py-amqp/flopsy to say "I'm going to wait forever, and I want this callback to be called whenever a message comes in," but I can't find any way of saying "OK, I got the message I want now stop waiting." (Maybe a GOTO? Just kidding...) Is there an elegant way of doing this?
