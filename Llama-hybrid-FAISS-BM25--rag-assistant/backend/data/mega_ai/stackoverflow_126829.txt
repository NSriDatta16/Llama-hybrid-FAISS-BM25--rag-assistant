Pattern for trying different methods when exception is thrown

Here's a question to expose my lack of experience: I have a method DoSomething() which throws an exception if it doesn't manage to do it cleanly. If it fails, I try the less accurate method DoSomethingApproximately() several times in the hope that it will find a sufficiently good solution; if this also fails I finally call DoSomethingInaccurateButGuaranteedToWork() . All three are methods belonging to this object. Two questions: first, is this (admittedly ugly) pattern acceptable, or is there a more elegant way? Second, what is the best way to keep track of how many times I have called DoSomethingApproximately() , given that it is likely to throw an exception? I am currently keeping a variable iNoOfAttempts in the object, and nesting try blocks... this is horrible and I am ashamed.
