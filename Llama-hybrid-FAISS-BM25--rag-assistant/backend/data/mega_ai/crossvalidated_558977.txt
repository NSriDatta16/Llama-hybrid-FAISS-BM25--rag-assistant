How to obtain the distributions of linear model parameters?

For a linear model $$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 + …… + \sigma^2$$ Assuming $\beta_0, \beta_1,……$ are random varibles, how to obtain the distributions of these parameters? It seems that Bayesian regression obtains the posterior distributions of $\beta_0, \beta_1,……$ , but the posterior distributions are not the real distributions of $\beta_0, \beta_1,……$ , because the variances of the posterior distributions will all converge to zeros when there are enough samples.
