This is a very common phenomenon when training neural networks with stochastic or mini-batch methods. Typical solutions include plotting only per-epoch averages (i.e. collecting results for all mini-batches and then averaging) or else using moving averages, smoothing, etc. To avoid re-inventing the wheel, Tensorboard give a nice way to log, plot and smooth results. If you use software like TensorboardX , you can access the convenience of the Tensorboard interface even if you're not using Tensorflow to estimate the model.
