In which language the KIS application might have been developed?

I just went through this link http://www.pcauthority.com.au/Feature/91093,the-tsar-of-antivirus.aspx and found that it's developed using c/c++ and visual studio with a little assembly language support. As a programmer i just want to know in what programming language the kaspersky internet security User Interface(UI) has been developed? Might be using QT(coz. of c++)? or using MFC(coz. of visual studio)?? With side tab like thing the UI looks good. Expecting the answers from expert analysts.
