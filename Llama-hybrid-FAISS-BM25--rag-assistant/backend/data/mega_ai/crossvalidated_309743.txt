Are there any recent advances on the combination of deep learning and graphical models?

Could you please introduce some recent papers on this? How to deal with the (approximate) gradient descent for graphical model inference, and then integrate it into the stochastic gradient descent? I know the Domke's work http://machinelearning.wustl.edu/mlpapers/papers/AISTATS2012_Domke12 was devoted on this. And the structured prediction energy networks is also on this https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.05667 . But the mathematical requirements for both two papers is beyond mine extreme. Could you please show some simpler methods with simpler math derivations?
