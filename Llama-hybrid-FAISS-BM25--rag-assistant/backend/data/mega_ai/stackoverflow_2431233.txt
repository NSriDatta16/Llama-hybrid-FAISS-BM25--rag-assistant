How Can I switch the session storage according to the client on Ruby on Rails 2.3.5

I have a question about sessions on ruby-on-rails. We have a several options about session storage such as cookie, active_record_store, etc.. I primarily use the cookie storage, but, there are some client which doesn't support cookie function. In that case, I have to make that client to use the "active_record_store". My rails version is 2.3.5. I found out that even though I use the active_record_store, the cookie is still available. In my situation, both session storage might be available. So, I want to make the framework to primarily use the cookie, when the cookie is available. On the other hand, the client doesn't support the cookie, secondly to use the active_record_store. I think this function requires some override to the framework, but I don't know how to do it. Do you have any idea for that? Thank you very much in advance.
