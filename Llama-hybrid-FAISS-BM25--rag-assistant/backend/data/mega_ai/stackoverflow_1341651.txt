A similar question that has been asked recently . ResultSet certainly is not a direct equivalent as it only works with an active connection to the database while a DataTable can be used "offline". From personal experience I would say there is no direct equivalent in Java (haven't tried javax.sql.rowset.WebRowSet , though). You either go with plain SQL and java.sql.ResultSet is your friend. Or you use some ORM tool like Hibernate, Cayenne, Toplink to name a few. Or you build your own (not that I encourage this, but I think on more than one project that has been done successfully).
