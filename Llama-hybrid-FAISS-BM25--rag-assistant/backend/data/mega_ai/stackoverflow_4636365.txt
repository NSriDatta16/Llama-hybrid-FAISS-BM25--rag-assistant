Having one CSS file per JS file seems a good thing for me. It's clean, and easy to understand and to maintain. The only problem would be to have dozens of CSS files on every page, but I suppose you combine those files to one big file, so this problem does not exist in your case. How to embed CSS in JavaScript? It depends on the environment you have, and how the build process is done. The easiest thing is to have a large comment at the beginning of every JavaScript file, something like this: // Your copyright notice here // /* body{color:red;} div{border:solid 10px lime;} // ... other ugly styles. */ // Then during the build, you have to search for ... blocks and extract the CSS by trimming the /* and */ . Of course, it creates a problem: if you are using an IDE with auto-completion, embedding CSS into a JavaScript file will make it impossible to use auto-completion in this case.
