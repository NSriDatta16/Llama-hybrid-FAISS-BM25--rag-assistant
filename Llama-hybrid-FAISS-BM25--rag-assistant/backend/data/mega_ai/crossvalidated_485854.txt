Following on from the comments, you'll still need to have some sort of model. You could have a prior for each variable and update them with your data, and that might tell you about the distributions that generated the variables, but it doesn't tell you anything about how they're linked together. Typically, a Bayesian approach would put priors over the parameters of a model, as @ericperkerson mentioned. I would first try multiple linear regression, which can be done in either a frequentist or Bayesian way. It will fit an equation to explain the relationship between the input variables and the output variable, from which you can then estimate the values of the inputs when the output is 1.8. The advantage of the Bayesian approach is it allows for uncertainty in the parameters, as they are drawn from a distribution rather than being point estimates, but that may not be of interest to you if you are not interested in the function itself.
