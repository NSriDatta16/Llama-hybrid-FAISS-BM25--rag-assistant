Many open tools are generating code from class diagram. You create a diagram then you get a code from it. You have Boum, Papyrus , Topcased etc.. Few tools can reverse engineer code into UML. I think Bouml and Topcased can reverse existing code. No open source can synchronize code and model in a round trip live mechanism. Hope this help.
