How to get a "unique ID" -- I do not really recommend this :-) However, it does fulfill the requirements in the question. See IdentityHashMap and consider weak references. Use a Map object -> integer where the integer represents a counter. For each new object seen, increment the counter and add it to the Map. For each existing object, return the value stored. There may also be implementation-specific methods: for instance, on Sun, I believe Object.toString (base method) always returns a unique string per that objects lifetime. The "encoded number" could be siphoned out and is the "internal reference" AFAIK. I make no guarantees about accuracy of the preceding paragraph. YMMV. Happy coding.
