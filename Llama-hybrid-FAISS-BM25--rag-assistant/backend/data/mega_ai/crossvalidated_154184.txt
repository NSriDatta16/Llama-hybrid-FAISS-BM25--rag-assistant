Why use a mixture model with RNN instead of just directly predictive real values?

Alex Graves created a model to generate hand writing sequences which use an LSTM (kind of Recurrent Neural Network) to predict the parameters for an mixture model. The mixture model is then used to predict the next x,y coordinate and whether the pen is up or down. Generating Sequences With Recurrent Neural Networks Demo of the above Why not just use the LSTM to directly predict the pen offsets (x,Y) and up/down flag. Why bother with the mixture model?
