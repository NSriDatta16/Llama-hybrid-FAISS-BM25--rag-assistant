I am guessing you work in a corporate environment, which would mean your computers are probably managed by your IT department and part of your domain. Because they are part of your company's AD (Active Directory), your systadmins Should be able to modify the existing policy (i say existing, because in IE, the defaults for the settings relating to logging on are by default set so that you WOULD have gotten a logon prompt, i am guessing a group policy is already in effect). If it does not exist, have your admins create one. The setting Jeremy mentions is one option. It could also be that the site is in included in your IE's "Local Intranet Zone". If it is, or, more probable, there is a wildcard *.yourdomainname.yourdomainextension). Use the setting mentioned by jeremy to override the default logon behavior (automatic logon) associated with sites listed in the intranet zone. A group policy can be applied to a group of computers or all the computers in the domain. If the policy should be applied to a small group of computers only, put those computers in a separate OU (Organisation Unit) in AD and apply the policy to that OU.
