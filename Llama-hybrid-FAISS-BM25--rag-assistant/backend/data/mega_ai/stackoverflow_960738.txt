Fading out an image with transparency in WinForms UI (.NET3.5)

The application: I am writing a little game that would teach the user to read music notes. The game play is very simple. The app displayes a note and my little daughter (target user) should hit the emulated keyboard key on the WinForm GUI matching to the note. She has 1 minute to get as many good hits a she can. Successes and failures are counted. The task: As she hits a good/bad keyboard key, I want to confirm immediately if she was right or wrong without interrupting the play . My plan is to show an OK or a FAILED bitmap that fades out gradually and becomes completely transparent within ~2 seconds. Fading the bitmap out is a nice way to encourage the user to concentrate on the next note and not to bother about the previous result anymore. The technical question: How can I display a bitmap on a Windows Form with transparency? Or do you have alternative non-intrusive, easy-to-implement ideas on letting the user know of the current good/bad choice?
