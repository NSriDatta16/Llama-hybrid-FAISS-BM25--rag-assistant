Woohoo! Thanks Eric Miraglia. The pointer to Dav Glass' forum got me where I needed to go. For some reason, I had found the css: configuration parameter which was correct, but I had done something else wrong and that caused it to fail. The correct answer is to put the following line where I have the css: when I call "new Yahoo.widget.Editor()" : css: YAHOO.widget.SimpleEditor.prototype._defaultCSS + 'body { font-size:130%; background-color:red;color:white;}' That was enough to get the font-size and editor background changed to what I want.
