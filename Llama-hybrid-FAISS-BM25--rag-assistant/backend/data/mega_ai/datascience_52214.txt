How to create a person-specific (personalized) classification model using machine learning

I have labeled datasets for 10 subjects that contain photoplethysmogram (PPG) signal value and the affective state as a label. How can I create a person-specific(Personalized) classification model to classify the subject affective state? Do I need to merge all 10 datasets in one dataset and train the model? or shall I create a separate model for each subject by using his data (this may not help in classifying the affective state of unseen persons? ?
