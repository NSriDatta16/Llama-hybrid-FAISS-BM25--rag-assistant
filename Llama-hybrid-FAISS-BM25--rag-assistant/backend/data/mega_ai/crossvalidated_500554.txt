So you have a logistic regression with one observed binary response and two numerical predictors, non-linearly correlated as shown in the plots? The reason for (maybe) leave out one predictor in the case of high linear correlation, is to avoid numerical instability. With the non-linear correlation shown in your plots, there will be no such numerical instability, so that reason do not apply. Edit I answered the question above, tentatively, assuming it is an isolated question with a constructed example. For a real example, there could be more predictors, not known or shown here, and that might change the conclusion, as alluded to by @whuber in a comment below.
