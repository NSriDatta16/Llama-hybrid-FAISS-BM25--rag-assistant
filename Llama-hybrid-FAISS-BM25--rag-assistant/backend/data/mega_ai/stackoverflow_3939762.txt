style and script tag sequence

Normally HTML page contains following tags I found number of times that changing the sequence of those tags, mess up with page layout. So what would be the reason and what are the points to avoid this situation? EDIT After looking the answer of @Anurag, I'm actually assuming that we don't have a case where we have two definition of the same css class, in different style or link tag. My major concern is css and script sequence. Whether we should have all the css class before we write any JavaScript or it doesn't matter at all (that I don't think). For example jqtouch floaty extension . In that if I define the .floaty class before the JavaScript tag, then it don't work. Hope you get my point.
