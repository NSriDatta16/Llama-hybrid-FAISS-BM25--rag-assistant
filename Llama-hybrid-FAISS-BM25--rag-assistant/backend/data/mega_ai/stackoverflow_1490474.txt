Difference between attributes and style tags in lxml

I am trying to learn lxml after having used BeautifulSoup. However, I am not a strong programmer in general. I have the following code in some source html: The reasons to eat pickles include: Because the text is bolded, I want to pull that text. I can't seem to be able to differentiate that that particular line is bolded. When I started this work this evening I was working with a document that had the word bold in the style attrib like the following: The reason I like tomatoes include: I should say that the document I am working from is a fragment that I read in the lines, joined the lines together and then used the html.fromstring function txtFile=open(r'c:\myfile.htm','r').readlines() strHTM=''.join(txtFile) newHTM=html.fromstring(strHTM) and so the first line of htm code I have above is newHTM[19] Humm this seems to be getting me closer newHTM.cssselect('b') I don't fully understand yet but here is the solution: for each in newHTM: if each.cssselect('b') each.text_content()
