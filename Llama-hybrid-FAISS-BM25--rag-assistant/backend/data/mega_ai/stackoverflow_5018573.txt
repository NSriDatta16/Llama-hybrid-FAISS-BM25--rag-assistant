MVC approach for JavaScript

I am searching for a decent framework for organizing my Javascript, jQuery assisted code according to MVCS micro-architecture. I did some research on JavaScriptMVC , and though it looks like a robust product, I'm afraid it's a bit of an "overkill" for my needs, and since it's poorly documented it will take me hours to exclude only the parts of it that I can utilize. What I really search for is something elegant like a jQuery- PureMVC port (which as far as I know does not exist) or Robotlegs (for those who are familiar with this AS3 framework). In other words: I look for a light and simple framework that will allow me to easily manage the business logic surrounding my many existing custom jQuery UI Widgets . Any recommendations?
