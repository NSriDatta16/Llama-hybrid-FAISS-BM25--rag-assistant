Windows 7 snap - Programmatic aspect

Windows 7 has a new "snap" feature it applies when dragging "standard" windows. I do have a pure win32 application (not MFC or any other framework) that I use to create a non-orthodox user-drawn window. That window does not "conform" to windows 7 snap and dragging it to screen corners will not do anything. Do I need a special style/class or something similar in my window in order for windows 7 to take it into consideration for "snapping"
