You can have a look at a similar problem I found some time ago here . But it used objective-C and not Javascript. The idea behind it is, as you touch an object you can create an UIImageView that represents it (maybe semi-transparent like drag&drop on the desktop works), add it on the main UIView as a subview and move it around by intercepting the dragging in the touchesMoved:withEvent: method
