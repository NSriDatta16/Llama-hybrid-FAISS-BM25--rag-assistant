If I only have a range, is it acceptable to calculate an average out of it?

Supposed I have only this data point available: Concentration = (1.1 - 2.0 g/L). Is it acceptable to conclude : (Theoretical) average = ((1.1 + 2.0) * 0.5) = 1.55 g/L? Or would that considered to be statistically incorrect by a reviewer of a scientific thesis (in a medical field)? EDIT 3: Complete rephrase: If I have only 2 data points out of a range, and nothing else, could I declare this as the only available data and therefore, calculate an arithmetic mean out of it? Like: " I have a range which represents two samples, the lowest one and the highest one. I don't know how many samples were in between. Therefore, I assume there were just those two samples, and calculate the average of those two. And add a note that this average value has been calculated out of a range, and should be considered as less reliable than others with more samples ". EDIT 4: whubers comment on the question is what I was looking for: Mid-range . I don't have enough points to upvote the other answers, sorry. If whuber will write an answer instead of a comment I will mark it as correct.
