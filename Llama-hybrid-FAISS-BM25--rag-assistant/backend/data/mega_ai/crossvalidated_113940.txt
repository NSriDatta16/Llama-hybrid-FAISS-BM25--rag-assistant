In R and INLA, how do I graph results of 'rw2' model?

I'm working with model 2 of INLA's Zambia example in R: formula.mod2 = hazstd ~ f(agc, model = "rw2") + f(district, model="besag", graph = g, param = c(1,0.01)) + f(distr.unstruct, model="iid", param = c(1,0.01)) + edu1 + edu2 + tpr + sex + bmi mod2 = inla(formula.mod2, data = Zambia, control.family = list(initial = 1), control.inla = list(h = 1e-4), control.compute = list(dic = TRUE,cpo=TRUE), verbose = TRUE) Everything works as advertised. In the Martino and Rue (2010) materials (section 5.2) I noticed nice graph of the 'Fig. 2a Estimated effect of age (posterior mean together with 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles) using MOD2'. PS I asked that question on INLA user group ; cross posting here to get more attention. My question is where do I find the data and how do I plot a graph like that?
