Magento - How to display ALL PRODUCTS in the homepage?

Display all products in the homepage? Anyone who have had done this? Note: This can be done in the CMS pages by adding manually each and every category id.. I don't want to do that.. Too much hassle if I have hundreds of categories.. I think this can be coded but I don't know where to start? Thanks and more power!
