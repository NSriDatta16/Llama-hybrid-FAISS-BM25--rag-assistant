Linear regression using standard deviations as regressors?

I am reviewing a study in which standard deviations (SDs) of an X variable, calculated for each individual in the study (measures on each individual were replicated 4 times), are used as predictors of a Y variable. They do not observe a significant correlation between Y and the SDs of X and they conclude by saying that it is not necessary to consider the variability among replicates of the same individual and, therefore, they can work with average values​​. Does that make sense?
