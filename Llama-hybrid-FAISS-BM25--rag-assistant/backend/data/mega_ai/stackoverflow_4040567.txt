Aggregation relationship between client and Person/Organization

I have a Client object which will either have a Person object or Organization object in it. These Person objects or Organization objects might have relations to other objects independent of the Client object. In this case should I use a General Aggregation association between Client -> Person and Client -> Organization where the Client object is the whole. Also note these scenarios: Person might be a normal Person in some scenarios like; Person makes payment on behalf of Client (* Organization *) Person might be a Client which bought a Product from Us. Person might be a Supplier
