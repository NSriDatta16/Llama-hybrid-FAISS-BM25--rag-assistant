Not an answer to your question, per s√©, but an alternative: .data() While it's very common to use classes for this type of data storage, they're sub-optimal, in no small part due to having to parse the data back out, as you've seen. Recent versions of jQuery, however, support HTML5-style "data attributes" which do the same job much better. (And do work with HTML4 and XHTML, though you'll get validation errors.) To use them, change your HTML to something like: Company 1 goes here and here is a test for two lines In jQuery, you can then use .data() : var parent = $(this).parent().get(0).data("product"); // parent === 1 (Note that the "1" in your HTML gets automagically converted from a string to a number.)
