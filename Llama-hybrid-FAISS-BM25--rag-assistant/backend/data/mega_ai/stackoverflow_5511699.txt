I have two files. manifest.json and content.js. I have compressed the both files in Zip format and conver into CRX format. Then just drag and drop the .crx file in Google chrome browser and continue to install the crx file. But it shows a alert message as "CRX_MAGIC_NUMBER_INVALID". How to i resolve this issue?
