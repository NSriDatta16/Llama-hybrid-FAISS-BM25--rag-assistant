First of I would like to state the following: Biostatistics is a really difficult field; many biostatisticians are better data scientists than people with a maths background. Biostatistics has create it own tools that we can use today. The experiments they make must be really regulated (at least from pharmaceutical view) Now imagine a trait that is really different between all of us. Let's experiment on height. That trait has indeed a high variance in the population. Will it follow a normal distribution? Of course yes we are talking about 7 billion people. Now take 10 people from 10 different countries but you have to choose a country of at least one continent. You take the estimated world median and run a simple Mann-Whitney test to see if the estimated median is statistically different from your sample's median. There are 2 possible results: There is indeed a signifigant difference, so your stratified sample is not so effective There is no difference whatsoever and the two medians seem to be the same with p-value=.0001 In the first case, there is noone that can argue with your experiment: it was wrong all along to test a sample with so few participants. In the second case there is a really good question to be answered: if you repeat your experiment about 20 times and have the exact same result; is this series of experiments better than an experiment with 10,000 participants? And if so, what does this means about our variable? Well in the highly unlikely case of the 20 repeated experiments to be significant, it is really to scratch your head. We just used a good sampling technique and nothing fancy so we are aware of the whole procedure and we cannot see any bugs or shade areas and on the top of that the experiment had given us the statistically correct result! But wait what if we had taken 10,000 people from different countries while having in mind the same sampling technique: stratified sampling. You ran the test again (we can still use Mann-Whitney although they should follow normal distribution and t-test is more powerful) and you see that the test says something unpredictable: the median of your sample is not the same as this of the population! You can go home and be done with statistics in this hypothetical scenario, however there should be an explanation. Which is pretty simple. Variables with high variances have huge amount of outliers and many tests (like Mann-Whitney or t-test) are really susceptible to them. You have taken 10,000 people; how many of them do you expect to be an outlier? Now consider a pharmaceutical experiment and the underlying variables (genes, environment, food etc etc). You should consider all these unique outliers that exists out there to have the best experiment, which is practically impossible. So what do we gain from a smaller sample? We are granted with the holy grail of riskiness. I am not kidding. A smaller sample is likely to be so variant that there is no way to compare it with any distribution and sleep well at night. However if you can see a pattern in such a small (and always random with a really careful sampling method) sample there is really good potential to your theory. So our problem is not wether or not the test is really significant or not (and I am starting to hearing your complaints but hear me out) is about how reliable is the sample. That's why your everyday painkiller has a telephone number on it. Because despite the large sample of the experiments anyone could still be in the outlier zone that the created model does not explain. So the statement is really correct. The question is how good was their sampling method. So what about his research? Well I read that it does not meet the [International Society of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy’s] expected standard, especially relating to the lack of better explanations of the inclusion criteria and the triage of patients to ensure patient safety. found here so the problem of the International Society of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy’s was not the statistical method, rather the sampling method they used.
