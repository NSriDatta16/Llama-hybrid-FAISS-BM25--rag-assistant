jQuery Draggable() and keyboard control

Hey there, I have a page with the jQuery Draggable() enabled on #person and that #person is constrained to #map . (link to plugin: http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Draggables/draggable ) However, I have also added control with the Arrow keys on the keyboard. Now, they all play well together until I get to the edge of the constrained area (the edge of #map ). If I am dragging, then the #person gets constrained to the #map - if I use the arrow keys, the #person can go beyond the edge of #map . How can I constrain the arrow keys as well as the draggable? My code for the keyboard control: $(document).bind('keydown',function(e){ //set the keydown function as... switch(e.which) { case 37: $(characterName).animate({ left: '-=40' }, 250, function() { }); break; } }); ****phew**** cheers. [EDIT] Please anyone? [/EDIT]
