Pragmatically, is your code expected to grow? Even though people herald OOP as the right way, I found that sometimes it's better to weigh cost:benefit(s) whenever you refactor a piece of code. If you are looking to grow this, then OOP is a better option in that you can extend and customise any future use case, while saving yourself from unnecessary time wasted in code maintenance. Otherwise, if it ain't broken, don't fix it, IMHO.
