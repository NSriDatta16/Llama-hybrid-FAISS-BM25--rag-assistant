You should define a variable as "const" when you know the value of this will remain constant through out your application. So once you define a const, it value must be determinable at compile time and this value will be saved into the assembly's metadata. Some more important points abt Const: A const can be defined only for types your compiler treats as primary types. Constants are always considered to be the part of defining type. They are always considered to be Static members. Constants value are always embedded directly into the code, so constants dont require any memory to be allocated to them at run time. Because of this embedding of the value into metadata, when somebody change the value of the const (in the assembly where the const is defined) due to versioning or some other requirement then the user of the dll has to recompile his own assembly. And this issue can be avoided using "readonly" keyword.
