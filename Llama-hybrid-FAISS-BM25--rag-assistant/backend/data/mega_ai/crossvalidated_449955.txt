What is the actual distribution that we are modelling in case of a Bayesian Regression Model?

I have come across blog posts that speak about modelling a regression problem using Bayesian approaches. I completely understand that, to set up example data, they generate a sine wave using a one dimensional data $X$ and then add Gaussian noise around the $Y_i$ value for every $X_i$ and consider this as a training data. Now, when we say we are going to determine the parameters of a probability distribution which generated our data, which data are we referring to? Are we modelling the parameters of the distribution that generated $X$ or are we talking of generating $Y$ ?
