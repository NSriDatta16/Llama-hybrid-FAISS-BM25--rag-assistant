You can treat this as a regression problem with a censored outcome (classical statistics version of dealing with this). I.e. you only know that the observed value lies in some interval (e.g. 2-3 drinks a day). You then assume that drinks follow some distribution (e.g. negative binomial, if they were discrete [which they are not] or zero-inflated log-normal) and specify a likelihood based on censoring (i.e. the likelihood is obtained as $P(\text{observation falls into } [y_\min, y_\max])$ , where $y_\min, y_\max$ is the reported category). You have the option of defining your own loss function (more machine learning type of phrasing the solution): I.e. you can some model (e.g. a neural network) to predict a continuous number of drinks, but score them according to whether they fall into the correct bin (the only thing you know). These two approaches are the same thing, just a different way of phrasing it.
