Re-Focus Browser in Javascript when Dragging File from Desktop

When I drag a file from the desktop to the browser, and I keep the browser in focus (Safari or FireFox for now), I know everything works right (dragging, having the app respond, etc.). I am also able to un-focus the browser, by clicking on my desktop for example (keeping the browser in view), and when I drag the file to the browser, I am still able to process the drag events, which is cool. I'm just wondering how I can refocus the browser when: 1) It's not in focus, and 2) when it's not in focus, I drag something over it. I can do something like window.focus() , but that doesn't bring the whole browser back into focus out of the things on my desktop. What line of js code do I need to make the browser refocus, like how when you drag a folder to an unfocused/blurred Finder window on the Mac and it pops into focus after a second or two? Then it's onto processing the dragged info...
