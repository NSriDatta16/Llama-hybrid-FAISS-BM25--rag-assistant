Help with a proof regarding empirical CDF

Given $X_1,X_2...X_n \sim F$ and $(\hat{F}_n(x))$ is an empirical CDF I need to prove that $$Var(\hat{F}_n(x)) = \frac{F(x)(1 - F(x))}{n}$$ So what I did is: The variance of an estimator $\hat{F}_n(x)$ of a population CDF $F(x)$ is this: (if I'm not mistaken) $$Var(\hat{F}_n(x)) = E[(\hat{F}_n(x) - E[\hat{F}_n(x)])^2]$$ Since $\hat{F}_n(x)$ is an estimator of the population CDF $F(x)$ , we can substitute $F(x)$ for $E[\hat{F}_n(x)]$ in the above equation to get: $$Var(\hat{F}_n(x)) = E[(\hat{F}_n(x) - F(x))^2]$$ We can then use the fact that $\hat{F}_n(x)$ is a Bernoulli random variable with probability of success equal to $F(x)$ to expand the square and simplify the expression: $$Var(\hat{F}_n(x)) = E[\hat{F}_n(x)^2 - 2\hat{F}_n(x)F(x) + F(x)^2]$$ Since it's a bernoulli we get that $\hat{F}_n(x)^2 = \hat{F}_n(x)$ and we know that $E[\hat{F}_n(x)] = F(x)$ , therefore we plug the new values: $$Var(\hat{F}_n(x)) = F(x) - 2F(x)^2 + F(x)^2 = F(x)(1 - F(x))$$ And this is where I get to a dead end, I get this formula but what I need to prove is this formula but with the right side divided by $n$ , and I didn't get this. What did I do wrong? EDIT- After reading your comments I tried adjusting the approach a little bit, I did the following, I hope I'm right: First we find the variance of $\mathop{\hat{F}_n}\left(x\right)$ . The variance of a random variable is defined as $Var(X) = E[(X - E[X])^2]$ . Substituting $\mathop{\hat{F}_n}\left(x\right)$ for $X$ , we have: $$Var(\hat{F}_n(x)) = E[(\hat{F}_n(x) - E[\hat{F}_n(x)])^2]$$ We can rewrite $\hat{F}_n(x)$ as $\frac{R_n(x)}{n}$ , where $R_n(x) \sim \text{Binomial}(n, F(x))$ , and that is because empirical CDF is the average of Bernoulli random variables. Therefore, $$Var(\hat{F}_n(x)) = E\left[\left(\frac{R_n(x)}{n} - E\left[\frac{R_n(x)}{n}\right]\right)^2\right]$$ $$Var(\hat{F}_n(x)) = E\left[\frac{R_n(x)^2}{n^2}\right] - \left(E\left[\frac{R_n(x)}{n}\right]\right)^2$$ Since $R_n(x)$ is a binomial random variable, we can use the formula for the variance of a binomial random variable, which is $Var(R_n(x)) = nF(x)(1 - F(x))$ . Therefore, $$Var(\hat{F}_n(x)) = \frac{nF(x)(1 - F(x))}{n^2} - \left(\frac{nF(x)}{n}\right)^2$$ After simplifying we get: $$Var(\hat{F}_n(x)) = \frac{F(x)(1 - F(x))}{n}$$
