No, it's not correct. What are $S$ and $s$ here? We use $X$ and $x$ instead. The population variance, which uses Greek letter is: $$\sigma^2=\frac{1}{N}\sum^N_{i=1}(x_i-\mu)^2$$ However, since you probably don't know the true mean, which is $\mu$ , you should use the sample variance, in English letter: $$s^2=\frac{1}{n-1}\sum^n_{i=1}(x_i-\bar{x})^2$$ where $\bar{x}$ is the average of X. So the sample standard deviation is: $$s=\sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1}\sum^n_{i=1}(x_i-\bar{x})^2}$$
