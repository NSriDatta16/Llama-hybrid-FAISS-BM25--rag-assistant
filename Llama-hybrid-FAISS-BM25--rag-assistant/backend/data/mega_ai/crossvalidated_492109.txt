Using ACF and PACF with non-stationary time series

I have just started using ARIMA modelling for time-series. I have read that ACF and PACF can be used to determine AR and MA coefficients. As rule of thumb, if ACF has negative value at lag = 1, MA is preferred to AR, and depending on where PACF drops, we can determine q and p values. However, I am a bit confused how to use ACF and PACF for non-stationary time series. If the series becomes stationary after 1st order differentiation, d = 1 . But, should the ACF and PACF be plotted using the original or the stationary (i.e. differentiated) time series? I have found different examples (using differentiated data example and original data example ). What is the best/correct approach?
