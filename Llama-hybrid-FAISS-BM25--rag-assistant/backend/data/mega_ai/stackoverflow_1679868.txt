I found exactly what I was looking for in the flare library's PanZoomControl : Interactive control for panning and zooming a "camera". Any sprite can be treated as a camera onto its drawing content and display list children. To pan and zoom over a collection of objects, simply add a PanZoomControl for the sprite holding the collection. var s:Sprite; // a sprite holding a collection of items new PanZoomControl().attach(s); // attach pan and zoom controls to the sprite The mouse controls are also implemented as you'd expect: Once a PanZoomControl has been created, panning is performed by clicking and dragging. Zooming is performed either by scrolling the mouse wheel or by clicking and dragging vertically while the control key is pressed.
