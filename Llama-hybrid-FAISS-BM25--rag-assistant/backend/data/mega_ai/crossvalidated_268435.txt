How do I compute the spread of ROC curves?

I want to say that my statistic background is very poor, but I'm doing Machine Learning, so I need to learn a bit of it. (my experiment may not make sense. If not, please suggest) Let's say I've got ROC curves, like in the pictures, representing the performance of 2 classifiers evaluated via cross-validation. I want to measure how stable the models are (i.e. if/how performance changes based on the training set). For example, there is more spread in the second plot than in the first. 1) Is it a good metric to compute the area between the curves? 2) If not, how can I tell that the first model is better than the second? (is it?) cross-validation first classifier -- little spread cross-validation second classifier -- more spread
