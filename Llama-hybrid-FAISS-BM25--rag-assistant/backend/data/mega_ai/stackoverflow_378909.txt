How do I save a NamedTemporaryFile into a model FileField in Django?

I created a NamedTemporaryFile, added some content in it and now I want to save it into a model FileField. The problem is that I get a SuspiciousOperation because the tmp directory is not within the FileSystemStorage directory. What's the proper way to do this?
