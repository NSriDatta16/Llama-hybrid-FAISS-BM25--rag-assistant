Which type of regression is most suitable for my situation?

I am working on research in R using a dataset from the German Comparative Candidate Survey (a survey of political candidates during election campaigns). I would like to run a regression with a dichotomous dependent variable (if an MP should follow the voters position on a certain issue or the party position) and mostly ordinal independent variables - e.g. immigrants should be required to adapt to the customs of the country (strongly agree, agree, neither, disagree, strongly disagree) or politics should abstain from intervening in the economy (strongly agree, agree, neither, disagree, strongly disagree) etc. Last but not least, I have a few standard demographic independent variables - gender, age & subjective size of hometown. Nevertheless, I'm not sure which type of regression to use. My intuition tells me that the logistic regression fits best. Am I correct? Note: I have not yet done the data cleansing - variable recoding, removing missings etc. This is how the head of the dataset looks like: t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9 a1 a2 1 3,20E+12 Germany 5 2009
