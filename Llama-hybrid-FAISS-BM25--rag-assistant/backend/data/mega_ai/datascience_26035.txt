To extend on the answer of @Kevin S Lin. POS tagging or Part-of Speech tagging refers to: the process of marking up a word in a text (corpus) as corresponding to a particular part of speech, based on both its definition and its contextâ€”i.e., its relationship with adjacent and related words in a phrase, sentence, or paragraph. A simplified form of this is commonly taught to school-age children, in the identification of words as nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, etc. More information on each particular tag can be found using the: nltk.help.upenn_tagset() Although the tagsets dataset needs to be downloaded. More on these matter can be found here .
