Here are a few things you need to learn : Your Java web application project must have folder structure of a webapp project. This is normally automatically created by your IDE when you choose to create a webapp project. For me, I am using maven to organise my webapp project so it slightly different from ant project. You will need to learn where to put you Java classes, JSP pages, resources in your webapp project folders. Try creating a HelloWorld page in your webapp, then learn how to config your web.xml Most IDEs can create war file for you. One war file is created you will have to deploy it in tomcat webapp folder. I don't think many people packing war file manually. Let me know if you want me to explain it in more detail.
