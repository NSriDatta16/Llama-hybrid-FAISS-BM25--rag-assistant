Estimate Causal Effect of Treatment on Binary Outcome

I am a newbie with zero experience regarding the estimate of causal effects of treatment on binary outcome and this is my first post on stackexchange. I have an unbalanced panel sample of about 5,000 individuals for T=11 years (2008-2018). Min t for some individuals is 3 , max t is 11 . On average t=6.5 . I want to estimate the causal effect of temporary work on the probability of being employed. The outcome variable Y is a binary variable that takes value one if the respondent is employed with a paid work in year t and zero otherwise (the respondent is not employed with a paid work in year t ). The treatment variable T is a binary variable that takes value one if the respondent is employed in a temporary work in year t and zero otherwise. This means that the treatment variable T will be equal to 0 if the respondent in year t belongs to one of the following categories: permanent employment part-time employment unemployment If the respondent is unemployed in year t , both the treatment variable T and outcome Y are equal to 0 ( T=Y=0 ). If the respondent is a part-time employee in year t , then T=0 and Y==1 . Similarly, if the respondent is a permanent employee in year t , then T=0 and Y==1 . Finally, if the respondent is a temporary employee in year t , then T=Y=1 . A respondent who is unemployed in year t can move to permanent or part-time or temporary employment in year t+1 . A respondent who is a permanent or part-time employee in year t cannot move to temporary employment in year t+1 . He/She can only move to unemployment if e.g., he/she get fired. A part-time employee in year t can also move to permanent employment in year t+1 (and vice versa). A respondent who is a temporary employee in year t can move to unemployment or permanent or part-time employment in year t+1 . I begin my estimation using a Fixed Effects (FE) at the individual-level model, with Y being the outcome variable, T the main explanatory variable and some control variables (e.g., age and education of the respondent). To provide a causal estimation, I utilize Lewbelâ€™s (2012) two-stage least squares (2SLS) approach. Based on all the above, I would appreciate your opinion/feedback. First of all, is the "coding" I have done correct? Does it make sense? Or it is something wrong... Moreover, does my estimation strategy makes sense? Should I use an alternative approach? Thank you all in advance!
