C# Linq syntax help - How can I exclude two values?

I have this linq query that works well (although it may be written better, pls say so if you notice something) var qry = BenefitCodes .Where(b => b.BenInterest != 'E' && (b.BenProductLine == CoverageProductLine || b.BenProductLine == null) ) .Select(b => b) .OrderBy(b => b.BenDesc); A new requirement came down the pipeline to exclude two BenCodes ( 1001, 1009), BenCodes is just another column in the SQL table. Am I supposed to use some variation of ".Contains", I would have to do !Contains or something. Can anyone point me in the right direction? Thanks, ~ck in San Diego
