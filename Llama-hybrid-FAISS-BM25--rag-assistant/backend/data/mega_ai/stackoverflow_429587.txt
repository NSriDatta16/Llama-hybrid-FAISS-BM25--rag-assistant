An important point that the other answers forgot, is that "@keyword" is compiled into "keyword" in the CIL. So if you have a framework that was made in, say, F#, which requires you to define a class with a property named "class", you can actually do it. It is not that useful in practice, but not having it would prevent C# from some forms of language interop. I usually see it used not for interop, but to avoid the keyword restrictions (usually on local variable names, where this is the only effect) ie. private void Foo(){ int @this = 2; } but I would strongly discourage that! Just find another name, even if the 'best' name for the variable is one of the reserved names.
