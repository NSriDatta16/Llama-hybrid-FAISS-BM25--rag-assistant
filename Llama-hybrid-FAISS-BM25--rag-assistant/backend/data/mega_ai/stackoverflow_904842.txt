I did some test to see how the theory actually works: kennethxu.blogspot.com/2009/05/interlocked-vs-monitor-performance.html . My test was more focused on CompareExchnage but the result for Increment is similar. Interlocked is not necessary faster in multi-cpu environment. Here is the test result for Increment on a 2 years old 16 CPU server. Bare in mind that the test also involves the safe read after increase, which is typical in real world. D:\>InterlockVsMonitor.exe 16 Using 16 threads: InterlockAtomic.RunIncrement (ns): 8355 Average, 8302 Minimal, 8409 Maxmial MonitorVolatileAtomic.RunIncrement (ns): 7077 Average, 6843 Minimal, 7243 Maxmial D:\>InterlockVsMonitor.exe 4 Using 4 threads: InterlockAtomic.RunIncrement (ns): 4319 Average, 4319 Minimal, 4321 Maxmial MonitorVolatileAtomic.RunIncrement (ns): 933 Average, 802 Minimal, 1018 Maxmial
