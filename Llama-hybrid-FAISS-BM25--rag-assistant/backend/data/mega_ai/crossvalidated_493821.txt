What is the difference between parametric and non-parametric distributions?

I've learnt that for parametrical distributions you can describe the family of statistical model with the parameters, one such example has been the uniform distribution. I just came across a text saying that the uniform distribution is "inherently non-parametric". What is really the difference between parametric and non-parametric distributions? (I have already read the previous answers on this topic). edit: link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_uniform_distribution I don't have a background in statistics/mathematics/machine learning.
