Find missing birthdays in Apple Addressbook

I am trying to clean the holes out of my Mac address book. As a first step I want to ask all my friends for their birthday, to be able to congratulate them with cheesy Hallmark cards . I need a "group" in my address book, to mailmerge personalized messages from. This is the Applescript I came up with: tell application "Address Book" make new group with properties {name:"No Birthday"} set birthdayPeople to (get every person whose birth date is greater than date "Monday, January 1, 1900 12:00:00 AM") repeat with i from 1 to number of items in people set thePerson to item i of people if not (birthdayPeople contains thePerson) then add thePerson to group "No Birthday" end if end repeat save end tell It breaks, but from the error messages I cannot deduce what is wrong: Result: error "Can’t make «class azf4» id \"05F770BA-7492-436B-9B58-E24F494702F8:ABPerson\" of application \"Address Book\" into type vector." number -1700 from «class azf4» id "05F770BA-7492-436B-9B58-E24F494702F8:ABPerson" to vector (BTW: Did I mention this is my first AppleScript code, EVER? So, if this code can be simplified, or made more elegant, that is welcome too.)
