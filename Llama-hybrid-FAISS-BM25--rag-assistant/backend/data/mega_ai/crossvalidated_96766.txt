dealing with exponentials in python - infinities and overflows

In a machine learning algorithm that I'm using, I need to get the exponential values of something in one of the steps. This is the step that I'm dealing with right now: I've already got all the 1+g_j(X_i) etc etc calculated, there's no problem in that. Let's call it calculated_value . That's fine. The problem is, I am getting infinities and overflows when implementing this function in code. What's the solution for this? What would the logarithmic version of the same function, that I could use in place of the function above? In case it matters, Î² is going to be used as a coefficient to some variables, including partially to calculate the weights for a weighted regression solution.
