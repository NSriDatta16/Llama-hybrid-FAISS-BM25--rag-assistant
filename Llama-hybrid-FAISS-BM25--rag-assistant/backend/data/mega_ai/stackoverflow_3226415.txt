Bug in xcode? Problem with using PNG's in UIImageView

Just a small warning for the ones of you who work with a lot of images. Today I was copying (drag n drop) a lot of PNG images into my xcode project (I'm using 3.2.3). Half way through the copying xcode stopped because there was already a file with the same name. No problem. Deselected that file and copied the rest. All seemed fine. Later on when I should set an image for a UIImageView with this piece of code [backgroundView initWithImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"Wallpaper.png"]]; I noticed that only some of the images worked. The rest only showed a blank screen. After some investigation I found that all the images where the copy was interrupted did not work. Once I deleted them and copied them in again it worked. Has anyone else seen this? Something to report to Apple?
