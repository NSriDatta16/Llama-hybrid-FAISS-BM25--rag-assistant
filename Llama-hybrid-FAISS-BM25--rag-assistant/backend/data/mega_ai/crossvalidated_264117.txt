You have asked 2 questions. First if you can use Logistic regression. Of course you can. You can surely have lag values of ending reading/ beginning reading as independent variables. Even ARMA is a kind of regression only.- http://machinelearningstories.blogspot.in/2016/08/time-series-and-fitting-regression-on.html Second, As you have state based output values- 0 and 1. You can think of state models for time series like Multi State Modelling (MSM) or Hidden Markov Models ( if data has markov property). In these state models you can have beginning reading, inflow, outflow as external variables and then you can build your model.
