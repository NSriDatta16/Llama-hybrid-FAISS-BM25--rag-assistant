What ML architectures might be best to classify text as containing an event or not?

I was looking for some ML/NLP advice. I have 50,000 newsletters (emails) that are labelled either “event” or “not event”. Here is an example of each: Not event: COMPLIMENTARY STANDARD SHIPPING ON ALL DOMESTIC ORDERS.

My current plan was to: Strip all HTML TFIDF on events vs non-events Create something that searches for a date/time (events have to have date/time), and then labels the post either 1 or 0 Use some type of spam email code to assess if an email looks like spam, and label it as such Then throw that data, with the labels, and train using XGBoost or something. Does that sound reasonable? I don't have a strong background in NLP, but I know a lot of you are NLP experts, what kind of architecture would you recommend for this problem? Should I be using LDA or something to identify the parts of speech? Any recommended way to clean HTML?
