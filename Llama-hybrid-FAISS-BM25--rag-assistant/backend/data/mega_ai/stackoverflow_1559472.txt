SQL Server converting a variable varchar field to money/decimal/something with decimal places

I'm looking for an elegant way to convert a field of type varchar, with variable data in it, to a data type which can be used for mathematical operations sample data from the field (excluding quotes) '' 'abc' '23' '23.2' The method should work for all, and for the first & second values should return 0, and not throw an SQL Server error..
