What is function of Holm-Bonferroni?

I am confused about Holm-Bonferroni. Suppose we want to compare age of female and male students using t tset. We also want to compare length of arm and elbow between male and female students. I think we need to use Holm-Bonferroni correction in elbow and arm cases. But there is no need to Holm-Bonferroni correction for the p value of age. Is this right? what means multiple comparison which is said about Holm-Bonferroni? please mention one example. Is Holm-Bonferroni correction needed in some logistic regression models too?
