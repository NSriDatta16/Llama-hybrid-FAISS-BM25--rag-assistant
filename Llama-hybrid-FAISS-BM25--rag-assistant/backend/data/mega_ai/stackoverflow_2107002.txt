What is the best way to do historic comparisons of database data?

i have a database that has a list of employees of an organziation. There is one main employee table and number of joined tables. i want to start to track week over week and month over month metrics on this data so i can do things like: March 1: headcount 100 (+1, -2 in Feb) April 1: headcount 101(+3, -2 in Mar) May 1: headcount 105(+10, -6 in Apr) i am trying to thing of the best way to do this. do i: Take a full database snapshot at the first of each month and have my application query multiple databases to generate these reports. try to keep track of all changes in some db triggered history table and try to aggregate that information to try to build up current state of each month. any other suggestions?
