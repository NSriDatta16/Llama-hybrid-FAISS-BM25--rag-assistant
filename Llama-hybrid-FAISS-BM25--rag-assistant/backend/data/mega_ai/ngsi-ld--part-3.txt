 have relevant NGSI-LD Entities. The architectural roles allow the implementation of different deployment architectures. In a centralized architectures, there is a central Context Broker that stores the context information provided by Context Producers. In a distributed setting, all context information can be stored by Context Sources. In a federated architecture, Context Sources can again be Context Brokers that make aggregated information from a lower hierarchy level available. These architectures are not mutually exclusive, i.e. an actual deployment may combine them in different ways. API The NGSI-LD Context Information Management API allows users to provide, consume and subscribe to context information in multiple scenarios and involving multiple stakeholders. It enables close to real-time access to information coming from many different sources (not only IoT data sources), named Context Sources, as well as publishing that information through interoperable data publication platforms. It provides advanced geo-temporal queries, and it includes subscription mechanisms, in order for content consumers to be notified when content matching some constraints becomes available. The API is designed to be agnostic to the architecture (central, distributed, federated or combinations thereof), so that applications which produce and consume information do not have to be tailored to the specifics of the system that distributes/brokers context information for them. API operations comprise: Context Information operations, concerned with Provision (creating NGSI-LD Entities, and updating their Attributes), Consumption (querying NGSI-LD Entities) and Subscription (subscribing to specific information, under specified constraints, in order to be notified when matching Entities appear, carrying the specified information). Context Sources operations, concerned with Registration (make a new source of context information available in the overall distributed system, by registering it) and Discovery (querying the system about what context sources have registered, which offer information of a specified type). Uses NGSI-LD was initiated by partners of the FIWARE programme, and is primarily used by the FIWARE open source community, supported by the FIWARE Foundation as well as a diverse range of other projects and users such as below: The Connecting Europe Facility recommends the use of the FIWARE context broker with NGSI-LD The Open & Agile Smart Cities & Communities (OASC) organisation references the NGSI-LD specification as the first of their Minimal Interoperability Mechanisms (MIM1). The Living-in.eu project recommends the use of NGSI-LD in their joint declaration and their technical commitments. The declaration has been endorsed and signed by 86 cities and public administrations from the EU, and is supported by many more companies and organizations. The GSMA "IoT Big Data Framework Architecture" is based on NGSI-LD. The Fed4IoT EU project, where it is used as a neutral data format for translating between various IoT data representations The Thing'in graph-based digital twin platform from Orange uses NGSI-LD as its core information model. The City Data Hub platform has been developed as part of the Smart City Data Hub project and is now used as a basis for smart cities in Korea. The India Urban Data Exchange (IUDX) uses the NGSI-LD API as part of their Resource Access Service Interface. It is referenced in the Bureau of Indian Standards' Unified Data Exchange IS 18003(Part2):2021 standard. History NGSI-LD is the result of an evolution of Context Interfaces that started as part of the "Next Generation Service Interfaces" (NGSI) suite published by the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) in 2012, which is also the source of the acronym NGSI. The NGSI suite included NGSI-9 as the Context Entity Discovery Interface and NGSI-10 as the Context Information Interface. The NGSI standard from OMA and its intermediary evolutions relied on a classical Entity–attribute–v
