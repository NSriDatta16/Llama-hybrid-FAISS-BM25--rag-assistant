From Wikipedia on burnout: "burnout is largely an organizational issue caused by long hours, little down time, and continual peer, customer, and superior surveillance" They might as well have an icon image of Scrum next to the definition of burnout. If you think you can send someone onto something else for a brief diversion to fix burnout, you obviously haven't thought it through. Ever go on a vacation after being burned out and go back to work thinking, Wow! Now I'm refreshed and ready for another 6 months of this torture until I finally get a break again. Nope, what happens is you realize, Wow! My job sucks. Now I can really see how my stupid manager's micro-managing, development process is just another way of getting more out of me for less and life's too short for this... I should find something else to do or change jobs to something less stressful. IMHO, short 2 weeks Scrum should be prohibited except in small doses, not more than 4-8 in a row. Use it as a tool for exceptional or critical things, not continually. Use common sense.
