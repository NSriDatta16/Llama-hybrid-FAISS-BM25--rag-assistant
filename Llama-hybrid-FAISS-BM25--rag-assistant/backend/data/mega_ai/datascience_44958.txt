Given your dataset, you can predict whether a given product made using certain machine settings is of bad quality or good quality. But, what you want to achieve (predicting machine settings) is difficult to achieve using a direct machine learning technique as you'll have only one feature and multiple target variables. However, you can use a knn type approach here. Let us call the data point with bad product for which you want to change settings A. Using knn methodology look for 1(or k) nearest neighbors of A which have good product. Then you can use the machine settings of these neighbors or their average. Though, this is not machine learning!
