I didn't have trouble getting colab and python to plot interactively with one million points: import numpy as np import seaborn as sns7 import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # one million points x = np.arange(1000000) y = np.sin(x/50000) # Static figure plt.plot(x,y) #Plotly interactive figure: import plotly.express as px fig = px.scatter(x=x, y=y) fig.show() See results below. I note that it was surprisingly slow UPDATE: I realized that this wasn't a many data points issue, but also a time series one. I was able to confirm that plotly fails when the x data are time series and the number of points is very large (1 million).
