WebDAV behind a reverse proxy

I have 2 servers. One Reverse proxy on the web and one on a private link serving WebDAV. Booth servers are apache httpd v2. On the proxy I have: ProxyRequests Off Order deny,allow Allow from all ProxyPass /repo/ http : //share.local/repo/ ProxyPassReverse /repo/ http : //share.local/repo/ On the dav server I have: DAV on Order allow,deny allow from all The reverse proxy is accessed via https and the private server is accessed via http . And there lies the problem! Read only commands work fine. But when I want to move something I get 502 Bad gateway . The reason for this is the reverse proxy not rewriting the url's inside the extended dav request. The source URL is inside the header and is correctly transformed to http://share.local/file1 . The destination URL is inside some xml fragment I do not understand and stays https://example.com/file1 :( Is there a standard way to let the apache correctly transform the request? Thanks for your effort.
