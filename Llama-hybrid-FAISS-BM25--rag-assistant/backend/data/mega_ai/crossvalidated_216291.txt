Perhaps a related question is, "What are words used in different languages, and what are the connections between these words?" Notation is in some sense like language: Some words have region specific meanings; some words are broadly understood. Like powerful nations spread their language, successful fields and influential researchers spread their notation. Language evolves over time: language has a mix of historical origins and modern influence. Your specific question... I would disagree with your contention that the two follow "completely different notation." Both $X\boldsymbol{\beta} = \boldsymbol{y}$ and $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$ use capital letters to denote matrices. They're not that different. Machine learning is highly related to statistics, a large and mature field. Using $X$ to represent the data matrix is almost certainly the most readable, most standard convention to follow. While $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$ is standard for solving linear systems, that's not how people doing statistics write the normal equations. You'll find your audience more confused if you try to do that. When in Rome... In some sense, the heart of your revised question is, "What are the historical origins of statistics using the letter $x$ to represent data and the letter $\beta$ to represent the unknown variable to solve for?" This is a question for the statistical historians! Briefly searching, I see the influential British statistician and Cambridge academic Udny Yule used $x$ to represent data in his Introduction to the Theory of Statistics (1911). He wrote a regression equation as $x_1 = a + bx_2$, with the least squares objective as minimizing $\sum\left( x_1 - a - bx_2\right)^2$, and with solution $b_{12} = \frac{\sum x_1x_2}{\sum x_2^2}$. It at least goes back to then... The even more influential R.A. Fisher used $y$ for the dependent variable and $x$ for the independent variable in his 1925 book Statistical Methods for Research Workers . (Hat tip to @Nick Cox for providing link with info.) Good notation is like good language. Avoid field specific jargon whenever possible. Write in the math equivalent of high BBC English, language that is understandable to most anyone that speaks English. One should write, whenever possible, using notation that is clear and that is broadly understood.
