You can drag and drop items from one project to another. Any namespace etc. changes you want will need to be done manually. This will copy the files, and create as an add to any integrated VCS. Another approach is to branch in VCS into the destination project and then use "add existing item" to add. This will (depending on your VCS) maintain history.
