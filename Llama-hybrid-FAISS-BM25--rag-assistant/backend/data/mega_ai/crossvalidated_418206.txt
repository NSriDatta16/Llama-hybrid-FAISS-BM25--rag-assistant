How are missing data handled in Time series estimation?

I am looking for most popular/theoretically sound methods for handling missing data in time series model (particularly ARMA class) estimation. Also what method is used in R (in arima and in forecast package) My concern is that if there is enough data missing, the sample autocorrelation at longer lags may not be available and may influence model selection (in auto.arima). How is this handled?
