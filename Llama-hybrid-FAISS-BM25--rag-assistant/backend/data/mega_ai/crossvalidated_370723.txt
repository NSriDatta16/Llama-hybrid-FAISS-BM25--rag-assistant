How to calculate the derivative of crossentropy error function?

I'm reading this tutorial (presented below) on computing derivative of crossentropy. The author used the loss function of logistic regression I think. https://www.dropbox.com/s/rxrtz3auu845fuy/Softmax.pdf?dl=0 Most of the equations make sense to me except one thing. In the second page, there is: $$\frac{\partial E_x}{\partial o^x_j}=\frac{t_j^x}{o_j^x}+\frac{1-t_j^x}{1-o^x_j}$$ However in the third page, the "Crossentropy derivative" becomes $$\frac{\partial E_x}{\partial o^x_j}=-\frac{t_j^x}{o_j^x}+\frac{1-t_j^x}{1-o^x_j}$$ There is a minus sign in $E_x$ . Then the derivative should be $\frac{\partial E_x}{\partial o^x_j}=-\frac{t_j^x}{o_j^x}-\frac{1-t_j^x}{1-o^x_j}$ . But it is not. What have I missed? The tutorial:
