Doing this in a time-space context is another barrel of monkeys (that I am not sure about), but it sounds to me like wavelet coherence (or wavelet covariance) might be worth looking into. Wavelet coherence is to wavelet covariance as correlation is to covariance. Wavelet coherence is wavelet covariance that has been normalized (mainly for the purpose of avoiding statistically significant peaks in the cross wavelet spectrum that are due to noise). Such a method would allow you to look at cross correlation of two time series. If you are an R user, look into the package "biwavelet" (and analogous packages). There seems to have been a surge of new packages for this sort of thing in the last several years. Most of the empirical applications of wavelet covariance and coherence analysis have been in climate science...and matlab seems to be popular in those realms, so packages for matlab might also be useful. Another option would be bivariate Moran's I, but I would think that wavelet coherence would be better because it sounds like it is peaks in the local spectrum that would be of interest to you...bivariate Moran's I is a global analysis (and thus would not tell you about anomalous positions). Hope this helps! CDA Edit: PS--You can also do a wavelet coherence analysis for your spatial data...but both time and space is where it would get tricky.
