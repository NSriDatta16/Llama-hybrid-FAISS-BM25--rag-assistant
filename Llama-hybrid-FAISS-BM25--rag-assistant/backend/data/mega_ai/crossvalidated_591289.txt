Shape of tensorflow model input

I'm reading Masking and padding with Keras , in the beginning, an input example is: [ ["Hello", "world", "!"], ["How", "are", "you", "doing", "today"], ["The", "weather", "will", "be", "nice", "tomorrow"], ] The article states: The data is a nested list where individual samples have length 3, 5, and 6, respectively. Since the input data for a deep learning model must be a single tensor (of shape e.g. (batch_size, 6, vocab_size) in this case) What is this tensor's shape (batch_size, 6, vocab_size) ? Is batch_size 3 since there're 3 sentences? What is 6 here? Is it the longest sentence's length? What is vocab_size ? The shape is strange to me because tf.keras.layers.Embedding 's input is a "2D tensor with shape: (batch_size, input_length)." This is not the same with the above shape.
