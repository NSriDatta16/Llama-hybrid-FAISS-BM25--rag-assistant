It's depend on how your extension was packaged(occurred), e.g. pear package(most likely you downloaded extension from magento website or purchased from professional vendor) or regular archive(purchased from some junior or amateurish vendor): installing pear package: ./pear install Foo_FooBar-0.1.0.tgz installing from regular archive: usually you just need to extract archive into the magento root, otherwise look for instruction inside archive or request from vendor See also installing magento via ssh Thanks.
