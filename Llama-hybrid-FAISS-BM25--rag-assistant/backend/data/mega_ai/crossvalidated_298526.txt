Another alternative not mentioned so far in the answers are variational approximations. Although these algorithms are not exactly EM algorithms in all cases, in some cases EM algorithms are limiting cases of Bayesian mean-field variational algorithms. The limit pertains to the limiting case of the hyper-parameters, choosing the limiting values-in some cases-will give you the EM algorithm. In either case (EM, VB, or even MM algorithms) there are 2 generic ways to speed things up: (1) reduce the dimensionality of the problem-from a $p$-dim problem to $p$ univariate problems. These are usually coordinate descent algorithms but I've seen MM algorithms that also do this type of speedup. (2) improving the convergence rate of your EM (or other type) algorithm. In a comment JohnRos mentioned Aitken acceleration. This is from the numerical analysis world but is discussed in the EM book by McLachlan and Krishnan. There may be others I missed but these seem to be the two big ones.
