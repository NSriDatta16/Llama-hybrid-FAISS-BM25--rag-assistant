If you're looking for clarity, documentation is one good way to deal with this. Of course, that assumes that people pay attention to your docs. Aside from using existing classes with known usage patterns, you could create your own class. With a class that the compiler could auto-generate from a normal parameter (using operators you would write, of course), you could more accurately specify the contract without making it more difficult to pass the parameters. There are drawbacks to this (extra classes, more layers for the user to see and understand, naming responsibilities), but it is an option to consider. If you're in an environment where IntelliSense is available, make sure that the necessary information is present in the parameter description. That could save you from any of these other steps.
