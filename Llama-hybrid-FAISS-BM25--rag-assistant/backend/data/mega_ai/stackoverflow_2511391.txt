jQuery UI sortable - unable to drag elements to the bottom of a connected list/column

I'm having an issue with jQuery sortables. I'm using it to develop an iGoogle-like dashboard by creating 3 columns. All 3 contain sortable divs and are connected to each other using the connectWith option. The issue I'm having is when trying to drop a div at the bottom of a sortable column; it just doesn't want to happen. It only works if I drag it over/past the bottom-most div that's already in the list I'm dragging to. Is there any way to avoid this? Or maybe to create a dummy div fixed at the bottom of each column? ANY help on this would be MUCH appreciated! Thanks in advance.
