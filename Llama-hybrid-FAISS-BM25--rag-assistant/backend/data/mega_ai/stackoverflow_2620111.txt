Javascript: how to tell if a node object has been inserted into a document/another element yet

I'd like to be able to identify whether a given DOM node has been appended/inserted into another node yet, or whether it is fresh out of document.createElement() or similar and has not been placed anywhere. In most browsers just checking the parentNode works. if (!node.parentNode) { // this node is not part of a larger document } However, in Internet Explorer it appears that new elements, even right after they've been created with document.createElement() already have a parentNode object (of type DispHTMLDocument??). Any other nice cross-browser and reliable way? Edit : looks like Internet Explorer is implicitly creating a DocumentFragment (with nodeType of 11) and setting that as the node's parentNode property.
