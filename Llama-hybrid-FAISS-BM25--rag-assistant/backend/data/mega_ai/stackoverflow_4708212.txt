Adding index on every field in every table is not smart. You should add indexes ONLY on columns that you use in the WHERE clause in select OR on which you sort. Often, the best results are achieved by using multi-column indexes that are specific to your SQL selects. There are also a partial indexes with limit on the length of field which can also be used to optimize performance and reduce the index site. Every unnecessary index will slow down the database during the insert because on every insert, every index has to be updated. Also the more indexes you have, the more chances you have of data corruption. And lastly, indexes take extra storage space on disk, sometimes a lot of space. Also MySQL tries to keep indexes in memory. If you have unnecessary indexes, there is a good change MySQL will end up using up the available memory with unnecessary indexes in which case your performance will degrade considerable. Creating the right kind of indexes is probably the single most important optimization technique. That's why when someone asks something like this I thought it was a joke. This question can only be asked by someone who have not read a single book on MySQL. Just get a good book and read it, then you will not have to ask questions like this.
