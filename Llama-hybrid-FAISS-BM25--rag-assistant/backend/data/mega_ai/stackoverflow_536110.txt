UI design and cultural sensitivity/awareness

When designing a user interface for an application that is going to be used internationally it is possible to accidentally design an aspect of the UI that is offensive to or inappropriate in another culture. Have you ever encountered such an issue and if so, how did you resolve the design problem? Some examples: A GPS skyplot in a surveying application to be used in Northern Ireland. Satellites had to be in a different colour to indicate whether they were in ascent or descent in the sky. Lots of satellites in ascent are considered good as it indicates that GPS coverage will be getting better in the next few hours. I chose green for ascent and orange for descent. I had not realised that these colours are associated with Irish Catholics and Irish Protestants. It was suggested that we change the colours. In the end blue and a deep pink were chosen. For applications that are going to be translated into German, I've found that you should add about 50% extra space for the German text compared to the English text. A friend was working on a battlefield planning application for a customer in the Middle East. It was mandated that all crosshairs should take the form of a diagonal cross, to avoid any religious significance. (Edit - added this) In the UK a tick mark (something like âˆš) means yes whereas a cross (x) means no . In Windows 3.1 selected checkboxes used a cross, which confused me the first time I saw it. Since Windows 95 they've used (what I would call) a tick mark. As far as I can tell both a tick and a cross are called a check mark in the US, and mean the same thing Edit Please ensure that any reply you add to this question is as culturally sensitive as the user interfaces we're all trying to build! Thanks.
