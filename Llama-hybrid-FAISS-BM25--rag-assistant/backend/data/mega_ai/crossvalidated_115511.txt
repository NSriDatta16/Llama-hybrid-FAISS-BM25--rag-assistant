For iid normal data, the expected mean deviation is $\sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}}\sigma$. For example, see this section , the paragraph beginning "For the normal distribution, the ratio of mean absolute deviation to standard deviation..." Also see here , which lists the result for the normal. You can also get it from the mean of a chi(1) distribution . (Note: chi, not chi-squared.) The derivation isn't particularly hard to do from first principles, though. Given that result, the square of the population mean-deviation is $\frac{2}{\pi}\sigma^2$. If the mean deviation is $d$, then $\sigma^2 = \frac{\pi}{2}d^2$. [Of course, if you're doing it from sample statistics, I'm pretty sure this won't give an unbiased estimator.]
