Try to add drawable folders for the slider icon so that the platform can correctly scale your image depending on the density of the current screen. res/drawable-ldpi/slider_icon.png // icon image for low density res/drawable-mdpi/slider_icon.png // icon for medium density res/drawable-hdpi/slider_icon.png // icon image for high density From the code above, I can see you're adding the sliding image resource to default drawable resource without actually paying attention to the screen density size, this may not work as expected as the platform is just loading your image as the default medium size density. This may look correct in the emulator but will produce the effect you describe above when running in a real device.
