There's no such thing as ColdFusion MX 2004, neither in name nor release year (CFMX 6.1 was released in 2003, and CFMX 7 was released in 2005). FusionDebug supports all versions of CFMX from 6.1 onwards. You may want to investigate BlueDragon.NET , which allows you to run CFML code on the .NET platform, and may make the transition easier for you.
