First of all, I think, that the overview you are talking about is actually called Gantt chart. How to implement it? Well, I can bet that you can find a lot of implementations of gantt chart controls, for WinForms, WPF or ASP.NET - whichever you need. I bet it would be the fastest and most cost-efficient way to do it. If, for some reason, you need to implementit yourself - then you'll just have to create your own contorl, but I strongly recommend using one of the existing ones - it'll save you a lot of time and nerve
