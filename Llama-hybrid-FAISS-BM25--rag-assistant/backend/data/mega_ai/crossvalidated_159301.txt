Using gbm to eliminate variables before glm

I have a classification problem I am attempting to model using logistic regression (via the glm package in R): cols I have a bunch of explanatory variables at the moment. How advisable is it to model this relationship using gbm , see the relative inference strength of each variable, and then remove seemingly meaningless variables before glm regression? I ask just because I have done this in the past, with glm and gbm giving seemingly contradictory signals on different explanatory variables.
