Extracting embeddings of Categorical Variables

I am trying to build a regression model, for which I have a nominal variable with very high cardinality. I am trying to get the categorical embedding of the column. Input: df["nominal_column"] Output: the embeddings of the column. I want to use the op of the embedding column alone since I would require that as a input to my traditional regression model. Is there a way to extract that output alone. P.S I am not asking for code, any suggestion on the approach would be great.
