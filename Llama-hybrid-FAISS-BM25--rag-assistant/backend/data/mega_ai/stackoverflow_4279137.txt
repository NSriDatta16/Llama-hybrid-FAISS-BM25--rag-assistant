The newsletter and subscriber tables don't contain firstname and lastname fields at least in the latest release, Magento EE 1.9.1.1. If you want to add an additional field to the subscriber table, you should update the subscribe method of Mage_Newsletter_Model_Subscriber class (it receives just an e-mail address, you should pass additional arguments) and the controller Mage_Newsletter_SubscriberController , action newAction so that it extracts other fields from $_POST array and uses in the creation of newsletter subscription (search for the instruction $status = Mage::getModel('newsletter/subscriber')->subscribe($email) ).
