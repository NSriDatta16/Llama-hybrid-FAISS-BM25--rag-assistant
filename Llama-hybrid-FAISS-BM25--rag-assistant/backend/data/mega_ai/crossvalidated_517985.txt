Is a neural network essential for deep learning?

I received preliminary materials on deep learning in my class. It was written as follows. This raised me the question of the basic meaning of the word deep learning. Deep learning is a machine learning method using a multi-layer neural network. Is a neural network essential for deep learning? Isn't it possible to do deep learning without a neural network by using PCA? (Example: PCANet) I'm confused by similar terms like deep learning and deep neural networks. I have a month to start school and I can't contact my teacher during that time. I would appreciate it if you could tell me.
