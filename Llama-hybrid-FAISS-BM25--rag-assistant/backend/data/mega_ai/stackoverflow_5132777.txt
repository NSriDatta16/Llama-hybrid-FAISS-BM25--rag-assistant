I would call crossover in this context "inefficient", rather than "pointless". One way to address the duplication you mention might be to sort the hidden layer neurons in some canonical order, and use this order during crossover, which might at least reduce the duplication encountered in hidden weight space. Also, you might fit the output layer weights by a more direct method than genetic algorithms. You don't say what performance metric is being used, but many common measures have fairly straightforward optimizations. So, as an example, you might generate a new hidden layer using genetic operators, then fit the output layer by logistic regression, and have the GA evaluate the total network.
