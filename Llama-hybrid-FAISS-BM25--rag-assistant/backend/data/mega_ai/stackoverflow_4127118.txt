Can you detect "dragging" in jQuery?

I have a throbber that is to appear when a user clicks a link. The problem is is that that same link can be clicked and dragged to be rearranged. In this case, I wouldn't need the throbber to appear. It only needs to appear if its actually waiting to go somewhere. How can I, with jQuery, create an event listener that would only allow a throbber to appear if its a click through to a link , and not a click and drag?
