eparates business and technical governance, with the PyTorch project maintaining its technical governance structure, while the foundation handles funding, hosting expenses, events, and management of assets such as the project's website, GitHub repository, and social media accounts, ensuring open community governance. Upon its inception, the foundation formed a governing board comprising representatives from its initial members: AMD, Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Hugging Face, IBM, Intel, Meta, Microsoft, and NVIDIA. Applications Natural Language Processing Open-source AI has assisted in developing and adopting of Large Language Models (LLMs). While proprietary models like OpenAI's GPT series have redefined what is possible in applications such as interactive dialogue systems and automated content creation, fully open-source models have also made significant strides. Google's BERT is an open-source model widely used for tasks like entity recognition and language translation, establishing itself as a versatile tool in NLP. These open-source LLMs have democratized access to advanced language technologies and reduce reliance on proprietary systems. Machine Translation Hugging Face's MarianMT is an example of Machine Translation, providing support for a wide range of language pairs. Another notable is model OpenNMT. Alongside these open-source models, open-source datasets such as the WMT (Workshop on Machine Translation) datasets including, Europarl Corpus, and OPUS contribute to the sector and assist developers to train and fine-tune models for specific languages. Computer vision models Libraries including OpenCV support real-time computer vision applications, such as image recognition, motion tracking, and facial detection. Originally developed by Intel, OpenCV has become one of the most popular libraries for computer vision. Other open-source computer vision models including YOLO (You Only Look Once) and Detectron2 also offer similar features. Unlike the previous generations of Computer Vision models, which process image data through convolutional layers, newer generations of computer vision models use Vision Transformers which break down an image into smaller patches to identify which areas of the image are most relevant which generally produces more accurate results. Robotics Open-source artificial intelligence has made a notable impact in robotics by providing a flexible, scalable development environment for both academia and industry. The Robot Operating System (ROS) is an example of a framework used by developers to work across different hardware platforms and robotic architectures. Gazebo is another an open-source robotic simulation software used to test robotic systems in a virtual environment before real-world deployment. Healthcare In the healthcare industry, open-source AI has been used in diagnostics, patient care, and personalized treatment options. Open-source libraries have been used for medical imaging for tasks such as tumor detection, improving the speed and accuracy of diagnostic processes. Additionally, OpenChem, an open-source library specifically geared toward chemistry and biology applications, enables the development of predictive models for drug discovery, helping researchers identify potential compounds for treatment. Military Meta's Llama models, which have been described as open-source by Meta, were adopted by U.S. defense contractors like Lockheed Martin and Oracle after unauthorized adaptations by Chinese researchers affiliated with the People's Liberation Army (PLA) came to light. The Open Source Initiative and others have contested Meta's use of the term open-source to describe Llama, due to Llama's license containing an acceptable use policy that prohibits use cases including non-U.S. military use. Chinese researchers used an earlier version of Llama to develop tools like ChatBIT, optimized for military intelligence and decision-making, prompting Meta to expand its partnerships with U.S. cont
