The "no space left on device" error isn't necessarily caused by running out of storage capacity, as it suggests, it can also be cause by running out of i-nodes on the filesystem. In other words, a given filesystem can only contain so many files. Running df will suggest everything's fine. See this article for more info. You either need to delete some files that you don't need any more, or put Hudson on a different filesystem. It's not uncommon in situations where you know you'll have a lot of small files to build a filesystem with an explicitly larger i-node table.
