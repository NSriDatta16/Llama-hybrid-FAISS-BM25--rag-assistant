Well, I've tried doing this: wget http://sube.garanti.com.tr which timed-out. but doing this: wget https://sube.garanti.com.tr/isube/login/en gave me website's source. It is frames base and I'm getting the frames definitions. The reason for that is probably, that the site is inaccesible through normal (http) connection, you have to use secured one (https). However, as a rule of thumb, I'd try to set User-Agent: header for any such application, as noted by pjc50.
