Do I need to adjust the degrees of freedom returned by pool.compare() in MICE?

I am analyzing a multiply imputed dataset produced from the MICE package in R. To assess the overall significance of my linear model, I am using pool.compare() to compare my "full" model to an intercept only "restricted" model. However, the degrees of freedom (residual) returned by pool.compare() seem very highly inflated (I have set m = 50 imputations). I'm aware that 50 imputations is high, but it's needed for my dataset. I've given an example below of the same issue using the nhanes2 dataset from the MICE package. I have two questions: 1) Why are the degrees of freedom returned by pool.compare() so high? 2) Is it appropriate to use the adjustment to the degrees of freedom suggested by Barnard and Rubin (1999) and described in section 2.3.6 of Stef van Burren's Flexible Imputation of Missing Data textbook? The R code below shows the issue I'm asking about using the nhanes2 dataset. This dataset has 25 observations and the example fits a linear model with one categorical predictor (age) with three levels and one continuous predictor (chl). # load package and data library("mice") data(nhanes2) # impute missing values, m = 50 imp F) 1 21 293.60 2 24 477.23 -3 -183.62 4.3778 0.01525 * --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 In the end, it seems strange that an analysis conducted on a hypothetically complete dataset returns 24 degrees of freedom, while an analysis conducted on 50 multiply imputed datasets returns over 1000 degrees of freedom. Why is there this large difference in degrees of freedom? My second question relates to the correction proposed by Barnard and Rubin(1999). Is it appropriate to use that correction here? Because this is a multi-parameter test, doing so requires, I guess, an estimate of lambda which is averaged across the parameters being estimated. The figures I've used in this example are: v_old = 1374.457 v_com = 25-1 = 24 average lambda = 0.329 v_obs = 14.91 v (adjusted degrees of freedom) = 14.75 Applying this correction in this instance returns a corrected degrees of freedom of 14.75, which is more than the df that would be returned by analyzing only complete cases (12) and less than the df that would be returned by analyzing a hypothetically complete dataset (24). Which seems reasonable. Thank you all for your assistance. Matt.
