In neural networks, the weights in a layer are always a matrix of shape [number of inputs, number of outputs], connecting every input to every output. When one of those is 1, the weights can be seen as 1D vector. In your case, there are 784 inputs and 10 outputs, so the weights are 2D. Note aside: what you are doing is classification, not regression.
