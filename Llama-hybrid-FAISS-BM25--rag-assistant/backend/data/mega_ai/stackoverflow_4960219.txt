Jquery ajax error - Requests adding GET var

My ajax function has stopped working all of a sudden. function get_file_info() { $.ajax({ type: "GET", url: "http://localhost/includes/get_file_info.php", dataType: "json", jsonp: false, jsonpCallback: "callbackName", success: function(data) { return data; } }); } I did some debugging and found that the ajax request is going to http://localhost/includes/get_file_info.php?_=1297356964250 I am just would like to know what it is and can be used for, also how to remove so the ajax request is like below so it works again. http://localhost/includes/get_file_info.php Many Thanks
