Some conventions we use in organizing stylesheets: Have one main.css stylesheet that holds all of the data for skinning the base application. Have one fonts.css stylesheet to store all of the fonts in the main app, because these can get quite messy. The main.css stylesheet is included in the main swf via the tag. We load our app with as little as possible, and once everything is loaded, if we need to immediately show some text (sometimes we just have a video playing if it's an advertising site), we fade/tween in the main elements and load the fonts.css via StyleManager.loadStyleDeclarations at runtime. If we have an admin panel, we have an admin.css stylesheet which we load at runtime because the main app doesn't need it. We don't need to divide up the CSS anymore than that because we usually create a whole set of skins in a Theme , so the stylesheet is just applying those skins to components and is pretty lean (using Flex 4). I tend not do divide stylesheets into anything smaller (like "pages.css", "comments.css", "popups.css", or even "controls.css", etc.) because it would be overkill and too much to manage for little in return. That's common with HTML, but that's because HTML requires CSS for nice presentation; Flex could do without CSS entirely. When developing, one of us usually develops most of the skin right away (having a default wireframe setup, like those found on ScaleNine as they do the photoshop/flash/after-effects. There's no way to not have to recompile the css swf if you make changes. But if it is loaded at runtime, you only have to recompile the css file and not the main swf, which is useful but not really useful during hardcore skin development. I tried keeping the main stylesheet separate during development (in a custom Theme), and it made development a LOT harder, because I had to recompile the css separately every time I made a change and sometimes I had to recompile the main app too, and there were strange and hard-to-track-down bugs, etc. Then I was compiling two different apps. So I recommend keeping the main css file part of the main app. If you wanted runtime css without having to recompile anything, try Ruben's CSS Loader and check out the source . But that would come at a runtime performance cost.
