The code below doesn't work as is, but hopefully it will point you in the right direction: // ... void recurse(int tmp[], int p, const int size) { if (p == size) { // Computationally heavy, should be executed in its own "thread" // perform task using the thread pool #pragma omp task performTask(tmp); // Note: Only requires read access } else { for(int i = 0; i The code is based on Comparing Nested Parallel Regions and Tasking in OpenMP 3.0 .
