First, it sounds like you want factor analysis not PCA. You have a latent variable (overall size). Finding latent factors is the goal of factor analysis. My favorite professor in grad school used to say: If you're not surprised, you haven't learned anything. The fact that PC 1 only accounts for 40% of the variance means that something else is going on. That is a surprise. Your goal is to figure out what that is. Throwing that information away by combining the two PCs seems like a really bad idea. I don't know what you mean by "not work statistically". What is a "good" representation is really up to you to decide. It's field dependent and also depends on the number of variables and what they are. With only six variables and given the ones you've listed (and assuming the others are similar) I am very surprised that one factor is only 40% of the variance. Very surprised means that you either a) Did something wrong or b) Found something really interesting. You don't want to ignore either possibility.
