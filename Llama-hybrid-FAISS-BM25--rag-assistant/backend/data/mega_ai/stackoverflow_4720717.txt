Baffling Sudden Error on loading data table

I'm using VB.net and WPF 4, as well as an SQL database. I have been using this EXACT code successfully for several days now, with absolutely no problems whatsoever. However, now, suddenly, it is throwing the weirdest exception... Public Class ROSTER Dim table_adapter As New AGENT_ROSTERTableAdapters.AGENTROSTERTableAdapter Dim roster_table As New AGENT_ROSTER.AGENT_ROSTERDataTable ... I have not deleted anything relating to this, and I can still do things similar to this, but I cannot, for the life of me, figure out why I am getting the following error: XamlParseException occured 'Provide value on 'System.Windows.Baml2006.TypeConverterMarkupExtension' threw an exception.' Line number '4' and line position '106'. On detail, every field contains the following: {Cannot evaluate expression because we are stopped in a place where garbage collection is impossible, possibly because the code of the current method may be optimized.} Why is this doing this, and what can I do to fix it??
