Training time complexity of non-linear SVMs is between O(n 2 ) and O(n 3 ) Weka SMO seems to be closer to the latter. For instance, the execution time in ms for a random set with 205 features with Weka SMO looks like this: It's hard to predict, but it could take anywhere from 1 day (n 2 ) and 124 days (n 3 ) Depending on your use-case, you could use a linear kernel implementation, like LIBLINEAR.
