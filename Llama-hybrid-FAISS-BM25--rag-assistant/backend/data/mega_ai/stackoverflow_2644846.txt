How can i call an XSL template within a hyperlink in the XSL stylesheet

I am making my own XSL stylesheet which will perform different views on the same XML document Because the XML document is so large, i would like some links at the top of the outputted page to call each template that will be used to display the data. At the moment I can create links that use anchors to a place in the document but it would be better if i just call each template as needed. How can i just call each template in a link? Would i have to use xlink? Show all the users Show all the festival organisers
