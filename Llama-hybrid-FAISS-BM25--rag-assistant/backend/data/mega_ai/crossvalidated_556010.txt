Stambaugh Bias in R

I am trying to estimate a predictive model in R, in the spirit of Goyal and Welch (2008), such that: $R_t = \alpha + \beta_1 X_{t-1} + \epsilon_t$ I am aware about the possibility of having Stambaugh bias. However, I do not know how to correct for it using bootstraping in R. My OLS model is lm(eval(parse(text=Rt)) ~ lag(eval(parse(text=DP)), -1), data=window(df, start, end)) Can someone who experienced this before tell me how to write a code to bootstrap this using 10,000 bootstrapped time series. Given that the DGP is: $ y_{t+1} = \alpha + \beta x_t + u_{1,t+1}$ $ x_{t+1} = \mu + \rho x_t + u_{2,t+1} $
