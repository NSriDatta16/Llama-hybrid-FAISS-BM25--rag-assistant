Javascript substr(); limit by word not char

I would like to limit the substr by words and not chars. I am thinking regular expression and spaces but don't know how to pull it off. Scenario: Limit a paragraph of words to 200 words using javascript/jQuery. var $postBody = $postBody.substr(' ',200); This is great but splits words in half :) Thanks ahead of time!
