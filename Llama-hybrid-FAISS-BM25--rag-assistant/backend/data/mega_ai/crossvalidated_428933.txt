Residual plot from a logistic regression

Reposting from here I am implementing a two-stage logistic regression customer acquisition model and want to understand the peculiar pattern I observe in the residuals from the DHARMa R package. The first stage model is a probit model selection_model 0) ~ m * b + l + w + f, data = aggregate_df, family = binomial(link = "probit")) Then I add in the inverse mills ratio like so: aggregate_df $IMR = dnorm(selection_model$ linear.predictors)/pnorm(selection_model$linear.predictors) The second stage model shares the same predictors except that the inverse mills ratio is also added as a predictor. Also, I am interested in looking at those customers who have given a total sales of more than X. This is captured in a binary indicator variable I(dollar_sales > X) , which is the outcome I model in the second stage. model_logit X) ~ IMR + m * b + l + w + f + I(f^2) + I(l^2), data = aggregate_df, family = binomial(link = "logit")) I then plot the residuals of this model using the DHARMa package like so: simulated_residuals = DHARMa::simulateResiduals(model_logit, n = 50) plot(simulated_residuals) I have the following questions: Why are there two disjoint blobs at the bottom and top of the QQ plot? Is this a cause of concern (as the KS test indicates)? The residual vs predicted plot seems okay, barring the outliers. Is this also expected behavior
