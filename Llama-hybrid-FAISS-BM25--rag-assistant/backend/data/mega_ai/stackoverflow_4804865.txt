In your constructor you declare a local variable called t which uses the same name as your field t . Simply replace Thread t with this.t or simple t there: public threadtest(String name) { this.t=new Thread(name); } BTW1, it's highly recommended to start class names with capital letters, i.e. ThreadTest in your case would be a better name. BTW2, a decent IDE would spot this mistake for you and drew your attention to this.
