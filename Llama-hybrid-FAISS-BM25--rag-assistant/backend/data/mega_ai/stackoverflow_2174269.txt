TIMEDIFF(endDate, startDate) outputs in DateTime format, so flat that to timestamp and devide by (60*60) SELECT (UNIX_TIMESTAMP(TIMEDIFF(endDate, startDate))/(60*60)) AS hours_difference FROM tasks Edit: Alternatively, TimestampDiff may also provide a valid solution in more elegant way providing its example: SELECT TIMESTAMPDIFF(MONTH,'2003-02-01','2003-05-01'); And your solution can be: SELECT TIMESTAMPDIFF(HOUR, startDate, endDate) AS hours_different FROM tasks
