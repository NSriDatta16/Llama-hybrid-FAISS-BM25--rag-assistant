SQLite- elegantly setting IDs

I want to use a database like: table wrongdoer (primarykey integer ID, date) table crime (numeric foreign_key_to_wrongdoer, text crime) I want my application (in python) to register a wrongdoer (which should give the entry a unique integer) and register the first crime against him. My idea is rather clumsy: insert into wrongdoer(...) id=cur.execute("select max(ID)") //this is to select the most recent ID cur.execute("insert into crime('"+id+"'"crime+"'")") That is, insert an entry, select its unique key from DB (assuming its the highest number), and then use it for the subsequent queries. Is there a better way to do it?
