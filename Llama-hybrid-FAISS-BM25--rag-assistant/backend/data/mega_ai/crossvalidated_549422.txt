Using multivariate normal likelihood when determinant of covariance matrix is zero

Estimating a multivariate normal (MVN) model requires minimising the negative log-likelihood of MVN (constant term dropped): $$ \ell(X|\mu,\Sigma)=\frac{n}{2}\log|\Sigma|+\frac{1}{2}(X-\mu)^T\Sigma^{-1}(X-\mu) $$ The problem I ran into is the covariance matrix seems to have determinant of zero. I've found a related question which mentioned that a covariance matrix will have zero determinant ( https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2624760/is-the-determinant-of-a-covariance-matrix-always-zero ). So then how are you supposed to use MVN likelihood in estimation? I've found a related question that was answered a long time ago ( Estimating parameters in multivariate classification resulting zero determinant sample covariance matrix ) which contained a solution without justification as to why the proposed solution works. [Edit] A bit of context - I'm using this to train a probabilistic neural network. So MVN log likelihood is my loss function. $N$ in this context is the size of my minibatch and so the covariance matrix is $N \times N$ .
