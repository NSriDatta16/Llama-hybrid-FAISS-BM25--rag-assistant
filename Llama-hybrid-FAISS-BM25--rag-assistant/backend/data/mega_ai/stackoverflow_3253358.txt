Synchronizing MS Access database file

I am developing a database with about 10 tables in it. Basically it will be used in 2 or 3 distant geographical locations (let's call them A,B and C). The desired work flow will be as follows: A,B and C should always have the same database. So when A does any changes he should be able to send those changes over to B and C. Emailing the entire mdb file doesnt make sense since its 15+mb in size. So I would like to send the new additional records and changes only to B and C. The changes B and C make should also be reflected to the other repective parties. How can I do this? I have a few ideas in mind but cont know how to implement it. solution 'A' - export the data tables only into a xls file and email that. But the importing of the tables into the mdb file could be a bit complex right? and the xls is file will also become bigger and bigger with time. solution 'B' - try extract just the changes and email only the new parts? (but how to extract just those) Solution 'C' - find some way of syncing all users onto the same database(storage) location. I was thinking of a front/back end splitting solution by storing the tables in a shared drive in the parent company's server (which is also overseas). But the network connection between locations is very slow, and I dont know how much bandwidth is needed for this. Any recomendations would be most welcome!
