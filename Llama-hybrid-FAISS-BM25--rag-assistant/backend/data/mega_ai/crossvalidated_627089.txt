Weighted average of covariance matrixes

My issue is as follows: In my model there are 4 different states, which each have a calculated probability of happening. I also have calculated covariance matrixes for my variables in each of these states based on historical movement. So I have a covariance matrix for state 1, state 2, state 3, and state 4, plus a probability for each of the states happening. What I am trying to do is calculate an "expected" covariance matrix based on the historical data of the variables and the calculated probabilities of the 4 different states, basically as a weighted average (in the same way you would do with e.g. stock returns). So basically the question is, can you calculate a weighted average for variance and covariance? Can I simply calculate a weighted average across the four covariance matrixes based on the probabilities of the states, or is there something I have to take into account when combining them? Or am I even approaching this completely wrong?
