One typical way is to compute predicted probabilities to investigate marginal effects. You can do this with eg the ggeffects package, see examples here , where you also find examples for interactions. You find a concrete example for logistic regression with interaction between continuous and categorical predictors here . Here is a code-example, marginal effects computed with different packages. The emmeans -package returns marginal effects on the link-scale by default. However, this is probably less intuitive to understand, and in this example I backtransformed the marginal effects. To avoid redundance, I only show one plot. You'll see that all plots produced by this code-example are essentially identical. library(ggeffects) library(ggplot2) library(effects) library(emmeans) library(insight) # create dummy data set.seed(5) data % plot() # with ggeffects-package, using "effect() ggeffect(m, c("var2", "var1")) %>% plot() # with effects-package eff $emmean emmean) eff $asymp.LCL asymp.LCL) eff $asymp.UCL asymp.UCL) ggplot(eff, aes(x = var2, y = emmean, colour = as.factor(var1))) + geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = asymp.LCL, ymax = asymp.UCL, fill = as.factor(var1)), alpha = .1) + geom_line()
