Non-biased User Interface for building training set

I want to use machine learning to detect objects of type A among objects of types B-Z. I require human expertise to initially classify these objects as A, B, C... Z. The individuals who can provide the initial classification are not familiar at all with machine learning and need a simple interface. Unfortunately, type A objects are naturally rare ( The challenge I am facing is to create a user interface that will encourage users to classify approximately the same number of objects of each type, without orienting the user. I have to find a way to push the user to classify all the type A objects they find, but not invent type A objects where there are none. Do you know of any publications that address these challenges? Or examples of similar interfaces to gain inspiration? Thanks in advance!
