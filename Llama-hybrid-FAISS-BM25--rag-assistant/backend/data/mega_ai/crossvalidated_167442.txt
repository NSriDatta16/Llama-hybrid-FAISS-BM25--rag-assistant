It appears to me that your model is possibly over-parameterized or over-differenced or both. This is the result of selecting from a set of fixed models and or the total ignoring of the effect of Pulses/Level Shifts/Seasonal Pulses/Local Time Trends. If you post your original data and your residual series I will test the constancy of the error variance by employing a search scheme along the lines suggested by TSAY http://www.unc.edu/~jbhill/tsay.pdf . Ignored by many researchers except a few since the mainstream time series software developers found it too difficult/technical to implement. Note that if the parameters of the model change over time this is often misdiagnosed as "evidence" of variance change. One needs to carefully diagnose possible Gauussian Violations.
