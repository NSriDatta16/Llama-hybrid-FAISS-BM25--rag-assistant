Using word embeddings / word2vec for classification of entiy

I am trying to used word2vec or word vectors for classification based on entity. For example , I have to classify the following words in a sentence as : " Google gives information about Nigeria " Here , I want to classify Nigeria as location. Suppose I am having good word2vec vectors for each of the word, based on some readings I came to know that, Recurrent Neural Network can be used for this. So, word2vec will capture most locations with a kind of similar word vectors. But my questions are: a.) Suppose a new location is there. lets say, Russia . So, do I need to assign a new word vector for this location ? b.) If my input for training does not have grammatical sense. For example, " Google information Nigeria " . Everything else Nigeria is associated with a non-location label. Will this condition work for find new location in non-grammatical sentences. Please help .
