AUC between estimated lines

Let's say you have a lmer model that test the drug effect of a set of rats with a set of rats (Control): lme1 where Days is the times of the drug applied, lVolume the log(Volume), and Drug a 2-factor level variable (Control and DrugA). Dat0 $log(Volume), Days = .$ Days, Drug = .$Drug)) Then, you look at the estimated marginal means of such interaction model with # average marginal effect of interaction emmeans(lme1, c("Days", "Drug")) Days Drug emmean SE df lower.CL upper.CL 29.5 Control 6.044 0.176 6.04 5.615 6.47 29.5 DrugA 0.617 0.484 49.46 -0.355 1.59 Degrees-of-freedom method: kenward-roger Confidence level used: 0.95 ##Also contrast(emmeans(lme1, ~ Days*Drug), method="pairwise") contrast estimate SE df t.ratio p.value Control 29.5166666666667 - DrugA 29.5166666666667 5.43 0.515 41.7 10.544 % summary(infer = TRUE) Drug Days emmean SE df lower.CL upper.CL t.ratio p.value Control 29.5 6.044 0.176 6.04 5.615 6.47 34.421 My first question here is, how do you interpret these emmeans results in the first part and in the second part how to interpret the p-value estimated? I plotted the emmeans, where the y axis is the lVolume, x axis the Days, red line is the estimated marginal mean for the Control , and the blue line is the estimated marginal mean for the DrugA . My second question here is how can I compute the area under the curve between these two lines ? Is there a way to compute it with the emmeans() in R ? And also how would you interpret these two lines in terms of the drug effect over the Control part? I tried to do: probs But I got this extrange result: Setting levels: control = 1.9505558410977, case = 2.74351132379233 Setting direction: controls Thanks a lot for any hints/help/suggestions to understand this.
