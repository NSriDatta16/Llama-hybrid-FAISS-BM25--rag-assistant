Within one application, no. Services run in session 0, please see here: http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/system/sysinternals/session0changes.mspx Your best bet is to used Named Pipes, see here: http://www.switchonthecode.com/tutorials/dotnet-35-adds-named-pipes-support ....or a memory mapped file, see here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd997372.aspx Within the scope of more-.NETty, you could also use Remoting. You'll need to come up with some interface or protocol to facilitate communication between the service and the management utility. Managing the process start/stop would be easier and you could use the ServiceController class ( MSDN ref ). Hope that helps (and itsn't too discouraging)!
