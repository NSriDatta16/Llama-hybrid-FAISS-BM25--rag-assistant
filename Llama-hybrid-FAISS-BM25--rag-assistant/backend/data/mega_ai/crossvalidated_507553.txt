CNN architecture for 1D time series classification

I would like to use a CNN in order to classify signal data consisting of min. 500 data points into 3 categories. What kind of architecture and design considerations do I need to take into account and how would an architecture look like. Also, what approach could be used to deal with differently sized input?
