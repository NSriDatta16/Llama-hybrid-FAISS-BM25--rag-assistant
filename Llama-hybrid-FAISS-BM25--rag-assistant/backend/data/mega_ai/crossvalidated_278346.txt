how to create ensemble of convolutional neural network for human action recognition

Recently I'm working on an article and in the article author used ensemble of CNNs to implement the technique he proposed. I already know what ensemble of classifiers and CNN are and how to implement them but the term Ensemble of CNN is somehow hard to implement. I've googled the term but there was no proper answer.Is there any tutorial or explanation that could be helpful to understand the term or any python implementation. Appreciate any answer that could be helpful.
