@whuber: negative $R^2$ is possible in a regression model without an intercept. In a regression model with an intercept, the definition of $R^2$ is based on a decomposition of the total sum of squares, i.e. $\sum_i (Y_i - \bar{Y})^2$, $\bar{Y}$ is the average of $Y$, the dependent variable. (Note that $R^2$ it is not defined as the square of the correlation coefficient because the latter is only defined between two variables, therefore, only in the case with one independent variable (and an intercept), the squared correlation coefficient is equal to the $R^2$). The decomposition of the total sum of squares (TSS) goes as follows: $TSS=\sum_i (Y_i - \bar{Y})^2=\sum_i (Y_i - \hat{Y}_i + \hat{Y}_i - \bar{Y})^2$, where $\hat{Y}_i$ are the predictions of the regression model. It follows that $TSS=\sum_i (Y_i - \hat{Y}_i )^2 + \sum_i (\hat{Y}_i - \bar{Y})^2 +2 \sum_i (Y_i - \hat{Y}_i ) (\hat{Y}_i - \bar{Y})$. In a model with an intercept , it can be shown that the third term on the right hand side is zero , but this can not be shown for a model without an intercept (see e.g. D.N. Gujaratti, ''Basic Econometrics'' or W.H. Greene, ''Econometric Analysis''). In the model with an intercept As the third term can be shown to be zero, $TSS=\sum_i (Y_i - \hat{Y}_i )^2 + \sum_i (\hat{Y}_i - \bar{Y})^2$. $\sum_i (Y_i - \hat{Y}_i )^2$ is the sum of the squared residuals (Residual sum of squares (RSS)) and $\sum_i (\hat{Y}_i - \bar{Y})^2$ is the sum of squared differences between the predictions and the average value of Y, this is called the explained sum of squares (ESS). So we find, in a model with an intercept, that $TSS=RSS+ESS$ of that $1=\frac{RSS}{TSS}+\frac{ESS}{TSS}$. And from this they define the $R^2$ as $R^2\stackrel{def}{=}1-\frac{RSS}{TSS}$. By the above, for a model with an intercept, it follows that $R^2=\frac{ESS}{TSS}$. As $ESS$ and $TSS$ are sums of squares, it follows that $R^2 \ge 0$. In the model without an intercept. In the model without an intercept it can not be shown that $\sum_i (Y_i - \hat{Y}_i ) (\hat{Y}_i - \bar{Y})=0$. Therefore $TSS=RSS+ESS+2\sum_i (Y_i - \hat{Y}_i ) (\hat{Y}_i - \bar{Y})$. So $R^2\stackrel{def}{=}1-\frac{RSS}{TSS}=\frac{ESS+2\sum_i (Y_i - \hat{Y}_i ) (\hat{Y}_i - \bar{Y})}{TSS}$. The second term in the numerator can be negative, so the sign of $R^2$ can not be shown to be positive.
