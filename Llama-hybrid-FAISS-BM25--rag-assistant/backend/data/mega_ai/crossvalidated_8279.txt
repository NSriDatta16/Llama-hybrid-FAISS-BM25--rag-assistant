I'm not sure why time series is not being accepted as a solution to your problem since this is equally spaced chronological data . Confounding variables although unknown in nature can be proxied by both ARIMA structure and/or Detectable Interventions. I'm not sure who is not accepting that time series analysis is appropriate so we disagree with that advice. Time series methods are not just pure autoregressive in form but easily extend to Polynomial Distributed Lags or ADL in user-specified supporting series such as the number of reported cases. In my opinion this is an example of a pooled cross-sectional time series problem. Gregory Chow developed a test for the constancy of parameters across groups in 1960 ; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chow_test http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_for_structural_change In this case, the test needs to be front-ended with Outlier Detection to ensure a Gaussian set of errors i.e. no proven anomalous data or in other words the error process can't be proven to be Non-Gaussian within each state. X1 is the number of cases and Y is the number of deaths. X2 is the empirically identified point of anomaly ;(2009 .. period 6 for State1 and 2004 .. period 1 for State2 . Outlier Detection led to identifying one anomalous data point for each state reflecting some unknown background variable thus yielding a more robust estimate of the mortality rates. Analysis of State1 State1 Y(T) = -.65649 +[X1(T)][.0046)] CASES +[X2(T)][-1.3608)] PULSE6 I~P00006STATE1 + [A(T)] Suggesting an unusually low mortality rate for 2009 Analysis of State2 State2 Y(T) = 123.55 +[X1(T)][(+ .0468)] CASES +[X2(T)][(+ 35.7590)] PULSE1 I~P00001STATE2 + [A(T)] Suggesting an unusually high mortality rate for 2004 This leads to estimating two cleansed data points STATE YEAR Y OBSERVED Y ADJUSTED STATE1 2009 3 4.36 STATE2 2004 254 218.24 Replacing these two observed possibly errant values possibly due to some unspecified concomitant factor (“lurking Variable”) one computes a rate of.0046 for STATE1 and .0468 for STATE2. The Chow Test for constancy of parameters across groups easily yields a rejection of the null hypothesis of equal coefficients, thus the states can be said to have significantly different mortality rates. Note that even though the “experiment was not a controlled one” it is possible to identify deterministic effects reflecting some uncontrolled input which untreated can distort the analysis. P.S. I am fully aware that we can’t have 4.36 or 218.24 mortalities in real life !
