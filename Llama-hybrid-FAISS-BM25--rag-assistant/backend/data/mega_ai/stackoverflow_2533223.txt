AS3 How do I stop sound and video when clicking a menu button to go to another frame?

I have a problem with my slideshow script. I have embedding a flash video file into my website with this slideshow called monoslideshow, and everything seems to work perfectly. Trouble is, when I am clicking on another menu button that should jump to another frame, it still keeps playing the video and sound while displaying the new menu data. So I will probably need some code that stops the video instantly, when another menu button is clicked. But how do I write it and where do I put it? Here is my actionscript for the video file to show: var loaderSlide:Loader = new Loader(); var monoslideshow:Object; loaderSlide.contentLoaderInfo.addEventListener(Event.COMPLETE, onLoadComplete); addChild(loaderSlide); loaderSlide.load(new URLRequest("monoslideshow.swf")); function onLoadComplete(event:Event):void { monoslideshow = event.target.content; monoslideshow.showLogo = false; monoslideshow.setViewport(new Rectangle(730, 20, 700, 660)); var xml:XML = monoslideshow.loadXML(xml); } It would be great to get a solution to this problem, otherwise my website will be kinda messy ;) THANK YOU!!
