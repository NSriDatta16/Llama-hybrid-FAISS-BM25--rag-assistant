So you asked specifically "how does Zappos.com do this". Here is the answer from our Search team. An alternative idea for your issue would be using a search index such as solr. Basically, the way these work is you load your data set into the system and it does a huge amount of indexing. My projects include product catalogs with 200+ data points for each of the 140k products. The average return time is less than 20ms. The search indexing system I would recommend is Solr which is based on lucene. Both of these projects are open source and free to use. Solr fits perfectly for your described use case in that it can actually do all of those things all in one query. You can use facets (essentially group by in sql) to return the list of different data values for all applicable results. In the case of keywords it also would allow you to search across multiple fields in one query without performance degradation.
