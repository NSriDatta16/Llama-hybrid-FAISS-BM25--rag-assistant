The reason why you get the wrong answer is because the way the calculation has been described in the book is a little confusing. The book says "imagine a string of digits of length $N$". This means a long string of digits, not just a string of $10$ digits. Imagine a long string of digits from the new language. On average, in $19$ digits from this sequence, you have $10$ zeros and $1$ of each of the other numbers, because $0$ occurs ten times as often as each of the other digits. Imagine dividing your long sequence into blocks of length $19$. Say there are $M$ of these blocks. Then the perplexity is $$\left(\left(\frac{10}{19}\right)^{10M}\left(\frac{1}{19}\right)^{9M}\right)^{-1/19M}$$ and just like in the example in the book, the $M$'s cancel, so the perplexity is: $$\left(\left(\frac{10}{19}\right)^{10}\left(\frac{1}{19}\right)^{9}\right)^{-1/19}$$
