class OLSR : public Agent You class OLSR is derived from some class 'Agent' (which I don't know what it is). I assume that is not one of those classes derived from 'Handle' (since it is not shown in the diagram). Since 'OLSR' is not derived from 'Handle', dynamic_cast of 'Handle' to 'OLSR' fails. You can do dynamic_cast from polymorphic Base to Derived only and not to unrelated classes.
