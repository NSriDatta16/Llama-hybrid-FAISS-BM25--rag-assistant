It really depends how worried you are about locking out legitimate users incorrectly. You can keep track of the IP addresses that they log in using, and some other identifiers like their user-agent string, and then look for discrepancies. So if someone normally logs in from an IP owned by Verizon using Firefox, and then suddenly they log in from one in Brazil using Internet Explorer, that might be someone sharing their login details. But, it also might be the same user who just took a trip to Brazil and is using their uncle's computer. How are you going to tell?
