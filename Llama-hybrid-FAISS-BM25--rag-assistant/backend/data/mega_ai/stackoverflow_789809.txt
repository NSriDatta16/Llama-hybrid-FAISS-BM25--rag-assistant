Been thinking this over, and seems like my two options are serialize a hash to a blob in the DB, or store it elsewhere. I don't have FS access, but could use S3. So I suppose I've changed my question. For storing 100kb objects that are pretty much read-only after creation, any feedback on general principles of S3 vs blob storage? I think this thread probably covers what i'm looking for for now!
