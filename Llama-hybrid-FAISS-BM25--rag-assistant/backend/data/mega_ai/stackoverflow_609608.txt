Casting from IEnumerable to IEnumerable

Recently I found a very surprising behavior in c#. I had a method which takes IEnumerable as a parameter and i was passing IEnumerable but it's not possible. While in c# everything can be upcast to Object than why this is not possible? It's totally confusing for me. Please someone clear me on this issue.
