Since the source list in this case is really a "scope" and not a flat list of nothing but instances of some "LibraryItem" entity, I think it's easier to implement this the "old fashioned" way (ie, table data source protocol). This gives you precise control over grouping, how/when to mix "static" items (like "Library" and "Music", and "Movies", "Playlists") with items from your store (like the individual Playlist items under the "Playlists" section). It's also a little easier to deal with drag and drop, in my opinion, which is key when preventing a Playlist item from being dropped upon your "Movies" group.
