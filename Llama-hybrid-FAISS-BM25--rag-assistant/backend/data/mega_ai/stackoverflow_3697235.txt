Windows Programming

recently, i began to read about windows programming, and i thought i could start with .NET since it is the "FUTURE" but as i happen to figure out, it is just like a fancy wrapper around COM, COM+, AUTOMATION and the rest of MICROSOFT technologies, so i wanna know if it is essential for any microsoft developer to get aquainted with these techs, i would also appreciate someone mentioning a some good books on the subjects...
