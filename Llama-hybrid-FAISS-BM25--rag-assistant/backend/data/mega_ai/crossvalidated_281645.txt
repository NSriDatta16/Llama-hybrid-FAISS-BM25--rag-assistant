I am not a specialist of logistic regression, but I would say that you want to use multinomial because of your discrete dependent variable. A linear regression could output coefficients that can be extrapolated out of the possible boundaries of your dependent variable (i.e an increase of independent variable would lead to a dependent variable out of your boundary for the given regression coefficient). The multinomial regression will gives the different probabilities for the differents outcomes of your dependent variable (i.e the coefficient of your regression will give you how they increase their probability to give a better score, without the score beeing out of bounds).
