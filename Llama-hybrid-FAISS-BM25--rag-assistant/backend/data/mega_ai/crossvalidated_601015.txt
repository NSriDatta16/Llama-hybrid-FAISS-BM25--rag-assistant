Examining the statistical difference between two time series

I am working on a dataset that is unfortunately messy. The data collection period covers from 2019 to 2022 but not every participant has data in all the data collection intervals in this period. In the beginning, the data was gathered monthly but towards the end, it is collected weekly. It kind of seems each subject has reporting periods that is unique to them and was not the same with other subjects! I have grouped subjects into three larger groups (G1, G2, and G3) based on their specialties and have used Tableau and a date scaffold to create the following plots on three of the metrics that I have to report. The date scaffold is very similar to the idea presented here: https://tarsolutions.co.uk/blog/tableau-scaffolding-dates-calculating-deferred-revenue/ Here is my question: I can see that the line plot for example for "Time in Notes per Appointment" for G1 is higher than that of G2 and that is higher than G3. What sort of analysis should I use to test the statistical significance of diff. between them? I am not sure if I have to treat it as time series or not and use something like ANOVA. What do you smart people think about this?
