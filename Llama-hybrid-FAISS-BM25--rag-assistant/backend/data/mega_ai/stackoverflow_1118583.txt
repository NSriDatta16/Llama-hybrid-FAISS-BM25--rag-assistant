string.Format() does not handle { and } in the format string. You need to replace { with {{ and } with }} everywhere in your template.html file. Except for the single place where you use the {0} placeholder. Not very elegant. Instead, consider using a template engine. See http://csharp-source.net/open-source/template-engines for some suggestions. The next-best solution is to use regexes (with MatchEvaluator) or string.Replace(), as suggested by other answers. Edit: Here's an example using the StringTemplate template engine: StringTemplate htmlpage = new StringTemplate(File.ReadAllText("template.html")); htmlpage.SetAttribute("content", "video.wmv"); Console.WriteLine(htmlpage.ToString()); Change a single line in your template.html file: from: to: When the template engine encounters $content$ in the template, it replaces it with the value of the 'content' attribute that you set using code. Using StringTemplate, you can do simple looping and conditionals within your template. See the documentation .
