What is your favorite/recommended project structure and file structure for Unit Testing using Boost?

I have not used Unit Testing so far, and I intend to adopt this procedure. I was impressed by TDD and certainly want to give it a try - I'm almost sure it's the way to go. Boost looks like a good choice, mainly because it's being maintained. With that said, how should I go about implementing a working and elegant file-structure and project-structure ? I am using VS 2005 in Win XP. I have been googling about this and was more confused than enlightened.
