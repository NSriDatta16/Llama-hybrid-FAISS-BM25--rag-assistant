You need to have some idea of expected variation or distribution, if you want to be able to exclude certain (higher) instances of variation as erroneous. For instance, if you can approximate the distribution of the "average times" result to a normal (Gaussian) distribution, then you can do what ojblass suggested and exclude those results that exhibit a variation that is greater than some multiple of the standard deviation (which can be calculated on the fly alongside your running average). If you wanted to exclude results that have a 99.75 (or so) percent chance of being erroneous, exclude those that vary more than 3 standard deviations from the mean. If you only want 95% certainty, exclude those that vary more than 2 standard deviations and so on. I'm sure a little bit of googling for "standard deviation" or "gaussian distribution" will help you. Of course, this assumes that you expect a normal distribution of results. You might not. In which case, the first step would be to guess at what distribution you expect.
