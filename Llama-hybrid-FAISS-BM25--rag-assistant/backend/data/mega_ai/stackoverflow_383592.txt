I'd try to do by introducing an object holding Map and Map. Adding Strings to that object (or maybe having them created from said object) will assign them an Integer value. Requesting a Integer value for a String already registered will return the same value. Drawbacks: Different launches will yield different Integers for the same String, depending on order unless you somehow persist the whole thing. Also, it's not very object oriented and requires a special object to create/register a String. Plus side: It's quite similar to internalizing Strings and easily understandable. (Also, you asked for an easy, not elegant way.) For the more general case, you might create a high level subclass of Object, introduce a "integerize" method there and extend every single class from that. I think, however, that road leads to tears.
