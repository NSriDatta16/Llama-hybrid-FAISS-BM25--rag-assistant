Statistical Significance of Time Series Data pre and post intervention

I am currently working on data in which I have to see the rate of entry of children to a foster home is statistically significant or not before and after a welfare program was implemented. I got the number of entries to the foster home from 2014-2017 (monthly entries) and intervention was implemented in June 2016. Can someone suggest the method to statistically compare the entry rate.
