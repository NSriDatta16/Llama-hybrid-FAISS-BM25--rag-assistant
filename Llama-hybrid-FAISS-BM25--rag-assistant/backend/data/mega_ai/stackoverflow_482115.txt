With JavaScript, can I change the Z index/layer of an SVG element?

Let's say I have a couple composite shapes ( ). I want to be able to click and drag them, but I want the one I happen to be dragging at the moment to be on TOP of the other one in the Z order, so that if I drag it over the OTHER one, the other one should be eclipsed.
