(This sounds like one of those problems which is probably fixable in 20 seconds if I stood over your shoulder. Or not. Since that's not possible, let's do some background first:) When you right-click on a field and see Text: , that means it's just a Text Object which may or may not display data from the database (if you just roll your mouse over it, it should say Text Object ). When you want a report to say something generic like "Hello, my name is", this is how you'd do it. But you can also drag & drop data fields into it as well. The other data fields that say 'Field:table1.columnname' when you right-click are indeed pulled (almost) directly from the database Try this: Go into your Field Explorer (If it's not open already, from the menu bar, choose View -> Field Explorer ). Check the Field Type of your field of interest. If it's a number field, then that's how it's being pulled from the database, which is good. Try deleting the original field in the report and drag&dropping your field directly from the field explorer. Preview the report. Right click to Format Field . There, you'll see display options to add/remove decimals, insert currency symbols, etc. That's enough for now. Let us know how it goes.
