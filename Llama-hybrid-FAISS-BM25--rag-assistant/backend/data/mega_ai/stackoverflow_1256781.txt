From your description, "How do I get the touch logic to disallow other cards from being picked up by a dragging finger?" it seems as though your finger is like a magnet picking up cards as you drag it along?!? I haven't run into that, specifically, but by putting the event handling into your card class you can have each card decide whether it should respond to the touch or to pass it up its responder chain to another one that does. I think you should review the section of the iPhone Application Programming Guide on Event Handling. Specifically the chapter on Responder Objects and the Responder Chain .
