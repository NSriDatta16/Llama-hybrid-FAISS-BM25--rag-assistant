Remove the () at the end of the function body. You wrote var storageLocker = function(...) { ... }() , which creates an anonymous function, calls it , and assigns the result to storageLocker . It's equivalent to function anonymous(...) { ... }; var storageLocker = anonymous(); Since the function doesn't return anything, storageLocker ends up being undefined , and is not a function.
