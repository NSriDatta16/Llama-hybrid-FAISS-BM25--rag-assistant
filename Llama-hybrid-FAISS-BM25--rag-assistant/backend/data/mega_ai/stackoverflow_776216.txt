Flash: Antialiasing characters on dynamic textfields without embedding fonts, in japanese

I'm trying to achieve antialiasing on dynamic textfields in flash on a Japanese site. The content of these textfields is not fixed data. I don't have the option to embed the fonts, since embeddeding all characters will result in a very heavy swf file(3000kb+ just for the fonts). This is due to the fact that there's a large number of unique characters in japanese(literally thousands). Basically, any flash site using dynamic textfields faces the same choice: keep the filesize down and use only Device Fonts (without antialiasing) force a 3mb+ font download to the user to display smooth antialiased fonts. I've asked around to some japanese friends, and they said "Shoganai!" (translation: "can't be helped"). Anybody have ideas? ps: unfortunately, silverlight is not an option either.
