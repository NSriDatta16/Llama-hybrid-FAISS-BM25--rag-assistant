You can see the problem by DeMorgans Laws for negation !( A || B ) === (!A && !B) The solution you give is impossible because there is no way for both statements to be false, because that would imply the string is equivalent to both the compared strings. The only way the else block would be hit is if both were false (because of the OR statement).
