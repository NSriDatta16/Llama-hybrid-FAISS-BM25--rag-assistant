We've decided to use Team Build as the 'primary' source of continuous integration running the gated checkings, assessing quality, providing links to tasks etc. In addition we will have TeamCity running 'on the side' on a Mono box which will checkout source from the TFS source repository and build it. A hybrid approach leveraging the benefits of both systems without having to 'couple' them together with scripts etc.
