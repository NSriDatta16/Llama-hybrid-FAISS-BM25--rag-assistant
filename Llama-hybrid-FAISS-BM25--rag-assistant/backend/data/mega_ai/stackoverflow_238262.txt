I do Java development in Eclipse. Here are some of the plug ins I find useful: Mylyn - hides project elements not relevant to the current context. eUML2 - UML editor. FindBugs - Static analysis tool to find common bugs in Java. Crap4J - Another static analysis tool. EclEmma - Code coverage plug-in for unit tests. Edit: I forgot one: Disable the spellchecker. :)
