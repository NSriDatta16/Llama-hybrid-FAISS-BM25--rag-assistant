One-hot encoding is commonly used in pre-processing data as inputs to machine learning algorithms. For factors with more than 2 levels, this involves creating one or more dummy variables. If a factor has only 2 levels then no dummy variables are needed - indeed it may be already one-hot encoded. Just check the levels (for example in R, use levels(varname) ). If they are not 0 and 1, then just change them to 0 and 1 and you should be good to go. An example in R: > x length(x) [1] 6 > x [1] alpha beta alpha beta alpha beta Levels: alpha beta > levels(x) x [1] 0 1 0 1 0 1 Levels: 0 1 You also mentioned factors with only 1 level. Such factors are not variables and could be removed from the dataset (as they are constants and will not affect predictions), but if it were me I would investigate why a single-factor variable is there in the first place.
