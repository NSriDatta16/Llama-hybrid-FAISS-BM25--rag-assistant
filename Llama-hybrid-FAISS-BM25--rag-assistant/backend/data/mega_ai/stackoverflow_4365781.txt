Updates: DLL (Dynamic Link Library) is a code component (some what like the Beans in Java). DLLs contains the methods or functions or routines or whatever you call those code fragments. And an API is an interface between an application and that DLL. Most of the time DLLs are used to provide services to other applications, these DLLs are called Server DLLs and if a DLL is requesting some service by using the API call or its dynamic invocation then it is said to be the Client DLL. So simple think, APIs are nothing but the methods or functions which are accessible from outside of that DLL. Hope you got the idea now.
