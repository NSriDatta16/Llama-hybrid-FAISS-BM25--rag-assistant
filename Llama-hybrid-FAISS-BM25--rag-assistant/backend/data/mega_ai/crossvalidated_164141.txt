Well, that sounds for me as an instance of a text classification problem. As far as I understand, the classes in your scenario represent parts that can/sould be replaced, correct? If yes, you first should figure out, which features are discriminative enough in order to distinguish among the 56 possible classes. In machine learning terms, this process is called feature selection/extraction and can be automated (to some degree). Note, that before you can apply feature selection/extraction you should apply an appropriate preprocessing on your data. Afterwards you can generate feature vectors and feed your classifier (e.g. $k$-NN, MaxEnt, SVM, Naive Bayes, etc.). Using a classifier, however, requires a training set, which should be representative enough. So i think you should start here first...
