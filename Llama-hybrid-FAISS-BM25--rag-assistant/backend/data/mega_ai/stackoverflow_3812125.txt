How do I create an application that works on both the Windows 7 Phone and IPhone?

It is clear that Mono Touch is part of the solution as it allows C# code to run on the IPhone, however Mono Touch wraps the IPhone API so does not provide a common API. Another option would be a jave-script toolkit that work on both and provided on-line data storage. However what real life experience do people have?
