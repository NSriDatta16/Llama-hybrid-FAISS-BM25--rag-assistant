While encryption in the database is fine (and necessary to protect backups and hard drives from a physical attack or an attack at the OS), since your application has to collect the data and send it to the database, you will need to at least consider several aspects of your application: Use SSL to protect data from the web browser to your web site (almost certainly necessary) Encrypt your connections from the application to the database (may not be necessary if you are running on the same box or if your servers have communication relatively controlled) Ensure that your application is not vulnerable to exposing data - either through design or implementation defects or injection attacks. Remember, if your application needs to display data to the client, then the database is going to return that to the app and then the user at some point. If the app is broken, that data can leak out, regardless of the fact that the data is encrypted in storage and in the channels from browser to app and app to database. Encrypting data yourself within a database column is almost always pointless since your app will have to decrypt the data before it can be used - the database can do very little with it. And then your app will need to have some kind of key management.
