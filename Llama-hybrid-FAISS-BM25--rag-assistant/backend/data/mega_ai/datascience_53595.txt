Machine learning model using keywords for binary decision

I have a some experience from Uni with convolutional NN and edge detection, but haven't much explored the other types of machine learning models. I was wondering if there might be one that is suited for being able to use certain, textual keywords (for example, words that were parsed from internet news sources) in order to arrive at some binary, yes/no decision?
