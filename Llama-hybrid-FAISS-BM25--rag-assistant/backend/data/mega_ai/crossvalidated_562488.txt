I'm turning my comments into an answer. Because this question shows up in the introductory natural language processing class I TA, I'm answering in the style for a self-study question. I hope any other answerers will respect this and do the same. The notation is tripping you up here. You need to be extremely explicit about what $p(a \mid b)$ means. Specifically, you need to clearly state what the random variables involved are: $P(A = a \mid B = b)$ ; clearly identify $A$ and $B$ . By abbreviating the notation, you've obfuscated a crucial distinction. You're on the right track, and you need to go one step farther: What are the random variables? Take a look starting at slide 20 of these course notes on probability from the NLP class at Johns Hopkins. A final hint: consider representing the sentence as a sequence of random variates. Now, the probability distribution over sentences is a joint distribution: $$ P(X_1, X_2, X_3, X_4, \ldots) \text{.} $$ How can we tie this to the $P(\text{"a"})$ and $P(\text{"quick"} \mid \text{"a"})$ values you wrote above, using the hint I gave earlier in my answer?
