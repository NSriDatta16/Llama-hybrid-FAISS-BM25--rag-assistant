How to investigate annual time series data?

I have annual time series data from 2000 to 2020. The brand has introduced new marketing camping in 2010 and I want to investigate the impact of this policy, that's why I am trying to explore the trend. In case of monthly data I would decompose it into seasonality and trend components but I only have annual data and that's an issue. R Code: library(forecast) year Now I want to obtain Stochastic and deterministic trends as given on this link . however when I apply it there is ARIMA(0,0,0) instead of ARIMA(2,0,0) . #Apply Stochastic trend trend The same happens in case of a deterministic trend, there is ARIMA(0,1,0) instead of ARIMA(0,1,1) and consequently output is different. #Apply deterministic trend (fit2 Could you explain why it happens? Also, which algorithm/technique/method could you suggest (besides Moving-Average) in order to investigate the impact of the campaign? I am open to discussion.
