"Dynamic" display of floats?

I'm trying to write an app for iphone in ObjectiveC. I need to display a statustext that tells the user the value of a few variables. These values are changeable by dragging a marker with your finger in a diagram. The problem I have is that the value range is quite wide. If you want to set values between 0 and 1 you probably want 3 decimals (like 0.345). But if the range is 0 to 10000, you don't need any decimals at all. I now have about 20 diffrent messages that can be displayed and if I want all of them to display values "dynamically" there is going to be a lot of code like this: float start,stop; // Defined earlier... switch ( numberOfDecimals ) { case 0: lblStatus.text = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"Start: %.0f Stop :%.0f", start, stop]; break; case 1: lblStatus.text = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"Start: %.1f Stop :%.1f", start, stop]; break; case 2: lblStatus.text = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"Start: %.2f Stop :%.2f", start, stop]; break; default: break; } Is there not a better way to do it?
