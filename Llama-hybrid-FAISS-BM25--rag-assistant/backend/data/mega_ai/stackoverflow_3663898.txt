Representing a multi-select field for weekdays in a Django model

I've been searching for an elegant way to represent a multi-select weekday field (Mon, Tues, Wed...) in a Django model. I was initially thinking of going integer field using bitwise math but I am not sure if this would be the way to go. This would be a mostly-read field. I would want the Queryset method to be something like Entry.objects.get(weekdays__contains=MONDAY) Where MONDAY would be a constant. Perhaps someone could come up with a better solution? Or maybe someone has done something similar and has some example code they could contribute?
