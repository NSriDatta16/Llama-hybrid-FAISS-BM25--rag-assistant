The C is the semantic action for reducing the stack when the syntax is read in. These actions are in C because the definition is intended for Bison/Yacc which produces a C source file. If you want to use Happy, port the BNF to the Happy definition syntax and write your semantics in Haskell. Just the tip of the iceberg for getting anything useful however. If you don't have a copy already, invest in the Dragon Book (Compilers: Principles, Techniques & tools by Aho, Lam, Sethi, Ullman - Pearson)
