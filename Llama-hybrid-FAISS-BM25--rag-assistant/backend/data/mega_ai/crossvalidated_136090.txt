No, you do not supply a correlation matrix to prcomp() . Instead, you supply the data and if you want to do PCA on the correlation matrix you also pass scale = TRUE , which centres and standardises the variables to zero mean and unit variance. To draw the data on the first two PCs, you were right to query the use of $rotation ; $x should be used for this. Yes, the "loadings" are the $rotation component.
