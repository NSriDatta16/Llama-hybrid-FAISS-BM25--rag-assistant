Emacs c-mode fill-paragraph with Doxygen Comments

I have a question that is very similar to Getting Emacs fill-paragraph to play nice with javadoc-like comments , but I wasn't sure if I would get many answers in a year old thread. Anyhow, I have C code that has some Doxygen comments that look like the following: /** * Description * * @param[in,out] var1 : * @param[in,out] var2 : */ Now, when I use M-q in emacs, I want the following: /** * Description * * @param[in,out] var1 : * @param[in,out] var2 : */ But, current I get the following: /** * Description * * @param[in,out] var1 : @param[in,out] var2 : */ Doing some research, it looked like I needed to set the paragraph-start variable in emacs to recognize the "@param." I found another question on stack overflow ( Getting Emacs fill-paragraph to play nice with javadoc-like comments ), that had a sample regular expression. I modified it a bit to fit my requirements, and I tested it inside of Search->Regex Forward, and it highlighted each @param sentence correctly. I used the following regular expression "^\s-*\*\s-*\(@param\).*$" So, I tried setting the given regular expression as my paragraph-start (with the added \'s required for the elisp syntax) in my .emacs file. When I opened a new emacs window and tried out the M-q, the same error was occurring. Is there something I am missing? Is M-q used differently in c-mode? Should I check my .emacs file for something that may be causing an error here? Any help would be appreciated. Thanks, Ryan
