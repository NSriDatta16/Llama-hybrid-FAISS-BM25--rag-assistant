If you were to leverage a PHP file then utilizing APC or some other opcode cache will mitigate performance concerns as your PHP files will only be loaded each time the file changes. However, as others have noted, a database is the best place to store this stuff as it is much easier to maintain (this should be your priority to begin with). Having ensured ease of maintenance and a working application, should you require a performance boost then generally accepted practice would be to cache this static data in an in-memory key/value store such as memcached . This will give you rapid access to your static values (for most requests).
