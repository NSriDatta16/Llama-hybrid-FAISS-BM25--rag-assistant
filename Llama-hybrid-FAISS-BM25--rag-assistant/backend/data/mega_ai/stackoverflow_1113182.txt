You can discover quick facts about your game interface by doing some hallway testing ; just find some random people, ask them to try the game, and watch them playing (you can record the desktop, or record the player from the back). As @AlbertoPL said, you may want to find some dedicated players, for advanced feedback on learning curve , how addictive it is, how the game is behaving in the long run , how rewarding it is, and how it may be abused. Don't forget to have an issue tracking system installed and easy to use; you can use it to track defects, ideas, and general feedback. I recommend trac , because it has a wiki and it's easy to use. Great tips @Midpoint for setting up a community.
