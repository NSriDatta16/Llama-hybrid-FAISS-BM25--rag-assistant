Outlier Detection giving almost all training points as outliers

I am trying to run an outlier detection algorithm using python and I have used OneClassSVM and Isolation Forest on a dataset of about 30 points with 5 outliers. I have trained on the 25 points and using it for remaining 5 points but I am getting almost all training points as outliers and also all the 5 points are outliers as well, of course. Can someone help me debug what might be going wrong?
