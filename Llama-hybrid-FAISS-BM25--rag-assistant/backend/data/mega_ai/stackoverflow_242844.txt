In Java, all object variables are references. So Foo myFoo = new Foo(); Foo anotherFoo = myFoo; means that both variables are referring to the same object, not to two separate copies. Likewise, when you put an object in a Collection , you are only storing a reference to the object. Therefore using ArrayList or similar is the correct way to have an automatically expanding piece of storage.
