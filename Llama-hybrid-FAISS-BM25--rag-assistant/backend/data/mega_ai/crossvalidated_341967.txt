There are several questions here; taking them in order, Exponential smoothing, as you have written it out, does not have a trend term. $m_t$ is the estimated level of the series at time $t$, not the "exponential smoothing trend". Since the $x_t$ are assumed to have no trend in the simple exponential smoothing formulation, the forecast for all periods $t+1, \dots, t+k$ is just equal to the estimated level at time $t$, namely, $m_t$. Note that $m_{t+1}$ is the estimated level after you have seen $x_{t+1}$; since, as you note, you haven't seen it yet at time $t$, it should be clear that you don't use it when forecasting. If you do use the trend version of exponential smoothing, at time $t$ you'll have formed estimates of the level $m_t$ and the trend, label it $b_t$. You'll predict the level at time $t+k$ by $m_t + kb_t$. The rule (of thumb) about not using regression to predict outside the interval of observation refers to the range of values of $x$, not the range of values of $t$. To see the difference, consider predicting ice cream sales as a function of time of year (let's ignore population growth and other factors for our example.) We'd probably model $x = $ "time of year" using a sine, shifted appropriately. Every year, the week with January 7th in it would have a value of $3\pi/2$ (as that is the average minimum sales week of the year for ice cream), and the fact that it is a future observation, i.e, the index $t$ on $x_t$ is different than any we've observed in the past, doesn't mean we can't expect our prediction to be reasonably accurate (given a fair amount of data.) ETA: Double exponential smoothing is a variant of exponential smoothing that estimates trend as well. Let's define the trend estimate at time $t$ as $b_t$, and the level estimate at time $t$ as $m_t$. At each time period, we'll form a level estimate and a trend estimate; for prediction, we'll predict the level at time $t+k$ by $m_t + kb_t$. The updating equations are: $$m_t = \alpha x_t + (1-\alpha)(m_{t-1}+b_{t-1})$$ $$b_t = \beta(m_t - m_{t-1}) + (1-\beta)b_{t-1}$$
