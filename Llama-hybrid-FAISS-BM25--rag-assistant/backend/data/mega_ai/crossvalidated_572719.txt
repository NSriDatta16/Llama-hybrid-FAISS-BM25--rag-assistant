Can you include interactions with the treatment variable as a covariate in linear regression?

I'm quite new to regression modelling. I'm trying to predict the average treatment effect of a weight loss intervention by comparing outcomes in control and treated groups. The model currently includes gender, age, age-squared, and treatment as covariates. But being male predicts better outcomes in the treated group and worse outcomes in controls. Adding an interaction term between gender and treatment improves model fit (about 20 AIC points) and the term is significant. But I'm not sure if it makes sense to do that, if the goal is to assess the effect of the treatment. I can't immediately think why it would be a problem, but I haven't seen it done before either.
