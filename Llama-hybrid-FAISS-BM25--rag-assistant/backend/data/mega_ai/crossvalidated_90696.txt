I am afraid this will not fully answer your question, but I would still like to write it to give you some keywords and mainly hoping to sparkle further discussion. I will be happy if anybody provides a better answer. Having said that, I disagree with what @whuber wrote in the comments above ( "in no circumstances does a Fourier basis act like PCA" etc.). I think you are right in observing that PCA on smooth more-or-less-translation-invariant signals (or images) results in Fourier-like components. This is a real effect and it must have an explanation. Mathematically, the covariance matrix with "diagonal structure" that you describe in your question is called Toeplitz matrix . Toeplitz matrices have many nice properties, one of them being that in the limit of infinite dimension (Toeplitz operator) the eigenvectors are sines and cosines with increasing frequencies. I think what you are asking to is to provide an intuitive explanation of this fact. I can't. Of course sines and cosines are also eigenvectors of the Fourier operator, as you rightly observe. Which means that Toeplitz and Fourier operators are closely related. I would be very happy if somebody more savvy in math would explain how it works (I strongly suspect that with the correct perspective it becomes almost trivial). Finally, if you are interested in a non-technical description of this phenomenon, I can recommend this paper Interpreting principal component analyses of spatial population genetic variation from Nature Genetics. The authors remark that "sinusoidal mathematical artifacts ... arise generally when PCA is applied to spatial data" and give some nice examples.
