Transforming prior distribution in inference for binomial N parameter

I'm struggling with question 6 in the Exercises to Chapter 3 (page 80) of Bayesian Data Analysis by Andrew Gelman. http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/BDA3.pdf We have data Y modeled as independent binomial data, with both $N$ and $θ$ unknown, as per Raftery's 1988 paper "Inference for the binomial N parameter: A hierarchical Bayes approach". $Y∼Bin(N,θ)$ and $N∼Poisson(μ)$ , where $λ=μθ$ The (noninformative) prior distribution of $λ,θ$ is $p(λ,θ) \propto λ^{-1}$ The question 6(a) asks you to transform to determine $p(N,θ)$ . It's similar to the following question, but I haven't been able to use that to get to the answer. Bayesian Aproach: Infering the N and $\theta$ values from a binomial distribution
