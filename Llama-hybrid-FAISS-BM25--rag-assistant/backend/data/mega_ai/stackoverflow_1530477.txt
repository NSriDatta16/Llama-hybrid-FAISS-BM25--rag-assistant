Passing data from one database to another database table

I want to take a backup of my Access database Pragmatically. And After taking all data in backup i want to delete data from source database. ( So that it will not take much time while querying and filtering through application.) The source database name is Data.mdb The destination database name is Backup.mdb Both are protected by same password. For these purpose i am writing a query in C# like this. string conString = "Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0 ;Data Source=Backup.mdb;Jet OLEDB:Database Password=12345"; OleDbConnection dbconn = new OleDbConnection(); OleDbDataAdapter dAdapter = new OleDbDataAdapter(); OleDbCommand dbcommand = new OleDbCommand(); try { if (dbconn.State == ConnectionState.Closed) dbconn.Open(); string selQuery = "INSERT INTO [Bill_Master] SELECT * FROM [MS Access;DATABASE="+ "\\Data.mdb" + "; Jet OLEDB:Database Password=12345;].[Bill_Master]"; dbcommand.CommandText = selQuery; dbcommand.CommandType = CommandType.Text; dbcommand.Connection = dbconn; int result = dbcommand.ExecuteNonQuery(); } catch(Exception ex) {} Everything goes fine if i try with without password database file. I think error in passing password on query statement. I am trying to execute through access query but it is saying "Invalid argument". Please is there any other programing logic for doing that.
