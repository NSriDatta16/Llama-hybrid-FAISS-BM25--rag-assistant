One possible approach might be to regard the number of exceedances as a Poisson process $N(t)$ with rate $\lambda$, and the sizes of the exceedances as identically distributed random variables $\{ X_i \}_{i=1}^{\infty}$ with mean $\mu$ that are independent of $N(t)$. You could then use the expected sum as your prediction. For $t > 0$ this would look like \begin{align} \text{E} \left ( \sum_{i=1}^{N(t)} X_i \right ) &= \text{E} \left [ \text{E} \left ( \sum_{i=1}^{N(t)} X_i \mid N(t) \right ) \right ] \\ &= \text{E} \left [ N(t) \text{E} (X_1) \right ] \\ &= \mu \lambda t. \end{align} So what you require are estimates for $\mu$ and $\lambda$. $\mu$ can be estimated using a simple average of exceedances, and to estimate $\lambda$ you would take the total number of exceedances in your sample and divide by $100$.
