how "most visited" works in applications

In the home page of my app, I try to implement something like "most visited websites" that Chrome & Safari have in their home pages. The major diff being that instead of websites the app will show Objects from the DB (Persons,Organizations,Orders, Invoices etc). It should work like automatic bookmarking . There is already a "Recently Viewed" table in the DB (InstanceId, UserId, LastVisitDate). I could expand it with (NumberOfVisits) attribute, but that would not permit me to weight more recent visits over old. One idea I'm working on is to weight the NumberOfVisits based on the the LastVisitDate. When the user visits the instance again, I weight down the existing NumberOfVisits before adding the new Visit. Has anyone implemented such a system before? Do you know how Safari & Chrome do it in the home page?
