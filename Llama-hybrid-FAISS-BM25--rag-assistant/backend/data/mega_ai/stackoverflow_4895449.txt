Glassfish 3 EJB app deployment advice?

For a variety of unfortunate management reasons (budget constraints etc.) I, the developer, have been put in the position to deploy the app in a production environment. The catch is that I don't have any experience in production EJB application server deployment. That said, they are aware that there are no guarantees of success. The context : The dev server runs on the latest version of Netbeans with Glassfish v3, on a mac machine 98% / 99% uptime is ok, there are no financial/critical transactions It is a client/server EJB 3 app, and the web tier, business tier, and resource tiers currently run on the same machine. I have the liberty to choose the hw/sw infrastructure Load estimations: 10 simultaneous connexions avg, rare 200 peaks The outbound public data is text/small pics (it's for iPhone clients), inbound HTTP text only Basic maintenance will be taken care of (backup, server reboot, etc) My questions for production deployment: What are the must haves infrastructure-wise? Minimum system specs etc? Is it ok to keep Glassfish v3? Which configuration aspects of the server should I focus on? Worst case scenario: if I deploy the same software infrastructure (Netbeans/Glassfish v3) as during the development, would the server keep up? Any piece of advice would be most welcome. Thanks!
