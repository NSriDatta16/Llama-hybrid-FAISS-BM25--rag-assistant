You're right that word2vec can't distinguish between 'palm' the tree and 'palm' the part of a hand, and related problems. More broadly, it struggles to handle polysemy and homonymy . The typical way to address this is to learn word sense embeddings instead of word embeddings. In general, this requires assigning word tokens to sense categories to learn embeddings for each meaning ("sense") that the word may have. (Basically, you learn separate vectors for 'palm₁' and 'palm₂'.) An excellent survey of word sense embedding techniques is "From Word To Sense Embeddings: A Survey on Vector Representations of Meaning" (Camacho-Collados and Pilehvar, 2018) .
