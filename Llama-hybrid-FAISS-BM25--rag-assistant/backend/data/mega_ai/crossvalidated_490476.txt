Solving for probability with negative logits

I have a multinomial logistic regression tutorial question asking to manually solve the logits and probability. When I calculate logit for both comparisons I get negative values. How do I continue and solve for P? The question part b asks, "What is the model's prediction regarding the classification of the movie?" If my calculations give me model 1 P = 0.05599435837 and model 2 P = 0.01193858104 do I do P(Low) = 1 - (0.05599435837) - (0.01193858104) = 0.93206706059 to get the missing probability? So does 93% means the model's prediction is 93% that the movie will be classified as low revenue? 93% seems pretty skewed does it not? I am writing my formulas as: model 1 - Low vs Medium Movie Success = constant + 5.316*LOpening - 0.003*Theatres + 0*Rating Movie Success = -7.007 + 5.316*2.4893 - 0.003*3017 + 0*1 Movie Success = -7.007 + 13.2331188 - 9.051 + 0 P = -2.8248812 model 2 - Low vs High Movie Success = constant + 8.128*LOpening - 0.002*Theatres + 0*Rating Movie Success = -18.615 + 8.128*2.4893 - 0.002*3017 + 0*1 Movie Success = -18.615 + 20.2330304 - 6.034 + 0 P = -4.4159696 p.s. I noticed that SPSS says b. This parameter is set to zero because it is redundant. I was told I could therefore discard that value. That's why I have it as 0.
