If you have little time, I recommend Niklaus Wirth's "Compiler Construction" (Addison-Wesley. 1996) , a tiny little booklet that you can read in a day, but it explains the basics (including how to implement lexers, recursive descent parsers, and your own stack-based virtual machines). After that, if you want a deep dive, there's no way around the Dragon book as other commenters suggest.
