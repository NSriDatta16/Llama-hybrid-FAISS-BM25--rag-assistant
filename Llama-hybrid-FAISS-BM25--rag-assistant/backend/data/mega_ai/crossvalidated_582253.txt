Sliding Window Approach to Time Series Modelling / Training

I am looking for some reassurance that I understand the sliding windows approach to time series modelling / training correctly. From what I gather, when training a model, the dataset is divided into overlapping training sets of size k that are tested on test sets comprised of the next m observations proceeding each training set. I believe that that the test sets do not overlap? Hopefully the attached image from "I. Kaastra, M. Boyd /Neurocomputing" illustrates what I'm describing. As far as I can see, this approach does not gauge the reliability of a single model, but rather tests the reliability that a model trained on k observations will be effective in forecasting the next m observations. This is unusual to me, as I am familiar with the training process being used to derive a single set of model parameters. Any help in clarifying this is much appreciated. Regards, Rowan
