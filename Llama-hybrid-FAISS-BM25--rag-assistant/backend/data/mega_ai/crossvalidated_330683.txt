I am assuming you are using the odds ratio as an approximation of the relative risk or the relative risk ratio, and that you are using the latter two terms equivalently. The multinomial logistic regression model does not estimate relative risk for intercepts unless it is parametrized to do so. The usual output shows an intercept which is a "baseline odds" (using Stata terminology) or an expected prevalence/risk if all $X$ = 0. You can, however, perform comparisons between the various intercept terms. If these comparisons are statistically or practically significant, then all it means that the number of $Y$ categorical levels have a non-uniform frequency when all the $X$ predictors are equal to 0. This can be an artifact of having an inappropriately scaled $X$. But it can also simply be the truth. As far as reporting, I fail to see why it is ever useful to report intercepts from models. It is not wrong to report these values, provided you can appropriately describe the output to your target audience.
