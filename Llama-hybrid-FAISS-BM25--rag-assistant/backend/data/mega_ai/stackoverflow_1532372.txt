I can't, honestly, think of any scenarios where it wouldn't be advisable to use an MVC approach. It's just a concept--a methodology to keep distinctly different parts of your code separated in a logical and standardized way. Codeigniter is an excellent framework. I've used it on several occasions. The best thing about it, IMO, is that you don't have to stick to the strict rules that some other frameworks make you stick to. Codeigniter offers you a way to keep your code organized, efficient, and secure but, honestly, you can code however you like within it. Could you explain a little more about what you mean when you say: "...and realized that I was having some difficulty getting things to fit into an MVC framework" I really want to help you make the right decision. Right now, steering away from Codeigniter, to me, seems like a bad decision based on innocent misconception of what it's for.
