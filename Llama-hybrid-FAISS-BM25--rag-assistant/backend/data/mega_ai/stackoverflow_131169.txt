It's common to add your statistics update to a maintenance plan (as in an Enterprise Manager-defined Maintenance plan). That way it happens on a schedule - daily, weekly, whatever. SQL Server 2000 uses statistics to make good decisions about query execution so they definitely help. It's a good idea to rebuild your indexes at the same time (DBCC DBREINDEX and DBCC INDEXDEFRAG).
