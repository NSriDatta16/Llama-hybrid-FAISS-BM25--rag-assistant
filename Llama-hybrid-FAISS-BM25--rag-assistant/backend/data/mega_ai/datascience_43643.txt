Evaluation of semantic segmentation network with mAP

I am interested in evaluating a semantic segmentation network. I've seen lots of challenges such as PASCAL VOC use the mean average precision metric(mAP). I understand how this would work with an instance detection approach, however I am unsure how it works for networks which just provide a class label to each pixel. Should I treat each image as a single instance of each class? Thanks
