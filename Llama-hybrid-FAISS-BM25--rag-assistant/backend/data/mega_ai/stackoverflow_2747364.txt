Circular NSSlider with stop (non-continuous)

I am not sure how to phrase this better as a title but I need to make an NSSlider that functions as a normal volume knob. At the moment it will spin around as many times as I hold the mouse down and move it around the control. I need it to stop at the "0" position and the "100" position, I cannot have it jumping from 0 to 100 when I drag it the other way. I hope I am making this clear. Does anyone know how to do this or have any suggestions?
