How do you save a Neural Network to file using Ruby's ai4r gem?

I'm using ruby's ai4r gem, building a neural network. Version 1.1 of the gem allowed me to simply do a Marshal.dump(network) to a file, and I could load the network back up whenever I wanted. With version 1.9 a couple years later, I'm no longer able to do this. It generates this error when I try: no marshal_dump is defined for class Proc I know the reason for the error - Marshal can't handle procs in an object. Fair enough. So is there something built in to ai4r? I've been searching with no luck. I can't imagine any practical use for a neural network you have to rebuild from scratch every time you want to use it.
