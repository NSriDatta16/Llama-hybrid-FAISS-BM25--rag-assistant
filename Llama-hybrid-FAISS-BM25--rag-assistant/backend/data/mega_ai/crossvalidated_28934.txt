Confidence interval about the difference between false positive and false negative proportions

Consider a multinomial $2\times 2$ table $\begin{pmatrix} x_{11} & x_{12} \\ x_{21} & x_{22} \end{pmatrix}$ with theoretical probabilities: $$\begin{pmatrix} \theta_{11} & \theta_{12} \\ \theta_{21} & \theta_{22} \end{pmatrix}.$$ Let us call $p:=\dfrac{\theta_{12}}{\theta_{11}+\theta_{12}}$ the "false positive" proportion and $q:=\dfrac{\theta_{21}}{\theta_{21}+\theta_{22}}$ the "false negative" propotion. Note that $p$ is the proportion parameter of the binomial conditional distribution of $x_{12}$ given $x_{11}+x_{12}$ and similarly $q$ is the proportion parameter of the binomial conditional distribution of $x_{21}$ given $x_{21}+x_{22}$. I am looking for a frequentist confidence interval about the difference $p-q$. Alternatively I am also interested in a Bayesian confidence interval as long as its confidence level is sufficiently close to its credibility level (I have checked on some examples that the Jeffreys credibility interval is a little too anti-conservatist).
