1 and 3 seem to me as invalid since they do not take into account the dependencies between repeated runs. In other words, repeated k-fold runs are more similar to each other than real repetitions of the experiment with independent data. 2 does not take into account the dependencies between folds within the same run. I do not know about 4. A potentially relevant (and discouraging) reference is Bengio & Grandvalet, 2004, "No Unbiased Estimator of the Variance of K-Fold Cross-Validation"
