In this setting, MCMC is less appropriate than particle systems or sequential Monte Carlo, because you can use the previous particle system as an approximation to your prior (posterior for the earlier datapoints) and only use one observation at a time. Appropriate references for this are, e.g., Del Moral, Doucet, and Jasra ( Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B, 2006, 68, 411-436 ) and Andrieu, Doucet, and Hollenstein ( Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B, 2011, 72, 269-342 ).
