Here's what I would do given the comments under your question: ## GENERATE SOME EXAMPLE DATA set.seed(127) d Don't forget to check the model fit with respect to the assumption of equal variances plot(fit) boxplot(residuals(fit) ~ d$strain + d$day) The random effect (1|strain/plate) expands to (1|strain) + (1|strain:plate) . If you averaged your plate measurement you can do (1|strain) . If you want random slopes of Day within Strain you can do (day|strain/plate) or (day|strain) , respectively. To get an ANOVA table: require(afex) mixed(diameter ~ strain * day + (1|strain/plate), data = d, method='LRT') The rest depends on which of your factors are significant. See here for a potential follow-up if your interaction is significant.
