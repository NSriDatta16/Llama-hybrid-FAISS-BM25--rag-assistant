You still need a separate test set (or outer round of cross-validation) if you're using those out-of-bag estimates to tune some aspect of the random forest, such as the number of features to consider for each split. If not, out-of-bag estimates can indeed substitute for a separate test set. I may be able to give you a more specific answer if you provide the particular paper or papers you're talking about.
