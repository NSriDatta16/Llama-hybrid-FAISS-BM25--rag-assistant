This is a common problem when searching multiple associates via a many to many join. This is often encountered in services using the 'tag' concept e.g. Stackoverflow See my other post on a better architecture for tag (in your case 'other') storage Searching is a two step process: Find all possible candiates of TagCollections that have any/all the tags you require (may be easier using a cursor of loop construct) Select data based that matches TagCollection Performance is always faster due to there being significantly less TagCollections than data items to search
