Using Lucene Highlighter along with MultiFieldQueryParser

Im using Lucene Highlighter to highlight the matches that I have found in a Lucene Index. Now, my problem is that If I have to search multiple fields of a document, and I need to display the matching text, then how can I get in which field the hit has occurred? The code which I am using for the highlighter is basically the second function here If I do not know in which field the hit has occurred in, then what field do I pass to the function defined above to get the matching fragments?
