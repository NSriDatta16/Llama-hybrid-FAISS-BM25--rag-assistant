My first approach would be to identify why map's performance is poor. Maps are actually pretty good all round performers - they may wel outperform hash tables in some circumstances. Changing containers without knowing the problem is not a good idea. Then I would junk DevC++. This antique is extremely buggy and is no longer under active development - I'd be especially dubious about using any libraries that came with it. I'd switch to a nightly build of Code::Blocks , the Twilight Dragon build of GCC, and (if I still wanted a hash) to either the TR1 or the Boost hashtable implementations.
