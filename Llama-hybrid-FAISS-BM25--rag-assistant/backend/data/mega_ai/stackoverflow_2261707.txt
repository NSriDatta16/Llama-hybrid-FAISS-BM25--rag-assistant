This is a PHP function, i prefer PHP for this because ideally you shall know the browser at the server side rather than client side in your case. function detect_ie() { if (isset($_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT']) && (strpos($_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'], 'MSIE') !== false)) return true; else return false; } This snippet will return true of the browser is IE, in this snippet the browser version is not being checked as it isnt required by your question hope this helps
