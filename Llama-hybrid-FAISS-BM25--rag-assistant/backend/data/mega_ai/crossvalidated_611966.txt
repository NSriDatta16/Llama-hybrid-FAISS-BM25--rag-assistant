As said by @ttnphns in the comment, you cannot use the two to calculate the third similarity. What you can do though is to use them to find bounds for it. One such "triangle inequality" is described in the Wikipedia article and more by Shubert (2021) in the "A Triangle Inequality for Cosine Similarity" paper that discusses many other such bounds and their properties.
