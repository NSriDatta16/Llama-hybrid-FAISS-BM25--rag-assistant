Note that you defined your quantities to be the mean and standard deviation of cars per unit length . So let's imagine your section is $k$ units long, and you take $n=k$ intervals. Then your $s$ really does estimate standard deviation of counts-per-unit-length. Now take $n=2k$ intervals. Is the standard deviation you get from counts in intervals of length $\frac{1}{2}$ the standard deviation per unit length ? No, it's the standard deviation of counts per half-unit length . Those will on average be smaller. They'll be multiplied in effect by a factor of $\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}}$. So when you now divide $s$ by $\sqrt{n}=\sqrt{2k}$, you're computing the standard error of the mean-per-half-unit-length, which is not what you wanted at all. Of course it gets smaller when you do that. You'll have a number that's on average half as big as the thing you were trying to work out. So when you scale back to the equivalent per unit length, you have to double the mean to get a mean per unit length, and correspondingly, you will have to similarly scale the standard error for the rescaling of the mean (doubling it). There's actually no gain at all (the only difference comes from the small effect of Bessel's correction - the population quantities being estimated scale exactly).
