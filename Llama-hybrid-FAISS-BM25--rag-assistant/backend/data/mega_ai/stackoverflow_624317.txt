Resize window with actionscript 3.0

Is there any way to resize an entire Flash project using Actionscript or some other method? I have created a 1024x768 Flash CS3 application, but upon closer inspection of the specifications, I now realise it has to be 800x600. Instead of manually making everything smaller, I'd like to resize the window as if someone were dragging the outside edge. Or perhaps add a button that allows switching between 1024x768 and 800x600. Is this possible? I mean something like this: stage.stageWidth = 800; stage.stageHeight = 600;
