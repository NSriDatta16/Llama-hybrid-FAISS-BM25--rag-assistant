So you are "I'm trying to cluster time series of different length and I came up to an idea to use DTW "... Either you are In a situation in which you can just make the time series the same length, see section 3 of [a]. In which case, problem solved. You are in a sitation in which you cannot do this. For example, maybe your time series is a mix of one heartbeat, 2 and half heartbeats etc. Which you should clearly not make the same length. In this case you have two sub choices... Cluster using only subsections of the time series, using u-shaplets [b] Cluster using derived (non-shape) features [c] If I had to guess from your description only, go with u-shaplets [b], there is free code. By the way, centroids under DTW was recently solved [a] http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/DTW_myths.pdf [b] http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/ClusteringTimeSeriesUsingUnsupervised-Shapelets.pdf [c] Xiaozhe Wang, Kate A.
