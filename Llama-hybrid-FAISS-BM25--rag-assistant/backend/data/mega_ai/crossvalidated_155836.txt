How to find the threshold that minimizes the (weighted) mis-classification rate?

To use a logistic regression model for doing prediction, let \begin{equation} \hat Y_i= \begin{cases} 1 &\mbox{if $P(Y_i=1|X_i)>\alpha$}\\ 0 &\mbox{if $P(Y_i=1|X_i)\leq\alpha$} \end{cases} \end{equation} where $\alpha$ is the threshold, i.e. , $P(Y_i=1|X_i)$ is estimated by logistic regression, and if $P(Y_i=1|X_i)>\alpha$, $\hat Y_i=1$, otherwise, $\hat Y_i=0$. The mis-classification rate is defined as $\mbox{MCR}=\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^mI\{Y_i\neq \hat Y_i\}$. The weighted mis-classification rate (assigning higher weights to rare events) is defined as $\mbox{WMCR}=\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^m\left\{ \frac{I\{Y_i\neq \hat Y_i|Y_i=0\}}{P(Y_i=0)} + \frac{I\{Y_i\neq \hat Y_i|Y_i=1\}}{P(Y_i=1)} \right\}$. It is known that the mis-classification rate is minimized when $\alpha=0.5$ and under certain conditions the weighted mis-classification rate is minimized when $\alpha=P(Y_i=1)$. Could anyone please let me know how these minimization problems are solved?
