I've written a couple of blog posts about the Silverlight Unit Testing Framework. The first one covers how to test asynchronous code using the asynchronous attribute and some of the more advanced features of the framework. The post can be found at http://jonas.follesoe.no/UnitTestingAsynchronousSilverlightCode.aspx The second post is about organizing your tests using the Tag-attribute. This enables you to have unit/integration/performance/UI tests in the same test suite, but only execute one specific category at a time.
