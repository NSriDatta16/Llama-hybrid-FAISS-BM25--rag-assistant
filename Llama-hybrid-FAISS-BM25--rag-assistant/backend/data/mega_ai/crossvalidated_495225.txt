I will try an intuitive explanation rather than the mathematical one but that may help as well. Suppose that you have a two level predictor and it is balanced so that half your sample have one value, half the other. For half the sample the predicted value of $Y$ is $\beta_0 +0.5 \beta_1$ and for the other half it is $\beta_0 - 0.5 \beta_1$ . Now average everybody's predicted value and the effect of $\beta_1$ cancels out and you are left with $\beta_0$ which must therefore be the grand mean since otherwise the model would be systematically over or under predicting.
