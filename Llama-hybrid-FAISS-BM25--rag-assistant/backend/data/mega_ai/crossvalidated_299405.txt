How to model an "order-invariant" function by neural networks

I want to approximate a multi-variable function $f(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4,x_5,y)$ from data by neural networks, and $f$ satisfies $f(x_1,\ldots,x_5,y)=f(x_{i_1},\ldots,x_{i_5},y)$, where $(i_1,\ldots,i_5)$ is an arbitrary permutation of $(1,\ldots,5)$. How can I impose this constraint on networks? Thanks!
