All your doPost() method has to do is generate a suitable servlet response (some form of content, and a suitable HTTP response structure). So it can do anything you want (including the above). However it sounds like your rendering requirement is distinct from your form submission and storage requirement. So I would make your doPost() method delegate to a suitable method for rendering the output. That way you can generate output from stored data separately from submitting data to the database.
