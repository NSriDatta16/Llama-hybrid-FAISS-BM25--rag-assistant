I would like to see links to such references calling$$\pi(p)\propto p^{-1}(1-p)^{-1}$$a "uniform" prior..! This is called the Haldane prior in the Bayesian literature, named after the geneticist J.B.S. Haldane (1892-1964) . It is not a recommended prior in that it does not return a proper posterior for all values of the observation $x\sim\mathcal{B}(n,p)$, hence "depends" on the observation since it can only be used when $x\ne 0,n$. Another traditional and non-uniform prior is Jeffreys' prior$$\pi^J(p)\propto p^{-1/2}(1-p)^{-1/2}$$which is a $\mathcal{B}e(1/2,1/2)$ (proper) distribution and hence the posterior distribution $\pi(p|x)$ is defined for all values of the observation $x\sim\mathcal{B}(n,p)$.
