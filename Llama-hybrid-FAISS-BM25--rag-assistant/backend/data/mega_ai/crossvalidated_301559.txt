reconciling multiple forecasts from grouped time series, Hyndman/Athanosopoulos method

I am doing grouped forecasting following the methodology of Hydman / Athanasopoulos described here: ...series can be naturally grouped together based on attributes without necessarily imposing a hierarchical structure. For example the bicycles sold by the warehouse can be for males, females or unisex. They can be used for racing, commuting or recreational purposes. They can be single speed or have multiple gears. Frames can be carbon, aluminum or steel. According to this method, the forecast for bicycles sold by the warehouse would be different, depending on which group (male vs. female vs. unisex, racing vs. commuting vs. recreational, single speed vs. multiple gears, carbon vs. aluminum vs. steel) is chosen. What I want and what it seems like one would normally want in this case is not 4 separate forecasts, but rather one single forecast for bicycles sold that reconciles all of the data from the non-hierarchical groups to which the bicycle belongs. Is there a good solution to this? To make the problem more concrete, I have posted a notebook that uses the pyaf package to produce forecasts for item1 and item2 . You can see that item1 belongs to 2 groups ( group1 and group2 ), and therefore there are two different forecasts for item1 . How would one make a forecast for item1 without choosing between group1 and group2 ? Simply average the two forecasts together?
