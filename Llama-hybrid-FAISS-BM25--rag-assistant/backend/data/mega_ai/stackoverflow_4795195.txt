Ways to get rid of mangling: (assuming MSVC is the build environment) Export via a .DEF file. Export as extern "C" ensuring that the __cdecl calling convention is used. __stdcall prepends the _ and postpends the @ on dll exported functions even when extern "C" is used. extern "C" __declspec(dllexport) int __cdecl MyFunc(int Param1, int Param2); Export using a #pragma directive. You need to pass the fully mangled name on the other side of this. __FUNCDNAME__ is a useful directive to put in a macro in a function to list its decorated name, #pragma comment(linker, "/EXPORT:MyFunc=_MyFunc@8");
