Your test, as written, is checking if the character is not equal to any of the whitespace chars. You need to check that it's not equal to all of them. You want: int idx = 0; if (test[idx] != '\n' && test[idx] != '\r' && test[idx] != '\t') return; Assuming, then, that idx is the index of the first non-whitespace char, or the null terminator you could shorten the string like this: int i; for (i = 0; test[idx+i] != '\0'; i++) test[i] = test[idx+i]; test[i] = '\0'; As others have said, there are more elegant ways to do all this with isspace() and pointers, but this should give you the basic idea.
