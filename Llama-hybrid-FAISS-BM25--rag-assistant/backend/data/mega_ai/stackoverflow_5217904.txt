Drag and Drop Java GUI

I am looking to create a GUI in Java, where I place controls or elements on a left pane and can drag them onto a designer pane, similar to creating a model in Visio. The current one I'm looking at is JGraphX , it allows you to create graphs etc. Are there any other projects out there that support this, or tools etc.
