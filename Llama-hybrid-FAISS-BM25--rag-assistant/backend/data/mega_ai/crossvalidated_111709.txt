how does the correlation of independent variables affect the correlation of parameters

Suppose $Y$,$X$ and $Z$ are correlated random variables with $N(0,1)$. We have these cross-sectional regression for each time $t$ $Y_{t} = \beta_{t}X_{t}+u_{t} $ $Y_{t} = \theta_{t}Z_{t}+\epsilon_{t} $ We can extimate the cross sectional correlation (or covariance) of $X_{t}$ and $Z_{t}$ at each time $t$ as $corr(X_{t},Z_{t})$ lets say it is $c_{t}$. I would like to work out how this correlation between $X_{t}$ and $Z_{t}$ affects the parameter estimates of $\beta_{t}$ and $\theta_{t}$. In particular I was hoping to get a formulaic expression on how $c_{t}$ affects the correlation between the time series of the parameter estimates of $\beta_{t}$ and $\theta_{t}$. Please let ke know if this is still unclear. Many thanks
