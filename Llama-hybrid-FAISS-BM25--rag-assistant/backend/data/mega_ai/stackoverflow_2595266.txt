A visible 301 redirect is losing its POST data. From RFC 2616 : If the 301 status code is received in response to a request other than GET or HEAD, the user agent MUST NOT automatically redirect the request unless it can be confirmed by the user, since this might change the conditions under which the request was issued. So, you have to fix the forms, not the .htaccess.
