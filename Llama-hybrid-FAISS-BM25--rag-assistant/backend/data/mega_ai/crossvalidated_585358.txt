Success stories of statistics are everywhere . The reason that you don't see newspaper articles about statistical success stories is not because they rarely happen; it's because they happen so often that it's not considered news. Some examples of successful applications of statistics are: Every successful scientific study involving a large number of individuals or measurements Every time an organization makes a good decision based on a large amount of data Every time an instrument is correctly calibrated or tested by taking a large number of measurements Every time someone makes a successful prediction about the future based on a large number of things that happened in the past And there are millions of examples of each of these. If you want to find a statistical success story in the news, look at any news article about any great achievement. Statistics plays a role in everything.
