Alternatively you could check out literatures on Generalized Autoregressive Moving Average Model (GARMA), which extend univariate ARMA models to non-Gaussian situations, which extends the Generalized Linear Modelds (exponential family distributions) to incoproate time dependence in the observations. I assume this is what you are interested. Gaussian ARMA is with Gaussian error process, but in GARMA you can assume non-Gaussian distributions in the error process.
