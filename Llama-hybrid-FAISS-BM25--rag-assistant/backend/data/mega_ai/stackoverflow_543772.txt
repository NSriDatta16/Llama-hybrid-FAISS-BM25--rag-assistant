Here's what I use , which was mostly cribbed from Luca de Alfaro : (defun fill-sentence () (interactive) (save-excursion (or (eq (point) (point-max)) (forward-char)) (forward-sentence -1) (indent-relative t) (let ((beg (point)) (ix (string-match "LaTeX" mode-name))) (forward-sentence) (if (and ix (equal "LaTeX" (substring mode-name ix))) (LaTeX-fill-region-as-paragraph beg (point)) (fill-region-as-paragraph beg (point)))))) I bind this to M-j with (global-set-key (kbd "M-j") 'fill-sentence) The references to "LaTeX" are for AUCTeX support. If you don't use AUCTeX, the let can be simplified to (let (beg (point)) (forward-sentence) (fill-region-as-paragraph beg (point)))
