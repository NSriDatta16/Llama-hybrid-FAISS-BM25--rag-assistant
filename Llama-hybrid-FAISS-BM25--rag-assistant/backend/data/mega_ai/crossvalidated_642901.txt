Logistic regression with highly left-skewed data for the independent variable

I am using the in-built GLM function in R to identify the model that best predict frogs' occupancy based on survey data. One of the independent variable (saturation) is highly skewed, as 36 of the 57 sites had 100% stream saturation. I used the skewness function with the moments package and I had a value of 1.73, would this render the model too shaky? I have attached the histogram for saturation and the qq residuals of the model with saturation and frogs' occupancy. I also tried to use transformations like log, power, etc. but they made the data even more skewed. I also read about reflection, but I am afraid that making too many transformation can hinder interpretation of the model.
