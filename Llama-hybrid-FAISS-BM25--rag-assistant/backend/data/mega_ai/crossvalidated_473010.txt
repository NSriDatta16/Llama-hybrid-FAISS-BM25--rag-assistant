I'm not familiar with any rigorous criteria, especially because in my experience people violate assumption for their models all the time. One criteria I think is important is where on the defined interval most your data lies. For example, time per day, bound between [0,24]. If you average was, say 8 hours with a SD of 1, you would have very little data on the extreme ends, and therefore normal may be appropriate. However, if the mean is like, 2 or 3 with a SD of 1(probably a more realistic case, probably also right skewed) something like a zero inflated poison may be more helpful.
