I am not sure I understand precisely what you are trying to do (What's the role of cluster analysis? Are you trying to derive factors/latent variables or use PCA for data reduction?) but all this (determinant, KMO) does not sound promising and is certainly far outside of traditional guidelines from the 1950s. On the other hand, my understanding is that these diagnostics were mostly a way to guess if factor analysis would be worthwhile before actually trying it, at a time when it was tedious and expensive to do so. With a modern computer, it's just a matter of pressing a few buttons and waiting a few seconds so you might as well just run it and see what comes out. Chances are you will find many factors defined by single variables, many low loadings or a generally uninterpretable structure or you will perhaps not be able to factor the matrix at all. In that case you might as well work with the original variables.
