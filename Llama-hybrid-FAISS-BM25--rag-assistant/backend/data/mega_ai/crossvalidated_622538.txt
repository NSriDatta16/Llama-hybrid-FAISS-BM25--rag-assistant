Following the multiple moderator model solution actually provided insightful results. Taking all other pre-specified moderators into account, one moderator did not further explain heterogeneity in effect sizes. I interpret this finding as such that this moderator was only significant due to its interrelation with another meaningful moderator. Maybe not the most elegant solution, yet in my opinion still meaningful.
