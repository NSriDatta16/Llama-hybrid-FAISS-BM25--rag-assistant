Alternatively, in the limit of large number of sides you can think of rolling a die as picking a uniformly distributed random number on $[0,1]$, and then multiplying by the number of sides. So you're trying to find $E(max(X,Y))$ where $X, Y$ are independent uniform[0, 1] random variables. This is $$ \int_0^1 \int_0^1 \max(x,y) \: dx \: dy $$ which you can split according to whether $x$ or $y$ is larger, giving $$ \int_0^1 \int_y^1 x \: dx \: dy + \int_0^1 \int_0^y y \: dx \: dy. $$ Both of these integrals are $1/3$ and so $E(\max(X,Y)) = 2/3$; this tells you that the larger of the two dice will be, on average, $2n/3$. Of course this agrees with Tim's answer. (It turns out that if you have $k$ dice each with $n$ sides, the expectation of the largest die would be about $kn/(k+1)$.) If you don't know calculus, don't worry about this. If you do know calculus, I hope this helped.
