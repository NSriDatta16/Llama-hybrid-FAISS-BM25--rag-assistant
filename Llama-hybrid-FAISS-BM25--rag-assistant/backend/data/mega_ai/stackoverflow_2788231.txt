Yes, that's accurate. LinkedList doesn't use an array for storage, it really is a chain of references. You'll get no garbage in the Large Object Heap when you need to store a large number of elements, unlike List, and avoid trouble with address space fragmentation conking your program out early. Beware that it is not a substitute for List, indexing is O(n) instead of O(1). Big difference, unless you always iterate the list sequentially. When you need to make shrill choices like these, it is high time to start considering a 64-bit operating system.
