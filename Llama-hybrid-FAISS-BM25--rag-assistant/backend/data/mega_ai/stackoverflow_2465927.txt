I would recommend adding unit tests to all the classes you touch, not retrofitting existing classes. Most of the advantages of unit testing is in helping programmers code and ensuring that "Fixes" don't actually break anything, if you are not adding code to a new section of code that isn't every modified, the benefits of unit tests start to drop off. You might also want to add unit tests to classes that you rely on if you have nothing better to do. You absolutely should add tests to new functionality you add, but you should probably also add tests to existing functionality you may break. If you are doing a big refactor, consider getting 80-100% coverage on that section first.
