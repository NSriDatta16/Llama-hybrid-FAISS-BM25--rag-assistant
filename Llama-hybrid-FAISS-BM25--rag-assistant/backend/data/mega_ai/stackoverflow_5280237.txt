It depends on your images, really. Very tiny graphics you'll probably want to draw separately, since you're going to lose fine details when interpolating to smaller sizes, whereas with larger ones, you'll probably be fine just rescaling, starting with a high resolution image. For background images, that's always kind of a tricky one. Since you can't count on a specific resolution, you can either estimate and go with one slightly smaller than the average, and turn it into a 9-patch, where the edges will stretch to cover the leftover space, or you can go with one slightly larger than the average (something like 900 x 500) and just make sure the edge area doesn't contain any pertinent information. Basically, think of it like a bleed for print, it's just extra area that may be cut off if the screen's not big enough. It's easier to just use some sort of gradient drawable or other resolution independent type of image for the background, if possible, due to the large number of different resolutions to support.
