First, I am not sure that your problem is really a time-series one. I don't see time as a factor figuring in your description. You need to set up a mathematical model, i.e. how you expect advertising to influence the number of customers. Let us use the following notation: $n$ : the total number of customers; $n_I$ : the number of inorganic customers; $n_{Oa}$ : the number of "true" (type "a") organic customers; $n_{Ob}$ : the number of type "b" organic customers; $a$ : the amount spent on advertising. By definition, $n = n_I + n_{Oa} + n_{Ob}$ . Now, your assumption is that: $n_I = f(a)$ (the number of inorganic customers is a function of advertising), and $n_{Ob} = g(n_I)$ (the number of organic "b" customers is another function of the number of inorganic customers). From above it follows: $n_{Ob} = g(f(a))$ . You need to make some assumption about the form of $f(\cdot)$ and $g(\cdot)$ . Probably the simplest (not necessarily correct) is that they are both linear: $f(a) = \beta_1 a$ , and $g(n_I) = \beta_2 n_I = \beta_1 \beta_2 a$ . You can determine $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ by minimizing some (quadratic?) error between your model and your empirical data, e.g.: $$ \min_\beta (n - n_{Oa} - \beta_1 a (1 + \beta_2))^2 $$ After determining the $\beta$ 's, you simply set $a = 0$ and calculate the number of customers from the formulae above. This basic idea $-$ minimizing the error $-$ can also be used when your $f(\cdot)$ and $g(\cdot)$ are not linear. For example, I'd assume that there is a saturation level, both for organic and inorganic customers, where spending more on advertising hardly brings any more customers. You can model that by some asymptotic function, e.g. $C_1 (1 - e^{\beta_1 a})$ .
