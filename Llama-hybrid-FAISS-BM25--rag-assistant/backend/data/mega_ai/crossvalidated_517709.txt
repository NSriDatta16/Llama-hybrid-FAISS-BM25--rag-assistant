What regression approach would suit zero-inflated data that is censored at a fuzzy threshold?

Monthly grid-cell burned area estimates are (almost) lognormally distributed, censored at a fuzzy threshold and zero-inflated. I want to predict burned area from weather etc. About 40% of the observations are zero. Some zeroes are due to true lack of fire. Others are due to the limits of satellite detection. Detection capability and therefore minimum detected burned area varies with both fire intensity and size, complicated by cloud cover, overpass frequency etc. Judged visually, the following histogram of log-transformed continuous non-zero burned area (actually fire CO emissions, but it could be burned area) looks nicely normal for the upper, say, 60% of data values. The dotted line is mirrored values around the mode, as a presumed target to describe the true distribution, or one to explore. For smaller values one can imagine a sort of missing ‘bite’, maybe 20% of the observations. The presumed missing observations add up to little burned area but omitting them would bias the regression. Again just visually, it appears that a normally distributed addition stacked onto the histogram would provide rough bilateral symmetry. So maybe just two additional parameters could capture the threshold‘s variability. The zero inflation with two possible causes seems suited to tools like r’s mhurdle or crch. But those commands require a crisp censoring threshold. I’d prefer to use existing commands. If that isn’t possible then one might (with difficulty!) build a custom Bayesian solution. I think a somewhat variable detection limit is common in satellite data. So I imagine, with hope, that others have worked on approaches for data like this.
