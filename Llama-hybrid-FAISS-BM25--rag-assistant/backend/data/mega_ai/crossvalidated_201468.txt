A scatter plot of observed and predicted is emphatically not a quantile-quantile plot (which defines a never-decreasing sequence of points). People often just talk informally in terms of what is on which axis, say observed versus or against predicted or fitted (e.g. Chambers et al. 1983). I'd suggest that plotting observed on the vertical or $y$ axis and predicted or fitted on the horizontal or $x$ axis is marginally preferable to the opposite convention for two reasons: Plotting response or outcome variable on the vertical axis is a common convention throughout science. This matches the very common convention of plotting residuals on the vertical axis and predicted or fitted on the horizontal axis in a very common associated plot. (Plots of observed versus fitted and of residual versus fitted show the same information; the first conveys the good news and can be easier to think of substantively, while the second conveys the bad news and can be easier to think of statistically, particularly when considering whether a model is adequate or can be improved.) On which is the right way round with versus , see discussion at versus (vs.): how to properly use this word in data analysis A more formal name is calibration plot (e.g. Harrell 2001, 2015; Venables and Ripley 2002; Gelman and Hill 2007).
