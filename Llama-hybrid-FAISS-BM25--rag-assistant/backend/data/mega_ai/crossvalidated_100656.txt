When your test statistic is below your critical value, this only means your evidence is insufficient to reject the null hypothesis; it does not mean that the null is true. You have very different sample variances from very unbalanced classes, one of which is pretty short on data. This affects the outcome of an F -test of the equality of variances. Furthermore, as Wikipedia says: This F-test is known to be extremely sensitive to non-normality , [2][3] so Levene's test , Bartlett's test , or the Brown–Forsythe test are better tests for testing the equality of two variances. (However, all of these tests create experiment-wise type I error inflations when conducted as a test of the assumption of homoscedasticity prior to a test of effects. [ 4 ] ) References 2. Box, G. E.
