Why is it that I cannot deploy my otherwise working Silverlight application

Inside of Visual Studio my Silverlight Business Application works fine. But when I publish it to my local machine's IIS (version 6.1), it runs fine, but doesn't seem to be able to access the RIA services. The first error to pop up is: The application otherwise works fine. It navigates fine. That is, until it tries to access data from the server through RIA services. I get messages like: I know very little about deploying web applications, let alone silverlight applications with RIA services. I published using the following settings: Edit: I've used fiddler to get the exact error after realizing that the "NotFound" exception could be anything. It is as follows. Server Error in '/PPCa' Application. The resource cannot be found. Description: HTTP 404. The resource you are looking for (or one of its dependencies) could have been removed, had its name changed, or is temporarily unavailable. Please review the following URL and make sure that it is spelled correctly. Requested URL: /PPCa/login.aspx I don't have a login.aspx page. Is this something internal to Silverlight? Do I need to create such a page?
