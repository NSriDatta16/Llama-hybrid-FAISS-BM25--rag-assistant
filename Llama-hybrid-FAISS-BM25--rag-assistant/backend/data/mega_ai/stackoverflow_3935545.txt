Well, I think it would look nicer if you used more pattern-matching instead of those guards. You can match against specific list lengths like this: partition :: String -> [String] partition [] = ... partition [x] = ... partition [x,y] = ... partition (x:y:z:rest) = ... It might also work better if you reversed the string before splitting it up, checking the length like that isn't very elegant. That way you can take three digits at a time, put them back in proper order, then repeat. Worrying about length then only happens at the end, and can be done with pattern matching (as above).
