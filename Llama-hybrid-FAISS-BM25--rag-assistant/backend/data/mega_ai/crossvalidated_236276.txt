If the response variable is binary, then there will be only two columns of output for the probability calculation. In this particular case, only one column is needed, as the fact the the probabilities sum to 1 means that the values of the missing column can be inferred automatically. I would hypothesize that the [, 2] is a convention for this particular binary case. For your case, which may have greater than two classes, you could choose to keep all columns, or possibly discard the first ( [, -1] ), again relying on the fact that the probabilities sum to 1 to infer the values in that discarded column. Two reasons one might discard an output column are 1) Saving a smaller output, or 2) if you are planning on feeding the output of the random forest as predictive variables into a further model, as including all the columns from the probability column would lead you into the dummy variable trap.
