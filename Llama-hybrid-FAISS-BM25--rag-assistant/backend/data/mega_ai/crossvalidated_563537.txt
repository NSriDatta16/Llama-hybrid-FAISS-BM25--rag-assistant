Purpose of negative indices in time series

In the book Time-series analysis by Hamilton we find the following passage: A time series is a collection of observations indexed by the date of each observation. Usually we have collected data beginning at some particular date ( say $t = 1$ ) and ending at another (say, $t = T$ ) in the following fashion: $(y_{1} ,y_{2} ..., y_{T})$ We often imagine that we could have obtained earlier observations $(y_{0} , y_{-1} , y_{-2}...)$ or later observations $(y_{T + 1} , y_{T + 2} , y_{T + 3}...)$ had the process been observed for more time. Typically, a time series $\{y_{t}\}^{\infty}_{t = -\infty}$ is identified by describing the $t$ -th element of the time series. Why do we need negative indices in our time series? Is it correct to say that $y_{-1}$ is the $-1\:th$ element of the time series $y_{t}$ ? That sounds weird and wrong. Is the negative indices only there to denote unobserved observations in the past?
