Thinking about units may help in making it clear what to expect. Suppose you have a set of measurements in kilograms: 2 3 4 4 2 with mean 3 kg, and standard deviation (computed from the variance) of 0.8944 kg If you send these objects to a friend in the United States and she measures the weights, they will be in pounds. The numbers will all be multiplied by 2.2 lb/kg. 4.4 6.6 8.8 8.8 4.4 What's the average of these? Well, it had better be the number you get from converting the known average, 3 kg, to pounds, by multiplying by 2.2 lb/kg: 6.6 lb. And it is. What's the standard deviation? Well, it had better be the number you get from converting the known standard deviation, 0.8944 kg, to pounds, by multiplying by 2.2 lb/kg: 1.968 lb. And it is. The variance is harder to think about because it's squared, but it should be the number you get by squaring the standard deviation and so it should be the number you get by multiplying 0.8 by $(2.2\ \textrm{lb}/\textrm{kg})^2$ . And so it is: $3.872\ \textrm{lb}^2$ (As an additional irrelevant note: if this is a teaching example then I think you were expected to use the $N-1$ version of the variance, because that way the variance is 1, a nice round number.)
