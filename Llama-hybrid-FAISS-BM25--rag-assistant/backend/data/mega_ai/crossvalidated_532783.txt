If you have so many points that they overlap and jittering is insufficient, you can add histograms for both levels of the binary variables (so one will be upside down). Here's an example combined with a logistic regression. The idea and R code ( popbio::logi.hist.plot ) come from Rot, M. D. L. C. (2005). Improving the presentation of results of logistic regression with R.
