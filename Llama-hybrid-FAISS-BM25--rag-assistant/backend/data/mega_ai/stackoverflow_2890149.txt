The most simple approach in your case is to throw 5 bits, what gives 32 (0-31) equiprobable outcomes. If you get a value outside your range (greater than 25) you try again (and again...) The average number of "coins" (bits) to throw in this case for each letter would be 5 x 32 / 26 = 6.15 (For reference, see geometric distribution )
