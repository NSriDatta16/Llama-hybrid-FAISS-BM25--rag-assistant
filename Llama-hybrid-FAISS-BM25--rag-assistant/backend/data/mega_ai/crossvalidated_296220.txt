Why I should use Bayesian inference with uninformative prior?

I am a Ph.D. student and currently I am studying Bayesian inference concerning vector autoregressive models. A lot of researchers when talking about uninformative prior, conclude that the results of inference are equal to what we can obtain using OLS. My question is: if this is true, why I should use Bayesian inference instead of OLS?
