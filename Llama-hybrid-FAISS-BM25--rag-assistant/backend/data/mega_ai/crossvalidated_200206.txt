There are two different regions to observe in each figure: $P$ which is the "pseudo polygon" where the dots don't appear. Let us refer to the area of the "pseudo polygon" as $A_P$ from here on. The aim of the author here is to estimate this "pseudo polygon". In both figures, it is estimated with an ellipsis $E$. Call its area $A_E$. In the first figure, you can see that $A_P$ and $A_E$ are close to each other, and geometrically "resemble" to each other. On the other hand, on the second figure, there is still a lot of room between the ellipsis and the pseudo polygon, which means that you have a poor estimation of the region $A$. Edit. Calling $\tilde{f}$ the classifier obtained with the SVM, the "pseudo polygon" is defined implicitly from $\{x|\tilde{f}(x)=1\}$.
