I suppose you just missed right bracket in the first of getString calls: Alert.show(resourceManager.getString('myresource', 'ErrorMessage'), resourceManager.getString('myResource', 'ErrorMessageTitle'), Alert.OK|Alert.CANCEL,this,onExitSuccess,null,Alert.CANCEL); Update: Ok as far as there is no typo in question I suppose the problem is in font embedding. Try to set the same font style for alert body as in alert title and check the result.
