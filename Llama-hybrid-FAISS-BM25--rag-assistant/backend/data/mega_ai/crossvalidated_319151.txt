CNN architectures come with the inductive bias that information is mostly spatially localized. For example, in an image, changing a few pixel values in one corner of the image should not change my interpretation of the rest of the image, because of the spatial locality idea. Since your data, a height-map, has the same property, it does make sense to use a CNN. I wouldn't say that this requires treating your data as an image. Rather, CNNs can operate on any N-D array, and both a matrix and an image are N-D arrays. For variable input sizes, I suggest either resizing, cropping, or padding all your data to the same size.
