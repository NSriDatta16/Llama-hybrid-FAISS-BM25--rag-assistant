OCaml is a great language -- one of my favorites -- but if your interest is distributed systems than I'd recommend going with Erlang, which is head and shoulders ahead of the other FP languages with regards to distributed systems (although there's an offshoot of OCaml called Jocaml which has some interesting aspects). OCaml is weaker even when just looking at parallelism, given its underlying architecture. Both Haskell and Clojure have better stories here, IMHO. (That said: once you get one FP language, you'll be able to carry the fundamental principles to other languages pretty easily, and they might be useful in the future. Both Scala and Clojure could easily sneak their way into organizations by virtue of the JVM.)
