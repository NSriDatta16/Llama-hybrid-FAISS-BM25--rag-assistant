Non-linear regression for Lambert W-function in stata

I need to estimate parameters $\alpha, \beta$ and $k$ in equation $y_i = \alpha + \beta \times W(k x_i)+\epsilon_i$ where ($x_i$,$y_i$) is the data and $W(\cdot)$ is Lambert W-function. This is the function with the property $W(xe^x)=x$. $Var(\epsilon_i)=f(x_i)$ where $f(\cdot)$ is unknown. $x_i$ is within $[0,10000]$ range. There are 300K observations. What would be the easiest way to solve the problem?
