This is up to you and what you want to find out. Are the outliers important? I could see how they could be (floods, droughts, etc) but maybe not. Or do you only want an average per month (maybe you have to allocate resources that way?) My tendency would be toward the daily plots, but I don't know what you want. You also might not want boxplots at all.
