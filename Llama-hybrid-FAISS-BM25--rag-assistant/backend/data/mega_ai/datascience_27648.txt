Multi target classification for different types of target variables

I am new to machine learning and I got this task in my university. I have a dataset with over 100 columns and two target variables: $target1$ is categorical i.e. $0$ or $1$ and $target2$ is continuous i.e. values in range $0 \space to \space 100$. How can I predict this type of problem? I tried using multi-output classification from sklearn using the Random forest as an ensembler and it is predicting nicely for continuous target variable but not for categorical target variable.
