NIST exponential distribution Poisson distribution

An exponential distribution describes the time between events in a Poisson process. Suppose that the average waiting time for an action is 5 minutes. The time waited each time measured in hours is an exponential random variable, $t$. Therefore $t$ has the CDF distribution :$$P(t) = 1-e^{-\lambda t}$$ where $\lambda = 1/(5/60)$. If the action can not be recorded at the time, instead only the minute during occurrence, why is it inappropriate to use exponential distribution? What is a better model?
