Microsoft PKI or PKI Vendor?

I have a question related to PKI Infrastructure , should an organization go with Microsoft PKI or an independent separate PKI Infrastructure ? Is there any licensing restrictions if I user Microsoft PKI Infrastructure ? Or should I get an independent PKI infrastructure from a vendor that offer PKI TSA and SP(Signature Proof) Infrastructure.
