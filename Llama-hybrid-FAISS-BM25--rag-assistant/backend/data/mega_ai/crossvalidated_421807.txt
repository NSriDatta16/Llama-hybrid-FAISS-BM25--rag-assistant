Distribution of inbag matrix when sampling with replacement

Say I take a random sample of size $M$ from a sample of size $N$ , like, for example you'd do when bootstrapping in random forest. As you increase $M$ , you're more likely to sample any particular observation an increasing number of times. When $M = N$ , it's been shown that you get zero instances of any given element about .38 percent of the time. I want to know what this distribution of the inbag matrix is -- the distribution of counts over elements -- as $M$ is varied. To see random draws of this distribution for $N = 26$ and $M = 10$ , you can run this a bunch of times: data.frame(table(table(sample(letters[1:26], 10, replace = T)))) I'm looking for an analytical function to give me the expectation of how many times ecah inbag count will show up as a function of $M$ and $N$ .
