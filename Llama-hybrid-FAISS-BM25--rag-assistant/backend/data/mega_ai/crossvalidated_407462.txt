Statistical Significance of a Binary Event

Consider a retail bank that makes loans to consumers. Some consumers will default on their loans. Modeling the default event would typically be modeled with a logistic regression if I am not mistaken. The default event could happen at any time after loan origination, so it could happen after not making any payments (in which case it would be deemed a “first payment default”) or it could happen after the consumer has made at least one payment. If I have 100,000 loans and 200 of them are associated with defaults, of which 100 are first payment defaults, how would I determine whether first payment defaults are actually just happening randomly or if they reflect statistically significant events? Thanks!
