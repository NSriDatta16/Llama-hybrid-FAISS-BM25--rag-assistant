Average values or whole raw data

I am performing my experiment which I have three independet experiments with three replicates each (9 samples in total) for each group (infected and mock). For the statistical analysis, should I use all these 9 values or the average value of each experiment (3 values only). I want to aplly non parametric test (mann-whitney U test) Ex: exp1: 10 exp2: 9,0 exp3: 8,0 or Exp1: 10,2/10,5/10,5 exp2:9,01/9,2/9,0 Exp3: 8,1/8,0/8,2
