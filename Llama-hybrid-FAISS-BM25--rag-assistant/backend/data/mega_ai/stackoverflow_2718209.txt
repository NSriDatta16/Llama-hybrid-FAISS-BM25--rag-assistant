Casting to (same cv-qualifiers ) void* is always implicitly possible, you should never see a cast trying to do so. The error is from trying to remove const with a static_cast Try this, which also handles embedded NUL characters correctly: using System::Runtime::InteropServices::Marshal::PtrToStringAnsi; return PtrToStringAnsi( const_cast (&input[0]), input.size() ); The const_cast takes care of the stupidity which is the lack of const-correctness in .NET
