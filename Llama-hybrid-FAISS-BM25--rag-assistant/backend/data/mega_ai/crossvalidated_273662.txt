Infimum of Binomial Confidence Interval Coverage Probability

Let $X \sim \text{Binomial}(n,p)$. Let $\hat{p} = X/n$ be the estimator for $p$. Let the confidence interval for unknown $p$ be $$ \hat{p} \pm z_{\alpha/2}\ \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}. $$ I am trying to find the infimum of the coverage probability for fixed $n$, where the infimum is taken over a subset of the range of $(0,1)$. That is, I'm trying to find $$ \inf_{p \in (a,b) }P\left[\hat{p} - z_{\alpha/2}\ \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}} My intuition is that the infimum occurs when $p$ is equal to one of the endpoints, because it will have the smallest width, but I can't show why. Probably $a$ if it's closer to $0$ than $b$ is closer to $1$. Another hunch of mine is that if I could write the probability as the cdf of some random variable, I could find the infimum more easily because cdf's are always non-decreasing. But even if this was possible, this random variable has weird support. Another thing I've noticed is that probability above is equal to $$ P\left[\hat{p} - z_{\alpha/2}\ \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}} Also, I'm trying to make my way through this , which seems to be relevant.
