How is inference performed in the RNN "many-to-one" architecture?

I'm looking at the diagram for the "many-to-one" architecture here and it looks like in the training phase there would be weights trained across activations between timesteps $W_{aa}$ , between inputs and activations $W_{ax}$ and between activations and outputs ${W_{ya}}$ . So assuming that variable length sequences will be used at prediction time, how is it known when the end of the sequence is reached and the final ${W_{ya}}$ weights need to be applied to get the final predicted output? Is it something like if is_final_timestep: apply W_{ya} else: apply W_{aa}
