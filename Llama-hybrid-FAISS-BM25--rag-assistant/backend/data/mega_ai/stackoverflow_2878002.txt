You wrote The "display_html()" function calls the javascript page which uses jquery ajax call to retrieve the html stored inside a php page What do you mean with "the html stored inside a php page"? If you want to load data and display there as a contain of the loaded data should be formated correspondent. I mean that it should be real a code fragment of HTML. Moreover Together with 'contentType' it would be a good idea to specify 'dataType' as "html" or "text". If you don't specity anything the last version of jQuery will "intelligently try to get the results, based on the MIME type of the response". If you know the 'dataType', it would be better to specify there. And if you use ajax use also default 'async: true' and not 'false'. You should also verify whether jQuery.load method (see http://api.jquery.com/load/ ) is the best choice for you. You can load with the mathod a full html page if required and display only a part of there: $('#main_container').load('ajax/about_us.html #container'); And about UTF-8 encoding don't forget to save the file really UTF-8 encoded. Use corresponding option of your editor (in Notepad choose "Save As" and then choose as encoding "UTF-8" and not "ANSI").
