You interpret the coefficient estimates from glmnet the same way you would interpret them as if you ran a regular GLM logistic regression. There are plenty of resources on this site and online for interpreting logistic regression coefficients. The coefficients with . next to them were set to 0 via the lasso penalty (it's lasso because you set alpha = 1). Your last statement is computing the number of times the prediction equals the label, i.e. the model accuracy, which you can get from the table above it: (207345+20460)/(207345+20460+60553+9004)=0.7660865
