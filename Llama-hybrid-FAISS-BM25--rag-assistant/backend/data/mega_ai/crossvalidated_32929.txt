One option would be to consider your audio stimuli as the independent variable in a multivariate analysis of variance or MANOVA . That is, the audio stimulus is your independent variable with a number of levels equal to the number of different audio simuli you used (I'm not clear what that number is from your description). Your 5 responses are each dependent variables. This approach treats your response variables as continuous, which is probably reasonable in this case. Given that you have measured each individual twice, you would want to include a within-subjects factor for trial number. A similar, but potentially more powerful approach, would be to use a mixed models approach, treating participants as a random variable. On Multivariate Mixed Model Analysis Yasuo Amemiya Lecture Notes-Monograph Series , Vol. 24, Multivariate Analysis and Its Applications (1994), pp. 83-95 In answer to your comment regarding PCA... I cannot claim to be an expert in principle components analysis either. However, I don't believe that it directly addresses your research questions. PCA is generally interpreted as revealing the latent structure, or underlying variables in your data. If i am interpreting correctly, your expected finding would be that happy sounds (for example) result in happy ratings by participants and that these happy ratings are greater than the other 4 responses. If so, rejecting the null hypothesis with a MANOVA (or a mixed-models extension) would indicate that changes in the audio stimulus affect their ratings. That is, not all ratings are equal between your stimuli. It would be reasonable to follow up a significant MANOVA with planned linear comparisons testing, for each stimulus type, whether the predicted emotion was higher than all other ratings. Chapter 4 of Maxwell and Delaney's Designing Experiments and Analyzing Data discusses procedures for such comparisons.
