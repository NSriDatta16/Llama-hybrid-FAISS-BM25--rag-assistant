Bug with embedding fonts in Flex - panel's title won't show up

Good morning, I face a curious bug as I try to set a fontstyle in a mx:Panel object in Flex. The associated CSS file contains the following relevant styles: /* CSS file */ @namespace s "library://ns.adobe.com/flex/spark"; @namespace mx "library://ns.adobe.com/flex/mx"; @font-face{ src: url("ttf\\ControlSign Bold.ttf"); fontFamily: ControlSign; fontWeight: bold; } @font-face{ src: url("ttf\\ControlMono Regular.ttf"); fontFamily: ControlMono; } .titleAssumed { fontFamily: ControlSign; font-weight: bold; font-size: 12; color: #FFFFFF; } .othersAssumed { fontFamily: ControlMono; font-size: 15; color: #ADADAD; } With this configuration, and once I have set the compiler properties in Eclipse for the compiler to use the Flash text engine for MX components, I can see the two labels of the Panel in the correct font and style ; but the Panel's title will not show up. Even if I add the "embedAsCff: false" line to my style .titleAssumed, the title refuses to show up. Any idea about what could be causing the trouble? Thanks ! EDIT: syntax error fixed.
