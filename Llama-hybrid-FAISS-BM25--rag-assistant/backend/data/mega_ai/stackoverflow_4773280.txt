moss 2007 List Forms - dynamic field logic

I'm using MOSS 2007 for the NewForm.aspx need to implement field logic i.e whether to show certain fields based on the values of preceding fields. I have implemented a similar solution embedding a Content Editor Webpart within the NewForm.aspx and using JQuery to manipulate the form elements. However this solution does not lend itself to my current scenario due to the number of fields which need to be referenced. It would make much more sense to somehow wrap div tags around the sections of the form I want to dynamically display rather then reference each field within that section individually. Does anyone have any suggestions? Many Thanks
