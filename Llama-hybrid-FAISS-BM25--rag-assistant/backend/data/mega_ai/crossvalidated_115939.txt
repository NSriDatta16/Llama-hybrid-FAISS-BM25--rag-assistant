Use fitted value from regression on subset of features as independent variable

I am working with a relatively large data set with 2K columns and many variables can be grouped together (a logistic regression). So I am thinking can I use fitted value from regression on subset of features as independent variable?. For example Instead of: Y ~ X1 + X2 + X3 + Z1 + Z2 + Z3 Can I use Y ~ X1 + X2 + X3 and Y ~ Z1 + Z2 + Z3 then use the fitted value Y1 and Y2 from those two models to do: Y ~ Y1 + Y2 Please correct me if there is any issue with this method. Thanks!
