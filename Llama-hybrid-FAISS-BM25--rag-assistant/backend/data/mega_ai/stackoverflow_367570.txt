Gantt Chart Controls on Windows Forms

We are evaluating options for a Gantt chart control (on Windows Forms) as opposed developing one on our own. What are the various Gantt Chart controls you have had experience with? Pros and cons? Is it a viable idea to develop such a control from scratch (given that the control is not the primary product in this case)? Update: Just bringing this up again since I've got only one answer. I'd be very grateful for more inputs. (Hope this is legal.)
