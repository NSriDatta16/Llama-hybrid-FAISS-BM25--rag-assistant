God only knows what SWIG is doing. My advice is to bite the bullet and use Lua's C API , which also works with C++. It's not that hard to learn, and you'll be able to overload the foo2 method exactly the way you want. Good examples can be found in Roberto Ierusalimschy's book Programming in Lua ; you can get the previous edition free online . N.B. Since the API is C, it doesn't know from reference parameters. Your Lua userdata object should contain a pointer to the C++ object of class foo2 .
