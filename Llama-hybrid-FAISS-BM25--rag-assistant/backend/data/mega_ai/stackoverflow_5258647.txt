Expanding Environment variable in string using python

I have a string containing an environment variable, e.g. my_path = '$HOME/dir/dir2' I want parse the string, looking up the variable and replacing it in the string: print "HOME =",os.environ['HOME'] my_expanded_path = parse_string(my_path) print "PATH =", my_expanded_path So I should see the output: HOME = /home/user1 PATH = /home/user1/dir/dir2 Is there an elegant way to do that in Python?
