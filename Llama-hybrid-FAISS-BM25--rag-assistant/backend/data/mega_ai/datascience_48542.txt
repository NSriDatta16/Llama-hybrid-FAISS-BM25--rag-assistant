Feels like most of the work is not related to data science at all. Is this accurate? This is the reality of any data science project. Google actually measured it and published a paper "Hidden Technical Debt in Machine Learning Systems" https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5656-hidden-technical-debt-in-machine-learning-systems.pdf Result of the paper reflects my experience as well. Vast majority of time is spent in acquiring, cleaning and processing data.
