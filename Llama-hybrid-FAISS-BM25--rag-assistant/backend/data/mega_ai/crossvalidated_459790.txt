Sketch ellipse with variance-covariance matrix that got after PCA

For X = (X1, X2, X3) distributed as N3(µ, Σ), mean of the original data is mu and variance-covarinace matrix of the original data is Sigma . I found in this section that we can derive the variance-covariance matrix of the Principal component using eigen vectors. Can I use that (variance-covariance matrix of the Principal component) to sketch the ellipse in 2d space? How to do it in R? I was stuck after below code. X $values Gamma vectors P is the principal component. P = (p1,p2) Orginal data is of 3 variable and PC is of 2 variable. Ellipse to sketch is (p - $\mu$$_p$ ) $^T$ Sigma $_p$ $^-$$^1$ (p- $\mu$$_p$ )=c^2 also c is const, Then by adjusting the value of it (where ellipse has 0.84 probability) plot has to done w.r.t to the joint distribution of P. I read here that PC vectors will be the same regardless of how many times you apply the transformation. What about variance-covariance matrix that got after PCA?
