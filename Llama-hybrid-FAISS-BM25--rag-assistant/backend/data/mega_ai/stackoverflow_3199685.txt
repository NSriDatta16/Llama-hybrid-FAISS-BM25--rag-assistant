A good place to start would be Jeff Duntemann's book, Assembly Language Step-by-Step . The book is about x86 programming under Linux. As I recall, a previous version of the book covered programming under Windows. It's a beginner's book in that it starts at the beginning: bits, bytes, binary arithmetic, etc. You can skip that part if you like, but it might be a good idea to at least skim it. I think the best way to learn ASM coding is by 1) learning the basics of the hardware and then 2) studying others' code. The book I mentioned above is worthwhile. You might also be interested in The Art of Assembly Language Programming . I've done quite a bit of assembly language programming in my time, although not much in the last 15 years or so. As one commenter pointed out, the slight size and performance gains are hard to justify when I take into account the increased development and maintenance time compared to a high level language. That said, I wouldn't discourage you from your quest to become more efficient with ASM. Becoming more familiar with how a processor works at that level can only improve your HLL programming skills, as well.
