The benefit of using WCF (decoupled approach) is that you get a deployment option to take it outside of the machine if it impacts the machine too much in terms of processing or storage. The downside is that you'll likely pay some performance hit compared to linking directly. I'm sure you can do some dynamic linking so you don't have to deploy to all 8 servers.
