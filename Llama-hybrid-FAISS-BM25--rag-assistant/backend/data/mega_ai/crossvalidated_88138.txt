Logit model would work here. Look up "logit" command in your statistical package. Your dependent variable would be converted to odds ratio. Independent continuous variables are obvious. Categorical variables will be converted into dummy/indicator variables. If you have a variable $x_i$ with M categories (unordered), you'll end up with M-1 dummies. You can find this all in the help for your command, such as the one in Stata. Yes, this can be a time series model too, if your independent variables are time dependent. You have to be careful with the underlying assumption of independence of the error terms, of course. The failure reason in this period may be correlated to the failure reason in the next period, if this dependence is not fully captured by your independent variables, then it'll pop up in the error terms, which will be an issue.
