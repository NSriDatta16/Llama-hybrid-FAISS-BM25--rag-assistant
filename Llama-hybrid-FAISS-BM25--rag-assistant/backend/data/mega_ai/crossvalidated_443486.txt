Algorithm selection rationale (Random Forest vs Logistic Regression vs SVM)

I want to understand the criteria of selection of ML algorithms i.e what are the guidelines on which algorithm to be selected in which case ? The reasons I know are : Logistic regression to be picked in case we want to advise the impact on y variable on what change on any x variable. Random forest works good on mixed data and very effective for categorical data. Also it does feature selection first(so dimension reduction is not needed). Random forest not to be picked with high featured and multiple category data due to its high processing time. SVM works well with the closely placed data points like in image processing identification of dog vs cat. But these are not sufficient enough to pick anyone, as i don't have any reason for why which algorithm not to be picked. Like when to choose SVM over Logistic regression or RF over Logistic regression. The only rationale i have is the performance, so i run all algorithms and who ever performs best that i select(but this is not right way).
