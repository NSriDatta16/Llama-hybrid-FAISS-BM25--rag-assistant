GAE authenticate to a 3rd party site

I need to authenticate securely to a third party site for a SSL REST api call. I have the API call part working but I want to save the third party credentials in my app engine datastore, or maybe somewhere else? I have no idea how im supposed to do this. The SSL call looks like: credentials = base64.encodestring('%s:%s' % (username, password))[:-1] request = urllib2.Request(accounts_url) request.add_header("User-Agent", user_agent) request.add_header("Authorization", "Basic %s" % credentials) stream = urllib2.urlopen(request) response = stream.read() stream.close() which means my app unfortunately needs to know the plaintext password. It doesn't make sense to me to AES encrypt it (not a hash--reversible) because the decryption key would need to be known by my app also so if my app is compromised no real security over storing plaintext was added.
