Is ics format a good idea when dealing with several thousands events?

In our company we have a php application to handle our assistance tickets. Now we are thinking to also add tickets, through that php application, into an ics (calendar) file so that appointments, meetings and to-do list are all together and, potentially, can be seen and edited even from an email client application (evolution, thunderbird ...) or a mobile phone. Some professionals in the company have more than 2000 tickets per year, so I made a quick test: it means around 400KB ics file, and if I add even the past tickets we start with a 2MB ics file. Not considering the mobile phones (which have bandwidth issues), will it be too large for an average email client application? Will it take too long for the php ics parser to go through the file? Have you ever had such experience?
