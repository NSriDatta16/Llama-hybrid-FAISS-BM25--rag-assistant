Average time Calculation

i just want the formula to calculate average waiting time depending upon the time difference between the events and number of the events occured............... For example if a customer comes to me at 9:00 am and i issue him a token then i give a token to another customer at 9:07am and so on...... and thus at the end of the day i want to calculate the average waiting time .................... And is it necessary to know at what time i served the customer in order to calculate the average time................... i want to check avg time for a day or a week or a month or a year or between few days or few weeks or months
