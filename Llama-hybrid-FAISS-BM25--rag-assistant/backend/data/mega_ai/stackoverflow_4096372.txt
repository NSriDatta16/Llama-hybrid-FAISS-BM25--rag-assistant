Try it first in development environment for getting rid of live website issues! These can be done by the following steps, : You need to define base url only for admin store view, then after typing /admin in the address string you will be redirected to base url of it. For this purpose you need to set base url configuration option in admin for default values to http://admin.yourdomain.com and for each website you need to specify its own base url (for example http://yourdomain.com ). It can be done via admin interface or config.xml file. In the second case, you need to remove all the records from core_config_data table those in these paths: web/secure/base_url and web/unsecure/base_url . http://admin.yourdomain.com/ https://admin.yourdomain.com/ http://yourdomain1.com/ https://yourdomain1.com/ http://yourdomain1.com/ https://yourdomain1.com/ For automatically applying of admin store view, you need to create .htaccess rule for Magento that will set the store code for running of it to admin and create redirect to /admin/ request path if it is not defined. You need to define rules like these to make it possible: SetEnvIf Host ^admin\.yourdomain\.com$ MAGE_RUN_CODE=admin RewriteEngine On RewriteCond %{HTTP:HOST} ^admin\.yourdomain\.com$ RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !/admin/ RewriteRule .* %{REQUEST_URI}index.php/admin/ [R=302,L]
