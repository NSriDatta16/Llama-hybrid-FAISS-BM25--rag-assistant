It sounds like your issue is more related to design than implementation. Designing forms can be challenging, but there are guidelines that can help to simplify the problem. One excellent overview is this slideshow , which provides many examples of forms that are simple and elegant, but which also capture many different fields. I don't recommend splitting your form into pages -- that is confusing to the user and will make your controller overly complicated. Group the fields into related sections and break the sections with visual elements to help the user read the form. People don't mind scrolling as long as what they see is attractive and easy to read.
