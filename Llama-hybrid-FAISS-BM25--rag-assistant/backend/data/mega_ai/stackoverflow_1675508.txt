Reading an std::ifstream to a vector of lines

How would I go about reading in a file where each line is a single number, then outputing that number into a vector of lines? eg: file.txt contains: 314 159 265 123 456 I have tried this implementation: vector ifstream_lines(ifstream& fs) { vector out; int temp; getline(fs,temp); while (!fs.eof()) { out.push_back(temp); getline(fs,temp); } fs.seekg(0,ios::beg); fs.clear(); return out; } but when I attempt to compile, I get errors such as: error C2784: 'std::basic_istream &std::getline (std::basic_istream &,std::basic_string &)' : could not deduce template argument for 'std::basic_istream &' from 'std::ifstream' so, obviously, something is wrong. Is there a more elegant solution than what I am trying? (Assuming 3rd party libraries like Boost are unavailable) Thanks!
