How is the class label applied in the softmax function?

Im reading this paper: Uncertainty in Deep Learning and in it (page4), the softmax loss is defined as \begin{align*} E(X,Y) = -\frac{1}{N} \sum^N_{n=1} \log(\hat{p}_{n,c_n}), \end{align*} where $c_n \in \{1,...,D\}$ is the class label for input $n$ , and $\hat{p}_{nd} = \exp(\hat{y}_{nd})/(\sum_{d'} \exp(\hat{y}_{nd'})$ is the element-wise softmax-function applied to model prediction vector $\hat{y}$ . Where does the class label $d$ actually show up in the softmax calculation? I.e. what does $\hat{y}_{nd}$ or $\hat{p}_{n,c_n}$ respectively shall mean? Thanks
