F# - Breaking a List into Concatenated Strings by an Interval

I have a list of email addresses, and I need to send an email notification to each address. I'd like to do this in blocks of 25 addresses at a time. Is there any quick way in a functional language like F# to "fold" (concatenate) 25 emails addresses together... each separated by a semicolon. I know there is the String.Split method in .NET, but I need to concat 25 at a time. What is the most elegant way to perform this in F#?
