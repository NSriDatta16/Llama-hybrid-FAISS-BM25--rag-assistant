Chi-square have H0 that the distribution among all groups is the same. So it will be significant if just one group is different, but you won't know which. Logistic regression will be more informative, since it will create a set of dummy variables for each group and run test whether coefficients for each dummy variable is statistically significantly differ from 0. Some code library(tidyverse) data_frame(a = sample(c(0, 1), 20, prob = c(0.4, 0.6), replace = TRUE), b = sample(c(0, 1), 20, prob = c(0.6, 0.4), replace = TRUE), c = sample(c(0, 1), 20, prob = c(0.8, 0.2), replace = TRUE)) %>% gather(var, value, a:c) -> df fit % count(var, value) %>% spread(value, n) -> df chisq.test(df[,-1]) UPDATE If you want to compare all three groups you could relevel the var variable, using factors. df $var var, levels = c("b", "c", "a")) # now b will be a reference point fit_2
