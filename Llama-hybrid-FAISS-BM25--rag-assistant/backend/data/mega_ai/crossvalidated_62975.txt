Regression without obvious dependent variable

Say I have 4 variables: Anxiety, Depression, Memory and Attention. I've given tests to subjects and now have a list of scores for each variable. Say I want to know the relation between cognitive capacities (Memory and Attention) and mood (Depression and Anxiety). The problem here is that there is no way to select a theoretically supported dependent variable in my case. Bad cognitive faculties lead to worse mood, but bad mood also causes worse cognitive functioning. So now I'm wondering: how do I model this thing? Should I just select the 2 mood variables as dependents and run Memory and Attention as predictors? If I reverse this does it matter for the results? Or does it only matter for the interpretation of the results? I feel like I'm struggling with a very obvious problem but cannot figure out what to do. My only other thought was that regression simply does not apply to a model without direct effects and I'm doing this thing the whole wrong way.
