Probably the revenue per cookie has a normal distribution (you can check this with bootstrapping). The revenue per si do not have a normal distribution, just the revenue per cookie. That said, you can applied an hypothesis test as usually an check is the difference in revenues per user in two groups are significant. Other approach is considers the revenue distribution as a combination of two others distribution. The first one is the distribution for the conversion (buy or not) and the other distribution if for the average revenue per order.
