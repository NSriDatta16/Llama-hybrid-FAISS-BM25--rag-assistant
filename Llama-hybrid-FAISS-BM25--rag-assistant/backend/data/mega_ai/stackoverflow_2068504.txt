307 came about because user agents adopted as a de facto behaviour to take POST requests that receive a 302 response and send a GET request to the Location response header. That is the incorrect behaviour â€” only a 303 should cause a POST to turn into a GET. User agents should (but don't) stick with the POST method when requesting the new URL if the original POST request returned a 302. 307 was introduced to allow servers to make it clear to the user agent that a method change should not be made by the client when following the Location response header.
