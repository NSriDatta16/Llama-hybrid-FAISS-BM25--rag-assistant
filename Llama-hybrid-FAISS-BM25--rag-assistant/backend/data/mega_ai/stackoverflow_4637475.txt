Indexes generally aren't well suited for custom calculations where the user is able to construct their own queries. Typically you choose the indexes to match the specific queries you intend to run, using EXPLAIN to see if the index is being used. In the case that you have absolutely no idea what queries might be performed it is generally best to create one index per column - and not one index covering all columns. If you have a good idea of what queries might be run often you could create an extra index for those specific queries. You can also add indexes later if your users complain that certain types of queries run too slow. Also, indexes generally aren't that useful for calculating counts, sums and averages since these types of calculations require looking at every row.
