Linear regression what does the F statistic, R squared and residual standard error tell us?

I'm really confused about the difference in meaning regarding the context of linear regression of the following terms: F statistic R squared Residual standard error I found this webstie which gave me great insight in the different terms involved in linear regression, however the terms mentioned above look a like quite a lot (as far as I understand). I will cite what I read and what confused me: Residual Standard Error is measure of the quality of a linear regression fit.......The Residual Standard Error is the average amount that the response (dist) will deviate from the true regression line. 1. This is thus actually the average distance of the observed values from the lm line? The R-squared statistic provides a measure of how well the model is fitting the actual data. 2. Now I'm getting confused because if RSE tells us how far our observed points deviate from the regression line a low RSE is actually telling us "your model is fitting well based on the observed data points" --> thus how good our models fits, so what is the difference between R squared and RSE? F-statistic is a good indicator of whether there is a relationship between our predictor and the response variables. 3. Is it true that we can have a F value indicating a strong relationship that is NON LINEAR so that our RSE is high and our R squared is low
