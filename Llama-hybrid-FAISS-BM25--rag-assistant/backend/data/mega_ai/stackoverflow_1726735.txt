It's not Facebook Connect, really, but at least it's webapp FBML handling: http://github.com/WorldMaker/pyfacebook/.../facebook/webappfb.py This guy made a post about Facebook Connect on Google AppEngine via webapp framework. (It's stickied in the Connect Authentication forum , with 8515 views.) Here's an example from May 15: http://myzope.kedai.com.my/blogs/kedai/236 It's based on the Guestbook example webapp, but with Facebook for authentication instead. The author does note that, "there's code duplication (when instantiating pyfacebook) in different classes," and that there should be a better way to do this. Django sounds like it's better integrated. There's a presentation from 4 months ago on Slideshare called Where Facebook Connects Google App Engine (Robert Mao's talk at Facebook Garage Ireland). It looks like an interesting talk, though no videos of it have been posted at the moment. On slide 13, the following tools are mentioned, including Django : Google App Engine SDK, Eclipse, PyDev, Django, App Engine Patch and pyFacebook. Sample application given: http://github.com/mave99a/fb-guinness/ If you merely want authentication, this Recipe suggests using RPXnow.com for Google, AOL, Yahoo, MySpace, Facebook and OpenID logins with the Webapp Framework. Might be helpful, though doesn't appear at first glance to use Connect, is a contributed howto article on GAE's site for creating a Facebook App with Best Buy Remix.
