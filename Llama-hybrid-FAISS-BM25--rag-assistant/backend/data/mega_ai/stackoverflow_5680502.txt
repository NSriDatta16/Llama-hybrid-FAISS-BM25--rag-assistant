In my opinion, a SQLite database seems most appropriate for this kind of application. There is lots of support for using the SQLite database in conjuction with ListViews (which I imagine you'd want to use in your to-do list app). In case you haven't already checked it out, see the page on the developer site: http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/data-storage.html#db
