If you're specifically after parsing links out of web-pages, then Perl's WWW::Mechanize module will figure things out for you in a very elegant fashion. Here's a sample program that grabs the first page of Stack Overflow and parses out all the links, printing their text and corresponding URLs: #!/usr/bin/perl use strict; use warnings; use WWW::Mechanize; my $mech = WWW::Mechanize->new; $mech->get("http://stackoverflow.com/"); $mech->success or die "Oh no! Couldn't fetch stackoverflow.com"; foreach my $link ($mech->links) { print "* [",$link->text, "] points to ", $link->url, "\n"; } In the main loop, each $link is a WWW::Mechanize::Link object, so you're not just constrained to getting the text and URL. All the best, Paul
