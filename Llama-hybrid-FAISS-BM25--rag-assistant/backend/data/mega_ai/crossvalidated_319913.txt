You can have a categorical (nominal) feature called "Weather" with the cardinalities: "Rainy", "Sunny", etc. For the days where you have no data, you can represent missingness explicitly by adding a "No Weather Data" category. You can feed your data into a random forest, or any linear / non-linear model in this way. Obviously you will need to one-hot encode your nominal feature(s) before feeding it in. If you use R, this is done automatically with most packages so you don't have to worry about it. In Python, you have to do this manually.
