to make a self-contained exe that extracts files and other commands

I am making a filtering sniffer in C and winPCAP that starts on every boot. For this I want to make a self-contained exe file that extracts (no, not compression!) the exe and DLLs to a new folder and performs other commands (like modify startup settings) silently, without showing any window/terminal. So The single file contains an exe and DLLs. When executed, it copies the files to a folder and does other commands It does it silently, without any windows or terminals or user intervention I stress on the silent part, so I cant choose some easy installers. Can you reccomend something that generates this executable? For the curious: its a stealth packet logger program for my college project. The "stealth" part will be tried out only on xp2 virtual machines with IE6 (yeah, old stuff). EDIT : answering the commenters: it is of a malware character . So I am running it in virtualbox, never on the loose . And I can compromise only an unpatched xp systems with IE6, without antivirus, that is from an OLD install disk. Thats the scope of the IE css use after free vulnerability, AFAIK never seen in the wild. So there is no unethical behavior involved.
