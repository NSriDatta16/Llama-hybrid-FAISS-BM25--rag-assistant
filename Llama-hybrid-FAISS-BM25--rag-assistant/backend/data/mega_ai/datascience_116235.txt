Can I use scikit learn's cross_val_predict with cross_validate?

I am looking to make a visualization of my cross validation data in which I can visualize the predictions that occurred within the cross validation process. I am using scikit learn's cross_validate to get the results of my bayesian ridge model's (scikit learn BayesianRidge) performance, but am unsure if my plot using cross_val_predict expresses the same predictions? My plot is a one-to-one plot of the predicted labels that occurred during cross validation versus the observed labels the model trained on. I use the same number of folds in both cross_validate and cross_val_predict. Basically, I just want to know if the plot I make with cross_val_predict can be described by the returned performance metrics from cross_validate? Thanks for the help
