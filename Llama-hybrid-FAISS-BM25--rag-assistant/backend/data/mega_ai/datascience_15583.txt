how can I visualize the bag-of-words in a scatterplot

I have a bag-of-words consisting of about 60000 features. Each feature represents a diminsion. I want to represent this bag-of-words in a reduced 2D space. How do I do it? I have see an example here , which looks more like what I want but not really the same. In the example they have 2 transform and I only have one. Therefore as suggested I do not want to use pipeline. Below is my code which taking for ever and does not show any error message: #myList contents about 800000 words bag_of_words = vec.fit_transform(myList) X = bag_of_words.todense() pca = PCA(n_components=2).fit(X) data2D = pca.transform(X) plt.scatter(data2D[:,0], data2D[:,1]) plt.show() I have not found any better option and right now it looks like I am doing something wrong. What is the best way to visualize a bag-of-words in a scatterplot? The bag_of_words looks like this: (0, 548) 3 (0, 4000) 6 (0, 15346) 1 (0, 23299) 1 (0, 22931) 2 (0, 32817) 1 (0, 51733) 1 (0, 38308) 6 (0, 14784) 1 (0, 146873) 1 ....
