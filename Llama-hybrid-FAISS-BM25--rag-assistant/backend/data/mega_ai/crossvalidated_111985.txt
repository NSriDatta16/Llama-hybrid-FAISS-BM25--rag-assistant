I had the similar question in mind when trying to comparing methods like SVD, PCA, and LSA (latent Sementic Analysis), and NMF (Non-negative Matrix Factorization). To concur Bitwise's point, the NMF wikipedia page http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-negative_matrix_factorization states that "It has been shown [27][28] NMF is equivalent to a relaxed form of K-means clustering: matrix factor W contains cluster centroids and H contains cluster membership indicators, when using the least square as NMF objective. This provides theoretical foundation for using NMF for data clustering." The citations are: [27] C. Ding, X. He, H.D. Simon (2005).
