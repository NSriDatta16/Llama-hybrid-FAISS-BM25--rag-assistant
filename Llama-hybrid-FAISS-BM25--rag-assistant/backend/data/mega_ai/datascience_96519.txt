My understanding of your problem is the target is weight and the point cloud are the features. Creating a different representations of the point cloud that are amenable to machine learning is called feature engineering. Possible feature engineering options: Input each individual cloud point. Calculate total volume of cloud points. Template matching. Define shapes and then categorize each point cloud into one of those shapes. The shapes could be for the entire point cloud or subsets.
