What about QueryContinueDrag event handler http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.control.querycontinuedrag.aspx ? You can hook a handler to any control and check if there is a ongoing drag&drop operation and then cancel it if you want to. Ooops, sorry, I just saw that the guy before me already mentioned that. Me bad.
