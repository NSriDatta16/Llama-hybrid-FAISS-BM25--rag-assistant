Oh, come on now, Hannes. I only hunt down people for things like . If I may, a slight correction. . is a valid character when it's been escaped, just as nearly anything you can type on a keyboard. (It should only require one backslash to escape, though; I'm not sure why JSfiddle thinks it needs two.) Hogan, you're correct that the point is the reason jQuery isn't finding the elements. That's because $(td.sede_co.uk) is saying "select any td element that has both sede_co and uk in its class attribute's value". In other words, it would select or or even . Note the spaces in those values, which maintain 'separation' between the different words. Since your cell's class value is literally sede_co.uk the selector can't find it. Escape it, and it can. Or else you could stop using points in class names. It'll probably be easier on you in the long run.
