ed an AI Core group and set up a Center of Excellence for AI and Big Data analysis at INS Valsura. Indian Army incubated Artificial Intelligence Offensive Drone Operations Project. During Exercise Dakshin Shakti 2021, the Indian Army integrated AI into its intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance architecture. In 2022, the Indian government established the Defence Artificial Intelligence Council and the Defence AI Project Agency, and it also published a list of 75 defense-related AI priority projects. MoD earmarked ₹1,000 crore annually till 2026 for capacity building, infrastructure setup, data preparation, and Al project implementation. The Indian Army, the Indian Navy and the Indian Air Force set aside ₹100 crore annually for the development of AI-specific applications. The military is already deploying some AI-enabled projects and equipment. At Air Force Station Rajokri, the IAF Centre of Excellence for Artificial Intelligence was established in 2022 as part of the Unit for Digitization, Automation, Artificial Intelligence, and Application Networking (UDAAN). Swarm drone systems were introduced by the Mechanised Infantry Regiment for offensive operations close to the Line of Actual Control. For offensive operations, the military began acquiring AI-enabled UAVs and swarm drones. Bharat Electronics developed AI-enabled audio transcription and analysis software for battlefield communication. Using AI during transport operations, the Indian Army's Research & Development branch patented driver tiredness monitoring system. As part of initial investment, the Indian Armed Forces is investing about $50 million (€47.2 million) yearly on AI, according to Delhi Policy Group. For high altitude logistics at forward outposts, military robots are deployed. Army is developing autonomous combat vehicles, robotic surveillance platforms, and Manned-Unmanned Teaming (MUM-T) solutions as part of the Defence AI roadmap. MCTE is working with the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology and, Society for Applied Microwave Electronics Engineering & Research, on AI and military-grade chipset. Phase III of AI-enabled space-based surveillance has been authorized. DRDO Chairman and Secretary of the Department of Defense Research & Development Samir V. Kamat said the agency started concentrating on the potential use of AI in the development of military systems and subsystems. The Indian government intends to leverage the private sector's sizable AI workforce and dual-use technologies for defense by 2026. In order to conduct research on autonomous platforms, improved surveillance, predictive maintenance, and intelligent decision support system, the Indian Army AI Incubation Center was established. Indian Navy launched INS Surat with AI capabilities. Russia Russian General Viktor Bondarev, commander-in-chief of the Russian air force, stated that as early as February 2017, Russia was working on AI-guided missiles that could decide to switch targets mid-flight. The Military-Industrial Commission of Russia has approved plans to derive 30 percent of Russia's combat power from remote controlled and AI-enabled robotic platforms by 2030. Reports by state-sponsored Russian media on potential military uses of AI increased in mid-2017. In May 2017, the CEO of Russia's Kronstadt Group, a defense contractor, stated that "there already exist completely autonomous AI operation systems that provide the means for UAV clusters, when they fulfill missions autonomously, sharing tasks between them, and interact", and that it is inevitable that "swarms of drones" will one day fly over combat zones. Russia has been testing several autonomous and semi-autonomous combat systems, such as Kalashnikov's "neural net" combat module, with a machine gun, a camera, and an AI that its makers claim can make its own targeting judgements without human intervention. In September 2017, during a National Knowledge Day address to over a million students in 16,000 Russian schools,
