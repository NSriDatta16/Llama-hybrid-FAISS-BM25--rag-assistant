Choose any distance based clustering algorithm. Have a look at ELKI . First of all they have probably the largest choice in clustering algorithms, plus you can plug in arbitrary distance functions easily. They also have Pearson correlation distance along with various specialized time series distances. Depending on your domain knowledge, DBSCAN could be a good choice. If you can define a reasonable threshold and minimum cluster size.
