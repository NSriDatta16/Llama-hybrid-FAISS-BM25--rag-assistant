accessing php session from a command line java program

I am designing an enterprise security server for our company - we own many different applications, most written in java and a few written in PHP. I could provide a remote API that would give each application access to the server. I could also create 'agents' that each application could include that would do all the work for them, but allow my server control over their sessions and thus their authentications/authorizations. Issue is I would probably be better to write the agent in java because 80% or more of our apps are in java. If I wrote the agent in java does anyone know if there was a way this program could access the php session? If not does anyone have a suggestion regarding a better way to go about doing this?
