I make a separate readonly list of readonly digest objects (or structs) that are lightweight and cannot be manipulated. The collection can be customized for whatever needs you might have as normal. Retrieval of a full object can be used by passing a "digest" object to a type conversion, or factory or constructor - whatever techniques you are using. Note that this is an optimization which only happens when a collection of full-blown objects is simply getting too slow. It can easily be created at that point. Generally such classes are not created until necessary.
