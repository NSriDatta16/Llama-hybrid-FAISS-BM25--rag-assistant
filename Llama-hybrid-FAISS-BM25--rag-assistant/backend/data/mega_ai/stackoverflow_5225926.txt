Sorry, apart from my little joke :) for accessing service information, you would use ServiceController class but unfortunately that will not work since that information is not exposed. Your choice is to read the registry and open the key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SQLAgent$SQLEXPRESS2008 or any other sql service you have and then read the ObjectName entry. For reading registry, have a look here .
