I can suggest you two possible solutions: 1) Buy Amazon's service (Amazon S3). For 100 TB it will cost you 14 512$ monthly. 2) much cheaper solution: Build two custom backblaze storage pods ( link ) and run a MogileFS on top of it. Currently I'm investigating how to store petabytes of data using similar solutions, so if you find something interesting on that, please post you notes.
