I actually often run into that problem. My two favorite ways to generate a time series with auto-correlation in R depend on if I want a stationary process or not. For a non stationary time series I use a Brownian motion. For example, for a length 1000 I do: x For a stationary time series I filter a Gaussian noise. For example this looks like: x In that case, the auto-correlation at lag $\tau$ is 0 if $\tau > 2$. In other cases, we have to compute the correlation between sums of variables. For example for $\tau = 1$ the covariance is $$ Cov(X_1;X_2) = Cov(Y_1+Y_2+Y_3; Y_2+Y_3+Y_4) = Var(Y_2) + Var(Y_3) = 2. $$ So you see that the auto-covariance drops down linearly up until $n$ where $n$ is the length of the filter. You can also want to do long memory time series (like fractional Brownian motion), but this is more involved. I have an R implementention of the Davies-Harte method that I can send you if you wish.
