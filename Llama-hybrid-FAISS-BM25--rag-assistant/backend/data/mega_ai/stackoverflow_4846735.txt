Understanding language is complicated, so the goal you need to determine first is what aspect of language you want to understand. An AI must be able to understand what the person says to it, then relate it to what it already knows, and then generate a legitimate response. These three steps can all be thought of as nearly independent, so you need to address each on its own. The brain, the world's best language processor, uses a Neural Network, but that's not likely to work well for you. A logic-based proof solving system, where facts that follow from facts are derived would probably work best, and I know of at least one system that uses it fairly effectively.
