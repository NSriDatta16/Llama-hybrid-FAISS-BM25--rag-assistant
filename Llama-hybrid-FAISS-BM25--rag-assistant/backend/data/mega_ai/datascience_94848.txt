I think these real-world industrial applications of Bayesian analysis might be helpful to you: "Bayesian Product Ranking at Wayfair" , David J. Harris, Wayfair blog, Jan. 20, 2020 "Bayesian modelling for cross-city learning at Glovo" , Javier Mae Adell, Glovo Engineering blog, Apr. 30, 2021 "Tutorial: How We Productized Bayesian Revenue Estimation with Stan" , Markus Ojala, Smartly.io blog, Jun 21, 2017 "Marriages made in heaven with a little help from Bayes" , Sriram Sharma, FactorDaily.com, May 14, 2018 Also, Uber, in particular, has done a ton with Bayesian optimization, Bayesian forecasting methods (Orbit), and Bayesian hierarchical/multilevel models (probabilistic programming language Pyro/NumPyro). For example, see the following results returned by searching the Uber Engineering website: Search: "Bayesian" . Interested in more? In general, I track developments in Bayesian Analysis and its application in industry here: "Bayesian" , a Flipboard mashup ezine I hope this has been a useful answer.
