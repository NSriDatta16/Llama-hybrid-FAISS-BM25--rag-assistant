You can't add keywords to the language but everything is an object and everything can be extended with prototyping. I wouldn't normally link to crockford but he actually has quite a decent coverage of this , which will afford you syntax of the form foo.inherits(bar); which is about as good as one could wish for. This is quite a common pattern.
