How can I display code better on my blogger blog?

These days, in any site where they show a code fragments (even in Stackoverflow), the code is nicely wrapped around a GUI element which highlights syntax elements, provides line numbers, etc. I want to show some ruby on rails code in my blog and I want those visual elements in my blog. How can I accomplish this on my blogger blog?
