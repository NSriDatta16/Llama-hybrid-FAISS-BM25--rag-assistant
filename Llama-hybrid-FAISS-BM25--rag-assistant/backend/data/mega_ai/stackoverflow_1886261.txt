The above answers (that I've seen so far) are all correct. Something else that isn't mentioned though is that companies/organisations define "large application" rather differently than programmers sometimes do. To the health service, a hospital medical information system is a "large application" even if it actually involves, say, a bunch of different web servers, databases, various custom scripts for integrating various third party products, specially written client programs for radiology diagnostics, different web interfaces for doctors and nurses, and SMS system for paging doctors when results have been uploaded, etc. In other words, where you might think "large application = 1 big binary", an organisation might think "large application = 1 noun for a bunch of big IT contracts, regardless of how many binaries are involved".
