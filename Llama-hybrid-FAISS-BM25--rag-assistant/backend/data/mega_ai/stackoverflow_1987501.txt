This strikes me as a workaround for a database design problem. I think the more elegant approach would be factoring the code in such a way as to have one method that handles each different program condition. I.e.: if (email == null) { DoStuffWhenEmailIsNull(); } else { DoStuffWhenEmailIsNotNull(); }
