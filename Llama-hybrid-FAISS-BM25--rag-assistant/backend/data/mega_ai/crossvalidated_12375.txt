If you just want to predict $Y$ then an explicit joint model for $X$ and $Y$ when $X$ is 4 dimensional is probably overkill. This is especially true if you truly don't have any information about the distribution of the $X_i$'s or the relationship between $Y$ and $X$. An exception would be if there is significant missingness in $X$, or perhaps measurement error in $X$. Bayesian approaches to binary regression will appear in any decent textbook on applied Bayesian methods; my usual recommendation is Bayesian Data Analysis by Gelman, Carlin, Stern & Rubin.
