Issue with receiving touches for a UIView subview of a MKMapView using MapKit

I have added a subclass of UIView as a subview to an MKMapView when a button is pressed. The UIView has its background colour set to be clear. This UIView is not getting messaged with any of the touchesBegan, etc. messages. The MKMapView seems to be receiving all the messages still as zooming still occurs on a double click, etc. How can I ensure that the subview is receiving the messages and is there a way to debug the responder chain, to see where the message is being sent. Thanks. If you need anymore information just say.
