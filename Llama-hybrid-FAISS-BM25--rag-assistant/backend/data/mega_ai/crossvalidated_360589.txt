How to decide between additive vs. multiplicative logistic regression model?

I want to collect data in an experiment where I manipulate two treatment factors. Factor A has two possible nominal values, Factor B has three possible nominal values. The outcome is binary. Therefore, I have six treatment groups. I assume that there is a multiplicative connection of my two factors because of the experimental setting. I want to generate an logistic regression model and test the impact of the factors. Although I do not treat independently with these factors: Is it useful or allowed to generate an additional additive model and compare both models to maybe find out that the additional model is more appropriate?
