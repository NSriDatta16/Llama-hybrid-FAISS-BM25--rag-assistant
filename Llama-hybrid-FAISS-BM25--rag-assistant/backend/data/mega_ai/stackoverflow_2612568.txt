calculating the potential effect of inaccurate triangle vertex positions on the triangle edge lenghts

i'm not sure how to solve the following problem: i have a triangle with each of the three known vertex positions A,B,C being inaccurate, meaning they can each deviate up to certain known radii rA, rB, rC into arbitrary directions. given such a triangle, i want to calculate how much the difference of two specific edge lengths (for instance the difference between lengths of edge a and edge b) of the triangle may change in the worst case. is there any elegant mathematical solution to this problem? the naive way i thought of is calculating all 360^3 angle combinations and measuring the edge differences for each case, which is a rather high overhead.
