In Bayesian statistics, data is considered nonrandom but can have a probability or be conditioned on. How?

In Bayesian statistics, parameters are said to be random variables while data are said to be nonrandom. Yet if we look at the Bayesian updating formula $$ p(\theta|y)=\frac{p(\theta)p(y|\theta)}{p(y)}, $$ we find probability (density or mass) conditioned on the data as well as the conditional and unconditional probability (density or mass) of the data itself. How does it make sense to consider probability (density or mass) conditioned on a constant or probability (density or mass) of a constant?
