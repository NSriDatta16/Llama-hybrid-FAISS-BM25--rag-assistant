Android out of memory on image capture

I have an Activity which takes photos (with full possible resolution, so quite large), the application have then the chance to analyze them. Only one photo is handled at a time. The problem is that I run in to a "Out of memory" after 4 - 5 photos. I see dalvikvm-heap Out of memory on a 5070745-byte allocation (the byte size varies) followed by Camera-JNI Couldn't allocate byte array for JPEG data My application does not crash but as it appears to me the Camera simply becomes unable to deliver the images from this point on. I pay attention to memory usage in my application but here it seems that there is a memory leak somewhere outside and I'm asking me how can I cope with this. Any solution approaches existing for this?
