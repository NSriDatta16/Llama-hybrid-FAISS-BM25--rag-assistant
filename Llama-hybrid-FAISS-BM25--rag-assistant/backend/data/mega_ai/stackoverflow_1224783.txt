I like Eclipse + PyDev (with extensions) . It is available on Windows, and it works very well well. However, there are many other IDEs , with strengths and weakness. As for the interpreter (Python is interpreted , not compiled !), you have three main choices: CPython, IronPython and Jython. When people say "Python" they usually refer to "CPython" that is the reference implementation, but the other two (based, respectively, on .Net and Java) are full pythons as well :-) In your case, I would maybe go on IronPython , because it will allow you to leverage your knowledge of .Net to build the GUI and treating the XML, while leaving the implementation of business logic to Python. Finally, should you decide to use CPython, finally, there are several choices for working with xml: minidom ; included in the standard library lxml , faster and with a better API; it means an additional installation on top of Python.
