web service for business logic or data access layer

This post http://www.theserverside.net/tt/articles/showarticle.tss?id=Top5WSMistakes encourages me to create the web service for business logic layer but many people use it in the data access layer. I want to create a project where i want to access the same data repository from a desktop application, website and a cell phone. What would you recommend me? Is there any case it may be a good idea to implement web services to both layers?
