Skip having an id-column. If you have a photo_id that is already unique you should use that instead. A primary key (in MySQL InnoDB) is automatically clustered, which means that the data is stored in the index, making for VERY efficient retrieval of an entire row if you use the primary key as reference. To answer your questions: Yes. And remove the id-column. It is an artificial key and provide no benefits over using the photo_id Yes. The primary key index is clustered and makes for very efficient querying on both exact and range-queries. (i.e. select * from photos where 2 ) A foreign key puts a constraint on your database tables, and ensure that the data in the tables are in a consistent state. Without foreign keys you have to have some application level logic to ensure consistency.
