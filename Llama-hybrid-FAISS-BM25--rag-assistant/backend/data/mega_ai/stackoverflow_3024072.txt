NTFS does not support mass amounts of .txt files well. Depending on how a flat file system is developed, the health of a harddrive can become an issue. A lot of older file systems use mass amount of small .txt files to store data. It's bad design, but tends to happen as a flat file system gets older. Fragmentation becomes an issue, and you lose a text file here and there, causing you to lose small amounts of data. Health of a hard drive should not be an issue when it comes to database design.
