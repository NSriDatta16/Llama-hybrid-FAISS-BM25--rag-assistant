In my company each developer is encouraged to save all db sctructure changes to a script files in the folder containing module's revision number. These scripts are kept in svn repository. When application starts, the db upgrade code compares current db version and code version and if the code is newer - looks into scripts folder and applies all db changes automatically. This way every instance of application (on production or developers machines) always upgrades db to their code version and it works great. Of course, some automation could be added - if we find a suitable tool.
