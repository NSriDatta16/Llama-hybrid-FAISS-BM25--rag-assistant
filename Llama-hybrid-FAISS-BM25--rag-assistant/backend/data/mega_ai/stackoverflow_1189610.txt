Why not heed the advice from the experts and Don't roll your own CSV parser . Your first thought is, "I need to handle commas inside of quotes." Your next thought will be, "Oh, crap, I need to handle quotes inside of quotes. Escaped quotes. Double quotes. Single quotes..." It's a road to madness. Don't write your own. Find a library with an extensive unit test coverage that hits all the hard parts and has gone through hell for you. For .NET, use the free and open source FileHelpers library .
