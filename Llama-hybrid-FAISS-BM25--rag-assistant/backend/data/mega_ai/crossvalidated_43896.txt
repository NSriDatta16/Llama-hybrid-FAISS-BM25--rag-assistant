I'm of the opinion that the "What's the application of this theory?" is a question that students of a theory should have to answer. Professor McGonagall spends all her time teaching and researching, it's up to her students to go find a use for the stuff in the world. (at least that's a kind-of defensible position, and the view I'll take just now) So perhaps the question should be: first, understand the algebra of quantum interactions (von Neumann algebra); then, look for things in the world which behave this way. Instead of "Who else has already done this work?" That said, one example that's tantalised me for a few years is V Danilov & A Lambert-Mogiliansky's use of von Neumann algebra in decision theory. Explicitly it is not about "quantum mechanics in the brain". Rather that "interfering (mental) states" might be a more accurate explanation of consumer behaviour than the usual picture:
