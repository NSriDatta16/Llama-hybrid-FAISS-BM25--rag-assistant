Why can't I get this page using wget in Ubuntu?

http://121.199.111.177 I access this URL using win7(IE8), it's ok, I can get the page. But if I using wget, or under Ubuntu desktop with Chrome or Firefox, I can't get any things. Like this: root@ubuntu:~# wget 121.199.111.177 --07:57:52-- http://121.199.111.177/ => `index.html.1' Connecting to 121.199.111.177:80... connected. HTTP request sent, awaiting response... Read error (Connection reset by peer) in headers. Retrying. I tried using user-agent, but still not work: root@ubuntu:~# wget --user-agent="Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1)" http://121.199.111.177/ --08:08:04-- http://121.199.111.177/ => `index.html.1' Connecting to 121.199.111.177:80... connected. HTTP request sent, awaiting response... Read error (Connection reset by peer) in headers. Retrying. Why? How can I get this page use wget?
