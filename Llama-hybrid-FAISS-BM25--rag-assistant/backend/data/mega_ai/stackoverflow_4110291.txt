Efficiently embedding Twitter/Facebook and Other counter widgets into a webpage when document.ready

For a new website I'm building, I'm trying to properly embed social media counter widgets from services such as Facebook, Twitter, Digg, Reddit, StumbleUpon, and Buzz. Using iFrame are messy and tags also cause major slowdowns when it comes to rendering and loading a page. I've noticed that pages often take significantly longer and pause loading half way down due to a slow response from one of those social networking sites. Therefore, I'm trying to write these widgets in once the document is ready. Is that a good idea? Or are there any drawbacks? Here are just a few of the examples: For a Facebook like button, I did this: $('.likebox').append(' '); However, how do I deal with widgets like this? " data-text=" " data-count="horizontal" data-via="twitter" data-related="twitter">Tweet or Any suggestions as to efficiently and properly embedding these or other widgets would be appreciated. Thanks!
