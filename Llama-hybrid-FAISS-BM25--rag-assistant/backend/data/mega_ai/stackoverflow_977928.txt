In all likelyhood, you don't want to access the block device via /dev/sd* or /dev/hd* directly. As others stated, you'll have to understand the raw underlying filesystem, and this will be very difficult. If you're writing an application that wants to treat bytes on disk as a big linear address space, then check out the mmap() system call. You can create a large, empty file on disk, and then use mmap() to map it into your process space. From there, you can use regular memory operations to read and write to the underlying large file. Note that writes are buffered, so guaranteeing consistency can be tricky. The advantage of this approach is that even if the underlying file is fragmented, your access pattern(s) can consider it as a linear collection of bytes.
