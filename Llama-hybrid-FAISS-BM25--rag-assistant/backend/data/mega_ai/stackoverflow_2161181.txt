Try doing: this.ddlAgent.DataTextField = "Text"; this.ddlAgent.DataValueField = "Value"; this.ddlAgent.DataSource = agentList; this.ddlAgent.DataBind(); Should also work, and it's probably better than looping through the list for no reason. Update Found another (shorter) way of doing this: this.ddlAgent.Items.AddRange(agentList.ToArray()); this.ddlAgent.DataBind(); By using Items.AddRange() instead of setting the source with DataSource , ASP is able to figure out that it should use the Text and Value properties.
