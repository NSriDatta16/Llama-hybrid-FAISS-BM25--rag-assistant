How to enable user to drag/drop WPF user controls anywhere on the page?

Now that I can make useful user controls in WPF (thanks to this stackoverflow answer ) I want to be able to put numerous user controls on one page in two columns and enable the user to be able to move them around according to preference, dragging the ones they use the most to the top, etc. Can anyone point me to code, tutorials, etc. which do this? I can imagine this has been made quite easy to do in WPF.
