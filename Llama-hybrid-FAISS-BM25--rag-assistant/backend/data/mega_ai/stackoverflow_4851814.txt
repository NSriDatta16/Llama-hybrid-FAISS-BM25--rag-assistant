Get X Y co-ordinates w.r.t image

I am new to mac application programming. I have created a cocoa-based application for MAC OS X. I have dragged a CustomView on my document Window (in Interface Builder). Then on my Custom View I have dragged a Image Well (with my image in it). When I run the application and click anywhere on my image I want to know the X Y co-ordinates w.r.t image. Any sample code will be much appreciated. Note: I don't want the X Y co-ordinates w.r.t document window. Thanks in advance.
