Override "private" function in JavaScript

I'm monkey-patching some of the jQuery's Draggable code*. The goal is to avoid modifying the original source files and patch dynamically one of the internal functions. The function _generatePosition is declared like this: (function($) { $.widget("ui.draggable", $.ui.mouse, { ... _generatePosition: function(event) { ... } } })(jQuery); Is it possible to achieve the dynamic replacement of it? *So it calculates the snapping grid relative to the top of parent element and not relative to the top of element being dragged. See here for more details.
