If you know some phrase or uncommon word from your file, you can search the raw sectors of the hard drive for pieces of text. This will turn up the text anywhere it might have been written: as paged out virtual memory, as a stil-existant file (temp file or saved file), or as temporary or saved file that was deleted and the space has not yet been rewritten. But it will be slow. And if the file was never written to disk, it will yield nothing. And what it yields may be fragmented or incomplete. Boot a Knoppix CD and start grepping! Knoppix is a linux installation that runs from CD, without writing to your hard drive. get knoppix: http://www.kernel.org/pub/dist/knoppix/KNOPPIX_V6.0.1CD-2009-02-08-EN.iso ) Boot it. Start a terminal. Search the hard drive: $ sudo grep "Four score and seven years" /dev/hda If it turns up anything, copy and paste to a text editor, and save to usb stick or send it to yourself via web-based email. If you have SCSI or SATA disks, you need to use /dev/sda instead of /dev/hda The other answer is correct, every moment that OS continues running decreases your recovery chances. pull the power and use another computer to prepare the knoppix CD.
