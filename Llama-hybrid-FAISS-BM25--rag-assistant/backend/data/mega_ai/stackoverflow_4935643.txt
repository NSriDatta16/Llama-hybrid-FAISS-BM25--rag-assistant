Erlang has no abstract data types as such. A standard way of defining a data type is by a module which provides all access functions into the data and the user is expected not to bypass them. Examples of this in OTP are things like sets , dict and array . This usually works well but you have to know what type the data is. Sometimes the structure is defined but the user is expected to "behave themselves" when working on the data, an example is ordsets . Note however that in all cases the data is standard immutable Erlang data which is not up-datable as in most traditional OO languages. I can only reiterate what has been said in the other answers and don't try to use OO-style in a non-OO language like Erlang, and vice-versa for that matter. The result will not be elegant and beautiful. A final comment: that definition of quicksort while it is concise and simple is very inefficient.
