Predicting future transporation mode based on previous patterns

I want to predict future transportation mode (car,walk, bus) of a user in a trip. A trip is composed of multiple segments and each segment consists of features like speed, distance, time and transportation mode. Based on known features of previous segments (here segment 1,2,3) i want to predict the transportation mode or if possible predicting the features of next segment (segment 4) and so on for segment 5,6 etc. segment No -> speed -> distance -> time -> transportation mode segment 1 -> 70 km/h -> 30 km -> 28 min -> car segtment 2 -> 3 km/h -> 1 km -> 15 min -> walk segment 3 -> 40 km/h -> 10 km -> 20 min -> bus segment 4 -> ??? -> ??? -> ??? -> ??? segment 5 -> ??? -> ??? -> ??? -> ??? . . . . . segment n -> ??? -> ??? -> ??? -> ??? which statistical or machine learning models would be helpful to predict the future transportation modes based on existing patterns?
