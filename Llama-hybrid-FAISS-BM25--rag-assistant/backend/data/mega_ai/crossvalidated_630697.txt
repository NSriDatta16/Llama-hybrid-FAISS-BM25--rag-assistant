Standard approaches would be any distance-based clustering (such as complete or average linkage or partitioning around medoids) using an appropriate distance measure. The standard distances would be simple matching and Jaccard (R-function daisy with metric="gower" and type "asymm" or "symm" ); there are some more in the literature, but one of these two makes sense in many applications. Jaccard ( "asymm" ) is the method of choice if joint presences (1) are meaningful but joint absences (0) are not; if 0 and 1 should be treated symmetrically, simple matching ( "symm" ) is better. Alternatively, one could fit a latent class mixture model assuming local independence within clusters (R-package poLCA ). I'd absolutely plot a binary heatmap to get some feel for what is going on before deciding what clustering method(s) to take (note however that what is seen from this depends on the order of observations, and a standard approach for ordering them is hierarchical clustering, so this may already involve clustering).
