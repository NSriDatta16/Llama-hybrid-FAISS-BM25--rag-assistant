HTML5 Canvas: globalCompositeOperation (eraser)

How can I use globalCompositeOperation for erasing something? http://canvaspaint.org/ has an eraser, but that's just a white line - ok only if your background is white... I know you can use ctx.clearRect(). But it didn't really worked for me because while dragging a mouse with eraser (set to 8x8px) it only makes unconnected 8x8px squares - not really a smooth line. Is there a way how to use globalCompositeOperation as an eraser? Something like: ctx.globalCompositeOperation = "___something___"; ctx.beginPath(); ctx.lineTo(mouseX , mouseY); ctx.closePath(); Thank you.
