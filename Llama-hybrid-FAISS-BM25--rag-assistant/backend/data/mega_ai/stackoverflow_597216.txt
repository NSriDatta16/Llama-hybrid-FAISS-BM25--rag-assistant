Is there a clean way to set a VS 2008 setup project's properties at build time?

I have an Office add-in project with a setup project for deployment (using VS 2008), and I need to build the same product in a few different flavours. I'm looking for a good way to make the installer resources dependent on the build configuration. The product name, manufacturer, manufacturer url, author, etc., etc. properties should be different for each of the builds. Also, the images shown in the installer UI will be different as well. If possible, I'd like to do this without creating a new project for each different UI. I believe this could be done using the ORCAS tool and build events, but this approach seems overly complex and fragile. Does anyone have any ideas on a clean way to go about doing this?
