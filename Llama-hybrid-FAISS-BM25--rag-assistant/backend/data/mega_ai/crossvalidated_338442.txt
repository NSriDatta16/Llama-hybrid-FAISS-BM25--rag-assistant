You are specifying an I(2) process, so you're specifying that the change in the time series is itself integrated. The forecast for the change of the series is then like a random walk (i.e. it won't die out). This estimate of this change (and so the forecast going forward) is encapsulated by the last estimated state (i.e. when the model is cast in state space form). Because the change of the series is fixed (either positive or negative depending on the last estimated states), the forecast will trend up or down, regardless of the AR and MA coefficients. Since the model is seasonal, there will also be a seasonal pattern, but the same general explanation applies to a non-seasonal ARIMA model with d=2. It seems like you don't need seasonal differencing here - have you considered SARIMAX(0,1,0)(1,0,1,24)?
