Selecting the best model using cross-validation on coefficient of determination and/or mean squared error

Let's say I'm doing regression and I want to know whether I should use Linear Regression or Random Forests. I do 10-fold cross validation on each model to obtain scores of $R^2$ and Mean Squared Error (MSE). How do I then compare these lists of numbers to see which is better? Do I choose the one that has the highest mean $R^2$ ? Or what about the lowest mean MSE? Or maybe the highest minimum $R^2$ , or the lowest maximum MSE, or some weighted average of these quantities? What if the $R^2$ is better on one but the MSE is better on another? Is it arbitrary? Does it depend entirely on the particular problem I'm trying to solve? Is there a generally accepted silver bullet?
