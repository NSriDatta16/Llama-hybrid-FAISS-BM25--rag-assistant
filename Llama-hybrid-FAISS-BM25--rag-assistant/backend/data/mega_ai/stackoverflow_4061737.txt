If you are using C++, Wordnet comes with an interface on its own. You should find them in your WN distribution. If you are using C#, then sharpnlp.codeplex.com is the place for you, they have a Wordnet interface. Wordnet also has a Perl distribution, but I don't know if they can be directly used because I dont use Perl. Best regards, David
