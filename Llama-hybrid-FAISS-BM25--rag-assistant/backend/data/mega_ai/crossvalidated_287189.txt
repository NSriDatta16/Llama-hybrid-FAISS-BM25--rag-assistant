What is the appropriate test for a small sample size?

I have weather stations collecting data (temperature, humidity, solar radiation, wind, etc.) inside and outside low-tech greenhouses. Four of the weather stations are inside, and one is outside. I am testing to see if the differences between inside and outside are statistically significant. I have taken hourly data and averaged it to monthly. I want to test each monthly average: inside vs. outside. Temperature and humidity are close to normal. The other variables are not. A: Can I test statistical significance? B: What approach would I use? Please let me know if I am missing any details from my study. As I am new to statistics, I don't always know what's important to provide. Thanks.
