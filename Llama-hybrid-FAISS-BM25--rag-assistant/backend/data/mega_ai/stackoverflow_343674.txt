IMHO the important thing about Functional Specs (and all other formal methods/tools for software development and project planning (Yourdon, SSADM, PRINCE2, UML, etc) is that they encourage good practice by making you think along common lines.They don't guarantee success but they encourage success by formalising good practice So the fact that FSs are created is a good thing, even if perhaps they could be better. Some planning and preparation is better than none at all - which is what a lot developers do. What should ideally go into a FS? As much as is necessary and as little as possible. Just because some functional specs cover X, Y & Z doesn't mean yours should. If you become too prescriptive, you will add unnecessary bureaucracy to simpler projects; correspondingly, for complicated projects, a prescriptive approach might encourage the developer to stop short of the level of detail that they really ought to go to.
