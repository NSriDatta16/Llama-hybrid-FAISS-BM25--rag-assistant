Just to elaborate on my comment, here's an example of how your apparent pattern could be an artifact caused by the distribution of data along the x-axis. I generated 100,000 data points. They're normally distributed in the x-axis ($\mu = 2500, \sigma =600$) and exponentially distributed in the y-axis ($\lambda = 1$). Following the "visual envelope" of the scatter plot, there's a clear, although illusory, pattern: y looks maximal in the range 1000 To prove it, I calculated the average y value in bins of x (black line). This is approximately constant for all x. If the data was distributed according to our intuition from the scatter plot, the average in the 1000 I'm not saying this is the whole story with your data. But I would bet it's a partial explanation. Addendum with actual Donors Choose data. Original scatterplot with overstriking markers: Same scatterplot with reduced opacity: Different patterns appear, but with 800K data points, there is still a lot of detail lost to overstriking. Zoom, reduce opacity again and add smoother:
