ental to get comprehensive information regarding the analysed anatomical region. It is widely employed in image-guided surgery, tumour monitoring, and treatment assessment. For example, in radiotherapy planning, image registration allows to correctly deliver the treatment and evaluate the obtained results. Thanks to the wide range of implemented algorithms, the use of the elastix software allows physicians and researchers to test different registration pipelines from the simplest to more complex ones, and to save the best one as a configuration file. This file and the fact that the software is completely open-source makes it easy to reproduce the work, that can help supporting the open science paradigm, and allows fast reuse on different patients data. In image-guided surgery, registration time and accuracy are critical points, considering that, during the registration, the patient is on the operating table, and the images to be registered have lower resolution compared to the target ones. In this field, the possibility to exploit elastix with high-level languages, such as OpenCL, opens to research in the usage of GPUs and other hardware accelerators.
