Its not elegant, but one way to do this is to use the onItemRendered property of the lists assistant. The function assigned is passed the list widget, item model and the item node. In this handler, you can then find your toggle widget inside the item node, and attach your functionality. Something like this : onItemRendered: function(listWidget, itemModel, itemNode){ var item = itemNode.select('div.mywidget').first(); Mojo.Event.listen(item, Mojo.Event.tap, this.handleTap.bind(this)); }.bind(this) There are some examples of how to use onItemRendered in the source code for the built in applications. The Tasks app for example, does this to cancel the ability to delete "special" items.
