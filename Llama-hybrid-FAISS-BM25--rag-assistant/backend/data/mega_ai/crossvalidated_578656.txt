Statistical analysis of dose effect on seed germination percentage data - Logistic regression?

I am trying to conduct a statistical analysis on seed germination data. Effect of 4 different plant extracts on seed germination is tested. Seed germination follows binomial distribution, as it is categorical variable (seed either germinates or not). Experimental design: Each of 4 different plant extract treatments have four levels (control and 3 different concentrations) Germination assay is tested in the following way: For each extract concentration 7 petri dishes with 10 seeds is planted (so 70 seeds per treatment concentration). So for each plant extract 70x4=280 seeds in total Data is collected by counting the proportion of germinated seeds per treatment (example: 4 of 10 seeds germinated) so percentage can be calculated for each treatment. Basic plot looks like this. In general extracts reduce germination percentage. Data frame is formatted in this way group germination extract SD SE 1 C 64.3 extract 1 1.51 0.571 2 I 60 extract 1 1.91 0.724 3 II 48.6 extract 1 1.21 0.459 4 III 47.1 extract 1 1.11 0.421 5 C 62.9 extract 2 1.70 0.644 6 I 71.4 extract 2 1.35 0.508 7 II 51.4 extract 2 1.07 0.404 8 III 41.4 extract 2 1.21 0.459 9 C 58.6 extract 3 1.77 0.670 10 I 60 extract 3 1.63 0.617 11 II 45.7 extract 3 1.99 0.751 12 III 37.1 extract 3 1.11 0.421 13 C 70 extract 4 0.577 0.218 14 I 61.4 extract 4 1.35 0.508 15 II 34.3 extract 4 1.40 0.528 16 III 31.4 extract 4 1.07 0.404 I would like to check whether there is a significant difference between treatment concentrations (control and three concentrations) and whether there is significant difference between plant extracts (to me it seems that it is possible only for certain concentrations, for example is there a difference in germination percentage between third concentration of different extracts). I know that ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis cant be used, I have considered Chi Square test (contingency tables for different concentrations), but I am not sure if it can be used for dose - response analysis. My favorite so far is Logistic regression, but I would need some help with R code for that, for determining the right type and parameters. Maybe something similar to this . I have the original data that represent counts of germinated seed per petri dish per extract per concentration. What would be the best type of analysis to show the desired differences? Thanks in advance! EDIT: @John Madden, here is the transformed dataset. I have transformed it to consist of a 1120 rows (each of 4 extracts with three concentration and control, so 4x4x70=1120) group germination extract 1 K 1 extract 1 2 K 1 extract 1 3 K 1 extract 1 4 K 1 extract 1 5 K 1 extract 1 6 K 1 extract 1 7 K 1 extract 1 8 K 0 extract 1 9 K 0 extract 1 10 K 0 extract 1 and it goes like this K, I, II, III for all 4 extracts, seems that I cant post whole dataset here.
