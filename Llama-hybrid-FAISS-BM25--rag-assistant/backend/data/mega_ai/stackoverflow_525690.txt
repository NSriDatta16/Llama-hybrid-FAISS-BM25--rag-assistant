Large Text and Images In SQL

Is it a good idea to store large amounts of text (eg html pages) inside your SQL database? Or is it a better idea to store it as html files in the filesystem? The same goes for images - is it a good idea to store image data in the database or better to put them on disk? Will storing large amounts of data cause me performance problems for example? What are the pros and cons of each method of storage? In terms of the size of data, in this case I am looking in the region of "a few pages" of HTML and images less than about 500kb in size (probably a lot smaller though). Enough to produce your average article/blog entry/etc scale web page.
