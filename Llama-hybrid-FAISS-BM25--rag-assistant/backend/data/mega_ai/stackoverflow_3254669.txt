How to implement QTextDocument serialization

This question I have asked before and just got answer that there is an open bug for this. But this is a really required feature and, I guess, each Qt programmer who programmes a more or less serious application, it is quite probable that there is used a QTextEdit and the data is inserted in QTextEdit is serialized and deserialized. Thus I consider this issue very importand and it can be useful for many Qt developers. So I have decided to discuss with good programmers how to implement operator So say in a QTextEdit I have some pictures and text. In different fragments the text has different format. How to get the content of this kind of QTextEdit and how to serialize, in order to show then as it was? EDIT: I know that I can get the formated text and images by using documnet() method, which returns QTextDocument. I also know that QTextDocument has no operator
