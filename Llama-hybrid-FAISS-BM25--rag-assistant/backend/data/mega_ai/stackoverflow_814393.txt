This is all freely available in MiscUtil . The Operator class provides access to generic arithmetic; and there are generic implementations (as extension methods) of Sum , Average , etc - and works with any type with suitable operators in addition to the primitives. So for example, you could use Sum with of Complex , etc. Note that it currently uses .NET 3.5; I did have a 2.0 version somewhere, but it isn't as tested.... A simplified example of sum is shown in the usage document : public static T Sum (this IEnumerable source) { T sum = Operator .Zero; foreach (T value in source) { if (value != null) { sum = Operator.Add(sum, value); } } return sum; } Although IIRC the actual implementation has a bit more... As an aside, note that dynamic (in .NET 4.0 / C# 4.0) supposedly supports operators, but we'll have to wait for the beta to see what it does. From my previous looks at dynamic in the CTP, I expect it to be a bit slower than the MiscUtil code, but we shall see.
