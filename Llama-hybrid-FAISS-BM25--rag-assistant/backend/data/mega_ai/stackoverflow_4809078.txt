EXE without Libraries / Runtimes?

I saw a software once that packed all the necessery runtimes + my exe file into one exe file. Then I can start the exe and it would start automatically (no runtimes installation) For example i have an old vb6 exe file and other dlls / ocx ... + vb6 runtimes... I dont care If the exe will be then 5 MB. :) I could do this with NSIS or other installer but is there something more elegant? (I know there is something like that! it was some commercial solution) Thanks
