Stuff you would need: Gesture recognition - resizing, tapping, dragging etc. Use a 2D surface for drawing. You can use a custom view and then draw on it by overriding the onDraw method. Buttons to select what you want to draw. Basically, detect gesture -> calculate changes in your view -> invalidate the view by calling invalidate() -> Redraw new view.
