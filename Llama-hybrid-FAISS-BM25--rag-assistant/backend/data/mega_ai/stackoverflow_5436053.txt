You could create a new data structure to hold these, though I think this is overkill. But, if you have an array of each word, or common phrase, then you store the index as an array for each word. You then pay 4 bytes for each word, but if each word is on average 3.6 characters, then you save yourself 3.2 bytes for each word, on average, since you pay the 2-byte/letter penalty once/word. But, in order to do searches or sorts you will take a big performance hit by having to rebuild the string at least for a short time. You may want to rethink how to design your program, as there are many programs that use large amounts of data and can operate in relatively restricted memory.
