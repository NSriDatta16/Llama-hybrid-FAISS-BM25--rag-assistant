Bit fields vary widely from compiler to compiler, sorry. With GCC, big endian machines lay out the bits big end first and little endian machines lay out the bits little end first. K&R says "Adjacent [bit-]field members of structures are packed into implementation-dependent storage units in an implementation-dependent direction. When a field following another field will not fit ... it may be split between units or the unit may be padded. An unnamed field of width 0 forces this padding..." Therefore, if you need machine independent binary layout you must do it yourself. This last statement also applies to non-bitfields due to padding -- however all compilers seem to have some way of forcing byte packing of a structure, as I see you already discovered for GCC.
