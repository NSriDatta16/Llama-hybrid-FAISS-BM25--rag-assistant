This seems like a situation where ordinal regression would be appropriate. See Chapter 13 of Frank Harrell's Regression Modeling Strategies or this UCLA web page for the commonly used ordinal logistic regression. Ordinal regression ignores the "known distance between the categories," but it's not immediately clear how important those known distances are, except for their ordering. It's not clear (to me, at least) what the "generalized" ordered logit model would add to that, and so far as I can tell that type of model also doesn't take the "known distance between the categories" into account. In response to comments: First, you aren't limited to a proportional-odds model. The R ordinal package provides several alternatives for ordinal regression. Second, the latent-variable interpretation of a cumulative-link ordinal regression provides something very close to "as x increases, the expected value of the response will change by ...". The idea is that there is some continuous underlying (latent) unobserved variable associated with the predictors, and that when you cross a threshold you jump into the next observed category. See Section 2.4 of the vignette on cumulative link models for the ordinal package, and illustrations as in Figure 1 of the vignette. In that interpretation, a regression coefficient represents the change in the expected value of the latent variable for a change in the associated predictor. The intercepts are related to the thresholds. With your data, analysis might benefit from the ability to specify a "symmetric" structure of thresholds in the ordinal package (although I don't have experience with that myself). This presumably can be handled by a Bayesian approach under a specific probability model, but that's outside my expertise.
