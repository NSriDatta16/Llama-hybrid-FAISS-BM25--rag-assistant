I'm not an expert in this area but I have written sample code in the past that did something similar to this. The approach I took was the following: in your Cocoa class where you want to update the text insert code similar to WebScriptObject *webScriptObject = [_webView windowScriptObject]; id result = [webScriptObject callWebScriptMethod:@"setTableRows" withArguments:[NSArray arrayWithObject:fauxData]]; where fauxData is whatever you want to pass to JS, and in the JS source have something similar to var mytable = document.getElementById("myTable"); var mytbody = document.getElementById("myTbody"); var docFragment = document.createDocumentFragment(); var myNewtbody = document.createElement("tbody"); myNewtbody.id = "myTbody"; var trElem, tdElem, txtNode; for(var j = 0; j and of course your HTML should have something like Last First Obviously this fills in rows of data in a table, but updating text would be similar.
