Programmatically suppressing AutoPlay for mass storage devices

I need to suppress autoplay for the mass storage devices. This needs to be achieved programatically through a service/deamon running in the background. I know it can be done by an application which opens a window and handles the "queryCancelAutoPlay" message sent by windows. Can this be done without GUI.I have the guid/pid/vid for the device whose autoplay needs to be disabled.
