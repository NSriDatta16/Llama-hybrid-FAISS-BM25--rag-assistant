Inclusion of significant interaction term in logistic regression table versus stratification for data presentation

This is a general question on logistic regression result reporting for a publication. We have an example where two well correlated ($r=0.4, p=0.001$) blood parameters ( blood parameter1 and blood parameter2 ) are associated with blood pressure in mixed sample of men and women, however, the effect is much stronger in women for blood `parameter1. UNIANOVA analysis includes age , gender , and one of the two blood parameters at a time as covariates, and blood pressure as independent variable. Each analysis shows the blood parameters as significant, however, when including gender × blood parameter1 , both the interaction term and blood parameter1 are significant. In women but not men blood parameter1 is highly correlated with blood pressure . The same interaction term using blood parameter2 ( gender × blood parameter2 ) is not significant. We are wondering whether for the publication of the data, we should include the table showing the interaction term where it is significant and not further include it/show it in the table where it isn't? I.e. show age , gender , blood parameter1 , gender × blood parameter1 in one table and age , gender , blood parameter2 , in the other? I would be grateful for an opinion. Alternatively, we could stratify the analysis for blood parameter1 by gender. The information seems to be the same, but it might be perceived in a different way.
