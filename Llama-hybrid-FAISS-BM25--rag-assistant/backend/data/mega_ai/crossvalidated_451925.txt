How do I change my neural network from a classification task to a regression task?

I currently have a neural network that is doing a reasonable job in classifying an image into a number of classes although not that great. These classes however are essentially buckets on a floating numeric scale (a T-score) of a baseline measurement. What is currently the best practice to adapt a classification network into a regression network? I can't seem to find any particular seminal papers working with similar problems as an reference (or maybe I have but just can't determine whether they are good practices or not). I mean the easiest way would be just to change the final fully-convolution layer into a linear output but I'm not sure if it would give good results. I was thinking if there is any way to minimize the correlation between the final feature layers (since this theoretically should make the linear regression more robust when the features an uncorrelated) but I'm not sure how to do this in a neural network setting. It'd be great if anyone could provide some suggestions or pointers as to which research papers I could reference.
