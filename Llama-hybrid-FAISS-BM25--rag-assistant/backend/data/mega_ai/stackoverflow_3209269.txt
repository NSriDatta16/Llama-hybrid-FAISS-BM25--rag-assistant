About Ruby Version Manager Installation

I was trying to install RVM:Ruby Version Manager from: http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/rvm/install/ I opened up my terminal in my mac os version 10.5.8 and use the command line bash then I got the message, "You must now finish the install manually: 1) Place the folowing line at the end of your shell's loading files(.bashrc or .bash_profile for bash and .zshrc for zsh), after all path/variable settings: [[ -s $HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm ]] && source $HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm Please note that this must only occur once - so, you only need to add it the first time you install rvm. 2) Ensure that there is no 'return' from inside the .bashrc file. (otherwise rvm will be prevented from working properly). This means that if you see '[ -z ] && return' then you must change this line to: if [[ ! -z ]] ; then ... original content that was below the && return line ... fi # sure to REMOVE the '&& return'. If you wish to DRY up your config you can 'source ~/.bashrc' at the bottom of your .bash_profile. placing all non-interactive items in the .bashrc, including the 'source' line above 3) Then CLOSE THIS SHELL and open a new one in order to use rvm. Installation of RVM to /Users/Home/.rvm/ is complete. kapplej-4:~ Home$ #!/usr/bin/env bash kapplej-4:~ Home$ kapplej-4:~ Home$ # Install git kapplej-4:~ Home$ mkdir -p $HOME/.rvm/src && cd $HOME/.rvm/src && version=1.6.5.3 kapplej-4:src Home$ curl -O http://kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/git-$version.tar.gz % Total % Received % Xferd Average Speed Time Time Time Current Dload Upload Total Spent Left Speed 100 2645k 100 2645k 0 0 953k 0 0:00:02 0:00:02 --:--:-- 1060k kapplej-4:src Home$ cd git-$version && ./configure --prefix=/usr/local && make && sudo make install -bash: cd: git-1.6.5.3: No such file or directory" I have no idea how to complete installation manually, I am a complete newbie so can someone please give me a step by step instruction on how to do this. For eg, where do I go to add those lines to the shell's loading files? Thanks,
