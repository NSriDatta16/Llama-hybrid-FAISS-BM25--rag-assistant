The problem with this question is: the similarity may be either a humanized-similarity (as you say "+- 90% similarity") or a statistical-similarity (Kondrad Rudolph's answer). The human-similarity can never be easily calculated: for instance these three words cellphone car message mobile automobile post The statistical-similarity is very low, while actually it's quite similar. Thus: it'll be hard to solve this problem, and the only think I can point you to is a Bayesian filtering or Artificial Intelligence with Bayesian networks .
