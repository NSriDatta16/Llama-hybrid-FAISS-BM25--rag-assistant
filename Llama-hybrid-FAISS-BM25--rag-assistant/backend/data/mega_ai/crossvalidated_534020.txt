Vector valued time series forecast significance testing?

I have two vector valued time series forecasts, and the components of the vector can be correlated. How do i significance test (ex. diebold mariano) for which is the better forecaster? I found two ways in the literature: summarize the forecast at each time step with RMSE [however this doesn't take into account correlations between components] do multiple testing, one hypothesis for each component?
