Query to calculate average time between successive events

My question is about how to write an SQL query to calculate the average time between successive events. I have a small table: event Name | Time stage 1 | 10:01 stage 2 | 10:03 stage 3 | 10:06 stage 1 | 10:10 stage 2 | 10:15 stage 3 | 10:21 stage 1 | 10:22 stage 2 | 10:23 stage 3 | 10:29 I want to build a query that get as an answer the average of the times between stage(i) and stage(i+1). For example, the average time between stage 2 and stage 3 is 5: (3+6+6)/3 = 5
