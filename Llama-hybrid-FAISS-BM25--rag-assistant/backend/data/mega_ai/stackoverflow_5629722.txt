How to design using patterns

I am a college student and I'm learning about software patterns (specifically the ones mentioned in the GoF book). I have never been that good at software design, but I'm learning how each pattern works and solves different problems to produce more flexible software. I have a question that has been bugging me. What's the best way to look at a problem (a piece of software that needs to be written) and determine how to organize it and apply patterns? I recently had a group Java project that went really sour because our design just wasn't very flexible. I honestly just had a great deal of trouble trying to break down the problem into manageable pieces to sort out. I know I can write code, but I don't know how to organize it. The patterns I have gone through currently are Composite, Builder, Adapter, Proxy, Observer, State, Strategy, Template Method, and Iterator. Like I have mentioned, I know what they are supposed to solve, but I feel like I am trying to force patterns into place. Any help or links to pages would be greatly appreciated. Thank you all!
