using a List that is ordered, I want to get next/previous urls

So I have a List collection that I fetch via a API call (which I don't have any control over). The list is ordered. public class Article { int articleID; string Url } So I have a Url value, using that I want to figure out the next and previous Url's if any. What's the most elegant way of doing this?
