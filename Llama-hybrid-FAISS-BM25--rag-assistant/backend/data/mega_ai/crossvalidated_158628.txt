I would try to reply using a simple example. Consider we have data where each record corresponds to a height and weight of a person. PCA might discover direction $(1,1)$ as the first component. This can be interpreted as overall size of a person. If you go in this direction, the person is taller and heavier. A complementary dimension would be $(1,-1)$ which means: height grows, but weight decreases. This direction can be interpreted as correction of the previous one: what cannot be distinguished by $(1,1)$ will be distinguished by $(1,-1)$. We cannot speak opposites, rather about complements. The further dimensions add new information about the location of your data. This happens for original coordinates, too: could we say that X-axis is opposite to Y-axis? The trick of PCA consists in transformation of axes so the first directions provides most information about the data location.
