It doesn't really matter, as long as you place your script tag in a valid part of your (X)HTML structure. You should be using jQuery's document.ready function to delay running the script until the whole document has been loaded. This means you're not dependent on the script coming after the HTML that it is manipulating. That being said, it is often preferable to put as much script as possible into external script files rather than embedding it in your views. (The external script files should be included at the bottom of the body of your HTML document since this gives the best browser performance)
