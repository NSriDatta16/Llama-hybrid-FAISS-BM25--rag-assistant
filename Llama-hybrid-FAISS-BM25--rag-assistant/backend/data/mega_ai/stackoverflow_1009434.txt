The expression A(1) is an r-value and constructs a new A value, the compiler may then copy this into a temporary object in order to bind to the const reference that push_back takes. This temporary that the reference is bound to is then copied into the storage managed by vector . The compiler is allowed to elide temporary objects in many situations but it isn't required to do so.
