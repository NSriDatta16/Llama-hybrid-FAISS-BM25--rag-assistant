How to add dummy variables for countries in time series data

I am running a binary logit regression. However, my independent variables consists of quantitative and dummy variables. Some of them are type of loan (5 types), loan purpose (5 types) and countries (15 countries). I made n-1 variables for each dummy variables. That is I created binary dummy variables for 4 types of loan and the type with largest observation is left as the base category. Is this correct? I tried same approach with countries. Is it correct to make 14 countries as binary variables? When I ran the regression with this approach, I am getting quasi complete separation error for one of the loan type. Can someone advise? Lastly, i also have one variable as risk score, it is either 5, 6, 7 or8 in all observations. Do i need to create a dummy variable for this? If yes, how? I have added an image of the estimated equation. The last 14 variables represent each country
