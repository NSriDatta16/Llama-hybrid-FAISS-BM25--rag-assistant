It seems to me that the ideal answer requires that you apply a parser that can recognize langauge substrings to the content of each comment. If the syntax error rate is small compared to the size of the comment, then you have commented-out code. To do this, you need a parser that is willing to parse incomplete code fragments. Program transformation systems that offer source-to-source transformations ( if you see this structure, replace it by that structure ) have this machinery built-in; they must parse code patterns comprising the source-to-source transformations, which are generally language sentential forms. Our DMS Software Reengineering Toolkit has exactly this property. As usual with DMS, it would have to be configured to parse VHDL (or Verilog) [this easy, DMS has full VHDL, Verilog and SystemVerilog front ends), scan the parse tree, find the attached comments (DMS captures comments as it parses), and then attempt to parse the comments using DMS's built-in "Pattern Parser". Some bookeeping to count syntax errors is needed. So this is possible. I suspect it isn't worth the trouble. Your regexp hueristic is probably pretty good especially when backed up by a human being, if that human doesn't mind having to extra code reviews.
