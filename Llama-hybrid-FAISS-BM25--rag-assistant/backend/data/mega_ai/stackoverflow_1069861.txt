The easiest way to fix this problem is to create a set of textfields off screen. Each field will handle the embedding for a single font and weight combination that you need. So, for example, if you need regular, bold, italic and both bold and italic for a single font, they you will have 4 textfields - each with embedding turned on, and the characters you need selected. Then you can simply turn on font embedding for any other textfield and it will be able to use all four styles (of that font).
