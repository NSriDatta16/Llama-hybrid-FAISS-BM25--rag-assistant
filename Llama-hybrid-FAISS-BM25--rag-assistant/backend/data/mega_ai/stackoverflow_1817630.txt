Using timeout is a tricking thing when it comes to timed-animation/effect. I didn't test your code but by browsing it, I noticed you are using setTimeout without anything to clear them. What happens when users trigger events during the 'delay'? You have got to implement something to manage that as well. Sorry I do not have an answer for you now, perhaps when I have more time later or someone comes out with a more elegant solution.
