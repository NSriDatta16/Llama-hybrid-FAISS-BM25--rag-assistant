Sending request using $.ajax to rails controller

I am using Rails 3 with JQuery. I have two variables, which I want to send from my javascript code to the controller and render my views so that they have new values of the variables. My request in javascript looks like this: function sendGPToServer(title, address) 14 { var dataString = 'name=' + title + '&address=' + address; $.ajax({ type: "GET", url: "/search", data: dataString, success: function() { alert("succeeded!"); } }); In pages controller (where the search action lives) I have protect_from_forgery :except => [:search] so it shouldn't be security problem. I get the "succeeded!" message but search does not get called. But if I reload the home page manually the values of the variables are filled in to my website page as I wanted. Does anyone know why can this be happening? Can it be because my javascript is included to the header of my html layout? (also: in routes.rb I have changed pages/search to search so it should not be a problem) Thank you
