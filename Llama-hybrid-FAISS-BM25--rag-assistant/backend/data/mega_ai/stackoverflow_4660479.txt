First, your image dimensions must be powers of two, not just arbitrary 500x375. Second, the internalformat (third) argument to glTexImage2D should be a symbolic constant, describing the internal format layout, not just "4" , as it's deprecated since OpenGL 1.2. Third, your dataP and bufferP storage layout must correspond to the current GL_UNPACK_ALIGNMENT . Fourth, your equilateral quad, on which you're trying to put the texture on, is essentially square, and thus your non-square texture will appear squashed or stretched with such a texture coordinates.
