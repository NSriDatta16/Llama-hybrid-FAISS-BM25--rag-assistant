How to communicate between service controller and a service/daemon?

It is easy to display the status of a Windows service or to control it (start/stop) from a GUI application but the question if how about receiving/sending notifications from the service? Like: service telling to the user monitoring it that it needs attention. Please consider that you can have several controllers started at any time in a multi-user environment. Do you know an example(open source) for this kind of communication? Extra points for a platform independent solution :)
