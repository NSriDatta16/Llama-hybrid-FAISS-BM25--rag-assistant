Multivariate time series with additional features

I am dealing with a problem that contains multiple categorical features and different time series depending on these variables. So, for example the dataset can be represented as: Day catA catB catC productA 1 A B B 1.8 2 A B B 2.4 3 A B B 2.8 4 A B B 3.8 5 A B B 4.4 6 A B B 4.8 7 A B B 5.4 ... ... With n days recorded. The fact is that during this same time, in parallel, another product is being registered with some of the categorical features in common: Day catA catB catC productB 1 A B C 1.1 2 A B C 1.4 3 A B C 1.8 4 A B C 1.8 5 A B C 1.2 6 A B C 3.8 7 A B C 3.4 ... ... And this process is done for multiple products. All the categorical space of combinations is being explored during n days for different products. The ideal forecasting will be something like predicting the next 5 days for the given categorical combination i.e catA=A, catB=B and catB=B, and it will forecast different results depending on the categorical input. I have been looking for something to model this problem and Prophet (with its additional regressors) looks interesting but I do not know if it is the (best) approach. I have also thought of a Bayesian regression due to I can introduce some prior knowledge on the distribution that the categorical features follow: y = catA + catB + catC where y are the different time series as mentioned before. What kind of model/framework/approach do you think I must follow to solve this? Thanks
