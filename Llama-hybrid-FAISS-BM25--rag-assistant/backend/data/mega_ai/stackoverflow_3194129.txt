First identify common technologies available on all platforms and try to stick with those as much as possible - OpenGL, SQLite, etc. Next I'd advise not to finish one port before starting any of the others. Start some groundwork on at least one of the others in parallel from day one. You will probably find that you can pick up on a lot of issues much earlier this way. You may not feel you have the dev resources for this but I think this is more important than it may look. Pay careful attention to your software architecture (MVC? although Qt is Model-View-Delegate). There's always a tendency to let architectural purity slip in order to get to market quicker with a slightly dirtier, slightly hackier solution. Try to resist this as much as possible because you are going to have to bite these bullets anyway very soon.
