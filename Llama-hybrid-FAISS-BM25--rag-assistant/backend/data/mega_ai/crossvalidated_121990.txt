Using variance from a Jeffreys prior in a Prevalence meta-analysis

I am doing a meta-analysis on a group of studies, where the observation is a rate (no. of successes / no of trials). Some of the studies have small sample sizes (n As an alternative I used Jeffreys Priors and calculated 95% Bayesian Credible intervals for each rate. Then in stata using the metan function, I inputted the observed rate and two bayesian intervals. The function runs fine of course and I can generate estimates, but was curious if this is appropriate to do. I believe stata takes the confidence intervals and backwards calculates the SE/variance and uses this in weighting. I was curious if anyone thought this is inappropriate to use bayesian intervals in the mixed effects Meta-analysis function?
