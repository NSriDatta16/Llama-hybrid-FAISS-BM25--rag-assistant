The metric to the time series forecastability is "the spectral entropy". I learned it from some talk of Rob Hyndman, so here is the description of his implementation for R tsfeatures package, entropy The spectral entropy is the Shannon entropy −∫π−πf^(λ)logf^(λ)dλ, where f^(λ) is an estimate of the spectral density of the data. This measures the “forecastability” of a time series, where low values indicate a high signal-to-noise ratio, and large values occur when a series is difficult to forecast. entropy(AirPassengers) #> entropy #> 0.2961049
