You can do it, for example using your own .filter() function: var st = $('div').scrollTop(), sh = $('div').height(), sb = st + sh - 1; $('p').css({ background: '#ccc' }); $('p').filter(function() { var $this = $(this), h = $this.height(), t = $this.position().top, b = t + h - 1; return (t >= st && b See DEMO: http://jsfiddle.net/qnuxs/3/ Every five seconds it makes the visible paragraphs red. It waits 5 seconds so you could scroll and see that the remaining paragraphs was not red. Another DEMO: http://jsfiddle.net/qnuxs/4/ This version updates the colors while you scroll. Note that the calculations seem to be incorrect so it's few pixels off but it should be enough to get you started. You probably need to use .innerHeight() for the div or maybe change something else but this is the idea: get the scroll position and div height to calculate top and bottom of visible part, and compare those values with top and bottom coordinates (relative to div) of every paragraph, and make your filter select only those within the correct range.
