Logistic regression corresponds to a Binomial distribution, a member of the exponential family, so in that sense it is nested within the Exponential Dispersion class of models. The $\mathrm{Tweedie}(\mu, \sigma^2)$ family specifically is also contained within $\mathrm{ED}$ , but imposes the mean-variance relationship \begin{align*} \mu &= \mathbf{E}[Y]\\ \operatorname{var}(Y) &= \sigma^2 \mu^p. \end{align*} This cannot work for logistic regression because the Binomial needs $$\operatorname{var}(Y) = np(1-p) = n\mathbf{E}[Y](1-\mathbf{E}[Y]).$$
