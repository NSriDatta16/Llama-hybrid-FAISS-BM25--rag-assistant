How can I get annual rates of change for combined trend estimates?

I would like to combine trend indices (gained with different methods referring to the same subject, assuming they do not differ significantly) of two different time series and to derive the combined annual rate of change and standard error. To combine annual indices ($Y$) and standard errors ($S$) in the overlapping period I use the following formulas: $$ \begin{aligned} Y^*&=(Y_1/S_1^2+Y_2/S_2^2)\cdot S_1^2\cdot S_2^2/(S_1^2+S_2^2) \\ S^*&=\sqrt{S_1^2+S_2^2/S_1^2\cdot S_2^2} \end{aligned} $$ Here is an example dataset with trend estimates gained from generalized estimation equations (I do not have the raw data from which the estimates are calculated): year Y1 S1 Y2 S2 1990 91.3 12.0 NA NA 1991 81.8 8.7 NA NA 1992 65.9 6.9 NA NA 1993 80.8 8.0 NA NA 1994 81.7 8.1 NA NA 1995 90.0 8.5 NA NA 1996 113.7 10.0 NA NA 1997 117.5 10.2 NA NA 1998 139.9 11.6 NA NA 1999 120.0 9.9 NA NA 2000 130.1 10.6 NA NA 2001 115.1 9.4 NA NA 2002 105.2 9.2 NA NA 2003 83.9 7.5 NA NA 2004 105.8 8.9 NA NA 2005 111.0 9.5 85.7 7.2 2006 100.0 0 100.0 0 2007 105.3 9.4 104.0 6.1 2008 93.5 8.6 102.3 5.5 2009 117.0 10.8 111.5 6.2 2010 107.0 10.4 108.5 6.1 Now, I would like to get an estimate of the combined annual rate of change and its standard error for the time period of 1998 to 2008. Does anyone have any idea to share?
