Is it valid to perform PCA if Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) index is very low?

I have a dataset that contains data from $307$ subjects and nine variables for each subject. I would like to run a PCA. My problem is that I get a Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) value of $0.06$. Can it be due to the fact that within every subject the variables add up to $1$? Is there another way to test whether it is okay to run PCA on my data?
