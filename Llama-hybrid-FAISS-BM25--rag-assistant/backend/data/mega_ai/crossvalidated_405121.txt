Another possible way of calculating the Odds ratio, using your model 'm' would be as below: # For odds ratio m $coefficients exp(m$ coefficients) And for finding the Confidence intervals, you can simply use: # for confidence intervals exp(confint(m)) Just for reference, the overall p-value (not just the p-value for each of the predictors) for logistic regression could also be computed: summary(m) (modelChi = m $null.deviance - m$ deviance) # for chi sq statistic (chiDF = m $df.null - m$ df.residual) # for DF (chisq_prob = 1 - pchisq(modelChi, chiDF)) # for hypothesis testing probability
