You should not bin continuous features in a regression model, it only reduces the model's ability to fit the data. I discuss this extensively here , where I compare binning with other methods of capturing non-linearity in regression modeling. The high level is Binning, which conceptually simple, was seen to suffer from a few issues in comparison to the other methods With a small number of estimated parameters, the binned regression suffered from a higher bias than its competitors. It was seen across multiple experiments to achieve its minimal hold out error at a larger number of estimated parameters than the other methods, and furthermore, often the minimal error achieved by the binning method was larger than the minimum achieved by the other methods. The binned regression’s hold out error often had a higher variance than the other method’s. This means that, even if it performed just as well as another method on average, any individual binned regression is less trustworthy than if using another method. Additionally, the binned regression method has the disadvantage of producing discontinuous functions, while we expect most processes we encounter in nature or business to vary continuously in their inputs. This is philosophically unappealing, and also accounts for some of the bias seen when comparing the binning regressions to the other basis expansions. Just don't do it.
