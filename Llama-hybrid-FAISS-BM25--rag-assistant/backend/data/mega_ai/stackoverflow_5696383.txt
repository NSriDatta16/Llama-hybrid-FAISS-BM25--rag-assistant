Understanding Google App Engine datastore

i am in the early stages of designing a VERY large system (its an enterprise level point of sale system). as some of you know the data models on these things can get very complicated. i want to run this thing on google app engine because i want to put more of my resources to developing the software rather than building and maintaining an infrastructure. in that spirit of things, ive been doing a lot of reading on GAE and DataStore. im an old school relational database modeler and ive seen several different concepts of what a schemaless database is and i think ive figured out what datastore is but i want to make sure i have it right so, if im right gae is a sorta table based system. so if i create a java entity class user public string firstname public string lastname and deploy it, the "table" user is automatically created and running. then in subsquent releases if i modify class user class user public string firstname public string lastname public date addDate and deploy it, the "table" user is automatically updated with the new field. now, in relating data, as i understand it, its very similar to some of the massively complex systems like SAP where the data is in fact very organized, but due to the volume its referential integrity is a function of the application, not the database engine. so i would have code that looks like this class user public long id public string firstname public string lastname class phone public string phonenumber public user userentity and to pull up the phone numbers for a user from scratch instead of select phone from phone inner join user as phone.userentity = user where user.id = 5 (lay off i know the syntax is incorrect but you get the point) i would do something like select user from user where user.id = 5 then select phone from phone where phone.userentity = user and that would retrieve all the phone numbers for the user. so, as i understand, its not so much a huge change in how to think about structuring data and organizing data, as its a big change on how to access it. i do joins manually with code instead of joins automatically with the database engine. beyond that its the same. am i correct or am i clueless.
