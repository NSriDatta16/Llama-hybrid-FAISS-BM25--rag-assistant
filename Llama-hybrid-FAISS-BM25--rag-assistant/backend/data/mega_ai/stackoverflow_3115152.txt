Starting the Synergys server on mac OS X

Here is the line I'm having trouble with... "Drag the synergys program from the synergy folder onto the Terminal window." I'm assuming this means a specific file within the synergy-1.3.1 folder, but I don't know which one... (unless I'm suppose to compile this first and then have a build file that I'm suppose to drag to the terminal and run the command on?) The configuration seems pretty easy providing I get the hostname correct.
