Multi-Parameterized Threads Efficiency

Would there a more elegant way of writing the following syntax? Thread t0 = new Thread(new ParameterizedThreadStart(doWork)); t0.Start('someVal'); t0.Join(); Thread t1 = new Thread(new ParameterizedThreadStart(doWork)); t1.Start('someDiffVal'); t1.Join(); Presuming we want to pass 20 different values, what would the best way of setting this up be? Looping through and joining at the end? If a new thread isn't instantiated (like below), it errors that the thread can't be restarted. For example: Thread t1 = new Thread(new ParameterizedThreadStart(doWork)); t1.Start('someVal'); t1.Start('someDiffVal');
