Do GEE and GLM estimate the same coefficients?

In a GLM, the likelihood equations depend on the assumed distribution only through the mean and the variance. The likelihood equations are $$\sum_i^n (\frac{\partial \mu_i}{\partial \eta_i}) \frac{y_i - \mu_i}{Var(Y_i)}x_{ij} = 0, \quad (j = 1, ..., p)$$ and in the quasi-likelihood case, we just let $Var(Y_i) = v(\mu_i)$ be some function of the mean. For GEE, the response is extended to be multivariate, with an assumed correlation structure, with the quasi-likelihood equations. Does this imply that GEE and GLM will have the same parameter (say $\beta$ ) estimates (population averaged) with the only difference being correct standard errors in the GEE case (Assuming clustered data?) If the estimated coefficients are not the same, then what is the difference?
