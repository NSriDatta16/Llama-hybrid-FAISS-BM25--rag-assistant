I think the easiest answer to your question is in Chapter 9 of the book by James et al. (2013) Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R. You can get the pdf of the book (for free!) form Gareth James's webpage http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/index.html . The authors also provide an R implementation. However, in your case I would go with a random forest. It is much easier to tune (R can do it for you almost automatically!) and it performs well in practice. Hope it helps!
