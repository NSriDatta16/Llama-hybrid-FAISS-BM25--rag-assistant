Is K-NN applicable for binary variables?

I need help because I'm just new to machine learning and I do not know if k-nearest neighbors algorithm can be used to identify the appropriate program(s) for Student 11 in the table below. The school subjects (Math, English, etc.) are the features, while the 'Program' column has the class labels A, B, and C. The binary values represent the interest of a student in the subjects. Can K-NN algorithm find the similar students based on the binary variables in the table?
