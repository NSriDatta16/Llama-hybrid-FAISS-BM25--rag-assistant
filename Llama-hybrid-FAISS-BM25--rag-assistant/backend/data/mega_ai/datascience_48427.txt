Iterrow passes a copy of the row, not the reference. This should fix your problem: df.loc[index,'Keywords'] = str(plot) However, I would recommend using apply , imho it is more elegant. And it is alot faster. That would looks something like this def string_to_keywords(string): plot = re.sub('[^a-zA-Z]'," ", string) plot = plot.lower() plot = plot.split() return " ".join([i for i in plot if not i in set(stopwords.words('english'))]) df["Keywords"] = df["Plot"].apply(string_to_keywords)
