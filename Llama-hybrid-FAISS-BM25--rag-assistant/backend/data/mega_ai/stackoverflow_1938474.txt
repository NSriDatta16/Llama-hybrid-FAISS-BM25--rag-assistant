In practice No and No would be the answers to your questions. I have never actually seen them used in production nor is there ever really a justified reason to use them. As Kent mentioned Silverlight or Click Once is almost always a better option. One could argue, in a full trust Windows only environment, XBAPS gives you the ability to leverage the full WPF framework with the flexibility of web deployment. Of course that is what Click once is for. However, in my experience ClickOnce is a nightmare for anything more then a simple, single application install so you might argue in favor of XBAP to avoid ClickOnce headaches. But again, my response would be, Silverlight is likely a better choice.
