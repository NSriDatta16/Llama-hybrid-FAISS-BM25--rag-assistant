Simple Mean/Average

I have results from a likert scale 1 - strongly disagree-5 - strongly agree. I also had a N/A and a Not Sure category. How do I calculate the average response? I am thinking to not include the n/a's and not sure's in my calculation because we only want to be evaluated by people who know about my company. Please help!!!
