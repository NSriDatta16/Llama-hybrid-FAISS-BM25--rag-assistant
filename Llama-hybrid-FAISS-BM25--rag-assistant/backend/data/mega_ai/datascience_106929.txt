Deep Learning 2D-Convol Layer: When does the Channel =1?

Sorry if this sounds basic. But for input_shape, understand that the channel =3 for colored images. But for black-white and grey-scale images, channel =1? Thank you model.add(Conv2D(filters=32, kernel_size=(4,4),input_shape=(28, 28, 1), activation='relu',)) input_shape = image_height, image_width, channels ```
