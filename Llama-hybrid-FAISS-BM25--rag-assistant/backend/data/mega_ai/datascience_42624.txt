Sometimes, it's reasonable to build different models for different classes. But as a first approach try to use one model. If your categorical data are ordinals you can encode them as natural numbers. Otherwise, try one-hot encode, but use threshold, because you have too many classes and you'll have too many dimension. For example, you can one-hot encode all the classes that have more than 10 samples in them and dismiss all the rest classes. In any case, there's no sense to encode class that have only 1-2 samples. It's reasonable to use different models for each class if you use different approach. For example, for one class tree-based models may work the best, for the other SVM. You can also build different models, if one model predicts well for high values of some independent variable, and the other for low.
