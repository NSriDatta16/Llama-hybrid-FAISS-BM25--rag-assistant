What's the point of basis path coverage?

The article at onjava seems to imply that basis path coverage is a sufficient substitute for full path coverage, due to some linear-independence/cyclomatic-complexity magic. Using an example similar to the article: public int returnInput(int x, boolean one, boolean two) { int y = x; if(one) { y = x-1; } if(two) { x = y; } return x; } with the basis set {FF,TF,FT}, the bug is not exposed. Only the untested TT path would expose it. So, how is basis path coverage useful? It doesn't seem much better than branch coverage.
