Why isn't this a function of syntactical highlighting instead of Hungarian notation? Why doesn't the IDE just italicize identifiers that refer to interfaces if it's so important to distinguish between classes and interfaces. I hate putting " " or "m " before fields, "C" before classes, etc. Even worse, it encourages programmers write really bad APIs such as: public class List : IList instead of a more reasonable: public class LinkedList : List public class ArrayList : List public class HashList : List Even the .NET common class authors fell into this trap. A class name should NEVER be the name of the interface with just the "I" removed. The class name should always tell the user how the class differs from other possible implementations of the interface(s). I vote for dropping the stupid "I" for that reason alone. Also, when I use intellisense, I want to group things by functional area, not whether it's a class or interface. I never think, "I need an interface, not a class." I always think, "I need something that does X".
