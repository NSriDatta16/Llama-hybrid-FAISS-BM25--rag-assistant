Here are some possible way you can solve this - Using Regular Expressions - Define them according to the patterns in your text. Match the expressions, extract pattern and you repeat for all records. This approach needs good understanding of the format in which the data is & of course regular expressions :) String Manipulation - This approach is relatively simpler. Again one needs a good understanding of the format in which the data is. This is what I have done below. Machine Learning - You could define all you rules & train a model on these rules. After this the model tries to extract data using the rules you provided. This is a lot more generic approach than the first two. Also the toughest to implement. See if this work for you. Might need some adjustments. new_file = open('parsed_file', 'w') for rec in open("your_csv_file"): tmp = rec.split(' : ') date = tmp[0] reason = tmp[1] if reason[:2] == 'He': sex = 'Male' symptoms = reason.split(' and ')[0].split('He got ')[1] else: sex = 'Female' symptoms = reason.split(' and ')[0].split('She got ')[1] symptoms = [i.strip() for i in symptoms.split(',')] symptoms = '\n'.join(symptoms) if 'died' in rec: died = 'True' else: died = 'False' new_file.write("Sex: %s\nSymptoms: %s\nDeath: %s\nDeath Time: %s\n\n" % (sex, symptoms, died, date)) Ech record is newline separated \n & since you did not mention one patient record is 2 newlines separated \n\n from the other. LATER: @Nurse what did you end up doing? Just curious.
