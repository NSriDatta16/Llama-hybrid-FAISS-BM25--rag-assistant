Choosing Between Prism and Caliburn

I have been using Prism 2.0 for a personal project for a few months now. I have recently heard of Caliburn and am wondering if there are compelling reasons for me to consider that instead. I like Prism's dynamic module loading capability. I intend to build modules for my application and would like to be able to deploy them in a modular manner. Is that also possible with Caliburn? What are the advantages of Caliburn over Prism? (I read that Prism will also have a new version by September 2010 that will leverage .Net 4.0. and am keeping my application flexible to be updated by then as well.)
