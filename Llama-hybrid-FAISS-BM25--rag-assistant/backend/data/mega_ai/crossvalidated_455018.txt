Fill or not to fill? That's the question

I have a dataset which shows the expense of users in a specific expense category daily, along the time. I am building a time series in order to predict whether this person will buy this some product on this category in the next days. I defined the time series and all the components: trend (using moving average with m= 7 days), season, noise. Now I am trying to figure out and interpret the auto-correlation chart because i want identify the terms to implement SARIMA for forecasting. My dilemma is: The person doesn't buy everyday on that category, then I don't know if should I fill the dates that don't have any purchase observation using some imputation techniques such as interpolation or don't because I think doesn't make any sense fill some number in a day that didn't occur the event. Thank you in advance! ;)
