Moving Average window

I am working with a multivariate time series problem which I try to predict 1 hour in the future. I am planning to use moving average of the features as separate new features. But I do not know if there is a convention to choose the window size when we use the moving average as a new feature. Any help regarding the subject is appreciated Thanks a lot
