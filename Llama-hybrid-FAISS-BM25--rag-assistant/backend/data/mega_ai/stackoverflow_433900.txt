Using TagText as the primary key would have the advantage that you could get an articles tags with fewer joins: SELECT * FROM Article_Tag WHERE Article_ID = ? It would have the disadvantage that tag strings take more space than integers, so the storage for Article_Tag and its indexes would be larger. This occupies more space on disk and also requires more memory for caching the index.
