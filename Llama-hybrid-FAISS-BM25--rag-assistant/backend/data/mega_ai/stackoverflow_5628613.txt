Could you suggest me a pattern to log exceptions during java application lifecycle?

I want to use the simple java.util.logging.* package to log exceptions. Any suggestions, links, articles to do this in a basic but elegant way? I should implement it in a Java EE application. I was thinking to a singleton class... what do you think?
