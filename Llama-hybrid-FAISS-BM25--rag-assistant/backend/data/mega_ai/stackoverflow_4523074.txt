This is a never-ending question in the C++ tag: "What is the predictable undefined behavior". Easy to resolve all by yourself: get every C++ compiler implementation and check if the predictable unpredictable still works. This is however something you have to do by yourself. Do post back what you found out, that would be quite useful to know. As long as the unpredictable has consistent and annotated behavior across the board. It makes it really hard for somebody that writes a C++ compiler to get anybody to pay attention to his product. Standardization by convention, happens a lot with a language that has a lot of undefined behavior.
