Comparative statics for conditional expectations

Let $f\left(x,y\right)\in\left[0,\frac{1}{2}\right)$ a function such that $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}>0$ , $\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} , and $\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x \partial y} . Further, let $\pi$ a random variable over $\left[0,1\right]$ with density $h(\pi)$ . I would like to know if: $$\frac{\partial^2 \mathbb{E}\left[\pi \mid \pi>\frac{1}{2}-f\left(x,y\right)\right]}{\partial x\partial y}>0$$ . My computations so far: $$\mathbb{E}\left[\pi \mid \pi>\frac{1}{2}-f\left(x,y\right)\right]=\int_{\frac{1}{2}-f\left(x,y\right)}^1 \pi h\left(\pi\right)d\pi=H\left(1\right)-H\left(\frac{1}{2}-f\left(x,y\right)\right),$$ where $H$ is a primitive of $\pi h\left(\pi\right)$ . Then, $$\frac{\partial \mathbb{E}\left[\pi \mid \pi>\frac{1}{2}-f\left(x,y\right)\right]}{\partial x}=\left[\frac{1}{2}-f\left(x,y\right)\right]\times h \left(\frac{1}{2}-f\left(x,y\right)\right) \times \frac{\partial f\left(x,y\right)}{\partial x}$$ . Am I missing something here? It seems I need to know something more about $h\left(\cdot\right)$ to say something after taking the $y$ derivative. In my application, $\pi$ is a probability itself arising from updating beliefs about a Markov chain -- it's a bit complicated to do more with its density. Thanks!
