This might help you partially. Flowing the derived column control into a condional split control. To flow only non-nulls create a condition !(ISNULL(COLUMN_NAME)) Then connect the conditional split back to your standard flow. This will flow the correct instances as your require. The thing I can't quite figure out is the logging of this error. Maybe try creating a second condition: (ISNULL(COLUMN_NAME)) And flow that into some dataflow task that will cause an error to be raised, not really elegant though. Or you could try flowing into another derived column that uses values in the row to form an output to some log file.
