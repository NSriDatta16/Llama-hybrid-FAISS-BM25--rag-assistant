If coefficient variance is incorrect (for a regression parameter), does that mean the model's log-likelihood is incorrect?

I am using logistic regression to estimate ~probability of a sample unit being used by an animal. Due to my sampling design it is unavoidable that there is overlap between 'used' sample units and 'available' sample units. (Overlap refers to the situation where 'used' units also occur in the sample of 'available' units. That is, sample units with identical characteristics are coded as both '0' and '1' in the data. So the situation is not analogous to a case-control application of logistic regression.) According to Johnson et al 2006 "Resource Selection Functions Based on Useâ€“Availability Data: Theoretical Motivation and Evaluation Methods"; "When overlap occurs, the variance estimates reported by the logistic regression procedure for coefficients are not correct, even though coefficients estimates are. If no overlap occurs, variance estimates are correct. Coefficient variances in the case of overlap should be estimated by bootstrap methods that resample distinct units." My question is, do incorrect coefficient variances imply incorrect log-likelihoods? I ask because I want to compare about 10 models using AIC, but it seems I'd have to bootstrap the variances for each model's coefficients separately and then calculate the likelihood, and then use my model selection procedure. Thank you for any thoughts
