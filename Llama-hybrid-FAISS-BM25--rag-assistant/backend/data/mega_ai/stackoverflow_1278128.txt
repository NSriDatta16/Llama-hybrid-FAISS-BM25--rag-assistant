Manager game: How to calculate market values?

Usually players in a soccer manager game have market values. The managers sell their players in accordance with these market values. They think: "Oh, the player is worth 3,000,00 so I'll try to sell him for 3,500,000". All players have three basic qualities: strength value (1-99) maximal strength they can ever attain (1-99) motivation (1-5) current age (16-40) Based on these values, I calculate the market values at the moment. But I would like to calculate the market values dynamically according to the player transfers in the last period of time. How could I do this? I have the above named qualities and the player transfers of the last period of time available for calculation. How could I calculate it? Do I have to group the last transferred players by the qualities and simply take the average transfer price? I hope you can help me. Note: players=items/goods, managers=users
