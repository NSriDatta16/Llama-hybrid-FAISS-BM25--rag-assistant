Testing treatment effect within different groups by re-running a regression with the reference class changed

Suppose I have a dataset with a continuous outcome, a dichotomous variable representing treatment, and another dichotomous variable representing membership in some group. As an example we can use R's built-in CO2 dataset, taking uptake as the outcome, predicted by Treatment (chilled vs not chilled) and plant Type (Quebec vs. Mississippi). My research questions are: Q1: Does treatment affect uptake for Quebec-type plants? Q2: Does treatment affect uptake for Mississippi-type plants? I could run two separate regressions estimating the effect of treatment within each subset of the data. But suppose that I expect the two types to have similar untreated outcomes, and similar responses to other covariates that might be in the model (not interacting with treatment or type, just soaking up additional variance). Therefore, I'd expect to have higher power to detect the two treatment effects if I could use all my data in a single model. I could do a multiple regression interacting treatment with type: summary(lm(uptake ~ Treatment * Type, data=CO2)) # Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) # (Intercept) 35.333 1.747 20.225 The coefficients and t-tests answer a different set of questions: A1: Does treatment affect uptake for Quebec-type plants? (same as my question 1) A2: Does treatment affect uptake for Mississippi-type plants any more or less than treatment affects Quebec-type plants? ( not the same as my question 2) Let's say I don't care about A2 at all and I only want to know if the effect on Mississippi-type plants is significantly different from zero. I could run the same model but using Mississippi as the reference class: summary(lm(uptake ~ Treatment * (Type=="Quebec"), data=CO2)) # (Intercept) 25.952 1.747 14.855 The Treatmentchilled parameter is precisely what you'd have calculated for Mississippi-type plants using the previous model's Treatmentchilled + Treatmentchilled:TypeMississippi parameters, but now it has a simple t-test telling me whether it's statistically significant. Is there anything wrong with running a model twice with different reference classes in order to test the treatment effect within each class? Specifically: Does it introduce any multiple-comparison or interpretation issues that are different from what I'd have to deal with if I ran only the first model and were interested in the treatment and interaction effects? Is there a more elegant way to accomplish what I want?
