Does Windows.CopyFile create a temporary local file while source and destination are network shares?

I have a D2007 application that uses Windows.CopyFile to copy MS Word and PowerPoint files from one network folder to another network folder. Our organization is migrating to Windows 7 from Vista. One of my migrated users got an error message that displayed a partial local folder (C:\Users\(username)\...\A100203.doc) during the copy. Does the CopyFile function cache a local copy of the document when it is copying from one network folder to another network folder or is it a direct write? I have never seen this error before and the application has been running for years on Win95, Win 98, Win2000, WinXP and Vista.
