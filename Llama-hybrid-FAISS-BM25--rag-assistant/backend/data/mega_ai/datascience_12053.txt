A few ideas to parse "events" from a text document

I'm working with lots of press releases (mostly PDF or DOC documents, i.e. text). I would like to automatically parse them into a CSV file, 1 line per event. Input: Output: datetime;location;title;description 2016-06-02 18:30;Public Library;About Picasso's last years;Lorem ipsum... 2016-06-03 17:30;Public Library;1001 stories;For children, 3 to 6 year old I could write a parser for each precise layout of document (e.g. date always in bold, description always in italic) or detect keywords (example: january, february, etc. => assume the nearby words are a date, etc.). But this would require lots of work for every different press release. I'm looking for more clever solutions, maybe involving machine learning and/or neural networks. I'm open to take a MOOC on this subject (I have a math PhD background and programming skills). What general techniques do you see to address such a big (and difficult topic) concern ? Are there open-source projects dedicated to that? Some Python libraries that would make this task easier? Any general idea?
