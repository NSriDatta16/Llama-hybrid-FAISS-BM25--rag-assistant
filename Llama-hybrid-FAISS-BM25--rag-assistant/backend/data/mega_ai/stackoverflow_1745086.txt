Why even bother writing a separate stylesheet for IE8? If you've already debugged for IE7, you can force IE8 into compatibility mode, and thus display your code as though IE8 were IE7. All you gotta do is put this RIGHT BELOW the opening head tag. Anywhere else and it won't work. And then that's a half hour or so less work on average per project, no intense debugging for IE8 needed! Even Msn.com does this - kind of ironic, eh? Wrote a blog post about it recently: http://blog.sankhomallik.com/2009/11/16/stop-wasting-time-debugging-on-ie8-when-you-dont-have-to-or-get-ie8-to-behave-like-ie7/
