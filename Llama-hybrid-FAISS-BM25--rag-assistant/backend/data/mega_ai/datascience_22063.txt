I don't understand that why have you decided to use CNN or RNN? This problem can be solved by ANN if you need to use Deep Learning. CNNs are good at Image Recognition tasks. RNNs are good at Time series analysis. I'd suggest you to use a couple of Machine learning algorithms. They might be enough for this. You can also use Gradient Boosting methods. Hope this helped.
