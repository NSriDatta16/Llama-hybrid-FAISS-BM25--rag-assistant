The right way to think about this is: use ref/out when you want to create an alias to a variable . That is, when you say: void M(ref int x) { x = 10; } ... int q = 123; M(ref q); what you are saying is "x is another name for the variable q" . Any changes to the contents of x change q, and any changes to the contents of q change x, because x and q are just two names for the exact same storage location . Notice that this is completely different from two variables referring to the same object: object y = "hello"; object z = y; Here we have two variables , each variable has one name , each variable refers to one object , and the two variables both refer to the same object . With the previous example, we have only one variable with two names . Is that clear?
