Is it true to some extent that statisticians are usually more concerned about the model's goodness-of-fit and the corresponding metrics of significance, and not that much about model's generalization capability, and vice versa for the ML scientists? Scientists and analysts using "pure" statistics have recently gotten into some trouble precisely for focusing excessively on metrics of significance. In fact, in 2017, the American Statistical Association held a Symposium on Statistical Inference which to a large extent discussed the over-reliance that many statisticians have on statistical significance and p-values. It's been a fairly serious problem in the sciences recently. But your question is difficult to answer, mostly because there are still no agreed upon definitions that mark the difference between statistics/machine learning/data science. A carpenter 2000 years ago used a hammer and nails. Now, a carpenter uses a power drill. When the power drill was invented, did the carpenters who started using it rename themselves? Did they also rename "nail" "multi-object concatenation device (MOCD)" and rename "hammer" "manual MOCD implementer?" Obviously not. That would be absurd. Yet machine learning practitioners and data scientists have more or less done this, and it makes statistics and machine learning seem to be more different than they really are. High computing power, parallel processing, and new methods became available. Now suddenly a "variable" is a "feature!" You no longer recode your variables, you engage in feature engineering . "Pearson's phi" that was used 100 years ago, you say? No, no, no , it is now the MCC! The list goes on. Differences in jargon often do not reflect any real differences in the underlying mathematics or theory. Having said that, to the extent that the focus of jobs called "statistician" versus "machine learning practitioner" are starting to diverge, I think you'll find that they diverge in largely the ways you expect. "Statistician" jobs tend to be more scientifically conservative, focusing on understanding relationships and testing assumptions. "Machine learning" jobs tend to be in industry where your goal is to deal quickly and efficiently with a lot of data in order to help make decisions that yield a desired result, which is rarely scientific understanding or evidence for/against hypotheses.
