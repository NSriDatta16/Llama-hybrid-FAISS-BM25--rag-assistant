One doesn't subtract variance from a time series .. one adjusts ... http://docplayer.net/12080848-Outliers-level-shifts-and-variance-changes-in-time-series.html . The idea of time series analysis is to separate signal from noise ...Identify an appropriate arima model with any and all necessary deterministic structures e,g, pulses/seasonal pulse / time trends and determine if there is any remaining structure suggesting the need to stabilize the error variance.
