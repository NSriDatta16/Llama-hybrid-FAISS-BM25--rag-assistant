The NetworkCredentials work if the web site is using windows authentication. I've had varying success impersonating a browser when doing this type of thing. Usually I have to make a valid request to their login page first. The response will contain a cookie with the SessionID. As long as I reuse the same CookieCollection for all the requests after that (ie. One global CookieCollection that is reused every request) it will work fine. On the odd occasion, I still find that a website won't recognize my newly logged in session. In which case, I manually login with FireFox and use the WebDeveloper toolbar to view the cookies. I grab the cookie name/value and put them in the app settings, which is used by the program to populate the cookie collection. Make sure you spoof a valid useragent too. I've had sites deny me because of that too.
