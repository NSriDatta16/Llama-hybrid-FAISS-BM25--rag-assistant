Great question! Although there are Bayesian p-values , and one of the authors of the arm package is an advocate, what you are seeing in your output is not a Bayesian p-value. Check the class of model class(model) "bayesglm" "glm" "lm" and you can see that class bayesglm inherits from glm. Furthermore, examination of the arm package shows no specific summary method for a bayesglm object. So when you do summary(model) you are actually doing summary.glm(model) and getting frequentist interpretation of the results. If you want a more Bayesian perspective the function in arm is display()
