"The future is already here. It's just not evenly distributed." Usability evaluation tools and methods are used all the time... but more in some niches than others. I've been a User Experience (UX) specialist for my whole career - from where I'm standing, not using these tools and methods is more unusual. Ecommerce sites have widely adopted usability & UX research. Why? Because there's a very direct link between usability and revenue generation. Other industries are not so lucky because the link is not so immediate. When there is a gap between the purchaser and the user, there is little motivation to spend money on User-Centered Design (UCD). Enterprise software, for example, is mainly sold on the basis of feature lists to people who don’t actually have to use the software on a daily basis. Usability can therefore be pretty shocking in these apps. Of course there is a perfectly good argument for building great usability into enterprise software (reduced training costs, improved task completion times, staff morale, etc), but since it doesn't make or break the sale, usability somehow slips by the wayside. (This will change in the future but for now the usability arms race has not quite begun in this niche). Of course, all it will take is one enterprise provider to start making products with outstanding usability, and the competitive landscape will shift. Being the first takes guts and money. It’s all about behavioural economics. Anyway, it sounds like you happen to work in a niche that doesn't focus on UX. You should see it as an opportunity. By the way, those of you who say that UX research needn't be expensive - this is a popular argument, but in my opinion, it isn't a good one. Whether you outsource one round of usability testing of 10 users for £10,000 (yes, that’s how much it costs, really), or whether you do it internally for next to nothing, the project timescales have to stretch out to accommodate this. After testing, requirement specs are thrown into question, then you have to make decisions and implement changes. If the changes are big, you will have to test again. It’s inevitably time-consuming and this in itself is expensive. A better argument for getting your organization to focus on UX is the price of not doing research . This can be catastrophic. Most organizations have had a train wreck or two where poor usability has been discovered post-launch and scuppered an otherwise good project. Find your train wrecks and hammer the point home.
