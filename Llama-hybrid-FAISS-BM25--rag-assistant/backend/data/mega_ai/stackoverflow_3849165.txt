General purpose open source taxonomy database

I am looking for a database which could help me group thousands of English-language keywords to few general disciplines. For example: I HAVE THIS => I WANT TO HAVE THIS cat => animal chair => household wine => drink deer => animal beer => drink glass => household, drink total 50 000 keywords => total I guess that organizing keywords into disciplines can be very tricky. I don't really care about what will be the disciplines. I only want to have my 50 000 keywords grouped into less than 100 disciplines. Do you know a dictionary database that can do that?
