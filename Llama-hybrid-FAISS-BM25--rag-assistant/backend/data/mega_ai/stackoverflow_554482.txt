I'd never really thought about this before... interesting. I think it has to do with organization for an left-to-right language universe. Since most languages move from left-to-right, it makes sense to have the site expand from the left to the right. Along those same lines, if you need to expand your menus, it makes sense to expand your menus from the left out to the right. However, user links (such as login, profile, etc.) are typically static. If you want to keep them out of the way of the rest of your navigation, better to put them on the other corner of the page - thus the right corner, rather than the left. Edit: Sorry, I think I misinterpreted your question to mean "why are the login links on the upper right" rather than "why is the whole form on the right side of the page".
