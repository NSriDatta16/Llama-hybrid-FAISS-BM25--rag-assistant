Embedding scripting capabilities into an application will depend very much on the language and technology that make up the application. In your case, developing with C# there are some interesting options because of the work on the Dynamic Language Runtime. You should probably take a look at the IronRuby and IronPython projects since they will provide the best overall integration with .NET applications since they are themselves implementations of the Ruby and Python scripting languages on the .NET platform. As my experience centers on Ruby predominantly I would look at the information on hosting IronRuby in a .NET application . As far as a general book goes I would probably start here: Language Implementation Patterns: Create Your Own Domain-Specific and General Programming Languages . For specifics on IronPython there is this title from Manning: IronPython in Action . And for IronRuby there is this book still in Beta: IronRuby in Action . This may also be a solid resource coming out of Microsoft's Professional Developer's Conference: Using Dynamic Languages to Build Scriptable Apps .
