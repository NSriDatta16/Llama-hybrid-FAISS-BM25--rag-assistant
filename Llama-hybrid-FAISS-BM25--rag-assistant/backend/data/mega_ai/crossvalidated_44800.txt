"weird" results from multilevel analysis

I am examining the effect of a group variable (with five levels) along with other predictors on achievement growth using SPSS Mixed Model. The descriptive statistics showed a consistent pattern on achievement for these five groups across all waves of data collection. That is, the average score of group C > Group E> Group B > Group D > Group A. However, the results of my analysis showed that the estimate of Group C on intercept (which was set on the last time point) was significantly lower than Group E and even lower than Group B. Is that possible? I can understand if the difference between Group C and E becomes insignificant because of other predictors in the model. However, is it possible that the addition of other predictors changes the relative standing of the groups in the model? I have rechecked and redone the analysis several times to make sure that the "weird" result was not due to my errors on recoding variables or imputing missing values. Should I be concerned about this results? Or can I say that the result was reasonable since the other predictors I added to the model may "explain away" the group difference? Any comment or advice is appreciated. Thanks!!!
