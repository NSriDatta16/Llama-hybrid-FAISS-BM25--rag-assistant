Whenever I start any new website project (especially ones using PHP), I plan it out on paper. In order to keep your files neat and organized (architecture) it is wise to follow an MVC format. Read more about MVC This is the kind of organizational system I used and that many professionals use. This will make it far easier to scale your web site, and add more pages and functions because your functions will be independent of the pages that your users are looking at and entering information (UI). Also, commenting in your code is VERY important, you can never have enough commenting and that is even more true when you are coding a large web site, because you cannot possibly remember it all, and it will help you very much while making changes and scaling your web site. As far as security, there are methods that you can use to prevent security threats, I have read some good articles on security when it comes to PHP applications. Here is one. I can't stress enough that you should plan out how you intend the website to work and lay out the file organization before you start coding, it will save you tons of work and stress in the long run. I have coded large PHP/MYSQL driven web sites before, and I have fallen victim to a lot of errors, please learn from my mistakes, plan out your file structure and how you plan on specific user based interactions to be executed. As for a framework, i've never used one, but i've done the research and they use the MVC format. I like to do it all on my own instead of having to learn a framework. Frameworks are good if you are doing repetitive coding, but even on that note, I use functions for that. Hope this helps! If you have any questions feel free to ask. Chris
