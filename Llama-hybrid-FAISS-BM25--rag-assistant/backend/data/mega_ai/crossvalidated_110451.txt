Where did you get this tree from? It appears to be highly nonstandard, including terminology. No wonder you are confused... I have never heard the terms "Euclidean Tree", "Kernel Tree". I can only guess this refers to hierarchical clustering using Euclidean distance and kernelized distance. For clustering I strongly advise against using machine learning literature. To ML people, everything looks like classification; but this isn't a classification task. SVM and SOM are something completely different. Similar, your other questions mostly indicate you need to read more literature: these questions cannot be answered as is. You are essentially asking "What is the difference between Apples and Oranges".
