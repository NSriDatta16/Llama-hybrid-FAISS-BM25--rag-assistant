Eclipse (PDT) annoyingly locks .phtml files to PHP Content Type

I am getting frustrated with PDT. I want the .phtml files to be opened as HTML BUT .phtml is "locked" to PHP Content Type and there is no way to unlock it! Opening the .phtml files in HTML would make more sense (for Zend Framework users) because .phtml contain more HTML and some Javascript than PHP code. The question is, wtf would the Eclipse developers lock certain file types? Is there any way to "unlock" this? If I right click on the file and select Open With -> HTML Editor, then I get this error: Could not open the editor: org.eclipse.wst.sse.ui.internal.StructuredTextViewer cannot be cast to org.eclipse.php.internal.ui.editor.PHPStructuredTextViewe Help anyone? Much appreciated, Wenbert
