I'm no expert in this field, so I might be wrong. Therefore, correct me if I'm wrong. consider this neural network (which I suppose is equivalent to yours): A---H1 \ / \ X C / \ / B---H2 consider that the activation function of H1, H2 and C is the bipolar sigmoid, to which we'll refer to as "bsig(x)" also, we'll name the connections as follows: A, H1: wa1; A, H2: wa2; B, H1: wb1; B, H2: wb2; H1, C: wh1; H2, C: wh2 now the values of H1, H2 and C can be defined as: H1 = bsig(wa1 * A + wb1 * B) H2 = bsig(wa2 * A + wb2 * B) C = bsig(wh1 * H1 + wh2 * H2) So, C can be written as: C = bsig(wh1 * bsig(wa1 * A + wb1 * B) + wh2 * bsig(wa2 * A + wb2 * B)) All you need to do is solve this equation in order to B or A depending on which of the values is unkown.
