You have a prior for the predicted probabilities. Including that information would be a form of Bayesian statistics. In most discussion of Bayesian statistics the prior is on the coefficients instead of the predictions, but I am sure you can either transform your priors to be priors on the coefficients or include them directly. I vaguely remember a discussion of priors on predictions rather than coefficients in Andrew Gelman, John Carlin, Hal Stern, David Dunson, Aki Vehtari, and Donald Rubin (2013) Bayesian Data Analysis. CRC press. However, I don't have the book here, so I cannot look it up.
