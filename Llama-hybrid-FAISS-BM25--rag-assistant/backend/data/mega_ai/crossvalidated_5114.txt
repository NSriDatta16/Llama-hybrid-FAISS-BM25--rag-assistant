Seeking a distribution, perhaps uncommon, consistent with two data points and expert constraints?

I am trying to state a prior distribution for a Bayesian meta-analysis. I have the following information about a random variable: Two observations: 3.0, 3.6 a scientist who studies the variable has told me that $P(X 8)=0$, and that values as high as 6 have nonzero probability. I have used the following approach to optimization (the mode of log-N = $e^{\mu-\sigma^2)}$: prior In the figure, you can see the distribution that this returns, but I would like to find something more like the red lines I have drawn in. This provides the same shaped distribution using the lognormal, gamma, or the normal, and it results in a distribution with $P(X=5) plnorm(c(5,6), v$estimate[1],v$estimate[2]) Can anyone suggest alternatives? I would prefer to stick with a single distribution rather than a mixture. Thanks!
