Cochran's Q test (1950) is akin to a repeated measures ANOVA for binary outcomes. With only 2 repeated measures, Cochran's Q gives the same results as McNemar's test . My answer to a question about the Effect size of Cochran's Q details effect size calculations for Cochran's Q . I have implemented the test in the cochranq package for Stata (within Stata type net describe cochranq, from(http://alexisdinno.com/stata) ). This all said, it is not clear to me that you do not actually need a regression model, since you apparently want to account for a treatment variable, as well as a measurement number (unless specific treatment goes along with specific time of measurement). If this is the case, you may want to explore using a multilevel logistic regression model, where time of observation is nested within plant clusters, and treatment is a plant cluster-level independent variable.
