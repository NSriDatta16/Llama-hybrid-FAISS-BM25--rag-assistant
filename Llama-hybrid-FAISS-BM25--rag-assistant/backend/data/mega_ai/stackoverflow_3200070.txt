Scraping stuff out of HTML formatted response is unpleasant, and can make your code fragile. Maybe the webapp / website you are trying to talk has other ways to deliver the responses; e.g. in XML or JSON format. Getting responses in an alternative format might entail setting an appropriate ACCEPT header to the HTTP request, adding some extra parameter to the query, or changing the path. Check the web API documentation for the webapp / website to see if there is any mention of this. Or check the webapp source code ... if you have it. Or if this is your code, consider changing it to support XML, JSON or even ad hoc text responses. (If you take this route, it would be a good idea to read up on media types and set the appropriate one in the "Content-type" header of your responses.)
