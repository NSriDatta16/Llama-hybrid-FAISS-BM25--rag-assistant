If you already have an idea about how many trees you want to use (Breiman recommends at least 1000) and have used randomForest::tuneRF to get an optimal mtry value (let's use 6 as an example), then: ctrl Eduardo has answered your question above but I wanted to additionally demonstrate how you can tune the value for the number of random variables used for partitioning. When tuning a random forest, this parameter has more importance than ntree as long as ntree is sufficiently large.
