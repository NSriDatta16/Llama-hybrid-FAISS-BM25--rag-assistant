Howto organize Vim buffers, windows and tabs when working with many files

I used VIM whole my life but recently I am a bit tired of it because I am lost in buffers, windows, and tabs when working simultaneously with 20 files or so in a big project (with 500k LOC, and hundreds files). Whenever i do :make , :grep , etc, new buffers are jumping out in the current window. The same happens for the tags. At some point this starts to be very confusing because I really have to focus where things are in a VIM. What are a proven and easy ways to control this behavior?
