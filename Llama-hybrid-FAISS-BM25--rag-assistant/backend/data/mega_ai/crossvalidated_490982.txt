The parameter of the Exponential distribution is an inverse scale parameter: $X\sim \mathcal E(\lambda)$ can be represented as $$X=\epsilon/\lambda\qquad\epsilon\sim\mathcal E(1)$$ Therefore if $$X \sim \mathcal E(\lambda_0) \\ \lambda_i | \lambda_{i+1} \sim \mathcal E(\lambda_{i+1}) \quad i=0,1,\dots,d\\ \lambda_{d+1} = 1$$ we can write \begin{align}X &= \epsilon_0 / \lambda_0 \qquad &\epsilon_0\sim\mathcal E(1)\\ &= \lambda_1 \epsilon_0 / \epsilon_1 \qquad &\epsilon_1\sim\mathcal E(1)\\ &= \epsilon_2 \epsilon_0 / \epsilon_1 \lambda_2 \qquad &\epsilon_2\sim\mathcal E(1)\\ &\quad \vdots\\ &= \frac{\epsilon_{2\lfloor d/2 \rfloor}\cdots \epsilon_0}{\epsilon_{2\lfloor (d-1)/2 \rfloor+1}\cdots \epsilon_1}\qquad &\epsilon_d\sim\mathcal E(1) \end{align} and hence \begin{align*}X&=\frac{\exp\left\{\sum_{i=0}^{\lfloor d/2 \rfloor}\log\epsilon_{2i}\right\}}{\exp\left\{\sum_{i=0}^{\lfloor (d-1)/2 \rfloor}\log\epsilon_{2i+1}\right\}}\qquad \epsilon_i\sim\mathcal E(1)\\ &=\frac{\exp\left\{\sum_{i=0}^{\lfloor d/2 \rfloor}\log\{-\log\upsilon_{2i}\}\right\}}{\exp\left\{\sum_{i=0}^{\lfloor (d-1)/2 \rfloor}\log\{-\log\upsilon_{2i+1}\}\right\}} \qquad \upsilon_i\sim\mathcal U(0,1)\end{align*} appears as the ratio of two independent random variables both converging a.s. to zero with $d$ , hence having no limiting distribution. (This property generalises to other scale distributions, obviously, provided $\mathbb E[\sqrt{\epsilon_i}] .) Considering the general case $\lambda_d\sim\mathcal E(k)$ simply means alternatively multiplying and dividing by $k$ the above, hence preventing any form of convergence. Note [update]: Corey Yanovski pointed out to me that this problem is investigated in “Infinite hierarchies and prior distributions” by Gareth O. Roberts and Jeffrey S. Rosenthal ( Bernoulli , 2001). The introduction reads as follows: Suppose that we had independent data from an $Exp(\theta_0)$ distribution. In a Bayesian framework, we suppose that a priori $\theta_0\sim Exp(\theta_1)$ , and that with uncertainty on the hyperparameter $\theta_1$ , we might also give it a prior, $\theta_1\sim Exp(\theta_2)$ say. In fact at each level of the hierarchy we can hedge our bets by imposing a further level of prior uncertainty. Suppose we impose $N$ levels of the hierarchy by fixing the hyperparameter $\theta_N$ and sequentially setting $$\theta_i\sim Exp(\theta_{i+1})\qquad i=N-1,N-2,..., 1, 0$$ In terms of the data, the only thing that matters is the marginal prior of $\theta_0$ , obtained (if it were possible) by integrating out the hierarchical parameters.In such a situation, it is natural to consider the prior distribution of $\theta$ as $N\uparrow\infty$ . In this case and many others, no proper distributional limit exists, but the limit can sometimes still be described in terms of an improper prior distribution.
