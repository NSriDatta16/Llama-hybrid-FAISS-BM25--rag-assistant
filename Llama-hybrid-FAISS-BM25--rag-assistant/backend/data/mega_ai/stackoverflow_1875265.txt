The reason you cannot apply an svn diff patch is because the version of the code in the trunk must be more recent than the change in your trunk. This is a common scenario where you may have branched out to work on a feature and work continued on the trunk. To solve this problem, you need to bring your branch up to date with the trunk, THEN apply the diff. svn merge svn://path/to/trunk /path/to/working-copy This will bring your branch up to date with the trunk. If there are any conflicts, you'll have to resolve them. Now, svn commit /path/to/working-copy -m "Merged latest trunk changes into the branch" then, svn diff /path/to/trunk > my-new-code.patch and finally, cd /path/to/working-copy patch -p0 -i /path/to/my-new-code.patch Your working copy of the branch will now be up to date with the trunk, plus it will have your new changes... and the repository version of the trunk will not have been touched. Edit: After the original question was edited to provide more information, I now suggest the following: This is assuming, for instance, that the branch was created based on revision 30 of the trunk and that the change you want to import is in revision 56 of the trunk svn up /path/to/branch-WC svn up /path/to/trunk-WC -r 30 svn merge svn://path/to/trunk -r 55:56 /path/to/trunk-WC cd /path/to/trunk-WC svn diff /path/to/trunk-WC > /path/to/branch-WC/mychange.patch cd /path/to/branch-WC patch -p0 -i mychange.patch What you're doing here is updating the trunk to the same revision as where the branch was created. This way, any patches you produce will be based on the same revision. Next, by merging revision 55:56, you are asking ONLY for the "dragon fruit" diff. Since the orange/banana change was NOT done between revision 55:56, that diff will not be entered into the patch file. If the change in revision 56 depends on previous changesets, you might have to resolve some conflicts or merge some more revisions (since this revision 30 trunk won't know about them), but it should be exactly what you need.
