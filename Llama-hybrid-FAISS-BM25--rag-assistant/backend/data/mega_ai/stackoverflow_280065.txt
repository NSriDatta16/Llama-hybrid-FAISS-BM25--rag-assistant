I got a hold of Tom Carter, the asker. He had a working example with a request followed by a cancellation. What I had wrong was my METHOD was inside my VEVENT when it should have been outside. So here is a working update! Original: BEGIN:VCALENDAR VERSION:2.0 PRODID:-//WA//FRWEB//EN METHOD:REQUEST BEGIN:VEVENT UID:FRICAL201 SEQUENCE:0 DTSTAMP:20081108T151809Z ORGANIZER:donotreply@test.com DTSTART:20081109T121200 SUMMARY:11/9/2008 12:12:00 PM TRIP FROM JFK AIRPORT (JFK) LOCATION:JFK AIRPORT (JFK) END:VEVENT END:VCALENDAR Update: BEGIN:VCALENDAR VERSION:2.0 PRODID:-//WA//FRWEB//EN METHOD:REQUEST BEGIN:VEVENT UID:FRICAL201 SEQUENCE:1 DTSTAMP:20081108T161809Z ORGANIZER:donotreply@test.com DTSTART:20081109T121300 SUMMARY:11/9/2008 12:13:00 PM TRIP FROM JFK AIRPORT (JFK) LOCATION:JFK AIRPORT (JFK) END:VEVENT END:VCALENDAR All I did was add the request method (in the correct spot!), and an organizer.
