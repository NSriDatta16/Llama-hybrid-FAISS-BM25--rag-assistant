Use Ben Alman's replaceText plugin to set a class on the highlighted text which will allow you to not only style it, but also link to be draggable by jQuery UI draggable to a div that you've predefined and set up with jQuery UI droppable . Once you've dropped the div inside there is an event you can bind to, and you'll be able to access the text inside of that.
