Presumably, one does it the same way as in Mac OS/X. You need to look in the ARP tables built by the OS as it talks to remote hosts/bridges. I'm not sure you'll find a ready-made library, but the standard C way should work. I found ArpSpy which has downloadable source, and should serve as an example. It uses libpcap to sniff packets; I'm not sure if this has been ported and/or is usable on the iPhone.
