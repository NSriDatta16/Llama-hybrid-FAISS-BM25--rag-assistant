google chrome extension: webdb or not?

I am creating a google chrome extension to help with testing. The extension basically fills and input with dummy data. I need to store this dummy data somehow. The dummy data will not change, so hard coding it is acceptable. What would the best way to do this be? (think 2000 Male First Names, 2000 Female First Names, 4000 Last Names, 5000 Company Names, 5000 email addresses, 50 country names, all cities in those countries, localized phone formats for all 50 countries etc.) as you can see it is quite a substantial amount of data. My extension already requests unlimited storage. Should I use A web db? or an whole pile of arrays? or maybe an object containing arrays?
