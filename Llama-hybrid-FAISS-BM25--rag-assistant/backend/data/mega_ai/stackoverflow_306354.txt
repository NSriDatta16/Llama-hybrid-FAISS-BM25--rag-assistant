Your best bet would be to not use Zend_Auth's storage to hold information that's likely to change - by default it only holds the identity (for good reason). I'd probably make a User class that wrapped all the Auth, ACL (and probably profile) functionality that uses a static get_current() method to load the user stashed in the session. This bypasses all the consistency issues you run into when stuffing it into the session as well as giving you a single point from which to implement caching if/when you actually need the performance boost.
