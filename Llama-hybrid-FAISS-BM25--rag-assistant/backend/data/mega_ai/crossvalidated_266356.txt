You are getting advice from profoundly ignorant people. In logistic regression the outcome is categorical and the predictor is a quantity or a vector of quanities, and the regression function is a logistic , or sigmoid function, so that $$ \operatorname{logit} \Pr(\text{something}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \beta_2 y + \beta_3 z + \text{etc.} $$ where $$ \operatorname{logit} p = \log \frac p {1-p}. $$ Each data point has values of $x,y,z,\ldots$ and tells you whether "something" occurred in that case or not. The parameters $\beta_0, \beta_1, \beta_3, \beta_3, \ldots$ are estimated by maximum likelihood. This sort of occurrence of the logit function is what makes it logistic regression.
