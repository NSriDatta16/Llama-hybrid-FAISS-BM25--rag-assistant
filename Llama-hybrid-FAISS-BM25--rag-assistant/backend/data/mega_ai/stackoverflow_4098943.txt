perform classifier training on twitter data

I have just started learning about NLP and I have to do a course project this semester. what I want to do is : a.) Fetch the tweets from twitter for a particular topic ( How can I do that?? ) b.) Have already trained data against which I can decide if the tweets I fetched has positive or negative sentiment ( how to train this data ) c.) show the results to user I want to use Java for this, and I found that we can use LingPipe for this I am all new to this and building the app for the first time, so guidance is very much appreciated
