One way to do this is to sample the cluster assignment (call it $z$ ) from the not-quite-a-full-posterior $P(Z|X_1, X_2)$ and then sample $X_3$ from $P(X_3 | Z=z, X_1, X_2)$ . The second task involves just one cluster, and it's covered extensively elsewhere -- look for "multivariate Gaussian conditional distributions". The first task is the same as the usual prediction task for "which cluster is $X$ from", but you get the cluster probabilities ignoring $X_3$ . This is how I would do it. Bayes' Rule says that if you have a prior $P(Z)$ on your cluster assignments, then $$P(Z=z | X_{-k}) = \frac{P(X_{-k} | Z=z)P(Z=z)}{\sum_z P(X_{-k} | Z=z)P(Z=z)}$$ . If cluster $z$ has mean $\mu$ and covariance $\Sigma$ (paying attention to only variables 1 & 2), then you need to compute $$P(X_1, X_2 | Z=z) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\det(2\pi\Sigma)}}\exp[\frac{-(x-\mu)^T\Sigma^{-1}(x-\mu)}{2}]$$ .
