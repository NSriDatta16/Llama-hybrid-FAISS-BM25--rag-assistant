Perl Pattern Matching Question

I am trying to match patterns in perl and need some help. I need to delete from a string anything that matches [xxxx] i.e. opening bracket-things inside it-first closing bracket that occurs. So I am trying to substitute with space the opening bracket, things inside, first closing bracket with the following code : if($_ =~ /[/) { print "In here!\n"; $_ =~ s/[(.*?)]/ /ig; } Similarly I need to match i.e. angular bracket-things inside it-first closing angular bracket. I am doing that using the following code : if($_ =~ / / /ig; } This some how does not seem to work. My sample data is as below : 'Joanne' "'Jo'" 'Rowling', OBE [http://news bbc co uk/1/hi/uk/793844 stm Caine heads birthday honours list] BBC News 17 June 2000 Retrieved 25 October 2000 , [http://content scholastic com/browse/contributor jsp?id=3578 JK Rowling Biography] Scholastic com Retrieved 20 October 2007 better known as 'J K Rowling' , [http://www telegraph co uk/news/uknews/1531779/BBCs-secret-guide-to-avoid-tripping-over-your-tongue html Daily Telegraph, BBC's secret guide to avoid tripping over your tongue, 19 October 2006] is a British author best known as the creator of the [[Harry Potter]] fantasy series, the idea for which was conceived whilst on a train trip from Manchester to London in 1990 The Potter books have gained worldwide attention, won multiple awards, sold more than 400 million copies and been the basis for a popular series of films, in which Rowling had creative control serving as a producer in two of the seven installments [http://www businesswire com/news/home/20100920005538/en/Warner-Bros -Pictures-Worldwide-Satellite-Trailer-Debut%C2%A0Harry Business Wire - Warner Bros Pictures mentions J K Rowling as producer ] Any help would be appreciated.
