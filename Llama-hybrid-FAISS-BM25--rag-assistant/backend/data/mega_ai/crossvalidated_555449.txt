The fact that a study oversampling certain types of persons does not imply that the sampling weights should be used in the analysis. Use of sample weights causes upweighting of certain individuals which by necessity (since the total sample size is fixed) leads to downweighting of other individuals. Though sampling statisticians will hate this idea, sample weights should be used only when computing estimates of population averages. This is done at the post-regression-coefficient-estimation phase. Example: Suppose that a study oversampled males. The best estimate of the sex effect uses the unweighted sample values and must suffer a little from the sex ratio not being 1:1. The idea is to use full information by conditioning on all covariates. Once you condition on sex=male to get a survival estimate, one does not need to take into account that P(sex=male) > 0.5 from our unequal probability sample
