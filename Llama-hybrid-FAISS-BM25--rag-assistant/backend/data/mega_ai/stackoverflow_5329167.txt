OpenGL for Embedded Systems (OpenGL ES) is a subset of the OpenGL 3D graphics API designed for embedded devices such as mobile phones, PDA's, and video game consoles. OpenGL ES is managed by the not-for-profit technology consortium, the Khronos Group, Inc. Current version is OpenGL ES 3.2 ( opengl-es-3.2 ), publicly released in August 2015. OpenGL ES 2.0 OpenGL ES 2.0 eliminates most of the fixed-function rendering pipeline in favor of a programmable one. Almost all rendering features of the transform and lighting pipelines, such as the specification of materials and light parameters formerly specified by the fixed-function API, are replaced by shaders written by the graphics programmer. As a result, OpenGL ES 2.0 is not backwards compatible with OpenGL ES 1.1. OpenGL ES 3.0 The latest major version is the OpenGL ES 3.0 specification, publicly released in August 2012. OpenGL ES 3.0 is backwards compatible with OpenGL ES 2.0, enabling applications to incrementally add new visual features to applications.
