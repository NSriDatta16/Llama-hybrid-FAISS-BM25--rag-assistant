What html/CSS/JS technology widgets does pagii.com use?

I am interested in creating a web page editor like the one used in pagii.com? It's unique among the web based editors I have seen in that it offers a great deal of customization. For example you can insert an image and drag it anywhere on the screen and resize it on the fly. The elements can be placed anywhere on the screen and layered in a wysiwyg fashion. Initially I thought it was Flash based but it's not. Are there CSS/Javascript libraries which provide similar capabilities? I mean a complete framework and not just stuff as in some Jquery plugins?
