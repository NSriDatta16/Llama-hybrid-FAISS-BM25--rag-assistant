PHP function to conditionally replace urls in html

So, I'm trying to create a function which does the following: Receive HTML in a string Find file paths (in SRC= attributes) Only replace image urls starting with the domain example.com Only replace images (jpg, jpeg, gif, png) Replace the domain of the image with example2.com Return HTML with image URLs replaced. Is there an elegant way of doing that? I've been struggling to create a regular expression to take care of it me, and have only met with epic fail so far. Any help greatly appreciated.
