This problem is identical with the problem of "learning to rank (LTR)" in the field of Machine Learning and IR. LTR focuses on how to rank the web pages according a given query. So, your problem is same as LTR's. Now, many approaches have been applied to address this problem. These approaches can be categorized into three directions: 1. point-wise approach, that is treat the ranking problem as a regression or classification problem (similar with the approaches proposed as linear transformation.). 2. pair-wise approach, as described by @GaBorgulya, the state-of-art model is RankSVM , which works well for this task. 3. List-wise approach, treating the list as whole, performing permutation (as I guss), then find a best ranking. I'm lazy man, you can easily ask for google to search "Learning to Rank", and also the Yahoo conducts a context about this field last year. You will find more technique and theory papers for this task.
