What is the difference between Conv1D and Conv2D?

I was going through the keras convolution docs and I have found two types of convultuion Conv1D and Conv2D. I did some web search and this is what I understands about Conv1D and Conv2D; Conv1D is used for sequences and Conv2D uses for images. I always thought convolution nerual networks were used only for images and visualized CNN this way A image is considered as a large matrix and then a filter will slide over this matrix and compute the dot product. This I believe what keras mentions as a Conv2D. If Conv2D works this way then what is the mechanism of Conv1D and how we can imagine its mechanism?
