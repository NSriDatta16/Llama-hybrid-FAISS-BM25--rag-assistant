One promising approach is to formulate the two marginal Bayesian models just as we always do, then to model the dependency of the two outcomes using a copula. That way posterior inference can be done marginally as always but you could also make efficient joint statements regarding unions or intersections of conditions (assertions) involving the two outcomes and their association with the independent variable. I've been looking for a good example of specifying a copula model in Stan --- I hope someone can find one and report back.
