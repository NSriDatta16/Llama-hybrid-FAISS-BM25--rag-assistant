To make the expiration date a little bit more difficult to avoid, you could store the time of the most recent execution somewhere "hidden" and make sure the user can not go back in time. Any decent "hacker" will get around this, but for joe the average user it will be too much of a hassle. Working with a wrong date has some bad side effects when using other programs that rely on the correct date/time. So when the user is desperate enough to change his date/time every time he starts your software, he wont buy it anyway... Improving the expiration mechanism further is just like copy protection for games at this point. Good games sell anyway, bad ones don't.
