Average of arrival times excluding outliers

I'm working with a dataset of arrival times as below: stop 1 stop 2 stop 3 09:01:00 09:03:01 09:05:12 09:01:23 09:03:03 09:05:13 09:01:12 09:02:55 09:05:40 09:02:01 09:03:30 09:04:44 09:00:45 09:03:31 09:05:55 ... The data correspond to arrival times for bus stops. I would like to calculate the average arrival time for each stop. I could calculate the median but I want to exclude the outliers. For example if one day the bus arrives to Stop1 at 09:03:55 (due to traffic jam, weather conditions, etc), this arrival time will not reflect the normal behavior and I want to exclude it from my calculations (for stop1). So my question is how I could determine the range of "valid" arrival times (for example from 09:00:00 to 09:02:30) just with my dataset? EDIT I've mentioned 'the median', but if you know a better approach to this problem I would like to know it.
