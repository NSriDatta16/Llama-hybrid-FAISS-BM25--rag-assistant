There is also a different less sophisticated method to handle this. However, I recon Uri Goren's proposed methods probably work better. I used a different method to normalize the time spent on a article page. I divided the time by the amount of words of the article. Also, I set a maximum of time spent on page by looking at the average reading time. By dividing the lenght of an article by the maximum time someone would need to read that article, an upper bound was set. In that way outliers were handled. I would also recommended utilising more implicit feedback variables such as scroll lenght. This variable can be used to enforce the time spent on a page.
