Finally, after searching a lot, I had solved it. As said by TheDeadMedic - "Are you sure that the post content does actually contain HTML? Don't forget WordPress will add paragraphs on-the-fly, and won't necessarily store them in the DB." WordPress does by using a function called wpautop(); I just used this with get_the_content(); , and I got it working. Here's an example of how you can achieve this - function myPluginReplaceContent() { $content = wpautop(get_the_content()); $content .= myPluginGetData(); // do whatever you want to - here return $content; } EDIT : I found that this function won't apply filters by other plugins. The following function won't cause any issues. function myPluginReplaceContent($thecontent) { $thecontent .= myPluginGetData(); // do whatever you want to - here return $content; }
