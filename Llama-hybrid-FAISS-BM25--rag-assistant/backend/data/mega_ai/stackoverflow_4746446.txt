Magento Connect is not working after migration

I have a problem with Magento after move it from local to live server: Magento connect is not working properly. I will explain it: I have access to Magento connect, but the extensions are not working. I have tried to delete the pear.ini file but didn't work. I have tried to delete the app/etc/local.xml file, copying the following files from a clean installation: clear, pear, peardev and pecl, and then running the installation process again, but nothing happened. Is there a way to get my downloaded extensions working wihtout do a clean install? Greets to all and I aplogize for my English.
