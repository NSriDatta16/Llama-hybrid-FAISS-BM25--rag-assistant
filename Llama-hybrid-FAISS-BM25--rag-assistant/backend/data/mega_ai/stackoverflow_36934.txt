OK my verdict :-): I have used successfully zend without mod_rewrite and it's as you've all said site/index.php/controller/action. I knew that before posting this. I've also found out around the net a technique that "pushes" 404 pages to index.php therefore what is not a resource (eg. CSS, image, etc) get there, with one exception: POST values. So I decided that the next time an application has to be made in the specific server, to ask politely for mod_rewrite. If the administrator can not provide it, talk with my boss or if it is for me, switch provider. Generally, it is a shame sometimes that the PHP market is so much fragmented (php4, php5, php6, mod_rewrite, mod_auth, mod_whatever), but this is another story...
