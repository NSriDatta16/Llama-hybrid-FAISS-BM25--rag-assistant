Combining two sets of principal components in a regression

My data set consists of a large number of time series of two frequencies: daily and monthly. I am interested in doing a predictive regression on a monthly and weekly basis. I am thinking of dividing my data set in two (daily and monthly), and then do principal component analysis on each subset individually and use the two separate sets of principal components in my predictive regression. Are there any contraindications in combining two separate sets of principal components (one from the daily and one from the monthly data) in a regression?
