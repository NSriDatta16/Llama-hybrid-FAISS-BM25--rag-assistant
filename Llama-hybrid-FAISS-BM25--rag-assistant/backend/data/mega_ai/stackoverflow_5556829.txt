ColdFusion 8 JavaLoader LingPipe or OpenNLP, how do I init it?

I'm using the JavaLoader.cfc. I've used it before, but am having trouble understanding how to get one of these libraries to respond to me. I've placed the JAR files into my java folder. I've created the "JavaLoader" object and passed the "paths" to it. But it keeps saying it cannot find the class names in the jar files or something along those lines... The requested class could not be found. The requested class opennlp.tools.sentdetect could not be found in the loaded jars/directories. I recognize I'm a total n00b when it comes to Java and how to tie it in with ColdFusion. I'm sure it's something stupid that IF I KNEW I could probably use any JAR file at my disposal... Please help if you can!
