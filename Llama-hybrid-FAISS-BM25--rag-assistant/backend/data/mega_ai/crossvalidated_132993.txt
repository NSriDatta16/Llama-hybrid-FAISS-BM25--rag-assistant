What is the simple standard error for MCMC?

Simply put: suppose that we have observed $X=\left\{ X_{1},\ldots,X_{n}\right\}$. We then need to calculate some statistic $T$ using MCMC, using $M$ loops (By "loops" I mean the number of times the chain is repeated to come up with a sensible posterior). We then repeat this entire experiment $P$ times as a part of some sort of simulation study. What is a sensible estimate of the standard error of $T$? At the moment, I am calculating the standard error without considering $n$ - so I do not think this is correct. Many thanks in advance!
