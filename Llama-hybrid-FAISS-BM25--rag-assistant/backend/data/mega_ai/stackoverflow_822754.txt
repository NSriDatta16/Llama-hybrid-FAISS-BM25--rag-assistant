Reorganizing a subversion repository with branches

I am trying to reorganize a subversion 1.6 repository that has branches. It appears that if you move a file in the trunk and that file has changes in a branch, when those changes are merged into the branch, they are no longer there. I will try to illustrate below: 1. Repo before move trunk/a.txt trunk/b.txt branches/feature/a.txt branches/feature/b.txt 2. File branches/feature/b.txt is changed. 3. Repo reorganized trunk/a.txt trunk/new-location/b.txt branches/feature/a.txt branches/feature/b.txt 4. Changes from trunk merged to feature trunk/a.txt trunk/new-location/b.txt branches/feature/a.txt branches/feature/new-location/b.txt The folder branches/feature is a copy of trunk . Upon completion of step 4, all changes to file b.txt from feature branch are no longer there. I thought this was fixed in svn 1.5? If this is not an option, i still need to somehow reorganize my entire repostory. Doing the move when the branches have all been merged into the trunk is not an option. I always have at least 1 branch plus trunk at any one time.
