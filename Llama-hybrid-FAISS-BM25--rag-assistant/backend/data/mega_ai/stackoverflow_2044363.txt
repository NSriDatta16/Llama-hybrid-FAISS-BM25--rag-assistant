To begin with with, I'm not sure I agree with the non-standard interface part. I suppose it depends on who the users actually are, but I would definitely say that that kind of text box/auto search functionality is becoming very standard from airline booking forms to search engines. About the selection method, I would go for the text box method, so that when a user types in text a search starts the results of which are displayed in a drop down. The search should of course search both surnames and first names with some kind of intelligent regex at least. On top of that I would still add a selection field, maybe not a drop down but perhaps a list box that contains all the employees, possibly with options to order the names by surname or first. This would be for those who don't know the spelling of a persons name, or can't quite remember the name. Otherwise the layout you have there seems to work for me. I wouldn't play around with dragging and dropping anything. This of course creates a nice feeling to it, but is way more unclear on what should be done to assign the tasks. If you find yourself writing instructions on how to use the thing then you've gone overboard. The other thing that I thought of would be to have an appleish menu where you have an empty list at first and when you click on the list, the input fields appear. The problem with this is that since the UI doesn't have indication on what you should do to add stuff to the list, people are easily left baffled.
