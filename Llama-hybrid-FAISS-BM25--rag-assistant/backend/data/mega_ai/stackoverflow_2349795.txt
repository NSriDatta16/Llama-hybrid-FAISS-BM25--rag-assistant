No it doesn't matter which container it is, and in fact this is not that important to cryptographic hashes; much more important is the birthday paradox , which says that you only need to hash sqrt(numberNeededByPigeonHolePrincipal) values, on average, before finding a collision. Thus, the hash needs to be large enough that the square-root of the search space is too large to brute-force. The square-root-of-search-space for SHA1 is 2 80 , and as of March 2012, no two values have ever been found with the same SHA1-hash (though I predict that will happen within the next year or two..); same with SHA2, a family of hashes which all have an even larger search-space. MD5 has been broken for a while though.
