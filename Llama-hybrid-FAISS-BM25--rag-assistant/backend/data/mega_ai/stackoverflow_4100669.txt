I'm assuming by "pop-up" you mean something similar to the CNN edition selector that slides down from the top or like the SO "a new answer has been posted to this page" bar at the top of this page. An actual javascript window popup would be incredibly intrusive for something like this. Show the message once. Once it is shown, store its status in a persistent cookie and never show it again. As an alternative, provide an X somewhere so the user can get rid of it and determine never to see it again. They don't want to see it in the first place, but if you have to show it... whatever. Mostly - fix your issues. Don't spend time worrying about fancy ways to avoid fixing them.
