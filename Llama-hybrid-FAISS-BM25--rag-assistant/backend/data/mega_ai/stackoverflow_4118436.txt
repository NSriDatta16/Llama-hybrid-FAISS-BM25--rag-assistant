Do ALL android devices have an internal SD card?

On the first run of my app, I am downloading a pretty big file to /sdcard/ I already know this can fail if the internal SD card of the user's phone is full or not mounted (e.g. if the phone is connected to a PC as a mass storage device, or has not been properly disconnected from a PC). But are there any android devices with NO INTERNAL SD CARD ? (on which my app would definitely be unusable)
