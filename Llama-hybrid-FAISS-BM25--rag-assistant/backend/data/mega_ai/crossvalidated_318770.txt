Difference between Random forest vs Bagging in sklearn

I know that Random forest uses Bagging, but how does ensemble give a single prediction in sklearn Bagging vs Random forest? Also, I do not understand why in Bagging you not need to choose a tree estimator, while not in RF? other than this, are the other steps the same? wht are main implementation differences in sklearn Bagging vs Random forest? bonus points if you have "explain like I'm 5 years old" simple example using sklearn please.
