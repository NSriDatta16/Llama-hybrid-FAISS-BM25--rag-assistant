Pivot DataTable with Unknow number of columns

How would you go about pivoting data in a datatable where the number of columns varies from? A few columns would always be in the datatable such as ID and Name but the rest could vary. I have been struggling a lot with this and can't seem to come up with an elegant solution. Does anyone have a suggestion?
