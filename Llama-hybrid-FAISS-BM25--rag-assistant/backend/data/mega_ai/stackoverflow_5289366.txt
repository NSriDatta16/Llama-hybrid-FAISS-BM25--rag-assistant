Can Boost.PHP to overwrite core PHP functions, such as require_once and include?

I wonder it is possible to use Boost.PHP to replace some PHP core functions logic and/or extend them. So What I want is simple: When a php script calls for require_once(dirname(__FILE__) . "/file.php"); I want to receive dirname(__FILE__) . "/file.php" with my function, create somehow that required file (in my case, go to some distributed storage), and return that file to PHP interpreter as if it was desired file. Is it possible with Boost.PHP? How could I do such thing?
