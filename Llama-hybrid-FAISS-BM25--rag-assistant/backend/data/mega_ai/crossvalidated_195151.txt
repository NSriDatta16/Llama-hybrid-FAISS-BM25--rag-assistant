Time series analysis: since volatility depends on time, why are returns stationary?

I run Dickey Fuller test in order to know if stock returns are stationary. I get that no matter which stock I take, his return is stationary. I don't know why I get this result since it is clear that volatility depends on time (hence, returns are not stationary since their variance depends on time). I'd like to get both a mathematical and intuitive answer.
