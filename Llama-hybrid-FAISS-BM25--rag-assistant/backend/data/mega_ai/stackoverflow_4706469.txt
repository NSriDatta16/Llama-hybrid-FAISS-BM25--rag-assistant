1 return 'localStorage' in window && window['localStorage'] !== null; This returns true if the window object contains a property with the name localStorage and the value of that property is not null . 2 return window.localStorage != undefined This returns true if the window object contains a propety with the name localStorage and the value of that property is not undefined or null (I am assuming that the global property undefined holds the value undefined )
