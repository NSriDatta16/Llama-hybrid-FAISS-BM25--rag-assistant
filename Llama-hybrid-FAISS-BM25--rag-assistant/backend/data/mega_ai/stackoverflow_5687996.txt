The standard for HTML5 says: The media attribute gives the intended media type of the media resource, to help the user agent determine if this media resource is useful to the user before fetching it. Its value must be a valid media query. If you follow that, it will lead you to the Media Queries page. The normative reference for media types is the CSS2.1 standard, which states: all Suitable for all devices. braille Intended for braille tactile feedback devices. embossed Intended for paged braille printers. handheld Intended for handheld devices (typically small screen, limited bandwidth). print Intended for paged material and for documents viewed on screen in print preview mode. Please consult the section on paged media for information about formatting issues that are specific to paged media. projection Intended for projected presentations, for example projectors. Please consult the section on paged media for information about formatting issues that are specific to paged media. screen Intended primarily for color computer screens. speech Intended for speech synthesizers. Note: CSS2 had a similar media type called 'aural' for this purpose. See the appendix on aural style sheets for details. tty Intended for media using a fixed-pitch character grid (such as teletypes, terminals, or portable devices with limited display capabilities). Authors should not use pixel units with the "tty" media type. tv Intended for television-type devices (low resolution, color, limited-scrollability screens, sound available). Note that HTML4 has a different list of media types: ‘print’, ‘screen’, ‘aural’, ‘braille’, ‘handheld’, ‘print’, ‘projection’, ‘screen’, ‘tty’, ‘tv’.
