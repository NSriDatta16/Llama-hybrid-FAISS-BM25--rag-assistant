I had posted the same question in the stan forum and the response was the following: "Try using the predict functions in brms, or analogs. It looks like youâ€™re estimating fitted results, which are conditional averages, not draws from the posterior predictive distribution." Now when I use (add_predicted_draws instead of add_fitted_draws), tibble(x=1:100) %>% add_predicted_draws(hum) %>% ggplot(aes(x = .prediction)) + geom_density() I obtained the following plot This is the nature of the zero inflation I was expecting from the posterior draws. In was incorrectly looking at conditional averages. Thanks to @franzsf in the stan forum for pointing this out.
