Number 1 is not a valid option, an application package (.apk) with the music in the raw will weight around 80Mb. An Android user will not download an application that is 80Mb size (if there is enough memory free to install it). You should use option 2.

BTW: Use the function android.os.Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory() to get a directory in the sdcard. Best,
