What type of neural network is used for image style transfer?

Tell me, please how to train a neural network to redraw pictures of people under the style of artists? For example Leonardo DiCaprio as Vincent van Gogh's Self-Portrait. I want to understand: What type of neural network is used for this? What type data are needed to train neural network? What should be the format of data? Where can I find any information?
