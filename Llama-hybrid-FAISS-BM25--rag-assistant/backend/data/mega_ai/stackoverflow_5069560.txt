Why Asp.net MVC2?

Possible Duplicates: Advantage of WPF app vs Winform for business apps? Biggest advantage to using ASP.Net MVC vs web forms I have a silly question here. Asp.net web form has tool box which helps you to drag the tools rather than writing codes for tools. but there is no such options in asp.net mvc2. we have to write codes for tools. My question here, why this complicated method ( writing codes for tools) which is time consuming become popular??? and this web forms are outdated now. what is the advantage of asp.net mv2. i simply don't understand. can u explain me.
