What gradient boosting library is the easiest to implement on mobile?

I think of implementing training and predicting in an app (both Android and iOS), but existing packages I found not seem to be very mobile-friendly (scikit-learn, xgboost, lightgbm). Random forest will also work fine. Maybe you guys could advise an easier way so it does not require a lot of porting? Would appreciate any help, Thanks!
