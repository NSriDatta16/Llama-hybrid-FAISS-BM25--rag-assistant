You're on the right track. The key is to do something similar to the section on Embedding Concepts in the link you posted. In simple terms it's little more than: ruby_init(); ruby_script("some_script"); You may need to copy over all the #ifdef stuff from main.c to get everything working. From then it's a matter of building an API to your C++ functions you want to expose, and depending on your design, multi-threading the thing.
