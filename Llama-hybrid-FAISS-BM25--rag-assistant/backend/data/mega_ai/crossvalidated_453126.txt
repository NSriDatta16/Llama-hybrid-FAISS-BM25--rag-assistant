Choosing between two models, logistic regression vs mixed model

I have a dataset, the distribution looks like this, before and after log-transformation. The data tends to separate itself towards two extremes, thus motivating me to classify them as binary and fit logistic regression. On the other hand, fitting a mixed-model on the log-transformed data might be a simpler way to go about this. I have tried to do both, and the results are not that different. How would you qualify which fit is more appropriate? I have been using R in my analysis and fit them using glm() and lmer() . Appreciate the feedback, Thanks!
