How to know which features in a linear classifier mainly led to a prediction?

I have a classification problem where I use a model (say Logistic regression or SVM) to determine whether an instance belongs to class 0 or class 1. For a certain prediction on a test instance X, if the prediction is class 0, I want to quantify the degree to which the features led to this prediction and obtain the main features that led to this prediction. For simplification, I can assume that the model is linear. I'm aware of techniques such as PCA, mutual information and information gain etc to determine correlation between features, linear combination of features, or how useful they are in an overall sense etc. My question is how to obtain the usefulness with respect to a specific instance and its prediction.
