An old and well-known technique for comparison is the Soundex algorithm. The idea is to compare not the words themselves but approximations of how they are pronounced. To what extent this actually improves the quality of the results I don't know. However it feels a bit strange to apply something like Soundex to results from a speech-to-text recognition engine. First you throw away information about how the words are pronounced, then you try to add it back again. It would be better to combine these two phases. Hence, I expect the state of the art technology in this area to do that, and be some form of adaptive classification, e.g. based on neural networks. Google does return recent research on Speech Recognition with Neural Networks .
