import django settings in app-engine-patch

I have a problem with Django settings. My app runs with app-engine-patch. I added a script that runs without django, and is reached directly via the app.yaml handlers. I then get this error: File "/base/python_runtime/python_lib/versions/third_party/django-0.96/django/conf/__init__.py", line 53, in _import_settings raise EnvironmentError, "Environment variable %s is undefined." % ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE : Environment variable DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE is undefined. I found this tip in google: # Force Django to reload its settings. from django.conf import settings settings._target = None # Must set this env var before importing any part of Django os.environ['DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE'] = 'settings' But then I got this error: raise EnvironmentError, "Could not import settings '%s' (Is it on sys.path? Does it have syntax errors?): %s" % (self.SETTINGS_MODULE, e) : Could not import settings 'settings.py' (Is it on sys.path? Does it have syntax errors?): No module named ragendja.settings_pre I think it is a problem with app-engine-patch paths modification, how can I import settings_pre correctly? Thanks!
