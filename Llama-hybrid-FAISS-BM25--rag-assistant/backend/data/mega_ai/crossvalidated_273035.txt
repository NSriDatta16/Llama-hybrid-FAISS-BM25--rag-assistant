Algorithm to Fit Intuitively Important Data Points

It is hard to formalize what I am asking without knowing the answer, but in experimental mathematics it is very common to see a graph of points hinting at limiting behavior. The graph below makes me think there could exist a nice upper function for sufficiently large n, where the least upper function is not monotonic. The "nice" points that would be most helpful to approximate a least upper function is highlighted in blue in the second picture. Is there a well recognized machine learning algorithm that does this? How does such a method formalize intuition?
