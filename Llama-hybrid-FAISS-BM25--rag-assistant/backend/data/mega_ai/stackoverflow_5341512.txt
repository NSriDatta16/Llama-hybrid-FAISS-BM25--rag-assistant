Instead of developing two separate versions of the application, ship a fully function application with limited choices available for little or no charge. Use in-app purchasing to give the user the option of selecting more topics that they could buy for a nominal charge. This will help you keep your code organized without limiting how little or how much the user will potentially buy once they have your application. here is the documentation for such a feat: http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#DOCUMENTATION/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/StoreKitGuide/Introduction/Introduction.html To expand: The Apple docs on in-app purchasing contain code given in stepwise fashion with associated explanations. Try out their code if this is the direction that you want to take and then maybe some new questions will form in your mind that you can bring back to stackoverflow!
