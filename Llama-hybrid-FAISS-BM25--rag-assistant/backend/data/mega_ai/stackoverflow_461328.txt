In those organizations (including also bank) that I have worked, there hasn't been such position. Testers and test users are used to get some feedback about usability. Best way is of course to use your own program in longer period than 5 minutes. This will show you some obvious shortcomings - like bad menu structure, missing/conflicting keyboard shortcuts, ability to sort/filter your data, remember user settings, etc. etc.
