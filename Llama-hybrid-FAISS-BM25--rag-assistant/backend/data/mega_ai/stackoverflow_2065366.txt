Flex: AdvancedDataGrid Tree dropParent

I have an AdvancedDataGrid tree with a ArrayCollection as its dataprovider. Now, for instance, i drag a leaf from one node to another node. To catch the event I'm adding a Listener to dragComplete. advancedDG.addEventListener(DragEvent.DRAG_COMPLETE, dRAG_COMPLETE_Handler); public function dRAG_COMPLETE_Handler(event: DragEvent):void{ var dropNode:Object = event.dropParent; My Problem: I want to know the new node where the leaf was dropped. Actually i would have expected that in the event there is a property like dropParent. This is not the case. Sry for my bad English.
