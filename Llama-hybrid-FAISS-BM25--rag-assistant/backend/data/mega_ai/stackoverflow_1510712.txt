Convert a string to XML input stream in java

I'm trying to generate a PDF document using FOP and Java. I receive the XML as a string and not as a file. How can I convert this XML string to an XML input stream so that I can call xslfoTransformer.transform(source, res); where source is my XML string as an Input stream. Please provide your suggestions.
