State management is a critical thing to master when coming to Web world from a desktop application perspective. Session is used to store per-user information for the current Web session on the server . It supports using a database server as the back-end store. Cookie should be used to store per-user information for the current Web session or persistent information on the client , therefore client has control over the contents of a cookie. Cache object is shared between users in a single application . Its primary purpose is to cache data from a data store and should not be used as a primary storage. It supports automatic invalidation features. Application object is shared between users to store application-wide state and should be used accordingly. If your application is used by a number of unauthenticated users, I suggest you store the data in a cookie. If it requires authentication, you can either store the data in the DB manually or use ASP.NET profile management features.
