Gonna get flagged for this one...sigh If all you want is a wrapper for stored procs, and you are using SQL Server, you might consider using LINQ to SQL or Entity Framework. It would probably be less work for you. Typically it is just a drag-drop operation and everything is mapped for you. Otherwise, what Craig said it (mostly) true. You have to create the hbm mappings for the sproc yourself.
