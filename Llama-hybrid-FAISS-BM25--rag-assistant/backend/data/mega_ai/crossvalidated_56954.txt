I don't think you can determine the optimal dimension. The main issue with you question would be that any "optimal" dimension will depend on which features you will be using or how you will combine the ones you have. SVM can deal with up to (indirectly) infinite dimensions thanks to some mathematical tricks. Again, this depends on the specific kernel function you applied (among other factors)
