I would probably go with the enum, placing those values and the logging code into a common Assembly that can be called by each application. It might not be the most elegant solution ever, but it gets the job done and let's you move on to more important things -- like good core business logic that doesn't throw too many errors :-). Another option might be to put the error codes and human-readable descriptions into a config file. That way you would have some flexibility for improving the error messages. I've never tried that, but now that I think of it, I can see it being a real boon in many situations.
