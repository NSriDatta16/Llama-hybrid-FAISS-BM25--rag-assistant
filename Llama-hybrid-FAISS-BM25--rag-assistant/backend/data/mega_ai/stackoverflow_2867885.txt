You can download the samples from http://java.sun.com/javaee/downloads/index.jsp (part of the Java EE 6 Web Profile SDK, the Java EE 6 SDK or NetBeans 6.8 ). You can also get them straight into GlassFish v3 via the Update Center . Just in case, note that you can also get Java EE Code Samples & Apps from http://java.sun.com/javaee/reference/code/
