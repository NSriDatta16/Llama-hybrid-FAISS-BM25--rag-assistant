Based on what I'm hearing, everything is as it should be. Recall that a logistic regression model takes the form $$\log(p/(1-p)) = \text{intercept} + \beta_1 * x_1 + \ldots \beta_p * x_p.$$ When $p = .5$, the left hand side is $log(1) = 0$. If the event is rare, then the left hand side is negative. A large negative intercept mixed with smaller positive contributions from the regressors can still result in a negative log odds prediction and hence a small estimated probability. Since your regressors are class variables, one of them must be the baseline. All other coefficient values are relative to that one so you may want to look into which category your software chose as baseline.
