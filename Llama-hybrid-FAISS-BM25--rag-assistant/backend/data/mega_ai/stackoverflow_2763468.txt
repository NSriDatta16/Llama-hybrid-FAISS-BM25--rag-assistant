If you use Swing I recommend working with the AWT internal drag and drop system. As Sun mentions on their guides: We do not recommend that you create your own drag and drop support using the AWT classes. This implementation would require significant complex support internal to each component. [source] For a deeper look at swing dnd you should try the Drag and Drop-Guide . If you decide to use a different toolkit than Swing you could be successfull finding any good third party drag and drop libraries.
