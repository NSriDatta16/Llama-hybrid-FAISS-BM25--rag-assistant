We have had very good results from using Fowler's Presentation Model concept. I strongly recommend that anyone who is doing UI development read Fowler's coverage ( GUI Architectures ) of the various approaches that have been tried in this arena - it's a fantastic read, and gives great insight in to the challenges and successes of each approach.
