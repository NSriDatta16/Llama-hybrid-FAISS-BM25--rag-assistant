For my projects I use NLP Lab , by John Snow Labs. It provides automated annotation and model training, saves time compared to other tools, and is completely free of charge. Another impressive thing about it (which I found) is that you don't need to have a prior experience in coding, because there is no coding involved. You can even invite your team members and collaborate with them in your project. The documentation can be a long read, I have provided a direct link here: docs
