Statistical inference is made of the whole collection of conclusions one can draw from a given dataset and an associated hypothetical model, including the fit of the said model. To quote from Wikipedia , Inference is the act or process of deriving logical conclusions from premises known or assumed to be true. and, Statistical inference uses mathematics to draw conclusions in the presence of uncertainty. Estimation is but one aspect of inference where one substitutes unknown parameters (associated with the hypothetical model that generated the data) with optimal solutions based on the data (and possibly prior information about those parameters). It should always be associated with an evaluation of the uncertainty of the reported estimates, evaluation that is an integral part of inference. Maximum likelihood is one instance of estimation, but it does not cover the whole of inference. On the opposite, Bayesian analysis offers a complete inference machine.
