The fact that there are no API hooks to do this should be a red flag - you shouldn't do it. It's not using Private APIs (which will get you a rejection), but it's leveraging undocumented behavior, which Apple advises against. In fact, last week at the iPhone tech talk I was specifically warned by an Apple Dev Evangelist to not to do stuff like this because it will break in the future. If you really want to do your own thing when it comes to UIAlertViews, you should create your own view and present it via a Modal View Controller.
