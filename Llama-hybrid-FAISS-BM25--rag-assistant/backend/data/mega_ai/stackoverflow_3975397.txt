Binding a table adapter query to a chart

I'm writing some code that will synchronize data in a database with a chart (it's ZedGraph , in fact - but it doesn't matter). I want to do something like this: chart draws data from the databse whenever new data is added to database, it's immediately drawn on the chart So far everything works OK, because I can bind chart line DataSource to a data table. But I also want to draw a moving average of the values on the chart. So I used Table Adapter to write a query that calculates the moving average and returns the result. Then I created a new chart line and bind it to the result of a query: it = new DatabaseDataSetTableAdapters.IntradayAdapter(); line.DataSource = it.GetSMABy(name); Is it possible, that whenever new data is added to the database, it gets drawn on the chart and recalculates the moving average without any action listeners?
