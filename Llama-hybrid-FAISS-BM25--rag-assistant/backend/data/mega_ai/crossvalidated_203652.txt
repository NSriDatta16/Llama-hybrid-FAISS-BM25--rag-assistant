How do I detrend this (non-linear) time series before differencing?

I have a variable that looks like this (after taking natural log): I can't run stationarity tests as there are clearly structural changes in the data. How can I get around this â€“ am I supposed to use dummy variables here? Would I include them in any VAR / VECM model that I'd run with this variable?
