I'd take your SourceStn and DestStn out of your TrainTbl -- it's needless clutter. Anyway, you can get what you're looking for with: select src.TrnNumber, srcSt.StnName as SourceStation, srcSt.StnCity as SourceCity, src.DepTime, destSt.StnName as DestinationStation, destSt.StnCity as DestinationCity, dest.ArrTime, (abs(dest.HopIndex - src.HopIndex)) as Stops from TrainHopTbl src inner join TrainHopTbl dest on src.TrnNumber = dest.TrnNumber inner join StationTbl srcSt on src.StnCode = srcSt.StationCode inner join StationTbl destSt on dest.StnCode = destSt.StationCode where src.StnCode = 'WDC' and dest.StnCode = 'NYC' and src.HopIndex Edit: I haven't taken into account transfers here. Your question mentioned just straight route trains. Let me know if you want transfers, as well.
