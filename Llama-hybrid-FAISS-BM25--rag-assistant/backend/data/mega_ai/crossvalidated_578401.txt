Actually, this is (perhaps surprisingly) fairly straightforward. The probability of rolling a 4 is $1/6$ , and each roll is independent. The number of rolls is therefore distributed according to the Geometric distribution with probability parameter $1/6$ ; the mean of the Geometric is 6, so, on average, it will take us 6 rolls to see a 4. The probability of rolling a 6 on the roll immediately following a 4 is also $1/6$ , and each roll is independent. Therefore, on average, it will take us 6 rolls to see a 6 after a 4. Note that these rolls only occur after a 4 has been observed, which, as we have found above, only occurs on $1/6$ of the rolls. The final number: $6\cdot6 = 36$ . A little R code provides some extra confidence in our result: n_rolls with result: One Sample t-test data: n_rolls t = -1.1521, df = 99999, p-value = 0.2493 alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 36 95 percent confidence interval: 35.66185 36.08779 sample estimates: mean of x 35.87482 If we want to do this with a Markov chain, we need to construct an appropriate state space, transition matrix, and starting state probability vector. The state space can take on 36 values, e.g., $\{(1,1), (1,2), \dots, (5,6), (6,6)\}$ , with the first value of each pair being the "first" of the two dice rolls and the second value being the "second" of the two dice rolls. The transition matrix is pretty straightforward; state $(1,1)$ transitions to state $(1,1)$ with probability $1/6$ , to state $(1,2)$ with probability $1/6$ , etc.; we can only transition to states whose first element corresponds to the second element of the current state (e.g., state $(1,3)$ can only transition to states $(3,1), (3,2), \dots, (3,6)$ .) We assume we start out in any of the 36 states with equal probability, and the starting number of dice rolls equals $2$ to reflect the first two dice rolls that determine our starting state. # Construct transition matrix A with result: One Sample t-test data: n_rolls t = 0.35505, df = 99999, p-value = 0.7226 alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 36 95 percent confidence interval: 35.82407 36.25377 sample estimates: mean of x 36.03892
