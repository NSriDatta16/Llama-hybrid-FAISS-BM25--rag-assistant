Consequence of ignoring the order of a categorical variable with different levels in logistic regression

As the title suggests, I am hesitating on whether to use ordinal logistic regression or not. I don't think I have the time to understand that and to figure out how to work it out in R, so can I just ignore it? Will the consequences be serious (i.e. seriously under/over-estimate the effect size)? Thanks.
