There are certain points that one should keep practicing that always prepare data first properly and make it uniform shape by applying the transformation technique or any other feature engineering methodology. As u mentioned problem in question i assume that u suppose to do iterative training. In that case when new data comes it comes with new features so whatever parameter learned during the previous iteration it will not help.U might have to deal with such a scenario in iteration wise.At each iteration u will have to train new parameter(new model). Technique suggested by @Fnguyen is cool but not scalable in production. If your new data come up with same feature set than u can use existing trained parameter of PCA or transformer. If new data is for training than load existing PCA and retrain it and transform new data and fit into model. PLease put feedback and your point of view as response.
