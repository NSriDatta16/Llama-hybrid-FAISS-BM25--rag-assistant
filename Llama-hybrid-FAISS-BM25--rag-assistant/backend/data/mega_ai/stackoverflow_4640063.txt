division with wrong result

I am trying to divide integers but get 0 as result. I just do not understand what i am doing wrong. I am using only int's in this example but get the same result testing with float or double. The code i use is: int wrongAnswers = askedQuestions - playerResult; int percentCorrect = (playerResult / askedQuestions) * 100; int percentWrong = (wrongAnswers / askedQuestions) * 100; NSLog(@"askedQuestions: %i", askedQuestions); NSLog(@"playerResult: %i", playerResult); NSLog(@"wrongAnswers: %i", wrongAnswers); NSLog(@"percentCorrect: %i", percentCorrect); NSLog(@"percentWrong: %i", percentWrong); NSLog(@"calc: %i", (wrongAnswers + playerResult)); NSLog(@"wrong answers %: %i %%", ((wrongAnswers / askedQuestions) * 100)); The result i get is: 2011-01-09 16:45:53.411 XX[8296:207] askedQuestions: 5 2011-01-09 16:45:53.412 XX[8296:207] playerResult: 2 2011-01-09 16:45:53.412 XX[8296:207] wrongAnswers: 3 2011-01-09 16:45:53.413 XX[8296:207] percentCorrect: 0 % 2011-01-09 16:45:53.414 XX[8296:207] percentWrong: 0 % 2011-01-09 16:45:53.414 XX[8296:207] calc: 5 2011-01-09 16:45:53.415 XX[8296:207] wrong answers : 0 % I would very much appreciate help :-)
