Even though this will probably be migrated to Server Fault, I ran into the exact same problem with this instance earlier today. It appears that this image assumes that there will be ephemeral storage present , when there is none on the micro instances. To work around this, comment out the following line in /etc/fstab: /dev/sda2 /mnt auto defaults,comment=cloudconfig 0 0 This should prevent the instance from hanging on startup, or at least it did for me with ami-1234de7b.
