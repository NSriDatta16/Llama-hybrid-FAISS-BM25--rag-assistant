Does the error continue "No such file or directory at..."? If so, then I think that the problem is that (for whatever reason) when you get to that point in the script, whatever you are passing to XML::Simple has no xml file in it. Long story short, the script you are using may be passing a bad variable (blank? empty?) to XML::Simple at which point the module chokes. To debug, add a check on whatever you hand to XML::Simple before you pass it along. (See the next paragraph for a concrete example explaining why I think this may be your problem.) A few months ago, I had a similar problem with Weather::Google . In a nutshell, the weather module was trying to get data from Google via LWP::Simple without a user agent . Google began (apparently) to reject requests without a user agent. I had to backtrack through the modules because the error appeared to come from XML::Simple . In fact, it was caused by what was done in LWP::Simple and Weather::Google . Or rather, the error was a result of Weather::Google not checking the data that was in an object created via LWP::Simple . In a case like this, it can be hard at first to see what's going wrong and where.
