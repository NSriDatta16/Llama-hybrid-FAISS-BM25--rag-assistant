Measure Variance over time for an average person across a large group of people

What would be the best way to measure variance of a metrics over time for an average person across a large group of people. For instance I have the triglycerides number for 10K people measured once a year for the past 7 years (so 70K triglyceride numbers). I want each person to be represented by one triglyceride number for the study I am doing. I was wondering if it makes sense to compute a variance over just 7 data points or if I can use all the 70K data points to compute a more accurate version of variance like average of variances or median of variance. Is there any statistical guideline, standard or practice around this?
