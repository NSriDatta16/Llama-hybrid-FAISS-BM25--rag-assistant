Comment: The several points at $Y = 17$ seem give the worst fit to a Poisson distribution, as the graphs below illustrate. In the histogram at left, the green dots show probabilities in $\mathsf{Pois}(\hat\lambda = 8.27),$ where $\hat\lambda$ is the average of values other than 17. In the ECDF plot, the CDF of that Poisson distribution is shown in green. In both plots $Y$ -values at 17 (red vertical line) seem not to fit the Poisson pattern. It is too much to expect so few points to emulate a Poisson distribution closely, but the "non-17" points do not seen to make a strong case that the remaining points are sampled from a Poisson population. In particular, there are no values less than 6; they should appear with probability about 8%. It seems you may have some deeper question in mind that is not quite evident from the data you present. Y = c(rep(6, 13), rep(7, 17 ), rep(8, 9), rep(9, 8), rep(10, 8), rep(12,2), rep(14,2), rep(17, 18), 23) par(mfrow=c(1,2)) hist(Y, prob=T, br = (5:23)+.5, col="skyblue2") a.x17 = mean(Y[Y!=17]); a.x17 [1] 8.266667 x = 0:23; PDF = dpois(x, a.x17) points(x, PDF, col="darkgreen", pch=19) abline(v=17, col="red") plot(ecdf(Y), col="blue", main="ECDF of Y") lines(x, ppois(x,a.x17), type="s", col="darkgreen") abline(v=17, col="red") par(mfrow=c(1,1)) Note: A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test of the $Y$ 's shows very poor fit to the Poisson distribution with the mean of all $Y$ 's as its mean. But this is not a satisfactory test because $\lambda$ has been estimated and because the data are discrete. Perhaps if we understood your motivation for the question, someone could suggest an appropriate test. ks.test(Y, "ppois", mean(Y)) One-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test data: Y D = 0.22534, p-value = 0.0007257 alternative hypothesis: two-sided Warning message: In ks.test(Y, "ppois", mean(Y)) : ties should not be present for the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test
