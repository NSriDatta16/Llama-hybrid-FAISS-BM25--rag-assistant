When you include a1.h first, it immediately tries to include a2.h before declaring anything a2.h references something in namespace a1 that hasn't been declared yet When you include a2.h first, it immediately tries to include a1.h before declaring anything a1.h references something in namespace a2 that hasn't been declared yet Removing the typedef from a1.h, which you aren't using, and not including a2.h removes the cycle. Or as by the other commenter, forward declare class C. // a1.h #pragma once //#include "a2.h" namespace a1 { const int x = 10; // typedef a2::C B; }
