Your div.header-holder has overflow: hidden , if you change that then the organizers list should show without any trouble. Edited in response to OP's comment: They are actually being covered up by those images now, and those don't have overflow:hidden applied... You might find that applying position:absolute; to the drop-down ul (and position: relative to its parent li ) should resolve that, by taking it out of the regular document flow, and making it sit above other non- absolute elements. Of course since 'those' images are part of a carousel/slideshow, and positioned absolute too, they might not natively show 'above' them. In this case it's worth specifying a z-index for the slideshow images, and making sure that the z-index of the drop-down is higher than that for the images.
