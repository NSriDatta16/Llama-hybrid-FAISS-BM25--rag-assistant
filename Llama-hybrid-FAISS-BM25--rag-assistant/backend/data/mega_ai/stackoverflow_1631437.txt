Database Storage of Formulas with Variables

This is a little complicated, so bear with me. My employer is asking to build a system that calculates task iterations from a set of variables. Each task in a project has a specific formula used to calculate the number of times the task needs to be accomplished ("iterations"). The formula could rely on constants, variables (number-entered, so a task might be related to the number of suppliers we have or the number of offshore employees, and these values may be different for each project), and/or time (e.g. once per month, once per quarter, once per 6 months, once per year) How can I design a database to hold these formula so that I can calculate them later? Example formulas: Once per month per supplier. Twice per quarter per supplier per customer. Once per month for every six suppliers. Tech stack is C#, .NET 3.5, SQLServer 2005.
