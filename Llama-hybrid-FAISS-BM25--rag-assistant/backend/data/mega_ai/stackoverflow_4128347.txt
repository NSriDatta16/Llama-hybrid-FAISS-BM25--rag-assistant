Table Structure for versioning data

I have a table to store data for the phones and it has about 50 columns .......... should be inserted on average 30 million phones in one year ........ however, it is necessary to store a history of these phones, for example, if I want to change a field in a phone at a given date, latter I need to know at any given time, the values that had this phone. It occurred to me to have a historical and a main table, where in the main, I have the latest values of the cell, and in the historical all the changes that were made. Now this is a duplication of data, because if you change only one field, I insert into the historical table all the values, even those not changed, and in the main,this last record, so the historical table will grow enormously. How could I manage to not store too much information that may not be changed and retrieve data from a phone at any given time?
