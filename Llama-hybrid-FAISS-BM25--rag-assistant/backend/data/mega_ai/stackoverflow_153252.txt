I try to look at the unit tests as a project on their own. As with any project the organisation should follow some internal logic. It does not however have to be specific or formally defined - anything you're comfortable with is OK as long as it keeps your project well-organised and clean. So for the unit tests I usually either follow the main project code structure or (sometimes when the situation calls of it) focus on the functional areas instead. Leaving them in one heap is as you might imagine messy and difficult to maintain
