I haven't tested it, but this should probably work: Say that you have your accordion with id #accordion $('#accordion').append(' New Paragraph New data ') .accordion('destroy').accordion(); Basically, just destroy and re-create the accordion. UPDATE: Since this answer was written a refresh() method has been added to the accordion widget. It can be invoked by calling: $( ".selector" ).accordion( "refresh" ); You can read more about this method here
