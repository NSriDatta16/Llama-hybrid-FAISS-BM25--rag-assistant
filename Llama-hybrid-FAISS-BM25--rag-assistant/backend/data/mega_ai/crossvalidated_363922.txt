Random variables have variance. The policy gradient method is not a random variable, it is a class of reinforcement learning algorithms. It doesn't make much sense to ask about the variance of the policy gradient method -- it is akin asking about the variance of addition, which likewise is not itself a random variable. If you're asking about the variance of a random variable , then it is computed in the standard way for any random variable by applying the usual definition $$ \text{Var}(X) = \mathbb{E}\left[(X-\mu)^2\right] $$ where $\mathbb{E}[X]=\mu$. But it's not quite clear which random variable you are asking about, so it's not possible to say more.
