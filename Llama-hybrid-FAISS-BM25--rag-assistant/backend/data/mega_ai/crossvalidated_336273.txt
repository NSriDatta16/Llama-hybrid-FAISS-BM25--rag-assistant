Observed odds ratio

I have looked at the answers at: Difference between logit and probit models Interpretation of simple predictions to odds ratios in logistic regression In a linear regression, you regress $Y$ on $X$. For each subject, $i$, you have a $X_i$ and $Y_i$. Assuming I want to do the transformation in a logistic regression by hand, how do I obtain $P(Y_i)$ for each subject? I found the following website that goes through the procedure for categorical predictors ( http://vassarstats.net/logreg1.html ). Which is essentially computing the log odds for each combination of categorical predictors. How then do you deal with continuous predictors? For illustration, I am using the dataset from: https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/r/dae/logit-regression/ bindata What I would like to achieve is for the results from: glm.logistic to match with glm.linear where admit_transform is the log odds of admit . The whole point of this is really to understand how logistic regression works, not as a practical way to do logistic regression.
