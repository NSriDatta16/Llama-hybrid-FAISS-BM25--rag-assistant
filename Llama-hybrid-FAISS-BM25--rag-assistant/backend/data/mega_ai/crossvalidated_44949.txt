inverse logistic regression with binary covariates

I am currently using a hierarchical Bayesian framework to investigate a problem with both a single binary response variable and binary covariates, $P(Y=1 | X_i=1), i=1,\ldots,n$. Using R/JAGS I can characterize the coefficients, find the odds-ratios, etc. However, I would like to make statements regarding the inverse, $P(X_i=1 | Y=1)$. Any suggestions for an approach or pointers to literature would be appreciated.
