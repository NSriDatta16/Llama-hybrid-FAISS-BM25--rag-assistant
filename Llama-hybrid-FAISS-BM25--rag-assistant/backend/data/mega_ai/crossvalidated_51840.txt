Rationale for the use of Regressogram (Bin-Smooth)

I am taking a class in data mining and we have recently been introduced to bin-smoothing in regression analysis but i cannot seem to understand the usefulness of this method nor how the method works or why it works. Basically, an illustration was given of a data set which cannot be fit using a linear model and the bin smooth was mentioned as a better model. See this lecture slide for the data set. This is not from my class but the bin smooth on the slide is identical. Could one explain the rational behind using averages as is done in bin-smooth?
