Well, on our organization we completelly translated it with the default directory structures suggested by Rails we have our locale and then we have either views or models for every view and model we created the translations and it works perfectly. for instance, in a HomeController#show we use: t('.title') and it looks in the views/home/{locale}.yml for the {locale}: show: title: It also works well with partials. Same example as above, but in a 'latest' partial would be {locale}: latest: title: Not sure if this is exactly what you were looking for, but hope it helps
