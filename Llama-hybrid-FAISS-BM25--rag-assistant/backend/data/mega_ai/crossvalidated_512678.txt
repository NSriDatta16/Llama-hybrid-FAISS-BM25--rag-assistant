Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence: What does Bayesian probability have to say about it?

A famous aphorism by cosmologist Martin Rees(*) goes "absence of evidence is not evidence of absence" . On the other hand, quoting Wikipedia: In carefully designed scientific experiments, even null results can be evidence of absence. For instance, a hypothesis may be falsified if a vital predicted observation is not found empirically. (At this point, the underlying hypothesis may be rejected or revised and sometimes, additional ad hoc explanations may even be warranted.) Whether the scientific community will accept a null result as evidence of absence depends on many factors, including the detection power of the applied methods, the confidence of the inference, as well as confirmation bias within the community. Therefore, for the sake of scientific progress, we end up accepting the absence of evidence as evidence of absence. This is also at the heart of two very famous analogies, namely Russell's teapot and Carl Sagan's Dragon in the garage . My question is: how can we formally justify, based on Bayesian probability theory, that absence of evidence can legitimately be used as evidence of absence? Under which conditions is that true? (the answer is expected to depend on the specific details of the problem such as the model we assume, the information gain provided by our observations given the model, or the prior probabilities of the competing hypotheses involved). (*) the origin of the aphorism seems to be much older, see e.g. this .
