KMeans never compares neighboring values. So two time series that are zero and peak at 15:00 respectively 14:59 are maximally different. That is why you want time warping to add some tolerance in time. Furthermore, kmeans cannot use time series of different duration or resolution. If your data is 24 dimensions for exactly 24 hours you don't notice. But many time series aren't aggregated this way. KMeans also can't handle missing data.
