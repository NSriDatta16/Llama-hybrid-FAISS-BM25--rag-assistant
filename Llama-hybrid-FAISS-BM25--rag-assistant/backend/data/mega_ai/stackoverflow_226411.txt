Selecting a non-standard image area in a web application

This question is for a web application. And maybe it's a stupid question but I was wondering if there is a way to generate a polygon with 4 points, so that the user can himself drag each point to create it's own (As an example, let's say that we want to remove a window from an image that it is not at a normal angle) .Is it possible?. I can't seem to find anything after a few hours of search.
