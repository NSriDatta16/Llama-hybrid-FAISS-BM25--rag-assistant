trackPageView on Google Analytics for iPhone Not Working

I'm trying to get Google Analytics working on an iPhone application without much luck. I've followed all the instructions on their website (google/apis/analytics/docs/tracking/mobileAppsTracking.html) and studied their sample application (google/gaformobileapps/GoogleAnalyticsIphone_0.7.tar.gz). When I run my application and go to Google Analytics' website ( https://www.google.com/analytics/reporting/ ), the only page that is recording is /app_entry_point. I'm seeing one count in my Google Analytics detailed report once every time my app fires up. However, I have added other pages to be tracked but it's not working. Here is a sample of two pages I've added to be tracked: trackPageview:@"/calculator"; trackPageview:@"/tellafriend"; I call them from various ViewControllers in the app. In each of those view controllers I import the the GANTracker header: #import "GANTracker.h" I'll admit it: I'm an objective-c newbie. Any help you can offer is greatly appreciated! Do I need to physically dispatch them to get the trackPageview working? If so, why is the /app_entry_point page the only page that is recorded by Google Analytics?
