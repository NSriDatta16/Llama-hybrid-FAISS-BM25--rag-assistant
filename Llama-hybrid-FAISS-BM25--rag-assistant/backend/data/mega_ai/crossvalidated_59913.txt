need derivation of join-count variance (spatial autocorrelation stat), know where it is?

I am using interlibrary loan to get Cliff and Ord's book Spatial Processes, but the semester just ended and it is slow now. On page 18ish of this book, Cliff and Ord show how the variance for the join-count statistic is calculated and also how this variance was derived. I have the variance equation, but need to see the derivation because I need to calculate variance of join-counts WHILE taking edge effects into account. So, I must modify the variance but can only do this if I understand the steps in its derivation very well (which is hard to do when looking at a reduced form equation). Time is of the essence, has anyone seen an online reference that shows this derivation and can point me to it? It might take quite a while to have this book in hand, given the situation. Also, buying a book like this for a few pages is a bit extravagant given the cost of books like this. Thanks. I doubt anyone can help, it is too odd a question likely.
