A hidden Markov model is a bivariate stochastic process $\{Y_t, X_t\}_{t=1,2,...}$ where $\{X_t\}$ is an unobserved Markov chain and, conditional on $\{X_t\}$ , $\{Y_t\}$ is an observed sequence of independent random variables such that the conditional distribution of $Y_t$ only depends on $X_t$ . When $Y_t$ depends both on $X_t$ and the lagged observations $Y_{tâˆ’1}$ , it is called Markov Switching Model. An, Y., Hu, Y., Hopkins, J., & Shum, M. (2013).
