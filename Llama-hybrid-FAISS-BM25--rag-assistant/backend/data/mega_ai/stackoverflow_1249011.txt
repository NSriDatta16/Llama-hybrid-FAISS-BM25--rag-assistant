Authentication information is stored in a configuration file local to the user running the program. Or at least, it can be configured to do that. I bet TeamCity's Agent program runs under a different user than the one you log into the machine with. If it does, you should try just logging into the machine with the same user, then do a svn checkout to a temporary directory and fill in the username and password. This will be cached, and thus when TeamCity runs SVN under the same user, it should reuse that information.
