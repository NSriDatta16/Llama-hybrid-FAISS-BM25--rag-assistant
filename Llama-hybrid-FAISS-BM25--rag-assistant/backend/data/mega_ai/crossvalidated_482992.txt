Transforming data on a per-instance basis

I am currently facing the following situation (in my feature engineering process): I am inspecting a step function for a set of instances (step function per instance), i.e., in each iteration "i" there is a functional value correspondingly. I am deriving several features from this trajectory, e.g. slope in a certain part or volumes spanned by any lower bound and the respective trajectory line. Now, comes the problem: each instance is generated based on a certain class which leads to certain "niveaus" of functional values, e.g. some might start in i = 0 at y = 100000000, some start at y = 100 my features now seem to adequately seperate those instances -- but this comes from these high discrepency in y-value niveaus. These niveaus, however, can change so the 100000000 might 100 when generated that way (nevertheless the instances/data is given I do not have to generate instances by myself) What am I looking for?: I want to gain generalizability in my model idea so far: transform the y-values in the the trajectories so my feature values will become independent of whatever "niveau" is there. But how do I achieve that based on an instance-base only (so NOT taking all instances and normalize on [0,1] scale or whatever). Glad you guys may have some ideas.
