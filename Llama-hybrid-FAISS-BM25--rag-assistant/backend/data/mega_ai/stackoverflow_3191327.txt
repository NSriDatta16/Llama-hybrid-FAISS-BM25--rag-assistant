Nest lists in paragraphs in html

It seems that (strict) html doesn't allow nesting any non-inline elements inside a , but then how am I supposed to render a paragraph that contains a list (something that occurs often in natural texts). I've seen three answers that all seem unsatisfying: Lists should not happen inside paragraphs. (I'm not going to go into a cultural debate, but I certainly hope that html is not going to become the place to dictate writing style.) Separate the text into a paragraph, then a list, and then a second paragraph with the post-text. This looks bad because now I have chunks that are parts of paragraphs, and that seems bad for a markup that is trying to to move in a more semantic direction. Fake paragraphs using some â€” which looks like a bad way to bypass the whole thing and give up on using the markup with the proper semantics for text. Is there some other way to do this that is semantically correct and valid?
