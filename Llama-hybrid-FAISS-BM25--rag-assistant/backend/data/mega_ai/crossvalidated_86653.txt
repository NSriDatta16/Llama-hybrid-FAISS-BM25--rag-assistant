Regression is equivalent to ANCOVA, you are right about that. So, if there is a point to using one there is a point to using the other. The typical format of the output varies, that's all. For a dependent variable that is ordered, a good starting place is ordinal logistic regression. Whether to use regression with the initial time point as a covariate or to use something like a multilevel model is another question; it has been discussed here in the past.
