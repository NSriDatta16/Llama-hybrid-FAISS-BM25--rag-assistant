The operation replaces each pixel with the weighted average of the pixels around it, where the weights are given by the matrix. Here's an example convolution matrix: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 What this does is replace each pixel with the average value of the 3x3 block centered on that pixel. Here's another: 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 This matrix doesn't do anything, it gives you the original back. The weights can be negative, too. This matrix subtracts the average value of the pixels next to a pixel: 0 -1 0 -1 4 -1 0 -1 0 Convolution matrices allow you to do fine-tuned blurring and sharpening effects. You can tune the directionality and the frequency response of filters using a convolution matrix, if it's large enough. However, it's usually used for quick-n-dirty blurring and sharpening.
