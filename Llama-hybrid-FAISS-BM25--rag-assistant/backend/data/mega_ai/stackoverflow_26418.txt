A selector engine is a JavaScript library that lets you select elements in the DOM tree using some kind of string for identifying them (think regular expressions for DOM elements). Most selector engines use some variation of the CSS3 selectors syntax so, for example, you can write something like: var paragraphs = selectorengine.select('p.firstParagraph') to select all P elements in the document with class firstParagraph. Some selector engines also support a partial implementation of XPath, and even some custom syntaxes. For example, jQuery lets you write: var checkedBoxes = jQuery('form#login input:checked') To select all checked check boxes in the login form in the document.
