Seasonal adjustment question, why do days matter?

I have a simple ols equation where the independent variable is total production in a month. I seasonally adjust the data with an x12 and run the ols and get my estimates. The strange thing is, if I change the independent variable to average production per day by dividing by the number of days in the month, and then seasonally adjusting the series my R-squared goes up by almost 0.1. Does anyone have any idea why that might be?
