Build one ARIMA model for multiple time series

I have 1000+ different timeseries. I want to build one ARIMA model which gives better forecast for most of the timeseries. I went through the answer of this question Estimating same model over multiple time series The answer given my rob hyndman caught my eye. Can someone explain that answer? what padding is he talking about? how to do padding for weekly data and how to do it in python? Thank you
