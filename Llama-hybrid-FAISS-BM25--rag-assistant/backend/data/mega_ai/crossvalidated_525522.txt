Error "Feature names stored in `object` and `newdata` are different!" using xgboost in mlr package

I am trying to make a multilabel classification model for XGBoost. I have one that works for RF, but when I try this code below for XGBoost I get the error: "Error in predict.xgb.Booster(m, newdata = data.matrix(.newdata), ...) : Feature names stored in 'object' and 'newdata' are different! And as I did not assign it train data and test data or 'newdata' (this is done by the makeResampleDesc() ) I don't know how to fix this error. Anyone has any ideas? example data label_bact create learner learner create grid ps set up resampling method and tuning ctrl initiate evaluation vector v_f1 actual grid search with different train_lines for each outer fold task $y[1])) v_max_depth x[1])) v_eta
