E[x|y] where y=cdf(x) and y is random

I have a grid approximation of a cdf, $F_x$. The cdf has support for $x>=0$ From there, calculating the $E[x]$ is straight forward with some std numerical integration techniques. In my case, however, I have a variable $y$, which is randomly distributed according to a pdf $f_y$. $y$ defines the percentile in which $x$ is likely to be. The relationship is $y = F_x(x)$ My goal is to calculate the $E[x]$ by knowing that $y$ is distributed as $f_y$. Can I just simply calculate the $E[x]$ integrating with $f_y(x)$ mapping $y$ to $x$ using $x = F_x(y)^{-1}$ (the quantile function). Or is there something that gets lost there (which is my concern)? EDIT I have been reflecting on the problem formulation. In a Bayesian framework where $c$ represents client data and $s$ represents sales we have: $$p(s|c) = \frac{p(c|s) * p(s)}{p(c)}$$ In the current set up: $p(s)$ is an empirical $cdf$ - which looks very weird and I would not try to fit - while $c$ is a ranking on clients. I was wondering if in this scenario we get to a numerical estimate of $E[s|c]$ and what is the role played by the probability integral transform ?
