Select adjacent records in Mysql

Assuming this table is ordered by date id | date | customer 3 | 2009-10-01| Frank 1 | 2010-10-11| Bob 4 | 2010-11-01| Mitchel 2 | 2010-11-02| Jim I would like to make a query so that knowing ID = 4 the resulting rows are $row[0]['id'] == 1 //previous $row[1]['id'] == 4 //most recent/current $row[2]['id'] == 2 //next A mysql only solution would be best, but if there is an elegant php solution that would be cool as well.
