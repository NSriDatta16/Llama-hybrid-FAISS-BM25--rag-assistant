Why do we use standard deviation in machine learning context? What is it used for?

I have a small question. What sense does it have if we calcualte the standard deviation in a machine learning context? I mean i know what it is. A low standard deviation means that most of the numbers are close to the mean (average) value. A high standard deviation means that the values are spread out over a wider range. But what does it mean to have a high standard deviation? or a low? What importance does it have to a machine learning model?
