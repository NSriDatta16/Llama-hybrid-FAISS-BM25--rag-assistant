You can measure similarity using one of the edit distance functions, there are implementations available for populate languages if you do a search, such as C# Leventshtein distance. . Similarity between documents can also be a problem of Information Retrieval , a popular library for which is Lucene . Lucene uses the vector space model to determine similarity between a document and a query and can also be used to measure similarity between two documents. There are implementations in Java and C# and ports to other languages as well. The problem can also be that of natural language processing and among the libraries I have used are NLTK and LingPipe . These libraries are targeted at much more than similarity, they have a steep learning curve and may be overkill. However, these could be helpful in extracting a the short title for a document.
