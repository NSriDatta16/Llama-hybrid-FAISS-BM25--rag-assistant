Iterated expectation over different sets of variables

For some random variables $Y, X, Z,$ and $Q$ , can we simplify $E[E[Y|X,Z]|Z,Q]$ ? Is it correct that $E[E[Y|X,Z]|Z,Q] = E[Y|X,Q]$ (idea being that $Z$ is averaged out)? In general, for some sets of variables $A$ and $B$ , such that $A \cap B \neq \emptyset$ and $A \not \subseteq B$ and $B \not \subseteq A$ , what is $E[E[Y|A]|B]$ equal to?
