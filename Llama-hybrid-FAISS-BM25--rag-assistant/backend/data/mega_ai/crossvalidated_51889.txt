The short answer is the "usual" way in the social sciences is to have pre-defined discrete areas and provide summary statistics for samples within those areas aggregated up. Examples of pre-defined areas may be census geographies, zip-codes, or any other neighborhood unit you can dream up. This is the usual because it is fairly rare to have surveys geocoded to the exact location or be able to utilize that information due to privacy reasons, so typically surveys can't be geolocated besides within a general area anyway. Even if you don't have pre-defined areas you could always create a uniform grid (i.e. quadrats) and provide summary statistics. If your sampling over the city diverges from uniform though this approach will not work as well, as you could have some quadrats with few (or zero) samples and some with many samples (in fact some people justify aggregation to larger units because of such concerns). More novel is to utilize what van Ham & Manley (2012) refer to as bespoke neighborhoods. One essentially picks a point, and then some arbitrary buffer around that point, and then estimates whatever summary statistic one is interested in based on samples around that point. Related examples can be found in Lee et al. (2008), Li & Radke (2012) and Ratcliffe & Taniguchi (2008). If you want more continuous measurements over the entire study space, you can utilize geo-statistical kriging to estimate a continuous surface (although this is also pretty novel for social science). Similar examples can be found in the social science literature under area-to-point kriging (which is a slightly different context). See this other answer of mine for a list of scholarly examples.
