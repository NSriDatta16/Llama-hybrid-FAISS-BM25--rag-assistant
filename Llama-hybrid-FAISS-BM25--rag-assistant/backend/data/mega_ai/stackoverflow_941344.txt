One example (that I'm not an expert on) is that simplex algorithms for linear programming have exponential worst-case complexity on arbitrary inputs, even though they perform well in practice. An interesting solution to this is considering "smoothed complexity", which blends worst-case and average-case performance by looking at small random perturbations of arbitrary inputs. Spielman and Teng (2004) were able to show that the shadow-vertex simplex algorithm has polynomial smoothed complexity.
