At the moment this is not really a solution at all, since there is no specification of how you get $c$ and $d$ from the observed data. At the moment the "solution" is merely saying that the interval estimator will a lower bound that is above $y$ . You have already noted in your question that $\theta$ is always larger than $y$ , so obviously it makes sense to use an interval of this form. The next step in solving the problem would be to specify $c$ and $d$ as functions of the data so that you get a specific interval estimate for a given set of data. The standard way to do this would be to use the sufficient statistic $Y$ to form a "pivotal quantity" that can be used to form an appropriate confidence interval . In any case, however you form the interval estimator, you will want to check that it has good statistical properties (e.g., correct coverage probability, consistency, etc.).
