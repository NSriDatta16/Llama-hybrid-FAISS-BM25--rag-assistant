How to organize Rails models that are too fat?

It is good practice to shift logic from the controller into the model. But in any complex system, this invariably leads to a very large file even if a majority of the methods are one liners as per the Rails Way. I've resorted to splitting up models into other modules and including them in the original model, for example, model_flags , model_validation , etc. Anyone has a better way?
