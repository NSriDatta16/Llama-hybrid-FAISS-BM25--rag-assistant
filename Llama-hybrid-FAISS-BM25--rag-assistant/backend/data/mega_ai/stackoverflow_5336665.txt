A Service should never start an Activity directly. This is clearly stated in the documentation on Notifications. You can view it at this link (please refer to the second paragraph). The scenario that you described can be handled in an alternate way: Add a method to the service isValidated() which returns true if the user has already been validated. Activity A, B or C should use isValidated() to first check whether the user is validated or not. If not the Activity should show the from F.
