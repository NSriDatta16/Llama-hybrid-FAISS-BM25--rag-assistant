Keep toolbox selection in Visual Studio 2010

Is there a way in VS2010 to keep a tool selected after adding the control to the design surface (I'm using the WPF designer, but I think it happens with all design surfaces). To be clear, this is an example of what I mean: Select TextBox tool Draw TextBox onto the design surface by dragging out a rectangle Pointer is now selected
