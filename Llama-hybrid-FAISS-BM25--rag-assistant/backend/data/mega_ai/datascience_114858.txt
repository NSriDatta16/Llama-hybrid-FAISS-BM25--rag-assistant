Should I annotate additional information besides the categories I already need in a text?

I have a dataset with bank transfer reasons. They vary a lot because humans wrote them. From the reasons that are linked to invoice payments I need to extract several things: invoice number(s) IBAN counterparty Before I use any NN algorithm I need to annotate the data. So, for example, I have these rows: "Bank transfer for INV. 00234 , 00435 / 2022.01.13 [BIC] [IBAN] Company Ltd " "Payment of invoice 00034 - 1120,34 on 02.17 [BIC] [IBAN] Company 2 inc ." In case 1, I have: invoice numbers: 00234, 00435 IBAN - [IBAN] counterparty - Company Ltd In case 2, I have: invoice number: 00034 IBAN - [IBAN] counterparty - Company 2 inc I have also annotated invoice prefixes such as inv, INV, invoice, etc. My question is, should I add additional annotations such as "date" (2022.01.13, 02.17) or "sum paid" (1120,34)? Could they be helpful for a transformer, for example, to find out what an invoice is?
