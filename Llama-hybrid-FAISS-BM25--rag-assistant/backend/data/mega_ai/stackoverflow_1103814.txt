When you are sending any information via email, it won't be secure. There are too many ways someone can get it. It would be child's play for a skilled hacker looking to steal your information. Refrain from sending any personal information like passwords and income information via email as it can become VERY EMBARRASSING for you and your organization if such information was leaked or stolen. Think about security seriously. It just takes that one incident for all the bricks to fall. As for password retrieval, thoroughly read Forgot Password Best Practices . The bottom line is that an application following best practices should allow a user to reset his own password. Personal security questions should be used. The application should not send email, display passwords, nor set any temporary passwords. EDIT: Updated link
