Beware what you build, as it will last a lot longer than you think. If the effort to code it either way is roughly equal, then code it in the language which is most widely used by your organization. One thing I see over and over at companines is the "wow, I can code this using shiny new (or shiny old) technology BZUP12G with Frammoplatzes". This does a disservice to the rest of the development team, who now have to learn BZUP12G with Frammoplatzes in order to modify what got built. Working to keep the basic set of technologies on which your application is constructed to a reasonably small set is a really good idea.
