However, I am not sure how I can achieve this if the response variable is categorical. b has a cardinality of 3: [low, medium, high]. Try multinomial logistic regression. Here is an example from the experts. PS1: Note that you can actually do this with any classification algorithm, and do not need to limit yourself to multinomial logistic regression. PS2: On the other hand, if you want to use a more "formal" solution for imputing missing data, you can use the MICE package by R. PS3: Another methodology for imputing missing data is expectation maximization (EM), although I do not know of any R packages for this. I would suggest googling.
