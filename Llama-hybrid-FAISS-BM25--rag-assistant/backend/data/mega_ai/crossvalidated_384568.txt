Can I use Lasso directly in classification for feature selectionï¼Ÿ

In the scikit-learn package, Lasso is a linear regression model while it can be used for feature selection. However, is it reasonable if I use it directly in classification tasks for feature selection, or should I use Logistic Regression based on L1 penalty or other algorithms based on L1 penalty?
