Why are you trying to escape it? That code should run inside ASP.NET using declarative syntax, you shouldn't need to escape anything, or perhaps I'm missing something? Try this: ' border="0"> EDIT: that was the original question. Here's for the new challenge (question was completely changed). It did not contain any errors, but it was hard to read with all the "" so I replaced it. Not sure what you're after, seems to me that you are trying to use interpreted declarative syntax inside your code behind, which is not possible, sorry: // slightly more readable: const string postdescWithComments = @" posted on {1} Comments({3}) More "; // somewhere else, this is where your GetRoot() goes: string parsedString = String.Format( postdescWithComments, href, hrefText, hrefFeedback, feedbackText, WebUtilityMethods.GetRoot()); EDIT: as you've found out, it is very hard to check code like that (esp. when it is on one string as in your original post) for errors. If possible, move the code to the declarative section (the part where the HTML of your page is) Then you can use the syntax and as a bonus you get an automatic syntax-check on the HTML. If that's not possible, you should replace the part with a {4} and use String.Format to fill in the blanks, the same way you did with the other parts. EDIT: this last remark, and the well-spotted (!) closing quote from Agent_9191 have been reflected in the code block for clarity.
