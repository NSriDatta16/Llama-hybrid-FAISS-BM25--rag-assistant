Managed to find this: http://vitrage.sibweb.ru/english/ Looks like it could be an Apache Module called VITRAGE. Not much available in English however so am really unsure if it's a match. On reading the code sample you posted, it looks like a XML styled procedural language. Are you sure it's available elsewhere or perhaps something that was developed internally?
