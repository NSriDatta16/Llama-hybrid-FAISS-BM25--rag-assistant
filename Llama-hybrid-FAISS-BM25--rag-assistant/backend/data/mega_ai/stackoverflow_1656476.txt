New to Core Data for iphone

I am new to the iphone platform and am creating an app that retrievals a rss feed and displays it in a UITableView. I have gotten this working perfectly (or rather, the way I wanted). What I was thinking was I would store the current feed items on the phone so that it would initally load the old items it has stored while it got the new feed, then parse the new feed and add the new items and refresh the TableView. I was going to use Core Data to store it the old feed items because it would be a good way of learning Core Data and it would be an appropriate use of Core Data. However, I am having a difficult time learning how to use Core Data and connecting it with the Table/Array. I have already googled and looked on stackoverflow for tutorials but have yet to find anything that explains it in a way I really understand. Any explanation of the overall steps that it takes to add Core Data to an existing app would be greatly appreciated. Full-blown detail are not necessary (but would also be useful). I'm just not very experienced with SQL or storing of data in such a manner and am having trouble wrapping my head around how the whole concept of Core Data works and how it connects to everything. Also, any better method of doing what I'm trying to accomplish would also be appreciated.
