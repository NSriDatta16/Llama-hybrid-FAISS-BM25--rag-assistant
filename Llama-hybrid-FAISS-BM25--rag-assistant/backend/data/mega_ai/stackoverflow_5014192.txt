Form1.resx is good for embedding graphic objects directly in your Form1 code files. That way it's easy to cut and paste your that form into your other projects. Also, if you create another copy of Form1 called Form2, you can make changes to either one without worrying about those changes affecting the other form. Resources.resx works in just the opposite manner. If you make changes to a resouce in Resources.resx, all classes that use that resource will be updated. For example, if you have a filepath resource and you change the path, all classes that reference that resource will get the updated path.
