Equivalent of AUC (area under the ROC curve) for two variables

I was wondering if there is a way to compute AUC using two variables instead of one as predictors. I got two populations after a follow-up, divided in Cases and Controls according to whether they had developed or not a pathology during the follow-up. There are also two independent variables in the data and now I would like to find a way to combine these two to see if any combination of them could enhance predictability. I've already tried combining many variables (a total of 39, including the two I am asking this question about) with principle component analysis (PCA), but it did not improve the predictability, so I want to try something else. I know that some use C-index, but I know nothing about it. Clarification. Suppose that the two variables I have are: a measure of the length of an heartbeat, also called RR, and a measure of the quantity of the blood ejected at every heartbeat, also called LVEF. I know that these two variables yield AUCs of 0.61 and 0.65, respectively, when used separately. Is there a way I could combine these two AUCs for RR and LVEF?
