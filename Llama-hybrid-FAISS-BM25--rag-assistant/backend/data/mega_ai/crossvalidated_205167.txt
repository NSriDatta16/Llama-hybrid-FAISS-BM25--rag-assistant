Forecasting Time Series: Stationary vs Non-Stationary

Let's say that I have a non-stationary time series and that the series can be transformed to a stationary series using a first difference. If I want to forecast this series using ARIMA then what is the difference between forecasting using the original non-stationary series and the forecasting using the now stationary differenced series? That is, can I expect the forecast for the stationary series to be more accurate than the forecast for non-stationary series? I am aware that one advantage of forecasting with the stationary series will have the advantage of also producing forecast intervals (which are dependent upon the assumption of a stationary series).
