I don't spend a lot of time at all; I use jQuery to do almost all the work, and then I keep things simple such that I avoid do much work elsewhere. So I'll return the entire HTML I wish to render, for ajax calls, instead of building it up client side, and other such things. I also do a bunch of 'rich' things, but keep it 'workable'. My 'util.js' is at about 800 lines. Possibly extravagent, but it does a bunch of things. I don't spend a significant amount of time on it anymore.
