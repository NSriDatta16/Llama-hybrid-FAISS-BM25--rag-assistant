As you want some rotation invariance to your neural network, traditional convolutional layers will not be enough. Of course, you can try to see how much data you would need to use only traditional CNN layers. I would advise to look at RIFD-CNN as a starting point (cited lots of times despite being "quite" recent). To get the position, you can backtrace in your NN up to the pool layers to see which part where activated. Once you have the part that are activated, you can know the position of your object.
