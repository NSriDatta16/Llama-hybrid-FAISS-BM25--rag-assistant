Eclipse has no visual designer for Swing components. Compare that to Visual Studio, where: click 'new form' drag buttons and text boxes onto the form, move them around, add some labels double click on a button, add some code done, one quick application, show it to the boss, get paid/promotion/coffee break In Eclipse you either have to use Netbeans instead (ie not Eclipse...), or use IBM's SWT, or code the Swing forms by hand. I feel it would be very nice to have a great wysiwyg forms designer in Eclipse for Swing forms.
