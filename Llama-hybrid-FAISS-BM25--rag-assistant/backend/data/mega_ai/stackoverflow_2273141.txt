How can I pass a Delphi string to a Prism DLL?

We try to pass a string from a native Delphi program to a Delphi Prism DLL. We have no problem passing integers, but strings are mismatched in the DLL. We saw Robert Love's code snippet in response to another question, but there is no code for the native Delphi program. How can we pass strings from Delphi to a Delphi Prism DLL?
