Is there a reasonable way to do a regression analysis without knowing the correlations between correlated regressors?

I have several datasets, each with the same response variable but with different regressors. Unfortunately, I do not know the correlation between the regressors from the different datasets, but have reason to believe that there is a correlation. Is there a reasonable way to combine the response variable and all the regressors into a single regression or other coherent analysis without knowing the correlation between the regressors? To specify my question a bit more, I can give the following simplified example: One of the datasets shows the effect of household income on the probability of owning a coffee machine. Another dataset shows the effect of household size on the probability of owning a coffee machine. If I want to know how likely it is to find a coffee machine in a household with a given income level and a given size, I cannot simply multiply the probabilities, since the independence assumption is unrealistic. Bigger households probably have higher income on average. How can I merge the data sets without knowing the correlation between household income and household size? Any idea is appreciated.
