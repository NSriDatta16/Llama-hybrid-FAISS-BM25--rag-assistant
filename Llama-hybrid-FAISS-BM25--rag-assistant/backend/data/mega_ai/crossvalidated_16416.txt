Using the sde package in R to simulate a SV model with leverage

Using the sde package in R, I would like to simulate the following model for stock prices $p_t$: $\mathrm{d}\sigma^2_t = (\theta_1 - \theta_2\sigma^2_t)\mathrm{d}t + \theta_3\sigma_t\mathrm{d}W_{\sigma,t}$ (CIR model used for stochastic volatility) $\mathrm{d}\log{p_t} = \sigma_t\mathrm{d}W_{p,t}$ where correlation between $W_{p,t}$ and $W_{\sigma,t}$ is possibly non-zero. Q: Is that possible? Is it even possible to simulate multivariate SDEs in the "sde" package the way one can in S+FinMetrics using the gensim functions? Is there another package in R that might do this? I'm able to simulate the variance process simply enough with the following code: library(sde) sig2 I can then simulate the price series (starting with initial price = 100) using: logr But this approach seems unnecessarily clunky and can't capture non-zero correlation between the Brownian Motions.
