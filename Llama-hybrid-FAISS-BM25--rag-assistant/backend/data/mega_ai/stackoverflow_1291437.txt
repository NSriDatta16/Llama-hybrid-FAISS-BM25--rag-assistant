Negative Testing passing invalid data to a test see http://www.pragmaticsw.com/Newsletters/newsletter_2007_09_SP.htm for one example of a top-ten list while testing boundaries et al is good, in TDD it would be better to explicitly test for expected exception conditions rather than randomly testing negatives that may or may not be relevant so a top-ten list would either be very generic, make a bunch of assumptions, or be too specific to be generally useful ;-)
