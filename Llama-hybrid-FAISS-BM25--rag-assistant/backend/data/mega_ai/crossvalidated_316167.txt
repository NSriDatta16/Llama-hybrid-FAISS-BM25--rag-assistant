To get the expected value of $y_{t+2}$, you will need to plug in the expected value of $\epsilon_{t+1}$. Which is zero, since ARIMA assumes normally distributed innovations with mean zero. You could say that the MA part is "completely useless", yes. Then again, there don't seem to be many other real-life examples of moving average processes , either. Plus, your third paragraph already hints at an extension: if you are not only interested in point forecasts (where your criticism applies), but also in predictive densities or prediction intervals, then the full density of $\epsilon_{t+1}$ does indeed come in, and depending on your MA parameter estimates may have quite some effect, indeed.
