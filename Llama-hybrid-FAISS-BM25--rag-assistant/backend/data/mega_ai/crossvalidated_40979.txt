It appears that "equitable" means that the expected values of the team points, conditional on $n$, need to be equal regardless of team size. This answer explores some consequences of this interpretation. For a team of size $n$ that is awarded $x(n)$ points if it "wins" and zero points otherwise, the expectation reduces simply to the probability of winning multiplied by $x(n)$. With the independent "fair coin" model of choosing colors, wherein the coin has chance $p$ of being black and (therefore) $n$ black values are found with probability $p\times p \times \cdots \times p = p^n$, this expectation equals $x(n)p^n$. The condition $x(2)=10$ determines the unique solution $$x(n) = 10 / p^n.$$ Notice that this solution has nothing to do with $n$ being random or not. However, the distribution of team points at the end of the "competition" will be strongly determined by the distribution of $n$. To explore this, we can simulate a competition. (The code uses R .) First, we specify the number of teams n.teams , the number of trials during a competition n.trials (which is fixed and equal for all teams in this simulation), the parameters for a random distribution of team sizes, and the chance of black. In this example, the distribution is Poisson (offset by $1$ to assure positive team sizes) with parameter lambda . We also start the random number generator at a reproducible point. lambda Create the teams, assign hat colors to their members for each trial, count up the total number of wins, and award the points accordingly (using the solution $x(n)$): n Here is a plot of points versus team size in this simulation involving 100 trials for each of 10,000 independent teams (averaging lambda+1 = $4$ people per team) when p.black is $1/2$. To make all the data visible, dots on the plot are randomly offset by up to 2.5% of the width and height of the plot. jitter The blue line is the least squares fit to the data. Its horizontal trend attests to the "egalitarian" nature of the solution $x(n)$: the expected number of points is the same regardless of team size. (In fact, inspecting the least squares fit with summary(lm(points ~ n)) reveals it has an insignificant--and relatively small--slope.) Please notice (a) the extremely skewed distribution of points and (b) the strong tendency for larger teams either to get no points at all or so many points that a single win assures a high standing at the end of the competition. The uniqueness of $x(n)$ shows that this behavior is forced on us by the requirements of the problem . It nicely illustrates the tradeoff between risk (exhibited as the large ranges of results for larger teams) and reward (apparent as the numbers of points). It is instructive to re-run the simulation with different values of the input. When lambda grows, for instance, most teams are relatively large, so only a few--and not necessarily the largest--account for almost all the points. When p.black grows, the skewness of the results decreases. For instance, here are results of the same simulation with p.black changed from $1/2$ to $2/3$:
