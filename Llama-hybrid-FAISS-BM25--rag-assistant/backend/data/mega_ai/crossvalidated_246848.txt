Why not build a matrix representative of the correlation structure of your pixels for each year. To do so, let us start with something like, $\boldsymbol{v} = (v_1,...,v_n)^{'}$ where $\boldsymbol{v}$ is a $n \times 1$ vector of $0$ or $1$ values, with $1$ standing for a position exhibiting a forest loss. $\boldsymbol{W} = [w_{ij} (d_{ij})] \equiv [e^{-\gamma d_{ij}}]$ or $\equiv [d_{ij}^{-\gamma}]$ or something else which is distance-based. Note that distances can be geographic, economic, road-based, etc... where $\boldsymbol{W}$ is a spatial weight matrix, entrywise specified to relate the distance-based strength of interaction between any position $i$ and $j$ of your space. And then you could compute the correlation between $\boldsymbol{v}$ and itself spatially lagged. I mean, computing $\rho(\boldsymbol{v},\boldsymbol{W}\boldsymbol{v}) = \frac{E(\boldsymbol{v},\boldsymbol{W}\boldsymbol{v}) - E(\boldsymbol{v})E(\boldsymbol{W}\boldsymbol{v})}{\sigma_{\boldsymbol{v}}\sigma_{\boldsymbol{W}\boldsymbol{v}}}$ with $E(\boldsymbol{v},\boldsymbol{W}\boldsymbol{v})$ simply standing for the average of $((\boldsymbol{W}\boldsymbol{v})_{1} \times \boldsymbol{v}_1,...,((\boldsymbol{W}\boldsymbol{v})_{n} \times \boldsymbol{v}_n)^{'}$, $E(\boldsymbol{v})E(\boldsymbol{W}\boldsymbol{v})$ trivially is the product of each vector average and $\sigma$ their respective standard deviation. If $\rho(\boldsymbol{v},\boldsymbol{W}\boldsymbol{v})$ is positive, it would mean that all forest loss pixels tend to be close one to another. If $\rho(\boldsymbol{v},\boldsymbol{W}\boldsymbol{v})$ is negative, it would mean that all forest loss pixels tend to be close to non-loss pixels. If it is null, the space of correlation is not the one you chose (geographic, economic, etc...). Note that the result you'll get will highly depend on the correlation structure you involve (your choice of $\boldsymbol{W})$. Also note that I use binary values, but it would be exactly the same with continuous ones, i.e. between $0$ and $1$. Since you have done this for each year, you can see the evolution of $\rho$ over time. So i should have written all preceding variables with a $t$ index, e.g. $\boldsymbol{v}_{t}$, excepted for $\boldsymbol{W}$ that we can suppose constant for all years, i.e. $\boldsymbol{W}_{t} = \boldsymbol{W} \ \forall \ t$. Now if you need to have a full statistical consideration, you also need to compute the p-values related to each $\rho_t$. Furthermore, note that I do not involve time in the correlation structure since you only ask for "spatial relationship".
