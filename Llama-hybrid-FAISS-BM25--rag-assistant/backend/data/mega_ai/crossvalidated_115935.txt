Do you have a specific reason that you want to use correlation? If you're just interested in determining whether the two groups differ, you could simply use a chi square test or t-test, depending on how your variables and data look. This approach would be useful if you wanted to show that men and women differed in their average opinion ratings. If you are specifically interested in using a correlation and your outcome variable is continuous, then a point biserial correlation would be appropriate. You would calculate this in the same way as a standard Pearson correlation, and your interpretation would be based on how you coded your sex variable. If, for instance, you coded your sex variable as male=0 and female=1 and found a positive correlation between sex and opinion, then you would interpret this as meaning that females tended to have higher opinion scores (e.g., as sex "increased" from 0/male to 1/female, so did opinion scores).
