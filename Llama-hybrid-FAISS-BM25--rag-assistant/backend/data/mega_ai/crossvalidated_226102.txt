You can simply calculate proportion of ' in ', $$ P = {n_{in} \over n}, $$ but - as per your question - it's better to add a correction for total number of 'votes'. One way to correct is to add some dummy ' outs ' (e.g. $10$), so $$ P' = {n_{in} \over n + 10 }. $$ items with a large number of votes see their modified percentage alters very little from their real percentage, but items with relatively few answers will see their modified percentage move considerably toward low values . This is known as " Bayesian averaging ". In effect, the items with many votes will rank higher than items with the same percentage but fewer votes. In your example $P'_A=0.9$ and $P'_B=0.93$.
