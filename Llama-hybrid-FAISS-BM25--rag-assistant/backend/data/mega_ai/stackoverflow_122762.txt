Thank you very much for your insights. I've used Krypton myself but only the part that is free. I think it's more of a "We want it to look slick". I share my boss's concern with using 3rd party controls, but I also agree with you guys in that it's far better to concentrate on the task than on providing controls that look good. The question the manager faced my boss with when he said that it's a bad idea to use Infragistics was "But can you do something similar in a reasonable amount of time ?". The answer was obviously "No". I'll try suggesting Krypton Toolkit, I've used it a bit in the past as I've said before, I did have some trouble with it. I think the datagrid is the main focus of the problem, since most of the toolkits have options for customizing the appearence. Again, thanks so much for your answers.
