Delphi - How to monitor the network

Can someone give me some indications about how to log the web pages accessed(using any web browser)? Should I make a global proxy.... hook the network....? All that I need to log is the page address, not the info contained in it. I am using Delphi. Thank you I am looking, if is possible, for a solution without using Winpcap Edit: I just found Internet Packet Monitoring Components by Magenta Systems.
