Your null hypothesis is probability ( $\pi$ ) of correct = 0.25 and alternative hypothesis is $\pi > 0.25$ . The logistic regression was used. $\pi = 0.25$ is equivalent to log odds = log(0.25/0.75) = -log(3) = -1.0986 So the original $H_o: \pi = 0.25$ can be converted as $H_o:$ log odds = -1.0986, and $H_A:$ is log odds > -1.0986. So for each treatment, you can get $X\hat\beta$ , which is log odds, and test if $X\beta = -1.0986$ as one-sided test.
