Note that there is a large fluctuation in the errors after each run. I have changed class_weight = class_weight.compute_class_weight('balanced', np.unique(y[:,-1]),y[:,-1]) to class_weight = np.array([1000, 1]) which resulted in val_loss around (0.09, 0.15) and to class_weight = np.array([1, 1000]) which resulted in val_loss around (0.06, 0.1) So class weighting is working correctly and has an effect on the final result, but fluctuation is high. It is better to take an average on multiple runs. The negligible difference in test error simply means that weighting is not that important for this particular task.
