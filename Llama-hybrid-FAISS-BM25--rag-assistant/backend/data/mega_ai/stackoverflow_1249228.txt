Transparent swf not receiving mouse events in internet explorer

I'm embedding a flash swf into an html page and setting wmode=transparent. I need this flash movie to still receive mouse over events. In Opera, Safari, Chrome and Firefox this works fine, the html background shows through, and the flash mouse over events are still received. (Sprites react to mouse) In Internet Explorer however, the background shows through, but no mouse interaction is happening with the swf itself. Anyone have any advice to work around this? I'm open to even changing my AS3 code to correct. Thanks - b
