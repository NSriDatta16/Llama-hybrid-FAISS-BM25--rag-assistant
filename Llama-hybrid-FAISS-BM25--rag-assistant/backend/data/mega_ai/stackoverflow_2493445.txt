Choose variable based on users choice from picklist

I have this form. Basically what I want is to send a auto-response with a different URL based on what the user picks in the "attn" picklist. I've been thinking I could have a different variable for each drop down value. It will then pass this variable on to the mail script that will choose which URL to insert inside the auto response that is sent. It gives me a headache thinking about it sometimes. What's the easiest way to accomplish this? Am I making more work for myself? I really don't know because I'm no programmer. Thanks in advance! Here is the form: Send us an Email First Name : Last Name : Email Adress : Phone : Subject : Investment Opportunities Vacation Rentals Real Estate Offerings Gatherings General Message : (max 5000 char) &nbsp; &nbsp; Here is the mail script: ' . "\n" ; $headers = 'Bcc: myemail@domain.com' . "\n"; if (eregi('http:', $notes)) { die ("Do NOT try that! ! "); } if(!$visitormail == "" && (!strstr($visitormail,"@") || !strstr($visitormail,"."))) { echo " Use Back - Enter valid e-mail \n"; $badinput = " Feedback was NOT submitted \n"; echo $badinput; die ("Go back! ! "); } if(empty($visitorf) || empty($visitormail) || empty($notes )) { echo " Use Back - fill in all fields \n"; die ("Use back! ! "); } $todayis = date("l, F j, Y, g:i a") ; $subject = "I want to download the report about $attn"; $notes = stripcslashes($notes); $message = "$todayis [EST] \nAttention: $attn \nMessage: $notes \nFrom: $visitorf $visitorl ($visitormail) \nTelephone Number: $visitorphone \nAdditional Info : IP = $ip \nBrowser Info: $httpagent \nReferral : $httpref\n"; //check if the function even exists if(function_exists("mail")) { //send the email mail($_SESSION['email'], $subject, $message, $headers) or die("could not send email"); } else { die("mail function not enabled"); } header( "Location: http://www.domain.com/thanks.php" ); ?>
