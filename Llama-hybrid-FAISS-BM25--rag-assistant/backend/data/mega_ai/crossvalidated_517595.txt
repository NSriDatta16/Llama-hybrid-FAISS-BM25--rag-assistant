No, that does not hold, because of the bias-variance tradeoff. Yes, adding more predictors that actually do have an effect will reduce the bias of your parameter estimates. But it will also increase the variance of all parameter estimates, and this increase in variance will carry through to increase your prediction error. Whether the variance-induced increase of MSE outweighs the bias-induced reduction depends on the specific situation. My answer to Why strong seasonality in time series of total shipped volumes not observed in customer groups? points to a simple simulation exercise I once did that illustrates this effect. Simpler incorrect models can yield lower MSE predictions than more complex correct ones.
