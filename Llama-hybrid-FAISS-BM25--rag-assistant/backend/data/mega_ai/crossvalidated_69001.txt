Confusion over lmer and p-values: how do p-values from memisc package compare to the MCMC ones?

I was under the impression that the function lmer() in the lme4 package didn't produce p-values (see lmer , p-values and all that ). I've been using MCMC generated p values instead as per this question: Significant effect in lme4 mixed model and this question: Can't find p-values in the output from lmer() in the lm4 package in R . Recently I tried a package called memisc and its getSummary.mer() to get the fixed effects of my model into a csv file. As if by magic, a column called p appears which matches my MCMC p-values extremely closely (and doesn't suffer the processing time that comes with using pvals.fnc() ). I've tentatively had a look at the code in getSummary.mer and have spotted the line that generates the p-value: p Does this mean p values can be generated directly from lmer 's output rather than running pvals.fnc ? I realise this will no doubt start the 'p-value fetishism' debate but I'm interested to know. I've not heard memisc mentioned before when it comes to lmer . To be more succinct: What is the benefit (if any) of using MCMC p-values over those generated by getSummary.mer() ?
