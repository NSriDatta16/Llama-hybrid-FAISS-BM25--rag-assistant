Scenario 1: It seems like you're dealing with columns that may lack data. You have a few options for assigning values to rows that have no information in certain columns, and each have advantages and drawbacks that depend on your dataset. An example is to assign the mean or median of that column for NaN entries, which has the drawback of reducing variance in your data. Here's an article on the topic that should help you. Scenario 2: For part "b", a common approach is to simply find a length that should be "big enough" and adding padding to sequences (or, in your case, strings) which are "too short". For part "a", a very simple approach would be to apply bag of words at a character level. Alternatively, you could experiment with trainin a character embedding model on your password text; such models would create a vectorized representation of your text that you can feed to whatever model you use for password classification!
