Check for internet explorer. PHP vs. ie conditional comments?

So I've decided to break up my CSS into an ie6-and-ie7-only file. I will have CSS rules in this file which target ie6 and ie7 only, such as: div { *color: red; /* target ie7 and below */ _color: green; /* target ie6 and below */ } If possible, I prefer to use PHP with $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] to detect the browser, rather than ie conditional comments. I understand that visitor can "spoof" their user-agent and claim to be whichever browser they want, but what is the general opinion on using PHP instead of ie conditional comments to detect the browser?
