Your approach sounds reasonable. With fewer than 28 historical data points, your options are limited, anyway. Which gives you the answer for your first question: no, 28 monthly data points is not a lot. You have observed less than three years of data. Once you hold out a couple of data points for method selection or similar, you will be left with only two years, which is very little to fit a SARIMA model. (And yes, seasonality may well be relevant. Or not. It depends completely on what kind of consumer products you are forecasting. Toilet paper is non-seasonal. Sunscreen is seasonal.) Then again, many CPG products will not even be available for more than three years until they are superseded (in which case you may be able to stitch time series together). So, you seem to be doing good things for a start. You may be able to do something more fancy by leveraging, e.g., product hierarchies and product similarities. However, that would require some deeper understanding of your data than we can likely provide here. You may profit from the excellent free online book Forecasting: Principles and Practice (2nd ed.) by Athanasopoulos & Hyndman . One simple "sanity check" would be to find series where your forecast is higher than the highest historical observation, or higher than the historical 90% quantile. This often signals trouble, except possibly for very new products that are ramping up. Ultimately, your sanity checks will depend on the kind of data you have. One thing to keep in mind is that the MAPE may lead you towards biased forecasts , especially for slow moving products.
