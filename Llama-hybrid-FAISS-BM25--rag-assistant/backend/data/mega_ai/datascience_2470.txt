Non-linear transformations input dataset for support vector machines

I have two classes (A,B) that I would like to classify using a SVM. Say that I have a class C and a function f. Can I do this: A' = f(A,C) = |A-C| B' = f(B,C) = |B-C| and then perform the classification on A' and B' instead? In the context of my problem A and B are classes where elements are vectors. The f function measures the Mahalanobis distance of each vector with respect to the distribution imposed by C.
