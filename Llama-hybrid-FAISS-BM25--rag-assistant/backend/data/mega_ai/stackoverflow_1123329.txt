Normally the circular array implementation is slightly better at reusing memory, but runs the risk of having to grow if too many items are added to the queue - and possibly holding too much memory if the normal storage and the max storage capacities are too different in practice. The linked list is more flexible, but generally involves more garbage collection. In practice I think I'd be surprised if you found your code bottleneck depended on this choice - use whichever seems most intuitive to you.
