Incorporating Risk Aversion in Bayesian Expected Loss functions

In Berger's Statistical Decision Theory and Bayesian Analysis, he presents the following expected loss function for decision theory: $\rho(\pi^*,a)=\int_\Theta L(\theta,a)d\pi^*(\theta)$ Where $\theta$ is the state of nature from the set of possible states of nature $\Theta$, $a$ is the action chosen from the set of possible actions $\mathscr{A}$, and $\pi^*$ is the posterior distribution. Question: how would I incorporate risk aversion into this function? In the above formulation, the loss function would be identical for a certain loss of 50 or a {0,100} space with 50/50 chance of either.
