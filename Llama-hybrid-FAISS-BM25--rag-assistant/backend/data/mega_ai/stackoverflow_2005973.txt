Javascript Calendar

I am looking for a Javascript calendar with support for drag-and-drop, extensive events model (drag, drop, deletion/adding of items). Also has to be capable of displaying a schedule for multiple persons. That'd be something similar to "Multiple Resources" view of http://dhtmlx.com/docs/products/dhtmlxScheduler/index.shtml Free/paid does not matter. Has to work across major browsers. Thanks!
