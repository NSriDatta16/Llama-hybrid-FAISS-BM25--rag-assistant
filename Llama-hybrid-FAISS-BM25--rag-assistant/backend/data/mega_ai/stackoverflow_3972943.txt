If you did this per pixel you would have to send the coordinates across the bus to the GPU, calculate the new coordinate, then send it back, then call the OpenGL commands to plot the point, etc. With shaders you might be able to do the Sierpinski carpet but that fractal is very sequential (at least the typical way it's computed with averaging points after point). In other words, you would lose the parallel advantage that makes GPUs compelling.
