How to search for Possibilities to parallelize?

I have some serial code that I have started to parallelize using Intel's TBB. My first aim was to parallelize almost all the for loops in the code (I have even parallelized for within for loop)and right now having done that I get some speedup.I am looking for more places/ideas/options to parallelize...I know this might sound a bit vague without having much reference to the problem but I am looking for generic ideas here which I can explore in my code. Overview of algo( the following algo is run over all levels of the image starting with shortest and increasing width and height by 2 each time till you reach actual height and width). For all image pairs starting with the smallest pair For height = 2 to image_height - 2 Create a 5 by image_width ROI of both left and right images. For width = 2 to image_width - 2 Create a 5 by 5 window of the left ROI centered around width and find best match in the right ROI using NCC Create a 5 by 5 window of the right ROI centered around width and find best match in the left ROI using NCC Disparity = current_width - best match The edge pixels that did not receive a disparity gets the disparity of its neighbors For height = 0 to image_height For width = 0 to image_width Check smoothness, uniqueness and order constraints*(parallelized separately) For height = 0 to image_height For width = 0 to image_width For disparity that failed constraints, use the average disparity of neighbors that passed the constraints Normalize all disparity and output to screen
