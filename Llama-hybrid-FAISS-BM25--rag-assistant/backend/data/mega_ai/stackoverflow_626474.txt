Few options, depending on what you really want to monitor: Net-SNMP (or other SNMP library) for talking with the network equipment and getting the data from various MIBs ( for example you want to collect interface counters, cpu utilization, and other goodies provided by the vendors ) WinPcap for doing more low-level, packet oriented things ( for example capture certain types of traffic using the power and speed of BPF filters ) If you are interested in collecting specific type of information (NetFlow, sFlow) then I cannot help you much. There are ready tools but I'm not sure if there is any in form of a library. RRDtool ( If you want to show the user some nice plots )
