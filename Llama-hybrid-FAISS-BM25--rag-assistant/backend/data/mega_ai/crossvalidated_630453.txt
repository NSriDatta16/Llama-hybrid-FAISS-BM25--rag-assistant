Here is one way to think about problems of this sort. This approach may or may not be directly applicable to your case, in part depending on whether the assumptions are reasonable for your case. Suppose you have noisy measurements of the quantity you are interested in. In particular, let \begin{equation} \mu_i = x + \varepsilon_i , \end{equation} where $x$ denotes what is being measured, $\mu_i$ denotes the $i$ -th measurement, and $\varepsilon_i$ denotes the corresponding error for that measurement. Further suppose the measurement errors are normally distributed: \begin{equation} \varepsilon_i \sim \textsf{N}(0,\sigma_i^2) , \end{equation} where $\sigma_i$ is the standard deviation of the measure error for that measurement. Now additionally suppose the measurement errors are independent. (In some cases these might not be reasonable assumptions, depending on how the measurements were made.) The measurement information could be supplied as 68% credible intervals of the form $\mu_i \pm \sigma_i$ . In this case $\mu_i$ is the center of the interval and $\sigma_i$ is half the length of the interval. Given this setup, we can express the information available in the measurements as \begin{equation} p(x|M) \propto \prod_{i=1}^3 \textsf{N}(\mu_i|x,\sigma_i^2) , \end{equation} where $M$ stands for the three measurements. It's straightforward to show \begin{equation} p(x|M) = \textsf{N}(x|m,v) \end{equation} where the variance is \begin{equation} v = \frac{1}{\sum_{i=1}^3 \frac{1}{\sigma_i^2}} \end{equation} and the mean is \begin{equation} m = v \sum_{i=1}^3 \frac{\mu_i}{\sigma_i^2} . \end{equation} Aside It is convenient to use the precision of the measurement errors instead of the variance. Let $\tau_i = 1/\sigma_i^2$ and $\theta = 1/v$ . Then \begin{equation} p(x|M) = \textsf{N}(x|m,1/\theta) , \end{equation} where \begin{equation} \theta = \sum_{i=1}^3 \tau_i \end{equation} and \begin{equation} m = \frac{1}{\theta} \sum_{i=1}^3 \tau_i\,\mu_i . \end{equation} In other words, the overall precision is the sum of the individual precisions and the overall mean is a weighted average of the individual means where the weights are the relative precisions.
