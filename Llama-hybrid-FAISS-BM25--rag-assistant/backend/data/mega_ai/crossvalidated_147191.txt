Why is stl function giving significant seasonal variation with random data

I plotted with following code with stl (Seasonal Decomposition of Time Series by Loess) function: plot(stl(ts(rnorm(144), frequency=12), s.window="periodic")) It shows signficant seasonal variation with random data put in code above (rnorm function). Signficant variation is seen every time this is run, though the pattern is different. Two such patterns are shown below: How can we rely on stl function on some data when it shows seasonal variation. Does this seasonal variation need to be seen in view of some other parameters? Thanks for your insight. The code has been taken from this page: Is this an appropriate method to test for seasonal effects in suicide count data?
