Model evaluation using R2 and RMSE

I am developing a machine learning model to predict the energy of a molecule ($E$). $R^2$ and $RMSE$ (root mean squared error) values I am getting for the prediction of $ln(E+5)$ are .71 and .08. I know $R^2$ is not good enough. Based on $RMSE$, can my model be considered a good one?
