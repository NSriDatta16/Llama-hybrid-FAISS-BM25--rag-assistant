Setting up Neural Network for this problem

I have a question regarding neural networks considering I am not an expert in NN. Assume have a 5 by 5 grid that depending on me pushing any square (or combination of squares) some of those squares (not necessarily the squares I have pushed) will light up. My question is: Can we set this problem as a NN problem if I have a set of input and outputs? Assume input layer with 25 neurons where all are zero except the ones are pushed and output layer is another 25 neuron where all are zero except the squares that light up. Assume in my training data set I have done this experiment 50 times. Letâ€™s say, in my training set square (3,3) has never been pushed. Can my trained model predict what would the response be if the square is pushed. So basically if a square has not been pushed in training set can NN still be used for prediction? At the end, if all this is possible how would you set up a problem like this? Which NN method would you choose?
