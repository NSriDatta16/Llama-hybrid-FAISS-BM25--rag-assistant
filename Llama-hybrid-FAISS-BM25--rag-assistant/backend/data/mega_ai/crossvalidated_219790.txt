It doesn't seem to be a question of opinion any more: the world appears to have moved well beyond the traditional "teach probability and then teach statistics as an application of it." To get a sense of where the teaching of statistics is going, look at the list of paper titles in last year's special edition of The American Statistician (reproduced below): not a single one of them refers to probability. They do discuss the teaching of probability and its role in the curriculum. A good example is George Cobb's paper and its responses . Here are some relevant quotations: Modern statistical practice is much broader than is recognized by our traditional curricular emphasis on probability-­based inference. What we teach lags decades behind what we practice. Our curricular paradigm emphasizes formal inference from a frequentist orientation, based either on the central limit theorem at the entry level or, in the course for mathematics majors, on a small set of parametric probability models that lend themselves to closed-­form solutions derived using calculus. The gap between our half-­century‐old curriculum and our contemporary statistical practice continues to widen. My thesis ... is that as a profession we have only begun to explore the possibilities. The history of our subject also supports this thesis: Unlike probability, a scion of mathematics, statistics sprouted de novo from the soil of science. Probability is a notoriously slippery concept. The gap between intuition and formal treatment may be wider than in any other branch of applied mathematics. If we insist that statistical thinking must necessarily be based on a probability model, how do we reconcile that requirement with goals of making central ideas “simple and approachable” and minimizing “prerequisites to research”? As a thought experiment, run through the basic concepts and theory of estimation. Note how almost all of them can be explained and illustrated using only first-­semester calculus, with probability introduced along the way. Of course we want students to learn calculus and probability, but it would be nice if we could join all the other sciences in teaching the fundamental concepts of our subject to first year students. There's far more like this. You can read it yourself; the material is freely available.
