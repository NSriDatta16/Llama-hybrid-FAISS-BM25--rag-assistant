If for some reason sje397's answer doesn't work for you (it's an elegant solution, unless the city auto-select is based on some other field on-screen, such as a zip code or state), simply POST both fields. When evaluating the POSTed data, if the CITY text box has data, and the hidden field does not, then evaluate the entered city using the same validation method used by the jquery callback. If the hidden field has data, you assume that javascript is enabled and use your current logic.
