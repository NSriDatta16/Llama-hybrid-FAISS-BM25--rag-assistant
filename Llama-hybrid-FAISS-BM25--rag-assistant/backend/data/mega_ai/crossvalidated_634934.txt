Preamble As I am sure you are already aware, Item Response Theory (IRT) is an umbrella term for a family of statistical models used to model the relationship between a test-taker's latent ability and their probability of correctly answering specific items (questions). Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) is a form of assessment where tests are dynamically tailored to the test-taker's ability level. CAT assessments, unlike fixed-form assessments, select questions $^1$ to match the test-taker's estimated ability level. The link between IRT and CAT is that the latter uses IRT-calibrated item banks and leverages the properties of IRT parameter estimates to both stop testing and to select questions. Whereas Reinforcement Learning (RL), on the other hand, is a type of machine learning (ML) where an agent learns to make decisions by performing actions in an environment to achieve some goals. Answer Now to your questions. I was doing studies in reinforcement learning and trying to apply it in Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT). While learning IRT, I felt it is similar to behavior of RL setting - receiving feedback and adjusting parameters(or learning) in each cycle. Yes, you are correct in pointing out that both IRT and RL use feedback. RL involves a continuous feedback loop where the agent's actions influence the future state of the environment, and the environment's feedback influences the agent's future actions. Similarly, in IRT, feedback is used to update item parameter estimates. However, this similarity that RL has with IRT may be extended to many other statistical problems, as statistical problems with no closed-form solution typically require feedback to arrive at a solution. Is Item Response Theory (IRT) a form of reinforcement learning? Can I know the differences if any. I would not say this, though I believe @conjugateprior was on to something when they suggested - you expand on your analogy it will be easier to say how CAT and RL might be usefully related So while I would not say either IRT or CAT is subsumed within RL (or vice-versa), they can be applied jointly to solve problems. For example, recently Xiao et al. (2023) developed a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm to create individualized learning plans for traits believed to be continuous. Their approach used IRT as the measurement model and a DRL algorithm to find optimal learning paths. $^1$ Note that this is an overgeneralization as CAT assessments differ with regards to how many questions are initially presented before subsequent questions are adaptively administered.
