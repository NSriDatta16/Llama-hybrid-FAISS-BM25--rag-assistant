What kind of data visualization should I use?

I'm going to program a customized phone keyboard where some letters are larger than others, depending on how often I misstype them. For example, if I often pressed "w" instead of "e", I'd make the "e" button take up some of the space of the "w" button: (screenshot from here ) In order to figure out how often I make specific typos, I'll need to collect data and store it in some kind of graphic organizer to help me visualize it. Right now, I'm thinking of something like a cluster map. Does that sound like a good plan, or do you have any other suggestions? Here's an example cluster map (from Microsoft PowerBI). Instead of pictures, they would say things like "KI", to show how often I type "K" instead of "I", and the circle would be larger or smaller depending on how often I make this mistake: Thanks!
