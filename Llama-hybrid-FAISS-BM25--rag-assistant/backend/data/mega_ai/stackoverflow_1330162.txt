Render a string[] as a series of editable controls?

I have a string[] containing individual words parsed out of a paragraph of text. I need to display each word in its own cell, and have each cell be assigned a dynamic width based on the word's length. I want to be able to have as many words as possible within the maximum width of each row. In short, I'm trying to take a given paragraph of text and present it as a series of editable controls in a way which resembles how it might appear as a plain text document, with each word consuming only its required space on each "line". I first tried using a DataList with RepeatLayout in Table mode and RepeatColumns to a set value of 10, with a Repeater within containing a Label control; this resulted in 10 words per row but each cell with a fixed width. I've considered using a GridView with a single column which I would cram with as many words (in the form of Label controls) per row as will fit, adding new rows as necessary until the entire paragraph is built. Could anyone please share an elegant way to do this?
