"files" in *nix type systems are very much an abstract concept. They can be areas on disk organized by a file system, but they could equally well be a network connection, a bit of shared memory, the buffer output from another process, a screen or a keyboard. In order for perl to be really useful it mirrors this model very closely, and does not treat files by emulating a magnetic tape as many 4gls do. So it tried an "IOCTL" operation 'open for write' on a file handle which does not allow write operations which is an inappropriate IOCTL operation for that device/file. The easiest thing to do is stick an " or die 'Cannot open $myfile' statement at the end of you open and you can choose your own meaningful message.
