Domain Adaptation is the process that attempts to alter the source domain in a way to bring the distribution of the source closer to that of the target domain. In many cases the Domain Adaptation methods are modifications of the basic algorithms from the area of the traditional Machine Learning, that they are trying to take into account the difference between the distributions of the train and the test set. For example, one popular DA algorithm is TrAdaboost, which is a Boosting algorithm and it is a modification of the Adaboost algorithm. Another issue is that the DA methods are developed based on the kind of the difference between the two domains that they are trying to tackle. Some of them are trying to get closer the marginal distributions and others the conditional distributions. In my opinion, they do not exist basic or popular methods in same sense as in the traditional Machine Learning, because the DA methods are strongly related with the application or with the assumption that they are based on. You can get an idea of the state of the art of the existing apporaches studying these surveys: PAN, S. J.; YANG, Q. A Survey on Transfer Learning.
