Mixed model with groups with no variability

I am considering the use of mixed models for an analysis of mine, but I may have a concern. Let's take an example from Wikipedia for introducing my question: Suppose $m$ large elementary schools are chosen randomly from among thousands in a large country. Suppose also that $n$ pupils of the same age are chosen randomly at each selected school. Their scores on a standard aptitude test are ascertained. Let $Y_{ij}$ be the score of the $j$ th pupil at the $i$ th school. With this in mind, consider $$Y_{ij} = \mu + \beta_1 \mathrm{Sex}_{ij} + U_i + W_{ij} \enspace ,$$ where $\mu$ is the average test score for the entire population, $\mathrm{Sex}_{ij}$ is the dummy variable for boys/girls, $U_i$ is the school-specific random effect, and $W_{ij}$ is the individual-specific random effect. My question is: What if there are schools with only boys? Are they excluded from the analysis? Is the school-specific random effect 0 in those cases?
