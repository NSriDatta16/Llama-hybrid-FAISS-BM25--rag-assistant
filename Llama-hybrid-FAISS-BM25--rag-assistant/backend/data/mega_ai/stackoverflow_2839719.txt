"Trade" can be ambiguous and it's not entirely clear to me what you want to do here. Are you interested in storing only your current position in each share or also the history of transactions that show how the position developed? If you just want to record your holding ("position" might be a better word if you can be short) then I'd simply record for each share the number held. You mention average price, but I'd be cautious about that if you expect at any time to be able to sell part of a holding. What's the average price if you buy 100 at 50, 100 at 60 and sell 50 at 70? Unless you expect your buy and sell transactions to number in the millions, I'd be more inclined to record each individual purchase or sale as a separate row in a single table and show the totals on demand as the derived results of a simple query.
