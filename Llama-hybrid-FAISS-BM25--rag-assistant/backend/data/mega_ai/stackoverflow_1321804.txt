You can get this by joining the table to itself a bunch of times with some left join s, like so: select org_roag.name + case when org_roa.id is not null then '>>' + org_roa.name + case when org_sg.id is not null then '>>' + org_sg.name else '' end else '' end as breadcrumb from organization org_roag left join roa on org_roag.roagid = roa.roagid left join organization org_roa on roa.roaid = org_roa.roaid left join subgroup sg on roa.roaid = sg.roaid left join organization org_sg on sg.subgroupid = org_sg.subgroupid where org_roag.roagid is not null
