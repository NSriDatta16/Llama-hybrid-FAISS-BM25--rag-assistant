The compiler may have some settings to optimize your code fragment (which has some errors), but you would have to tell the compiler whether you are optimizing for speed or size. There is nothing in the standard saying the degree of performance required. I would factor out the allocation and deallocation because I don't want to rely on the compiler. Also, since there is no garbage collection in the Standard C++ language, your allocation and deallocation could wreak havoc with fragmented memory (or slow the execution down). BTW, you error is comparing variable 'i', which is an integer, to a floating point quantity, "5000000000.0". Note the decimal point. Good programming practice is to compare integers to integers and floating point to floating point.
