Problem with distributing web applications on the Apple Store

I have quite a problem with finding out how to distribute the web based application. There is the description: I have a web based application I would like to distribute over Apple Store (the application itself is free - I would like to use Apple Store because everybody uses it and it is a natural distribution channel for iPhone). To use the Apple Store I can make an wrapper application, which will launch the Safari browser after its startup - but this approach looks pretty ugly: 1/ First the wrapper application window is launched 2/ Then in application delegate I open the link NSString *stringURL = @"http://www.mypage.com/"; NSURL *url = [NSURL URLWithString:stringURL]; [[UIApplication sharedApplication] openURL:url]; 3/ The application is going to background 4/ The Safari is launched 5/ The Safari launch is also not so nice, because the previously opened page is shown in Safari first and then it slides to a blank new window, where start my web application. The 'not so nice' launch is the 1st problem - 2nd problem is that the application is not full screen and i did not find a way how to force Safari to become full screen. Sure - I can force users to can go directly to my application web page first, then they will create a bookmark on the springboard, so they will have the icon here. Then they will have a nice launch + full screen Safari, but I will loose the possibility do promote and distribute the application on the Apple Store. The last possibility is to use the UIWebView, but it does not support HTML5 cache manifest and localStorage, so it cannot be used. Has anyone some advice how to handle this or I have to forgot the Apple Store? BR STeN
