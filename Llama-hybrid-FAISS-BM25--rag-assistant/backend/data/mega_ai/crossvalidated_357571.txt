According to Efron (the "inventor" of the boostrap technique), you should make 1600 replicas. I have no other clue about where this number comes from, except that its square root is 40, an easy number to divide by. I suggest you go like in any other Monte-Carlo. Try 1600, then increase the bootstrap samples until it stabilizes. The bootstrap was introduced to compute confidence intervals in case the distribution of the v.a.r is unknown or not technically computable, because of outliers or skew. The bootstrap replaces the theoretical computations of the confidence interval by a measure of simulated samples. So the confidence intervals should be the same. Note however that all statistical indicators are not equal in front of he boostrap. A average (or a mean) will require less samples than a maximum, or a 1% percentile for example.
