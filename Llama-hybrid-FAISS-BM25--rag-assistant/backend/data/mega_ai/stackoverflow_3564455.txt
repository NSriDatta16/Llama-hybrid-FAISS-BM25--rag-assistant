Implementing Drag-to-Submit Form

I am sick to death of assholes spamming my site, and I hate those stupid Captcha things, and my customers have had it up to their necks with the captcha on my site. So, I had an idea. What if there was a small line. And all they had to do was simply drag a circle from the left of the line to the right. And once the circle reaches the drop-target (end of the line), the form will then submit. Sounds simple? No need to inconveniently type some random crap just to submit a form! See demo pic: Does anybody know how I would implement something like this? Can someone please help me? I need a little direction. Thank you
