Is there a way to prevent forecasting negative values in SPSS?

Currently I'm using the SPSS expert modeler, the training series is a seasonal time series, with some values close to zero in each period, and I find that when the training series have a descending trend, then in the result of the forecast, there will be some negative values. But the time series should be positive on every timestamps, is there a way to prevent forecasting negative values?
