strange characters in packets

I'm writing a sniffer for http packets with libpcap. Sometimes printing the content of the http payload I get strange characters.. do you know what could they be? *xNT:���3�@�"P#1u`��$%S{M�� or �~�tsE��}>a�����}/���`�▒�A�y Thanks, for the answers. If the header is in plain text so the problem is my code. Anyway, can a POST request be coded in base64?
