How can I get normally distributed data?

I have done Repeated Measure Two way ANOVA for my ample of data using SIGMAPLOT. My analysis has two factors, for example: 1st factor is the hydrogen peroxide concentration and the 2nd factor is about time series (20 minutes with every 1 minute interval I took the absorbance reading). What happened was my normality tended to fail and even sometimes my variance test failed. Then this SIGMAPLOT can suggest me to proceed with the Holm-Sidaak test. I have never used that or came across in any analysis. So I need advice on how from the beginning I can collect (how many or replicates) data to make my data are normally distributed when I run a normality test where I can use Tukey or Post hoc test which is commonly used. I would like to run a new set of experiments. How can I proceed?
