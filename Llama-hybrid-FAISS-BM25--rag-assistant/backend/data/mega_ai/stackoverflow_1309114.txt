There's no need to use a POST for this, since requesting the report doesn't change the state of the server. I would use a resource like this: GET /daily-report/ 200 OK Pragma: no-cache Responding to your edit: if you are POSTing a description of the report to a URL, and retrieving a temporary data set as a result, that's not REST at all. It's RPC, in the same vein as SOAP. RPC is not an inherently bad thing, but please, please don't call it RESTful.
