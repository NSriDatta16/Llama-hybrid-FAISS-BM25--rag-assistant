Maybe you can read some papers related to MapReduce and distributed computing first, to gain a better understanding of it. Here are some I would like to recommand: MapReduce: Simplified Data Processing on Large Clusters, http://www.usenix.org/events/osdi04/tech/full_papers/dean/dean_html/ Bigtable: A Distributed Storage System for Structured Data, http://www.usenix.org/events/osdi06/tech/chang/chang_html/ Dryad: Distributed data-parallel programs from sequential building blocks, http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824-2007/papers/isard-dryad.pdf The landscape of parallel computing research: A view from berkeley, http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.67.8705&rep=rep1&type=pdf On the other hand, if you want to know better of Hadoop, maybe you can start reading Hadoop MapReduce framework source code.
