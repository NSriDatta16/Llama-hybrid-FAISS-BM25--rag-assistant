Questions about implementation of a global register allocator for the tiny c compiler

upcoming summer i will hopefully start writing my masters thesis and i have been quite busy looking for a thesis subject. I now have a pool of subjects that i am interested in and the one that struck me most is the implementation of a global register allocator for the tiny C compiler (graph coloring or linear scan). So i wanted to drop by and ask if any of you has ever done this and if it is a feasible subject for a master thesis, or if it is too hard. I would also be very happy if you could direct me to any good literature about this subject(i already have the dragonbook).
