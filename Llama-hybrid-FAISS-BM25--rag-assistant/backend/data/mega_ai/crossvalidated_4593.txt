The following approaches might be of interest. In (1) http://www.chemoton.org/ref31.html a GA was used on image analysis but data was first treated. In order to treat the data, the GA was hybridized with K-means clustering, a well-know data classification procedure. Among classification the GA was also able to perform data feature extraction. Other approaches are also available from (2) ref 39 in chemoton org (3) ref 51 in chemoton org and (4) ref 42 in chemoton org among many other works. Hope it helps. Best, v.
