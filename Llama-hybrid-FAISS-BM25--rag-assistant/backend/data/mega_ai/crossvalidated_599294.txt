How should I impute a 100% missing element of a composite variable?

I want to model the variable $Y$ (score 1 to 10) that is a composite of 5 ordinal variables $Y_{a:e}$ with the same levels (0 = "not at all", 1 = "a little bit", 2="a lot"). $Y_{a:e}$ has been observed on the same individuals (n=500) at 3 points in time; $Y_{a:e;t1}$ , $Y_{a:e;t2}$ and $Y_{a:e;t3}$ . The aim is to compute the adjusted (i.e.: model-based) prevalence of $Y>5$ at each of these time points. So, ultimately, my overall score variable $Y$ is transformed into a binary variable. Unfortunately, 1 of the 5 ordinal variables is 100% missing at one of these time point (e.g.: $Y_{a;t3}$ is completely unobserved) , so the score (0-10) and furthermore the prevalence $Y>5$ can't be computed. How can I estimate the score at this time point, given that the composite variable $Y$ was partly unobserved? I thought of 3 solutions: a) Replace missing $Y_{a;t3}$ with $Y_{b;t3}$ because $Y_{b}$ is similar to $Y_{a}$ , however gives a little bit more specific information (e.g.: $Y_{b}$ = "Do you feel anxious at work?" vs $Y_{a}$ = "Do you feel anxious in general?") b) Average $Y_{b:e;t3}$ and attribute to result to $Y_{a;t3}$ . So basically, $Y_{a;t3}$ = ( $Y_{b;t3} +Y_{c;t3}+Y_{d;t3}+Y_{e;t3})/4$ c) Treat the problem as a "machine learning" problem. Predict missing $Y_{a;t3}$ through a multinominal proportional odds regression trained on $Y_{a;t2}$ with numerous predictors that are relevant to predict the outcome. I have a slight preference for solution c), but I would enjoy any advice that that get me closer to attribute unbiased values to $Y_{a;t3}$ . If solution c) seems reasonable, what can I do to maximize my model prediction performance?
