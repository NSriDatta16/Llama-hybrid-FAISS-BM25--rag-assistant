Well, lots of things can make a SQL Server query slower the first time it is run. Most of them do not take multiple seconds, however. â€¦ Except for hard drive random accesses. The first time you run the query, SQL Server may have to read the database pages from hard disk storage. The next time you run the query those pages are likely in memory. Regarding the Entity Framework, the first time you run a query it must be compiled into SQL. You can use the CompiledQuery type to pre-compile Entity Framework queries in order to do this work ahead of time, before the end user has to wait for it. On a very large model, view generation take some time, as well. You can move this to compile time, instead. See this article for more such tips.
