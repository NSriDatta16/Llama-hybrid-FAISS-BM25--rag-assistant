Sorting Katakana names

If I have a list of Katakana names what is the best way to sort them? Also is it more common to sort names based on their {first name}{last name} or {last name}{first name}. Another question is how do we get the first character Hiragana representation of a Katakana name like how it is done for the iPhone's contact list is sorted.? Thanks.
