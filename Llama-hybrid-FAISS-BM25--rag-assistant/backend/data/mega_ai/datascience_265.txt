Can machine learning algorithms predict sports scores or plays?

I have a variety of NFL datasets that I think might make a good side-project, but I haven't done anything with them just yet. Coming to this site made me think of machine learning algorithms and I wondering how good they might be at either predicting the outcome of football games or even the next play. It seems to me that there would be some trends that could be identified - on 3rd down and 1, a team with a strong running back theoretically should have a tendency to run the ball in that situation. Scoring might be more difficult to predict, but the winning team might be. My question is whether these are good questions to throw at a machine learning algorithm. It could be that a thousand people have tried it before, but the nature of sports makes it an unreliable topic.
