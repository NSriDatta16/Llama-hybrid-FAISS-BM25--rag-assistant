Is there an indicator to know if the predicted value is 100% right?

I am new to Machine Learning. I want to know if there is any indicator which can show us ML's confidence about any given prediction. I am suppose to build an application in which I only want to use predictions which are 100% right...anything less than that, I want to ignore those predictions. Please let me know.
