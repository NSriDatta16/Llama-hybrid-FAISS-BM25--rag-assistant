This is the case where the statistician should endeavor to be agnostic about their results. The relations that we model with regression are not well ordered, they are stochastically ordered. It may be the case for a particular individual or setting that, even when receiving the superior condition or treatment, their outcome is worse than if they had not received it. Regression quite literally averages up over everything - the patient level characteristics, the settings, the experimental contamination, and so on. Certain forms of biases can be excluded, but outcomes contrary to expectation does not a bias make.
