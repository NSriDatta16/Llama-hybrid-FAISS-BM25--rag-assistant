Can't add comment yet, so another answer. I was also surprised when I saw for the first time, that DoDragDrop is called synchronously and it somehow doesn't froze the UI. But the copy/move stuff I believe is perfectly logical. You can specify allowed effects while calling DoDragDrop method in source app and that's all what's important to you. How destination app will handle and use the data it's up to it.
