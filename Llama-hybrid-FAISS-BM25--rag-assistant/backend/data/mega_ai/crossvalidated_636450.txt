Calculating Degrees of Freedom for Each Predictor/Coefficient in Logistic Regression

So I'm sure there's likely a simple answer here and I've just been thinking about this question for too long, but would appreciate your help nonetheless! I'm trying to calculate what the degrees of freedom would be for each of the individual predictors/coefficients in a multiple logistic regression model. When I run the logistic regression in R, I get the overall model's degrees of freedom, but not the individual ones. What calculation do I need to run for each predictor/coefficient to find their own degrees of freedom? Is it number of observations within that predictor minus the overall number of parameters for the entire model, or something else? I'm using this paper (table below) as reference, but can't figure out they calculated their individual DF for each coefficient/predictor: Link to their paper here: https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/C08A4270B0DC219461466BE9BC6C06AC/S0954394521000235a.pdf/a-variationist-analysis-of-first-person-singular-subject-expression-in-louisiana-french.pdf
