Modelling a response variable that changes in time

As an example, suppose that I am interested in predicting what proportion of a rain water tank will be full today. I have the following pieces of information: The proportion of the rain water tank that is full yesterday. Other predictors like number of people using the rain water tank. What sort of analysis should I use to model this proportion? Can I: Fit a logistic regression model and use the proportion of the rain water tank that is full yesterday as one of the predictors. Calculate the change in proportion between today and yesterday, use that as the response in a regression model. Use a Bayesian type model where the proportion of the rain water that is full yesterday is the prior in the model. Use time series analysis, even though there are only two points in time where we observe the fullness of the tank.
