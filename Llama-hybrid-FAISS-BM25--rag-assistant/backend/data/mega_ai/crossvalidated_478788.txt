Consider first the simpler regression: $$ y_c = \beta x_c + \mu_s + \eta_c $$ In this regression, the idea is to use the variability of $x$ across counties within states to identify $\beta$ . Why would you want that? Maybe because other policies are implemented at the state level that might influence both $x$ and $y$ . In this case, omitting the state fixed effects $\mu$ would allow one to use both the cross-county and the cross-state variability of $x$ , which might cause a bias. Running this fixed-effect regression is exactly equivalent to centering your $y$ and your $x$ by removing the state average to each county-level measure and run the simple regression of the centered $y$ on the centered $x$ . Or, as you put it, running one regression per state, and then average all state-specific estimates. Now, let's go back to your specification: $$ y_{ct} = \beta x_{ct} + \lambda_{c} + \mu_{st} + \eta_{ct} $$ We are not only using the within-state variability in this case. For instance, if $x$ was varying across counties but constant over time, we could not identify $\beta$ . The presence of $\lambda_c$ means that we are identifying $\beta$ from the variability of $x$ over time and across counties within states. This is a very flexible specification because it allows the different states to have arbitrarily different time evolutions in $y$ , and counties to have arbitrarily different levels of $y$ . For this reason, it is also quite demanding on the data, and you end up throwing away a lot of the variability in $x$ , leading to less precise estimators. Note that differentiating this equation over time leads to: $$ \Delta y_{ct} = \beta \Delta x_{ct} + \Delta \mu_{st} + \Delta \eta_{ct} $$ with $\Delta X_t$ defined as $X_t - X_{t-1}$ . In differences, this model is therefore close to the first one: we rely on the within-state cross-county variability of the time difference of $x$ .
