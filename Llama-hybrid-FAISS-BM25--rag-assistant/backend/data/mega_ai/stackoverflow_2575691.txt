I'd do this this way 1*num(1) + 2*num(2) + 3*num(3) + 4*num(4) + 5*num(5) + A*3 ----------------------------------------------------------- num(1) + num(2) + num(3) + num(4) + num(5) + A Where num(i) is number of votes for i. A is a parameter. I can't tell You exact value of it. It depends on what do You mean by "few votes". In general high value of A means that You need many votes to get average different than 3, low value of A means You need few votes to get different value than 3. If You consider 5 as "few votes" then You can take A=5. In this solution I just assume that each product starts with A votes for 3 instead of no votes. Hope it helps.
