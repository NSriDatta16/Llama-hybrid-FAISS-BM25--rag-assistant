Gibbs sampling step for variables that have a complex offline prior in an MCMC hybrid

I have a question about how to use an offline function as a prior when performing a Gibbs/hybrid analysis. Let's say I have data $y$ and some parameters which I'll simplify to $\theta_1, \theta_2$ . Next, let's say I am working on a Gibbs sampler step $t$ for $\theta_1^{(t)}$ (which I'll simply call $\theta_1$ ) and the other parameter $\theta_2^{(t-1)}$ is fixed. The conditional posterior of $\theta_1$ is being evaluated and if it had an independent prior, I would have: $$ p(\theta_1 | y, \theta_2^{(t-1)}) \propto p(y | \theta_1, \theta_2^{(t-1)})p(\theta_1) $$ In an MCMC hybrid, I would try to make use of the proportionality using a Metropolis-Hastings step. I have found many examples. In my case, the thing that makes this harder is that instead of independent priors I want to use a function that will describe the "reasonableness" of any pair $f(\theta_1, \theta_2)$ . The function is complicated, but I can evaluate it and it decreases rapidly outside a limited region. My question is, can I make use of this reasonableness function in the hybrid context? I haven't seen examples. The idea I had was to fix $\theta_2$ when evaluating $f$ : $$ p(\theta_1 | y,\theta_2^{(t-1)}) \propto p(y | \theta_1, \theta_2 ^{(t-1)})f(\theta_1, \theta_2^{(t-1)}) $$ and then I would use an MH step for the update. Assuming $f$ is bounded and decays as I claimed, is this idea sound?
