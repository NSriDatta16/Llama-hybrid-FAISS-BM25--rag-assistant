SVM prediction accuracy drops when using Test data

I am using the Kaggle Scikit data to learn R. I am using the R e1071 SVM function to predict classes. When I use: svm(train, trainLabels, scale = TRUE, type = NULL, kernel = "polynomial") I obtain this level of accuracy on a sample of the Train data: > table(pred, trainLabels) trainLabels pred 0 1 0 478 8 1 12 502 which I interpret as being 98% accurate (8+12) / (478+8+12+502). Though when I use the same prediction model on the Test data, Kaggle returns a 0.82 score, based on classification accuracy . Can you explain why I can get such a different accuracy level?
