The Bayesian rating formula looks very simple to me. Let me break it down and present an alternate view of the parameters involved. WR = $\frac{v}{v+m}*R+\frac{m}{v+m}*C$ =P(enough evidence)*[Rating based on evidence]+P(no evidence)*[best guess when no evidence] Say, a movie got v ratings and you have empiracally chosen m based on what you think is a good number of votes to rely on the rating based on votes. Observe that the second term ($\frac{m}{v+m}*C$) in the sum goes to zero when v is large. The best guess for the rating, when there is no evidence is the average rating of all the movies. I think choosing m as the average number of votes in the dataset is over-kill. I would start with the first quartile of the number of votes. Thanks
