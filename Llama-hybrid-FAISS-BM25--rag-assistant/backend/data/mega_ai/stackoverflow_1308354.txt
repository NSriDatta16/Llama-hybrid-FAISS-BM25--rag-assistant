Asp.net - Caching vs Static Variable for storing a Dictionary

I am building a web-store with many departments and categories. They are stored in our database and accessed often. We are using URL rewriting so almost every request within the store generates a lookup. We also need to iterate over the data frequently to generate menus for the main store and the department pages. This information will not change often so I'm thinking that I should load the database into a dictionary to speed up the information retrieval. I know the standard practice is to load data into the application cache, however i assume that there is some level of serialization that occurs during caching, and for a large data-structure I'm thinking the overhead would be significant. My impulse on this is to put the dictionary in a static variable in one of the related classes. I would however like to get some input input on this. Am I right in thinking that this method would be faster? Is it horrible practice? Is there a better way that I'm missing? I can't seem to find much information on this and I'd really appreciate any information that you can share. Thanks!
