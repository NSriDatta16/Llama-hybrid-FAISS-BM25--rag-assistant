What kind of model to run?

Trying to make a good model for voting habits of congress- dependent variable is "vote", with values being 0- not a member when vote taken, 1 – yea, 6 – nay, 9 – abstain. Independent variables include party, primary election returns... Will do feature selection to find important variables, which I can do on random forest. Now since vote can be 0,1,6,9. does doing regression make sense? How should I change the dependent variable
