How do I get started with machine learning and image recognition?

I'd like to get started with machine learning, specifically image recognition. I know that Python is the most popular language for ML since it's easy to pick up and there's tons of libraries for it. I have a few questions: What are the advantages of using a pre-trained model vs training my own? Where would I find pre-trained models? At what point would it be worth it to train my own models, and how can I do so? Which library should I be using as a beginner? TensorFlow, scikit-learn, etc.
