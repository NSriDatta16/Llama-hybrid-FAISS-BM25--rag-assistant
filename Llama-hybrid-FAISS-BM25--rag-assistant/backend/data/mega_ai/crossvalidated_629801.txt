You can certainly take 12 months of monthly ARIMA predictions and call the sum a prediction for the entire year. Your bootstrap idea is a bit questionable. First, bootstrapping will discard any seasonality in your data. Second, you will indeed get something like a confidence interval for your prediction, but are you sure you want that and not a prediction interval? There is a difference. it is impossible to fit time series model on 2 data points Certainly it is possible. You can take the mean of the two datapoints, or use the most recent one as a naive forecast. You could even fit a trend and extrapolate it out, whether dampened or undampened. No, none of these will likely be very good forecasts. I personally would put most stock in the average of your two historical annual observations. However, there is not very much you can do with just two years of data. Perhaps you can learn something from related time series? Alternatively, take a look at the MAPA algorithm, which would leverage both annual and monthly data.
