You shouldn't subclass the description method ( Link ): Although the description method does not cause a fault to fire, if you implement a custom description method that accesses the objectâ€™s persistent properties, this will cause a fault to fire. You are strongly discouraged from overriding description in this way. I tested your loadTrivia code (with a different entityName) on my app and it worked fine. Did you have a look at the NSError (you should initialize it with =nil): NSLog(@"Unresolved error %@, %@", error, [error userInfo]); Also you should release the NSFetchRequest after execution in - (BOOL)loadTrivia .
