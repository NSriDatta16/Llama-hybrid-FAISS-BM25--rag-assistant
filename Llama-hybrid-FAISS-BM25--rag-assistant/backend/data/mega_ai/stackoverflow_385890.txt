Timed Subscription Schedule in SSRS sends out duplicate emails

I have created a one-time subscription in SSRS report manager 2008. However I keep getting duplicate emails sent out by the subscription. The interval between each email is about 30 minutes. I have checked SQL agent job and it looks the SQL agent job is created correctly. It just runs once and after that the next run time is cleared. I also checked SMTP service on local machine by testing code. SMTP works fine for test email without duplicate. So I guess probably it is something wrong in SSRS. Any advice on where I can look into?
