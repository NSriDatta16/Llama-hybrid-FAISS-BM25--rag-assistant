I think you need to use HttpCacheability.ServerAndPrivate That should give you cache-control: private in the headers and let you set an ETag. The documentation on that needs to be a bit better. Edit: Markus found that you also have call cache.SetOmitVaryStar(true) otherwise the cache will add the Vary: * header to the output and you don't want that.
