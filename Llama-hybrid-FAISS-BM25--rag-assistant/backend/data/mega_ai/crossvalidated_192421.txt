The statistical coffee test

I have had a couple of courses in mathematics, and two in basic statistics. over the last few days I have pondered on how to perform the best possible test of coffee brands, using my knowledge of statistics and mathematics. Note that the choice of coffee here is completely irregular. Background: My thought was that the standard way is to make each subject taste each coffee and rate them on some scale. Afterwards one can take the mean or average, and maybe remove the most extreme values (outside 95% confidence interval). I think that this method is easy to implement but lacks a refference point. It is hard for the subjects to objectively compare 6 or 8 types against each other. The important thing is if Y is better than X. Another point is that this does not give any indication on how reliable the subjects score. By removing the extremas you are either labeling the subjects as valid or invalid. The experiment: Given $n$ brands of coffe, have $2n$ cups labeled cup where each brand is in two cups. Give two cups to the subject, make them rate which cup is best, or if they are indistinguishable. Repeat this process untill you have a sufficient sample. Now the control-rods is the number of tests, where the subject is given two identical brands to compare. If the subject rates A over A, then he/she is unreliable. The subject would then get a credibility factor 5/7 for an example, based on how many of the identical brands he/she was able to identify. Statistics Now I want to use this data to say something productive of which brand is preffered, where one also takes into consideration how good the subjects are at rating brands. I was toying around with using a ELO or GLICKO rating system, and then just multiply this rating with the credibility factor. However this is then biased towards the first ranked brands. Question Given a list of ratings between brands, and a credibility factor. What is a good way to interpret and present the dataset?
