Use UIElements as ItemsSource of ListBox in Silverlight

I've noticed that if you have anything deriving from UIElement as items in a ListBox in Silverlight it renders the object as is and isn't paying any attention to settings of DisplayMemberPath and/or ListBox.ItemTemplate . For example if you have XAML like this: text1 text2 text3 In Siverlight this produces a ListBox with items like this: text1 text2 text3 However in WPF (and I think this is correct behavior) it lists tags as expected: tag1 tag2 tag3 If I use objects that aren't inherited from UIElement everything works as expected: abcde fgh Produces: a f Is there any way to use UIElement s as ItemsSource in Silverlight the same way as any other objects? Or am I missing something?
