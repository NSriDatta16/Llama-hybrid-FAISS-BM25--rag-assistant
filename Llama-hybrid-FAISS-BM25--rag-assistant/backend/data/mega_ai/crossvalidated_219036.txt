"Importance" is not a clear-cut concept. However, a coauthor of mine recently varied the mtry parameter (that is, the number of candidate predictors randomly chosen at each split) and recorded the resulting out-of-bag classification accuracy. Now, on the one hand, the accuracies differ by an amount that is probably not clinically different - just between 79.8% and 81.3%. On the other hand, the difference between mtry=8 and mtry=21 certainly is statistically significant. So it seems like the parameter settings for your Random Forest can indeed have an impact on your accuracy. I was surprised at this myself. (I'd rather not give details on the classification task here, because this is yet-unsubmitted work in progress, and I don't want my collaborators to kill me. I'm too young to die.)
