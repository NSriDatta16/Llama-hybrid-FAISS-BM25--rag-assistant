Has anyone managed to build any applications with the LinkedIn API?

LinkedIn are very cautious of applications using their APIs. I have tried and failed to get access to them. Has anyone actually built any real applications with them yet? If yes, what strategy did you employ to get access to their API? BTW I am talking about first class value added applications on top of LinkedIn, not just embedding hyperlinks.
