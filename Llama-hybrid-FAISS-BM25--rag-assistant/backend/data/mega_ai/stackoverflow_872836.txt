How can I recognize a tap on a UIImageView-subclass inside a UIScrollView?

I tried it with this code in my UIScrollView-subclass: - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { NSLog(@"he/she touched me"); } I also made sure that in the initialization of my view, this gets called: self.userInteractionEnabled = YES; But when the scroll view doesn't move and i tap on my subview a few times, nothing happens. No log message. I know that the UIScrollView actually waits a moment if the user would like to scroll, but at some point it should give up waiting and fire the event to the subview, right? Is there something important that I might missed here? EDIT: Read my answer below, if you have the same problem!
