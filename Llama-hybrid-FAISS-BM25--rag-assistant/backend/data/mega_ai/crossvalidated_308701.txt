The answer is through the hidden unit that it passes along. The simplest RNN in this case would be a character RNN, which given a list of characters so far (including punctuation, brackets, etc.), tries to predict the next character in the sequence. After every prediction, it passes along an updated hidden unit. While the hidden unit is generally abstract nonsense, it still contains the notion that at some point the sequence outputted a "[" bracket. Since 99.99% of text that contains a "[" bracket ultimately contains a "]" bracket, this kind of prior will heavily influence the RNN. So it will generally spit out a closing bracket "]" after it determines that the length of the text after the "[" bracket is long enough. This length will likely depend on the corpus of text it was trained on.
