How to deal with unknown classes with a neural network classifier?

I have a small RNN with a softmax output, which succesfully classifies sequences within a known set of n classes. The model is only trained with known classes. Now I have the problem that there might be sequences which do not belong to any of said classes. Of course, my model will try to lump in those sequences into one of the given n categories. How to deal with these sequences that do not fit into any of the given/trained categories?
