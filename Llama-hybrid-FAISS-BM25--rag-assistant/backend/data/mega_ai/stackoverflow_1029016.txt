I believe @Jason Creighton and @S.Lott are correct. At least if the table that you're updating is on a transactional storage engine. InnoDB is transactional, ISAM is not. You either have to call commit() on your connection object before closing it, or you must set the connection to autocommit mode. I am not sure how you do that for a MySQLdb connection, I guess you either set an argument to the connection constructor, or set a property after creating the connection object. Something like: conn = mysql.connection(host, port, autocommit=True) # or conn = mysql.connection(host, port) conn.autocommit(True)
