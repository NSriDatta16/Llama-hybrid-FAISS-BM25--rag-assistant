Is there an R or python package to calculate wasserstein metric between negative binomial distributions?

As the title says I am looking for an R or python package which can calculate wasserstein distance (aka earthmovers distance between) two lists (vectors) of sampled values from a negative binomial distribution? Relevant publication: Barbour, A. D., Gan, H. L., & Xia, A. (2015). Stein factors for negative binomial approximation in Wasserstein distance. Bernoulli, 21(2), 1002-1013. Explanation of the Wasserstien distance: https://rpubs.com/FJRubio/NWD
