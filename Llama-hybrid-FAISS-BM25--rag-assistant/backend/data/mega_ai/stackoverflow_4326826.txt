Bending the rules of UNIQUE column SQLITE

I am working with an extensive amount of third party data. Each data set has items with unique identifiers. So it is very easy for me to utilise UNIQUE column in SQLITE to enforce some data integrity. Out of thousands of records I have id from third party source A matching 2 unique ids from third party source B. Is there a way of bending the rules, and allowing a duplicate entry in a unique column? If not how should I reorganise my data to take care of this single edge case. UPDATE: CREATE TABLE "trainer" ( "id" INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, "name" TEXT NOT NULL, "betfair_id" INTEGER NOT NULL UNIQUE, "racingpost_id" INTEGER NOT NULL UNIQUE ); Problem data: Miss Beverley J Thomas http://www.racingpost.com/horses/trainer_home.sd?trainer_id=20514 Miss B J Thomas http://www.racingpost.com/horses/trainer_home.sd?trainer_id=11096 vs. Miss Beverley J. Thomas http://form.horseracing.betfair.com/form/trainer/1/00008861 Both Racingpost entires (my primary data source) match a single Betfair entry. This is the only one (so far) out of thousands of records.
