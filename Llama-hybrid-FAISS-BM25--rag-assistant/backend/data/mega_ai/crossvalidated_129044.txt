Does a degree in statistics make one a more rational thinker?

All my life I have been plagued by mental illness, delusion, superstition. I have come to see the value of science and rationality and skepticism but don't really know how to think in a more scientific or rational way - I don't have the tools/methodology. I was wondering what areas of study (in terms of a major for a bachelors degree) can help one develop the most scientific and rational mind they can. I see a link between probability and belief - belief is holding a proposition as true - but probability is the different shades of grey of that belief. Seeing as statistics deals with probability, and therefore with belief. What type of college major do you think builds the most rigorous rationality in a individual? I suspect the hard sciences would on average produce the most rational thinkers, followed by majors in statistics and mathematics. I also posted a question on another forum that was ignored - perhaps someone can answer it for me. I am interested in knowing how statistics ties into the scientific method. Do most scientific experiments need the expertise of a statistician? Or is the use of statisticians limited in science? When are statisticians needed? What do statisticians contribute to scientific experiments? (at what stages of the scientific method are they involved?) Do statistic majors learn the logic needed to draw inferences from a scientific experiment? or is this part left to the scientists?
