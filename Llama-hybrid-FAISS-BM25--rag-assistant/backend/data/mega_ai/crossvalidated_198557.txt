Three IVs, one DV. What test to use?

I've gotten myself into a pickle with my experimental design. I'm looking at how the temperature at which an organism dies is affected by: - the population it came from (e.g. Pop1, Pop2, Pop3) - the temperature at which I kept them (Pop1 was split into three different incubation temperatures, etc.) - the weight of organisms I believe that gives me 2 categorical and 1 ratio predictor variables, but I don't know what stats test to use, because I've never dealt with so many IVs at once. My statistics knowledge isn't great so I'd appreciate any help.
