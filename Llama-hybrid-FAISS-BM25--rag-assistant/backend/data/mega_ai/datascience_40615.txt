as ncasas mentioned "Normally, the answers to those questions are that series are not perfectly aligned and that variations in scale are also fine as long as the shape is similar" then DTW is good. The Q is: what if the shape is not similar but the subsequence of TS1 is similar to TS2? Then you shall have a look at subsequence time series clustering. I've found this idea couple of days ago and realized there is a research paper about it already. Here you have the link: https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.11624 Please remember that comparing subsequence TS is meaningfull as long as you choose right metric for clusters distance computation and it shall be based on clusters shape as per "An Alternate Measure for Comparing Time Series Subsequence Clusters" paper.
