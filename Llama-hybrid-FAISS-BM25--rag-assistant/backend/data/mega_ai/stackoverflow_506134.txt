Word has a little marker thingy that it puts at the end of every cell of text in a table. It is used just like an end-of-paragraph marker in paragraphs: to store the formatting for the entire paragraph. Just use the Left() function to strip it out, i.e. Left(Target, Len(Target)-1)) By the way, instead of num_rows = Application.ActiveDocument.Tables(2).Rows.Count For n = 1 To num_rows Descr = Application.ActiveDocument.Tables(2).Cell(n, 2).Range.Text Try this: For Each row in Application.ActiveDocument.Tables(2).Rows Descr = row.Cells(2).Range.Text
