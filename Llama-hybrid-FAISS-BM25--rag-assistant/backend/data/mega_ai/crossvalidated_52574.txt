Your statement 'also measure a laboratory reference value to compare our value to' is slightly ambiguous. I assume you mean 'get Glucose measures from the same samples assessed by a lab'... (but you might mean that the second sample are your device's assessment of known glucose-level sample that aren't related to the first lot of values). If the laboratory reference values are a gold standard, wouldn't you want to know two things: 1) typical bias 2) some kind of typical distance from the standard, like average absolute percentage error or RMSE...? and for a more sophisticated idea of how your machine performs: 3) some kind of plot of error (or %error) vs gold standard (to check for a trend) However, since you have both your measurements and the gold standard, you can also calibrate your measurements to the standard, which might eliminate the bias (1) almost completely and reduce (2) to pure variability. That is, imagine the correlation is really high but (1) and (2) look really bad. You should be able to use regression to derive a linear correction that greatly improves the absolute accuracy of your results. More algebraically: if your device values are $y_i$, $i = 1, 2, ..., n$, and the gold standard values are $m_i$, wouldn't you want 1) average of $y_i - m_i$ OR $(y_i - m_i)/m_i *100\%$ 2) average of $|y_i - m_i|$ OR $|y_i - m_i|/m_i *100\%$ OR RMS(y_i - m_i) or RMS((y_i - m_i)/m_i) 3) plot of $y_i - m_i$ OR $(y_i - m_i)/m_i *100\%$ vs $m_i$ More than likely, I bet there's some typical measure like one of those in (1) and (2) that are widely used for devices like yours already ... and you should definitely use whatever that is.
