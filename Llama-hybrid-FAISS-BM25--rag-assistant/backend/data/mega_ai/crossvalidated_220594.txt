Can AdaBoost be used with multiple measurements?

Can Adaboost be used with multiple measurments? If yes, how / why is it working? Example: let's say I want to predict if it's going to rain=1, or not=-1 and I want to model my prediction based on, let's say, the amount of clouds AND the average atmospheric pressure during a day. The thing is, I understand for example what's happening here , but I am not able to understand how does Adaboost work when I have "two sets" of $X$s.
