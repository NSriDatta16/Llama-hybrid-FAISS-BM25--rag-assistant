The Google's Closure Compiler can accept JSDoc comments , and it will generate warnings or errors. For example, if you try to compile the following code with the Advanced Optimization : /** @const */ var MY_BEER = 'stout'; MY_BEER = 'bar'; It will generate an error: Number of errors: 1 JSC_CONSTANT_REASSIGNED_VALUE_ERROR: constant MY_BEER assigned a value more than once at line 5 character 8 They discourage the const keyword because it is not part of the ECMAScript Standard.
