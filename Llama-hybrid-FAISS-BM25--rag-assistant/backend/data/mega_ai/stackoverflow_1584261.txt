I'm assuming that what you need here is a 2-columns page layout. In theory, you could use display:table but if you need to support any version of IE, thats not really an option. This is one of the hardest things some of us encountered when switching from tables to CSS, but fortunately for you, we've been doing this for more than 5 years and I think you can fine a solution for every problem. Maybe you want to check this classic article: Faux Columns Please, don't feel discouraged, CSS is only hard the first months, and after that you'll be able to layout anything in a very clean, simple, semantic and standard way.
