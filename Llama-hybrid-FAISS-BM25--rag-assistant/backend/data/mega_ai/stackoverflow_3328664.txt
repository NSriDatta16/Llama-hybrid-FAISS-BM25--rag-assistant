Analytics for 3rd party JavaScript widgets

I'm trying to find the best approach for analyics on 3rd party JavaScript widgets - i.e. tools and content that is distributed to any number of arbitrary users, who include the widgets as HTML snippets with tags. On the same domain Note that the widgets do not load into an iframe element that has a document loaded from the external site. Instead, they load content into the DOM of the host page - i.e. they are treated as being on the same domain as the host. Analytics for a fragment of the host page So, essentially, I want to track stats (such as widget views , user clicks and custom interactions within the widget), but I only want to track stats for the fragment of the host page that is the widget. I don't want to track clicks on the host page that are outside the widget. I want the stats to be collated together, so that stats for the widget on site A will be aggregated with those of the widget on site B and site C, etc. Questions Is it possible to use Google Analaytics in a custom way that satisfies these requirements? Or is it not possible to separate GA from the rest of the data collected on the host page? If it is possible to use Google Analytics, then will there be a problem if the host page already uses GA (with a different GA profile ID), or is it possible to keep them safely apart? Are there any other analytics packages out there that are properly suited to widget stats tracking, to meet these requirements? Or, how else would you approach the problem of obtaining stats for these widgets?
