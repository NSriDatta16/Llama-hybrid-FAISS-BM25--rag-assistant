I think what you're looking for is this: http://ryanfait.com/sticky-footer/ It's an elegant, CSS only solution! I use it and it works perfect with all kinds of layouts in all browsers! As far as I'm concerned it is the only elegant solution which works with all browsers and layouts. @Josh: No it isn't and that's what Blankman wants, he wants a footer that sticks to the bottom of the document, not of the viewport (browser window). So if the content is shorter than the browser window, the footer sticks to the lower end of the window, if the content is longer, the footer goes down and is not visible until you scroll down. Twitter Bootstrap implementation I've seen a lot of people asking how this can be combined with Twitter Bootstrap. While it's easy to figure out, here are some snippets that should help. // _sticky-footer.scss SASS partial for a Ryan Fait style sticky footer html, body { height: 100%; } .wrapper { min-height: 100%; height: auto !important; height: 100%; margin: 0 auto -1*($footerHeight + 2); /* + 2 for the two 1px borders */ } .push { height: $footerHeight; } .wrapper > .container { padding-top: $navbarHeight + $gridGutterWidth; } @media (max-width: 480px) { .push { height: $topFooterHeight !important; } .wrapper { margin: 0 auto -1*($topFooterHeight + 2) !important; } } And the rough markup body: // navbar content // main content with your grids, etc. // footer content
