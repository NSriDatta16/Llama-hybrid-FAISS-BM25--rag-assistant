\n not working in UIlabel

I've seen similar questions here, but still can figure out why it's not working. How to add line break (in other words add new paragraph) in multiline UIlabel? I have a label with a lot of text, lbl.numberOfLines = 0; lbl.sizeToFit; but I'm still getting something like this: "Some text here\nAnd here I want new line" Thank you
