jQuery Draggable to Sortable list

Good day! I right now have a function the drags an element from a list to a sortable list. But what I want to achieve is to insert my own created html elements when i drag it to the sortable list and not to insert the elements selected from the draggable list. Appreciate you help in advance! Thanks, steamboy
