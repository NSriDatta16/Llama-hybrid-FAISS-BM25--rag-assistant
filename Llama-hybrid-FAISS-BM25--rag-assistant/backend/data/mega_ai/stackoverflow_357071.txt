Rails 2.0: Why not use sqlite3?

I've been reading some tutorials on how to get started using Rails 2.0. (Time out: genius website name idea conceived from a typo I just made: "tutoRAILS." Sorry, back to my question.) In most of the tutorials I've been reading, it seems to encourage using MySQL instead of sqlite3. Is there a reason for this, like, performance-wise or anything? I'm just testing out Rails on my PC using InstantRails at the moment, and they're nice enough to include MySQL in their setup, but I've been making my experimental applications using sqlite3. Am I missing some major caveat of sqlite3, or is this just a general preference that others have for MySQL?
