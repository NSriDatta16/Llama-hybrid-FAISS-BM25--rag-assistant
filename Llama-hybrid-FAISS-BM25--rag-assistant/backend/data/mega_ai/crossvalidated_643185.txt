The answer to your question is not immediately obvious (great question). In order to provide a response, and aiming for a complete and integrated answer, we first define the DDPM forward procedure, and subsequently discuss how its derivation reveals why the final target distribution is indeed a Gaussian distribution. We are reminded that for DDPM diffusion models, the forward procedure details a Markovian process for corrupting the data distribution $q(x_{t} \vert x_{t-1}) \: = \mathcal{N} \big( \: \sqrt{\smash[b]{\alpha_t}} \cdot x_{t-1} , \: (1 \: - \: \alpha_t) \cdot \mathcal{I} \: \big)$ whereby the $\smash[b]{\alpha_t}$ hyperparameter is defined as a function of another hyperparameter $\alpha_{t}=1-\beta_{t}$ . The algorithm adds step-wise deformations to the data distribution by injecting Gaussian noise at each time step. The solution to the analytical form of the final target distribution $x_{t=T}$ is found in a previous answer . $x_{t} \: = \: \sqrt{\smash[b]{\bar{\alpha_{t}}}} \cdot x_{0} \: + \: \sqrt{\smash[b]{1 \: - \: \bar{\alpha_{t}}}} \cdot \epsilon_{t}$ given by $\bar{\alpha_{t}} = \prod_{t=1}^T \: \alpha_{t}$ , and each noise random variable $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \mathcal{I})$ . It is the inspection of this derivation that reveals the use of a special property of Gaussian distributions: The sum of two Gaussian random variables is another Gaussian random variable, with the mean being the sum of the means and the variance being the sum of the variances. Since each noise addition step in the forward diffusion model is assumed to be Gaussian, this property ensures that, after multiple iterations, the overall distribution remains Gaussian. From the perspective of the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), each step of adding noise can be seen as adding an independent random variable to the system. When you apply many such noise addition steps (assuming they are independent and identically distributed), the result, according to the CLT, tends toward a Gaussian distribution. The following excerpts are taken from my book on variational inference. Learn more on the topic by visiting https://www.thevariationalbook.com/
