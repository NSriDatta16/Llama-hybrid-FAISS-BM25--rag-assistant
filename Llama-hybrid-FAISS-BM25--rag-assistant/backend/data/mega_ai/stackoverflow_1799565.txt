Change an image during animation using storyboard

I was looking for a way to change an Image during a storyboard, or more specifically, change the Source property of the image to point to a new image resource. There seems to be a StringAnimationUsingKeyFrames and a DiscreteStringKeyFrame but this does not work (as far as I can tell) since the Source property of the Image is of type ImageSource My current storyboard looks like this and the image Can I change the Source of the image as part of the storyboard or am I out of luck?
