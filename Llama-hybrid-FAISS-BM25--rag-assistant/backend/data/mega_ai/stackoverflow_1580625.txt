This site lists a way to connect to SSH through a USB connection: http://oss.coresecurity.com/iphonedbg/usb_tunnel_doc.htm It would be useful for a jailbroken iPhone. As for other possibilities I haven't looked into, iphuc might be able to do get you just the screenshot capability without requiring you to be jailbroken. You will probably need to sniff them while running the organizer.
