Estimate a probability that the mean of k values selected randomly w/o replacement from a known non-normal-distributed set is between `a` and `b`

The goal is to roughly estimate the probability that a sum/average of k randomly selected values without replacement, taken from a known set, will be within the range [a, b] So far the experiment was simulated and values were randomly selected thousands of times. This is highly inefficient. Is there any method that is fast?
