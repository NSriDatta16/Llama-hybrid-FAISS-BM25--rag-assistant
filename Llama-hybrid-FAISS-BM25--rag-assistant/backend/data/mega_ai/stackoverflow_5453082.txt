First you need to calculate the variance for the set. The variance is computed as the average squared deviation of each number from its mean. double variance(double[] population) { long n = 0; double mean = 0; double s = 0.0; for (double x : population) { n++; double delta = x – mean; mean += delta / n; s += delta * (x – mean); } // if you want to calculate std deviation return (s / n); } Once you have that you can choose x depending on your graph resolution compared to your value set spread and plug it in to the following equation to get y. protected double stdDeviation, variance, mean; public double getY(double x) { return Math.pow(Math.exp(-(((x - mean) * (x - mean)) / ((2 * variance)))), 1 / (stdDeviation * Math.sqrt(2 * Math.PI))); } To display the resulting set: say we take the population set you laid out and decide you want to show x=0 to x=2000 on a graph with an x resolution of 1000 pixels. Then you would plug in a loop (int x = 0; x
