Encrypt/Encoding an ID in URL string

Just trying to do some security on my website and trying to figure out the best route to secure an ID. EXAMPLE: http://localhost/page.php?id=90 TO: http://localhost/share/22349234987sdsdf9sdf87423498asf9 I am using HTACCESS to do the share part. But would like to hide the '90' and try to discourage anyone from just adding random numbers to try and receive a different response. Any thoughts on how to create something like this, or if something already exists that works well with implementation? Security is a factor, so just trying to find the best solution out there...
