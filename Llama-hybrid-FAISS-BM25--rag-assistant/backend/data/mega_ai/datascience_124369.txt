If you are looking to identify outliers in time series data with seasonal patterns, you can consider using the seasonal decomposition of time series (STL) method. STL decomposes a time series into three components: trend, seasonality, and residuals. The residuals represent the noise or irregular component of the time series. To identify outliers using STL, you can follow these steps: Decompose the time series into its components using the STL method. Calculate the residuals by subtracting the trend and seasonality components from the original time series. Calculate the z-score for each residual value. The z-score measures how many standard deviations an observation is from the mean. Outliers are typically defined as observations with a z-score greater than a certain threshold (e.g., 3 or 4). Identify the outliers based on the calculated z-scores. Here is an example code snippet in Python using the statsmodels library: import numpy as np import pandas as pd from statsmodels.tsa.seasonal import seasonal_decompose # Assuming your time series data is stored in a pandas DataFrame called 'data' with a column named 'value' # Assuming the time series has a frequency of 1 day # Decompose the time series decomposition = seasonal_decompose(data['value'], model='additive', period=365) # Get the residuals residuals = decomposition.resid # Calculate the z-scores z_scores = (residuals - np.mean(residuals)) / np.std(residuals) # Identify outliers outliers = data[np.abs(z_scores) > 3] # Print the outliers print(outliers) This code uses the seasonal_decompose function from the statsmodels library to decompose the time series into its components. Then, it calculates the z-scores for the residuals and identifies the outliers as the observations with z-scores greater than 3. Finally, it prints the outliers. You can adjust the threshold for identifying outliers by changing the value in the np.abs(z_scores) > 3 condition.
