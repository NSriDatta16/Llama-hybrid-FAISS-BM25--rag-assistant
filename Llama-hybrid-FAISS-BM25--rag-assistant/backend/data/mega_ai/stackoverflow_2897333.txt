What's the point of the javascript navigator.javaEnabled function?

The navigator object has a javaEnabled function that indicates if the browser has javascript support. This seems to be a little odd: If JS is indeed enabled the function will return true, well obviously. If JS is disabled it will return nothing > since it is never run, javaScript is disabled. I must be missing something here, or is it really that useless this function?
