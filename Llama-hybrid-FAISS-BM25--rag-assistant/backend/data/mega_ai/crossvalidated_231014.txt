A classic example would be a trimmed mean. For concreteness consider a 25% trimmed mean, where we average the middle half of the data. That's an L-estimator, but not an M-estimator. It can in a sense be approximated* by a Huber-type M-estimator but they're not the same. * (perhaps 'analogy' would be a better term than 'approximation' -- they might not always be very close together -- if the distribution is quite skew for example. In symmetric cases they're very alike.) While many L-estimators can also be M-estimators, there are a great many that aren't.
