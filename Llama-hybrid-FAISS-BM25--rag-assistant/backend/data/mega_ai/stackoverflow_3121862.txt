Eclipse Helios/Galileo Update sites cannot be accessed on Windows machine with IE7

When starting the update, the following error is displayed: Network connection problems encountered during search. Unable to access " http://download.eclipse.org/releases/helios ". Error accessing site stream. [Server returned HTTP response code: 503 for URL: http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd] Server returned HTTP response code: 503 for URL: http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd Error accessing site stream.

I was able to load the DTD by setting a different UserAgent for IE7 using %windir%\System32\cmd.exe /k %windir%\System32\reg.exe ADD "HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\5.0\User Agent" /v Version /d "Opera/9.2.1" /f I tried to -D overrides suggested at: Change user agent in Eclipse 3.5 for new software installations to no avail. I think eclipse does not follow the User-Agent set by IE7 ... Is there an other way to override the User-Agent for Eclipse? Thanks
