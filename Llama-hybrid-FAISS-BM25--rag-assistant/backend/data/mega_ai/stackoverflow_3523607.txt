A couple of things. Not sure that they are the cause of your problems, but still things to consider before submitting your homework. I don't think you are using wait correctly. According to http://linux.die.net/man/2/wait it doesn't take pid pointer as an argument. Each time around the loop you call malloc for token and token2 , but I don't see a corresponding release of the memory. You've writen a single monolithic function. Good coding practice would suggest breaking it out into a collection of subroutines Finally, and its possibly related to point 3, the following two lines of code appear twice in your code. Again it's not an error, but unnecessary duplication, and inelegant. printf("Please enter the first command: \n"); user_input = gets(line);
