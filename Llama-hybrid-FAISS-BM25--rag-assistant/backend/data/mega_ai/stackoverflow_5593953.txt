Resume after pressing 'Home' should start my Startactivity

I want my app to have a password-query. This should be displayed every time the app is started or resumed. So I have declared a Startactivity that shows a password prompt. If the user closes the App by pressing 'Back'-hardware Button some times everything is fine. But if the user pauses the app by pressing 'Home' the app opens in the activity displayed before without showing my prompt. 1)What is the best way to implement this as I want? Maybe doing something in OnStop() of each activity but this is called to often, not only when the app is closed by 'Home'. 2)Is there any other way to close the app so that my promt is not displayed? Where do I have to pay attention? Thanks and best regards, Till
