Sending arguments to an app-instance that resides in another process

I have a single-instance app (c#, WPF, .net3.51). The check if the app is already instantiated is done via a Mutex. If the app is already running, I open a new window from within the already opened app-instance. This works fine so far. However due to an app extension, I now must send the e.Args (or at least the first string of it) to the already running instance which resides in another process. How is this best done? Additional Information Currently I use a globaly registered Window-message that I send to all open apps via PostMessage (HWND_BROADCAST). My app looks for this message and opens a new window, if this message is received. An Idea would be to set a param of PostMessage. However I found a lot of bewildering information on this topic, therefore I had not the courage to go this way. Besides of that I thought of replacing the global PostMessage-call through another activation logic, since the global call seems to have some unlovely side-effects.
