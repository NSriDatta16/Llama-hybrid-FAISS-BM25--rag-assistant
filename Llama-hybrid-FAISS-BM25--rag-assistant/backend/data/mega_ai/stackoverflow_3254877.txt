English Sentence to Camel-cased method name

I had to convert a series of sentences into camel-cased method names. I ended writing something for it. I am still curious if there's something simpler for it. Given the string a = "This is a test." output thisIsATest I used for following: a.downcase.gsub(/\s\w/){|b| b[-1,1].upcase }
