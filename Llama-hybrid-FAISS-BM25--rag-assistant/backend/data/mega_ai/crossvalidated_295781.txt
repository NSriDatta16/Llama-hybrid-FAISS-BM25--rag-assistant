Using logistic regression to infer relative importance of features

I need to ascertain what features drive users to submit more bids for items in my auction website. I have a dataset where # of bids is the dependent variable, and there's several measurements of features in other columns. Some of these columns would be highly correlated to driving # of bids. I'm planning on running a logistic regression on this data set. I'll classify the # of bids columns as high or low depending on whether bids attracted were above median or below median. My question is simply this: is running logistic regression in a scenario like this correct? OR is logistic regression ill-suited for measurements of this sort (in which case, another question would be what's a better technique to use).
