This is a matter of configuration. The SMTP server has to be configured to act as a gateway, which means it'll forward email to the SMTP server registered for the destination domain. Typically, an organization's SMTP server will only act as a gateway for users connecting from the inside of the network, or who authenticate as members of the organization. You can also set up an SMTP server under IIS and configure it to act as a gateway. Then you'd send all mail to localhost, and it would do the rest. Talk to your sysadmin.
