nHibernate storage of an object with self referencing many children and many parents

I have an object called MyItem that references children in the same item. How do I set up an nhibernate mapping file to store this item? public class MyItem { public virtual string Id {get;set;} public virtual string Name {get;set;} public virtual string Version {get;set;} public virtual IList Children {get;set;} } So roughly the hbm.xml would be: This wouldn't work I don't think. Perhaps I need to create another class, say MyItemChildren and use that as the Children member and then do the mapping in that class? This would mean having two tables. One table holds the MyItem and the other table holds references from my item. NOTE: A child item could have many parents.
