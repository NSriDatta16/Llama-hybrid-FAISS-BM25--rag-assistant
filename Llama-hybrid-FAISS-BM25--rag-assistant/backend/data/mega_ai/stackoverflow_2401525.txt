UIScrollView with UIWebViews

There seem to be many questions asked about this subject here on stackoverflow, but none of them touch on the updates made in 3.0. After mucking around for hours on end I finally found out, that nested scroll views (in my case web views inside a scroll view) are fully supported, however the example given at http://developer.apple.com/iphone/library/documentation/WindowsViews/Conceptual/UIScrollView_pg/Introduction/Introduction.html is pretty basic. I have a main scroll view with paging enabled, with web views laid out as subviews, so that I can page left and right changing different web views, but also scroll up and down inside the subviews. In essence this seems to work fine, however what I can't figure out is how to stop the parent scroll view from paging left or right once the user has already started scrolling the web view. Essentially I'd like to lock the scrolling to whichever direction it started with. Funnily enough, this works fine if I start paging first, but if I start scrolling up or down first it also lets page at the same time (during the same began-moved-ended cycle). The stocks app for example locks the scrolling properly.
