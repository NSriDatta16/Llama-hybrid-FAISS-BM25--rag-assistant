Why does my contentEditable element become draggable/resizable in Firefox?

I'll be answering this question To my great surprise, I discovered that, after using JavaScript to apply a class to an element and make it contentEditable, the element suddenly gained draggable and resizable UI elements. This only occurs in Firefox. Why does this happen and how can I fix it?
