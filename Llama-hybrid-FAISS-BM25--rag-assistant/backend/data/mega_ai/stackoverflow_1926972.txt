add text to UITextField at desired location

I am quite new to iphone development. I have a situation here. I have some labels which can be dragged across the screen. When any of these labels are dragged to some textfield and released over a textfields UIlabel test is assigned to that text field. Now the problem is this I want to assign the text of UILabel to some specific position in textfield according to release of textfield i.e If user releases at the beginning of text field then it should be appended at the beginning and if somewhere near end of text of textfield then it should be appendended at the end. Can you help me to fabricate this condition. Thanx in advance
