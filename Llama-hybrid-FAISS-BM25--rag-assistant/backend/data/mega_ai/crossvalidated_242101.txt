VAR models in R: Constant, Trend, Constant+Trend, None

I currently apply a VAR models with the vars package in R. There are the options to select "both" , "none" , "trend" , or "constant" . I searched a little but I didn't find conclusive evidence to know what "const" exactly means. I found this plot and I'm curious, whether "const" means "cycle", also sometimes described as "drift"? "trend" should be clear as a time series that is trending up- or downwards is trending. I assume most economic time series to be either constant+trend or constant?
