Just to add evidence to what SoftDeveloper says. In the area of low value software, protection is counterproductive. Likewise for high volume. However, our money-earner is a product that sells for £10-25K per user license. The vast majority of our consumer base is very careful to be compliant - large corporations - and for some of these we have sold unlimited unprotected products. However, we have had evidence in the past that when used by smaller companies for short-term use attempts have been made to break the protection. When you stand to lose £100K+ per incident, you must at least discourage that. In the past we have used SuperPro but that product is weak and obsolete now. For our latest product we are still evaluating, but Sentinel/Aladdin ( http://www.safenet-inc.com/sentinelhasp/ ), SecuTech Unikey ( http://www.esecutech.com/Software-Protection/UniKey-Family/UniKey-Drive/UniKey-Drive-Overview.html ) and KeyLok Fortress ( http://www.keylok.com ) are among the subset selected. One thing we are doing is allowing extreme flexibility in the model. That way when marketing comes up with the next bright idea, we will be ready. Also, ensuring extremely robust and informative license control is vital too. Protection shouldn't mean a bad customer experience (although it often can!).
