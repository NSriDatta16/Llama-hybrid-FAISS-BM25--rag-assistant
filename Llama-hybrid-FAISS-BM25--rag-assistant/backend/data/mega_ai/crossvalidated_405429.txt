Uncertainty in Linear Regression Coefficients

Suppose I do linear regression for data $y \in \mathbb{R}^n$ and design matrix $X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times m}$ , with $n \gg m$ . I seek $$ \hat{\beta} = \operatorname*{argmin}_{\beta \in \mathbb{R}^m} \| X\beta - y \|_2. $$ What are the ways to quantify uncertainty in $\hat{\beta}$ ? I considered bootstrap and maybe a Bayesian estimator that may give a prior with closed form expression for the variance of $\beta$ . What are other approaches? References are appreciated but a full derivation (with intuition) would be ideal. Full derivation: Proof that the coefficients in an OLS model follow a t-distribution with (n-k) degrees of freedom
