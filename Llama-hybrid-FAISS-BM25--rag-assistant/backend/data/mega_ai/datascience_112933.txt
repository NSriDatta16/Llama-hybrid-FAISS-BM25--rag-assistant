Absolutely nothing. A PCA decomposition maps the original variables into new dimensions which capture the highest amount of variability. Note that the directionality of these dimensions is completely irrelevant - given a dimension that captures some amount of variability, the negation of that dimension also captures the exact same amount of variability. Because of this, the positive/negative direction of a PCA dimension may be arbitrarily chosen. Different software packages may produce different results depending on how they are coded, and slight variations in the input data could also result in a near-identical but flipped PCA plot.
