How many time series is it logical to model using VAR (in R)

I have weekly sales for around 6000 products , for which I would like to obtain forecasts for n periods. I believe that estimate forecasts for all 6000 products is too much, so i thought about aggregating the products in certain categories/clusters (based on some rules). I end up with around 50 products (or more correct groups/clusters of products ), for which again I want forecasts for n periods. My question is, are 50 products again too many for a VAR model ? I am planning on using the vars package in R Or maybe it would be a better idea to estimate 50 VAR models (because 50 is the groups/clusters of products ), with the logic that since the products in each group are similar, then the sales of a product will affect the sales of a product (in the same category)
