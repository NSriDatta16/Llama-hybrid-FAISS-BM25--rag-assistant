Wordpress problem

Just recently, my client's blog http://robertnogueira.com/ encountered a bug. If you look at the site the footer has been displaced. It's been running fine until I tried to populate the posts for the 6th time with caff content. It got broke and I don't know how to fix it. I chose to ask help here because the folks here usually responds to my question unlike the wordpress forums. Please help me figure this out, I do this for a living. :(
