How does one test a test ? Mutation testing is a valuable technique that I have personally used to surprisingly good effect. Read the linked article for more details, and links to even more academic references, but in general it "tests your tests" by modifying your source code (changing "x += 1" to "x -= 1" for example) and then rerunning your tests, ensuring that at least one test fails. Any mutations that don't cause test failures are flagged for later investigation. You'd be surprised at how you can have 100% line and branch coverage with a set of tests that look comprehensive, and yet you can fundamentally change or even comment out a line in your source without any of the tests complaining. Often this comes down to not testing with the right inputs to cover all boundary cases, sometimes it's more subtle, but in all cases I was impressed with how much came out of it.
