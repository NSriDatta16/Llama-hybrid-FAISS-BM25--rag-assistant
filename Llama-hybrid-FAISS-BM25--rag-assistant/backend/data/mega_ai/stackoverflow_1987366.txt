The biggest problem I've found is that you seem to be required to drag and drop database tables onto a designer, and it's not easy to access the dbml text directly. There have been many times I've added a column to a table and wanted to update it, only to have to delete the table from the designer, re-add it, and remap any custom associations I've done. If someone can tell me how to easily get at the dbml text, I'd love to hear how to do this. Another thing that bugs me is if I get a "string or binary data may be truncated" error, I can't tell which column caused the error, making me play a trial and error game.
