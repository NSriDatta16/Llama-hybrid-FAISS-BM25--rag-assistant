How to code Microsoft Excel "Shift Cells Up" feature in SQL

Take a simple table like below: Column Headings: || Agent's Name || Time Logged In || Center || Row 1: Andrew || 12:30 PM || Home Base Row 2: Jeff || 7:00 AM || Virtual Base Row 3: Ryan || 6:30 PM || Test Base Now lets say that a single cell is deleted so the table now looks like this: Column Headings: || Agent's Name || Time Logged In || Center || Row 1: Andrew || 12:30 PM || Row 2: Jeff || 7:00 AM || Virtual Base Row 3: Ryan || 6:30 PM || Test Base Notice that "Home Base" is missing. Now in excel you can delete the cell and shift the rest so the finished product looks like below: Column Headings: || Agent's Name || Time Logged In || Center || Row 1: Andrew || 12:30 PM || Virtual Base Row 2: Jeff || 7:00 AM || Test Base Row 3: Ryan || 6:30 PM || And you can see we are left with a blank cell last row. How do I code this procedure of shifting the cells up in SQL? I've been struggling on this problem for weeks! Thank you!
