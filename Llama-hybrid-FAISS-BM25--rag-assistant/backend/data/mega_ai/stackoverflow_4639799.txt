Libxml in a library for ios

I have created a cocoa touch static library that contains functionality that I want to include in several apps. This library is linked to libxml and I have the header search path /usr/include/libxml2. The library builds correctly. I include this library in another xcode project as a reference (by dragging the library xcodeproj file into my app xcode project. I also setup the target to have the library as a direct dependency, setup the header search path to include /usr/include/libxml2, and add libxml2.dylib in the frameworks. The problem is, when I try to build the project is has a build error: Libxml/tree.h: No such file or directory. I initially had this problem trying to build the library and solved it by adding the header search path and framework into the project for libxml2. Incidentally, i have another app that uses the library but does not use libxml, it builds and runs correctly. So the problem seems to be using libxml in both the app and a linked library. Anybody any ideas? Yours hopefully, Neil.
