From Wikipedia , as good an answer as any. A typical vector implementation consists, internally, of a pointer to a dynamically allocated array,[2] and possibly data members holding the capacity and size of the vector. The size of the vector refers to the actual number of elements, while the capacity refers to the size of the internal array. When new elements are inserted, if the new size of the vector becomes larger than its capacity, reallocation occurs.[2][4] This typically causes the vector to allocate a new region of storage, move the previously held elements to the new region of storage, and free the old region. Because the addresses of the elements change during this process, any references or iterators to elements in the vector become invalidated.[5] Using an invalidated reference causes undefined behaviour
