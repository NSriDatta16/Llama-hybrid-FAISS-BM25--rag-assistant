Okay, first off, what you have posted here is not what you are using, or you have made modifications to InternetImage you have not mentioned, since InternetImage does not respond to initWithUrl:object:. You also have not included the code to the delegate method internetImageReady:. I understand that it is not being called when something goes wrong, but it is called once you start scrolling, and having the contrast of what happens in the correct case will help people diagnose your issue. Also, it is not entirely clear from your description what happens when you scroll. Clearly subsequent calls work, but do all the previously attempted connections suddenly start at that point, or are they completely lost? As for what is going on, well for the reasons above I don't believe anyone can do more than give you some guesses. If I had to wager guess that if what I said in the last paragraph is happening then your issue is that (for whatever reason) the main threads runloop is not processing the NSURLConnections events until something primes the pump. This could be for a number of reasons, for instance the runloop being in the wrong mode. You could try running the NSRunLoop manually, or changing to InternetImage to explicitly set runloop, or manually starting the download. Two quick asides InternetImage appears to do a lot of things that are idiomatically inconsistent with general Cocoa programming conventions. At least for me that makes it harder to read quickly and I am not entirely sure it is doing things correctly. Don't use _imageScaledToSize:. That is a private Apple method and if they notice that you are using it that may result in a rejection.
