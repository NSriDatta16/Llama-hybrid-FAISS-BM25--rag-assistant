This is an anomaly caused by your use of a discontinuous improper accuracy scoring rule. Use an efficient non-arbitrary scoring rule that is designed for this case, related to log-likelihood or the Brier score. No good measure of predictive discrimination would make things better by deleting data. Your sample size of just over 5000 is likely too small for split sample validation to work, because splitting again would result in different predictions and accuracy. You might consider the optimism bootstrap to bias (overfitting) correct the apparent accuracy such as Brier score. In terms of the sample, get the largest sample you can and let the ratio of positives to negatives reflect the prevalence of the population to which you want to apply the predictions. The logistic regression model and other probability estimators can ultimately be used to classify, if needed, once you specify the loss/cost/utility function. Probability estimators also give you something quite magic: intermediate probabilities for which you might "punt" and not classify the observations.
