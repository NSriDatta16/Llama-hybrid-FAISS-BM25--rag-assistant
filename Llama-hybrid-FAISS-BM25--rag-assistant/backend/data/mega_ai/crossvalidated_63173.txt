Here are the estimates from the above post again for reference: Estimate MCMCmean HPD95lower HPD95upper pMCMC Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 6.1372 6.1367 6.0418 6.2299 0.0005 0.0000 groupB -0.0614 -0.0602 -0.1941 0.0706 0.3820 0.3880 condition2 0.1150 0.1151 0.0800 0.1497 0.0005 0.0000 condition3 0.1000 0.1004 0.0633 0.1337 0.0005 0.0000 groupB:condition2 -0.1055 -0.1058 -0.1583 -0.0610 0.0005 0.0000 groupB:condition3 -0.0609 -0.0612 -0.1134 -0.0150 0.0170 0.0148 First, let's understand what the estimates mean. Note that the variables are all dummy variables (1 if "true", 0 otherwise). Intercept is the expected value for group A in condition 1 - this is because it's the combination that is omitted; all other combinations can be "reached" with a combination of several of the available coefficients. For example, if we wanted the expectation of group A condition 2, we would use Intercept+condition2. Condition2 is $E[gA,c2]-E[gA,c1]$, so we add this to the Intercept: $E[gA,c2]-E[gA,c1]+Intercept=E[gA,c2]$ (because $Intercept=E[gA,c1]$). Now we want the expected value of GroupB/Cond2. What we need to do is to add everything that takes value 1 in observations of this combination. The intercept is always 1, groupB and condition2 is 1 (because both are part of the combination we want), and because both of these are 1 simultaneously, so is the interaction groupB:condition2 (easier to see if written as groupB*condition2 - this is 1 if and only if both factors are 1). Now we just need to add all those coefficients, and we arrive at $$E[gB,c2]=6.1372-0.0614+0.115-0.1055=6.0853,$$ exactly as in the table. You didn't arrive there because you neglected condition2 in your calculation. All coefficients except for the Intercept are relative to some reference category. condition2 is the effect in group A relative to gA/c1, and groupB:condition2 is the effect of condition 2 on group B relative to the effect of condition 2 on group A. So to get from gA/c1 to gB/c2, you need to add to the Intercept condition 2 to get $E[gA,c2]$; then you add both groupB and the interaction simultaneously, because you basically switch two things at once: group and the way condition2 affects the expectation (this effect differs by group).
