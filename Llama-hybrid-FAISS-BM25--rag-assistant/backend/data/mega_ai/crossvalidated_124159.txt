If you already have a BS in mathematics and you want to analyze data in the field, then an MS in statistics will do much more than a second math degree. Only statistics, biostat, and OR (not so sure) teach the underlying statistical assumptions for statistics problems. Statistics already teaches more math than you need for analyzing data, e.g., measure theory and large sample theory. Also, Statistical Machine Learning is firmly in the statistics field. These are the tools in ML that we use to analyze data. The other tools are for managing data.
