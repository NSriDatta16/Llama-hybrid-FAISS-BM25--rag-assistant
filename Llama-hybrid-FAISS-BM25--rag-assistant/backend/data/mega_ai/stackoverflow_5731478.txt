if you create a war file called images.war and place it in your webapps/ROOT directory then this will automatically be mapped onto the context path images (based on the war file name). So you can do it this way. Make sure you also include a deployment descriptor ( web.xml ) -- details here: http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/E13222_01/wls/docs81/webapp/web_xml.html Sorry you are spot on with your comment -- serves me right for not paying attention! It is indeed the webapps directory and not webapps/ROOT as I copied and pasted above.
