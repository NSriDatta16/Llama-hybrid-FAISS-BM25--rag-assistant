Your thinking is not bad, as a certain degree of experience with Key Performance Indicators allows me to conclude. As a clarification, in your $CR$ , you count the longest streak of target-achievements, not the longest streak in general (which is reasonable). But I would suggest a different way to compute your final Consistency Index, since in order to have a meaningful average, one needs to sum similar in nature/meaning/content things -and your $AR$ and $CR$ certainly describe different aspects of the situation. What you could do is to "penalize" the achievement ratio by using multiplicatively the consistency ratio, in order to obtain your target-consistency Index: $$CI = AR \times CR$$ So the first level of target achievement, $AR$ , is adjusted downwards by the degree of consistency, $CR$ . This approach is a bit aggressive, since it penalizes more heavily discrepancies between $AR$ and $CR$ . For example, for a period of length $T$ , for $AR = CR = 4$ we get $CI = 16/T^2$ , while for $AR = 5$ , $CR = 3$ we get $CI = 15/T^2$ , while your arithmetic average would here be the same. But there is no meaningful sense in which "one target achievement less is exactly offset by an achievement streak longer by one". And if further you had $AR = 6$ , $CR = 2$ you would get $CI = 12/T^2$ , even lower. So in the multiplicative approach the person who achieved the target 5 times gets a lower CI than the person who achieved the target only 4 times, because the second had a longer streak. And the person that achieved the target 6 times with a best streak of 2, is scored even lower. In other words the multiplicative approach does put a lot of weight in the consistency aspect, justifying the name of the final Index. It sends the signal "it's not enough to achieve targets; you have to do it in a consistently" -perhaps because increased consistency means less uncertainty.
