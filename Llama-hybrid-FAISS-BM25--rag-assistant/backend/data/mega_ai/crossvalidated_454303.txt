Reference on local false discovery rates

I am looking for a reference on local false discovery rates. I'm familiar with FDR and the Benjamin-Hochberg procedure, but am getting lost when it comes to the Bayesian local false discovery rate stuff. A reference with mathematical details would be very appreciated.
