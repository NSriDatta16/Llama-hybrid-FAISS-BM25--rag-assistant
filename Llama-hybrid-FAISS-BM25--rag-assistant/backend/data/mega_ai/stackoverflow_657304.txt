I'd say it depends on what you want to hire them for, and what their purpose in your organization will be. Somebody who understands C++ but not C (which is easy to do, nowadays), will fall into this type of category. They can, potentially, be a fine employee. However, I would say this is a warning, so depending on their resume, this would be one mark against them in my book. However, if they are going to be working on fairly straightforward projects, and not be required to design and develop critical parts of your code base (at least early on), they might be fine. I would not, however, hire somebody to do design or to work on critical systems who did not understand the basic concepts like this one. Any developer I hire who will be working on C++ projects at a high level needs to understand memory management, basic concepts of C and C++, templates and generic programming, and all of the fundamentals, at least to a reasonable degree, of the language they will be using. Not understanding the concepts of how string literals work would be a big disadvantage - even if they will be using std::string or the like, I want them to understand how it works underneath, at least to some degree, and also the other options out there. Understanding the concepts helps to understand the rationale behind the newer, nicer technologies, but also to understand the compromises being made when they are used. It also helps to understand the design decisions made there, and apply them to your own projects.
