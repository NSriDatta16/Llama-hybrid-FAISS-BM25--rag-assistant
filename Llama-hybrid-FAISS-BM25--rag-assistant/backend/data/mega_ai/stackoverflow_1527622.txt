I do not think that the sort-order has conceptually anything to do with indices. AFAIK it is part of ANSI-SQL, but is mostly ignored by most RDBMSs (like Oracle). This seems to be the case for older versions of SQLite as well (from the SQLite documentation): Each column name can be followed by one of the "ASC" or "DESC" keywords to indicate sort order. The sort order may or may not be ignored depending on the database file format. The "legacy" file format ignores index sort order. At least according to the documentation, the index-info pragma does not help you in determining the sort order within the index. So it looks as if you are out of luck ...
