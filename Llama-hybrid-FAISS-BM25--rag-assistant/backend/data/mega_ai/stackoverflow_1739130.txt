You may want to keep an eye on ABSE ( http://www.abse.info ). ABSE is a code-generation and model-driven software development methodology that is completely agnostic in terms of platform and language, so you wouldn't have any trouble creating your own generators for C# and anything else you wish. The big plus is that you can generate code exactly the way you want. The downside is that you may have more work to do at first to build your templates. ABSE allows you to capture your domain knowledge into "Atoms", which are basically fragments of larger models you can build. ABSE is both declarative and executable. The model is able to generate code by your specification and incorporate custom code at the model level. Unfortunately, ABSE is still work in progress and an Integrated Development Environment (named AtomWeaver) is still in the making. Anyway a CTP release of the generator is scheduled for January 2010, so we're already close to it.
