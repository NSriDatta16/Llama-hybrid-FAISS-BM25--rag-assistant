Is Reinforcement learning a viable approach to sample high dimensional parameter space efficiently?

I would like to efficiently search through a five dimensional parameter space within a given computation time to search for astronomical sources. The search is currently limited only by processing time. I would like to know if Reinforcement learning (RL) is the right framework to find the optimum policy to traverse through this parameter space to maximize rewards? P.S. Reward in this context means finding regions that are most likely to find astronomical sources of interest.
