important feature selection using dimensionality reduction algorithms

I have a dataset having more than 25000 features. I did perform noise removal using the histogram approach, and this dataset gets reduced to more than 5000 features. There are two classes, healthy and infected. I want to extract important features where the separation is maximum between these two classes. After noise removal, most of the features have NaN. PCA doesn't handle the data set with missing values. Any suggestions are appreciated. Thank you so much for your attention and participation.
