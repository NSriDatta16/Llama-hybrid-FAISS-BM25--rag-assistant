You want a reason the current Java doesn't support it. I can only say that Java typically takes little steps wherever possible. I would guess that there was some little technical glitch that they weren't sure about getting "Right" before Java 7--probably something to do with being absolutely certain it wouldn't create an ambiguous case in some older or non-generic code. Notice how Robert pointed out that the syntax will be this: List strings = new ArrayList<>(); Notice the empty <>? I'm guessing that's to disambiguate this type of inference from older non-generic code; it's probably just something they didn't think of at first.
