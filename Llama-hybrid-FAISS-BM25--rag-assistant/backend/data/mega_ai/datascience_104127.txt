Does this ARIMA model take seasonality into account?

I'm writing a tutorial on traditional time series forecasting models. One key issue with ARIMA models is that they cannot model seasonal data. So, I wanted to get some seasonal data and show that the model cannot handle it. However, it seems to model the seasonality quite easily - it peaks every 4 quarters as per the original data. What is going on? Code to reproduce the plot from statsmodels.datasets import get_rdataset from statsmodels.tsa.arima.model import ARIMA import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import seaborn as sns sns.set() # Get data uk = get_rdataset('UKNonDurables', 'AER') uk = uk.data uk_pre1980 = uk[uk.time
