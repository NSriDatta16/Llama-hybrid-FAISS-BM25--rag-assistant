Is it sensible to use the ROC curve with an KNN model? And if so why?

I am a beginner doing my first ML project. I am doing a binary supervised classification on an unbalanced dataset and want to use the ROC curve as a performance metric of my models. I am using Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine and K Nearest Neighbors as classifiers. For Logistic Regression I understand what the ROC Curve is and how the threshold could be adjusted. When predicting the probabilities for K Nearest Neighbours however I don't understand where the ROC Curve comes in handy, as the threshold can not be varied anyways. So is there a reason to still implement a ROC Curve for K Nearest Neigbors?
