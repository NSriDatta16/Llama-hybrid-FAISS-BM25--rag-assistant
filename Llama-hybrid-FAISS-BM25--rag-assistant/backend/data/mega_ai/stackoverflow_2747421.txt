This work should be done in the view. You say that feels wrong but that's exactly what the view is meant to do: retrieve the data that is going to be presented to the user. Take a look at the Django FAQ: http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/faq/general/#django-appears-to-be-a-mvc-framework-but-you-call-the-controller-the-view-and-the-view-the-template-how-come-you-don-t-use-the-standard-names Django appears to be a MVC framework, but you call the Controller the “view”, and the View the “template”. How come you don’t use the standard names? In our interpretation of MVC, the “view” describes the data that gets presented to the user. It’s not necessarily how the data looks, but which data is presented. The view describes which data you see, not how you see it. It’s a subtle distinction. A side point to this is that based on how you are using the average in your template it would probably make more sense to use annotate rather than aggregate . http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.1/ref/models/querysets/#annotate-args-kwargs
