If you had some real data, then you could leverage GMMs or Generative AI models to create synthetic data to mimic your data. If you don't have any real data, then could go for declarative approaches, but it would be difficult to achieve real data value from it. If you have some idea of the type of data and properties (e.g., range, distributions, etc) you want to generate, take a look at the Synner project , it looks promising. If you eventually get some real data (or another real dataset that somewhat matches your requirements -- even if it is from another domain), then have a look at the ydata-synthetic project to create synthetic data.
