How can I extract an array from an executable file?

I want to do the inverse of this question . I am embedding a file into an executable as an array, and I would later like to extract the embedded file from the executable. It seems like objcopy might be useful here but I haven't figured out the proper incantation yet. (Edit: clarify question, I somehow removed the crux of it in editing originally...)
