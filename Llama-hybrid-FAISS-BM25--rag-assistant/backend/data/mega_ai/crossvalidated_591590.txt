Random Forest Models for Time Series and Cross Validation

If one were to build a model using a random forest model that uses lagged variables, for simplicity we'll describe this just using a single feature describing lag 1: $x_{t-1}$ . Which attempts to predict $x_{t}$ Will this model still be subject to standard time series CV rules? I believe the feature vector from one instance to another will be independant and therefore a forecast of rolling origin isn't required and standard K-Fold can apply? Is there any issues that can arise from not doing a rolling origin CV under this context?
