All variables are stored "in memory", no matter their storage type (static, automatic, free store), location (stack or heap), linkage or scope. A variable is static only if it's declared static. Otherwise, variables in class methods, whether parameters or local variables, have function or local scope, automatic storage, no linkage and are stored on the stack. Class methods have global scope and external linkage, though you can send a message to an object (including classes) even if there isn't a handler in scope. Internal linkage should be possible, but I don't think the language supports declaring methods with internal linkage. Storage type and location doesn't really apply to methods, but you could say methods have static storage.
