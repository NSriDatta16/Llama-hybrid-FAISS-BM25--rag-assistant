How to user Frames with ASP.NET 2.0 / OR AJAX?

I would like to use a flash menu in Asp.net 2.0. However, I have two problems: How do I keep the menu static so the animations do not refresh with page clicks? Example would be like a 'frames' but within ASP.NET 2.0... Do I use the old HTML Iframes approach?? Or can I use something more contemporary using AJAX or something like that? This one stumps me... Should I user custom controls or AJAX ?? Among other things, I'd like to change the menu swf based on security role of user in ASP.net 2.0, so I would need to pass variables to Flex / Flash application. I have resolved to do this with SWFOBject (for embedding Flash) but if there is another way / easier or more standard please let me know... Thanks for your help! Craig
