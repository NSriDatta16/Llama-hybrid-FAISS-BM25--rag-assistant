As Jon Robertson stated in his answer Delphi 6 should work under Windows 7 64-bit. But I would highly recommend to use the Windows 7 Professional edition which comes with XP Mode support. So you get a Windows XP virtual machine. With the free VMware Player you can convert this Virtual PC VM and use it with the VMware Player which provides better performance than the XP Mode. To work with Delphi in a VM gives you several benefits. So it's very easy to backup your development system and you can easily transfer it to another machine. Another big advantage is, that you can avoid component version conflicts between your products or product versions, if you use separate VMs.
