Averaging SVM and GLM results: sensible or stupid?

I have taken two different approaches to calculate probability: using a GLM and an SVM. They are giving slightly different results (which is understandable, they are completely different approaches). Both methods are proving to be generally accurate though and doing a similar job with predictions. Given that it's hard to pick which method is better, I was just wondering if there would be any value in averaging the two results eg if item A has probably 0.65 of occurring according to SVM and 0.71 according to GLM, then take 0.68 as the probability. Does this sound ok - getting the benefit of both a frequentist approach and a ML approach? Or is it just bad stats with no real basis?
