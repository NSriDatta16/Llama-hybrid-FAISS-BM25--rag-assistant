Your question can really only be answered in two parts. Part one is how to construct a request to any web service...which is what the answer at Consume WCF Web Service using Objective-C on iPhone will show you. The second part is SharePoint related - their web services requires you to construct chunks of XML that are passed as parameters, and the XML you pass in is in a format that Microsoft specifies. For example, Lists.UpdateList method (at http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/lists.lists.updatelist ) requires 6 parameters, 4 of which are XML fragments -- which will need to be encoded and escaped. (SharePoint's web services are difficult to deal with on any platform and I would expect it to be doubly so from iPhone).
