Early stopping for F-score

I'm working on a Relation Extraction Task that has Train/Dev/Test Dataset. The performance is measured by F-score (MicroAverage without Non-entity-relation class). I'm computing a Neural Network for this end, and I have to find the best epoch via early stopping criterion in the Dev set for training a good model. I see in many works that are computed by loss or accuracy independently, but in this task accuracy is not a good metric. My question is, which is the best metric to find the optimal epoch, the error computed by the loss function, the accuracy or directly the F-measure?
