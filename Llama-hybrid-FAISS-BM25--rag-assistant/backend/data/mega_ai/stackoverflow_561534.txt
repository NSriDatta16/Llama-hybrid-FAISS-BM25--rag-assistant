Base64 takes 4 bytes/characters to encode 3 bytes and can only encode multiples of 3 bytes (and adds padding otherwise). So representing 4 bytes (your average int) in Base64 would take 8 bytes. Encoding the same 4 bytes in hex would also take 8 bytes. So you wouldn't gain anything for a single int.
