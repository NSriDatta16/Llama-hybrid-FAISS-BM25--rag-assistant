Insert port traffic into SQL table

I'm working on a project where a hardware device will be sending small chunks of text data (around every 5 seconds) to a port on the Windows 2003 server. I need to capture that data and insert it into SQL server for later retrieval, display, analysis etc. Obviously I need something to monitor the port for the incoming traffic, and then some way to run an INSERT using it. I'm an advanced asp.net and sql developer, but this is a little beyond that scope.
