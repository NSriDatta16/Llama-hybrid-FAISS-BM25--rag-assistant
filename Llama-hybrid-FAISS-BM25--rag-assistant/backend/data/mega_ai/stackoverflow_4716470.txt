WebClient.DownloadString() returns string with peculiar characters

I have an issue with some content that we are downloading from the web for a screen scraping tool that I am building. in the code below, the string returned from the web client download string method returns some odd characters for the source download for a few (not all) web sites. I have recently added http headers as below. Previously the same code was called without the headers to the same effect. I have not tried variations on the 'Accept-Charset' header, I don't know much about text encoding other than the basics. The characters, or character sequences that I refer to are: " ï»¿ " and " Â " These characters are not seen when you use "view source" in a web browser. What could be causing this and how can I rectify the problem? string urlData = String.Empty; WebClient wc = new WebClient(); // Add headers to impersonate a web browser. Some web sites // will not respond correctly without these headers wc.Headers.Add("User-Agent", "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-GB; rv:1.9.2.12) Gecko/20101026 Firefox/3.6.12"); wc.Headers.Add("Accept", "*/*"); wc.Headers.Add("Accept-Language", "en-gb,en;q=0.5"); wc.Headers.Add("Accept-Charset", "ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7"); urlData = wc.DownloadString(uri);
