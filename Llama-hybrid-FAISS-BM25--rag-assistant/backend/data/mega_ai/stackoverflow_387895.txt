ADO.NET DataService: Passing parameter to [WebInvoke] Method

Consider following example : public class SomeBusinessLayerService : DataService { [WebInvoke] void DoSomething(string someParam) { } } I can not find example or any help on how can I pass parameter to the function! Using WebClient (or goofinfg around with fiddler) I can trigger the function call, but no matter what I try the parameter someParam is always null What's worse - if I change the type to int - all my attempts end in following error: Bad Request - Error in query syntax. Can anyone please help with working example of POST content on how I can call it ? NOTE: This is DataService, and not WCF service. I can get it working with WCF service same method without any problems. EDIT: Also I need example of POST and not embedding parameter in URI because URI has size limit and requirement to sanitize the string.
