[Disclaimer: I'm on the Akka team] I really encourage you to take a good look at the Scala framework Akka We really strive to provide a platform that scales horizontally AND vertically, and that embraces failure to enable self-healing systems. Features: Actors for concurrency Software Transactional Memory (STM) for concurrent transactional composition Supervisor hierarchies for fault-tolerance Cluster Membership Java API with ActiveObjects (Java Actors sort of) Distributed persistence through MongoDB, Cassandra or Redis REST support through exposing Actors as JAX-RS endpoints + (Comet/Ajax Push) + much much more Hope to see you on the mailing list soon!
