In fact, a variable is tuple (storage, scope, type, address, value): storage : where is it stored, for example data, stack, heap... scope : who can see us, for example global, local... type : what is our type, for example int, int*... address : where are we located value : what is our value Local scope could mean local to either the translational unit (source file), the function or the block depending on where its defined. To make variable visible to more than one function, it definitely has to be in either DATA or the BSS area (depending on whether its initialized explicitly or not, respectively). Its then scoped accordingly to either all function(s) or function(s) within source file.
