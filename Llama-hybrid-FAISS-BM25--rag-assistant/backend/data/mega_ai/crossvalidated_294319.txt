How do I obtain the confidence of a prediction from a neural network in matlab?

I have trained a neural network and am getting the accuracies in the end, but how do I go about getting the confidence in each prediction? The neural network is being used for classification, so I want to know how confident the neural network is that a certain input yields a certain output. So how do I get how confident the neural network is that a certain data point should be classified as 1 or 0? My neural network currently outputs values between 0 and 1, but they are not always rounded. So for example if one output is .6, then that rounds up to 1 but how do I obtain a confidence value from that? In order to see which points the nn was unconfident on, I set a threshold such that I removed the data for which the neural network predicted between .4 and .6, since .5 is the middle and it could go either way to 1 or 0. If the nn predicted .5 then it is really unsure as to whether or not the data should be classified as 1 or 0 so this threshold removed those unconfident predictions
