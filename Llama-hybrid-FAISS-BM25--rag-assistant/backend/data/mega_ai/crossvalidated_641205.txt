Obtaining P value in LASSO regularized linear regression showing that the model is generalizable

I have a problem. I am a biologist working in machine learning. Recently I am dealing with LASSO regularized linear regression. Very nice RMSE, MSE, R^2 values under all kinds of cross-validation. But the problem is that biologists at the moment (especially here in Eastern Europe) are not willing to let go of this p value thing. My supervisor wants me to show some kind of p-value... Do you think it makes sense to do a Pearson correlation analysis on the test set between predicted and actual values and show the p-value derived from it? What exactly would that tell me? I refrain from doing this, but I'll have to do something...
