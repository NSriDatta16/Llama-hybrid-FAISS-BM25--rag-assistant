If I were you I'd go with what some of the others said and use SQL Express: http://www.microsoft.com/express/sql/default.aspx You get all the benefits of a true SQL environment FOR FREE! You can even use the SQL Management Studio as well as leverage Reporting Services (if you download the advanced pack). Download link below: http://www.microsoft.com/express/sql/download/ Which edition of SQL Server 2008 Express is right for you? SQL Server 2008 Express is available in the following 3 editions (each is available from the Install Wizard): SQL Server 2008 Express with Tools SQL Server database engine - create, store, update and retrieve your data SQL Server Management Studio Basic - visual database management tool for creating, editing and managing databases SQL Server 2008 Express with Advanced Services SQL Server database engine - create, store, update and retrieve your data SQL Server Management Studio Basic - visual database management tool for creating, editing and managing databases Full-text Search - powerful, high-speed engine for searching text-intensive data Reporting Services - integrated report creation and design environment to create reports SQL Server 2008 Express (Runtime Only) SQL Server database engine - create, store, update and retrieve your data SQL Server 2008 Management Studio Express (SSMSE) Free, easy-to-use graphical management tool for configuring, managing, and administering SQL Server 2008 Express. It can also manage multiple instances of the SQL Server Database Engine created by any edition of SQL Server 2008 including Workgroup, Web, Standard and Enterprise. Note: This separate download is designed for customers who have previously installed SQL Server 2008 Express (Runtime Only). If you are looking to download SQL Server Express and SSMSE for the first time, please download the SQL Server 2008 Express with Tools from the Install Wizard. Access, to me, is really a hobbyist tool or for REALLY basic local projects at this point that just hasn't been phased out yet. I'd definitely look to using SQL Express, plus it makes it that much easier to upgrade if you get beyond the 4 GB database barrier in the future.
