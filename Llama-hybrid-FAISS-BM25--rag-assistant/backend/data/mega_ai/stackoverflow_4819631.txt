Make sure, that your "*.nocache.*" files and your start page (usually "index.html") are served with the correct HTTP caching headers. See Ideal HTTP cache control headers for different types of resources for a discussion on this (somewhat difficult) topic. Basically, you'll probably want to set Cache-Control: no-cache for these files. (By the way, this forces a re-download only when the file has changed!) How to do this configuration, depends on your web server (for Apache Httpd, you can use this guide ). Alternatively - if you use a JavaEE server (Tomcat, Jetty, ...) to serve these files - you can use a Servlet Filter. Maybe you'd like to use my example from How to set Expires HTTP header on a single JS file in Apache Tomcat?
