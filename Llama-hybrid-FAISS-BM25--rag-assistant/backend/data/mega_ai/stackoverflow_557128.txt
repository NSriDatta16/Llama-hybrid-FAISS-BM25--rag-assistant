When you are under extreme time pressure then you have to make it work. Even so, it's crucial to go over your solution to make sure that it really fixes the problem. You must understand the code involved, know how the problem happened, and make sure your fix is the correct thing. Too often patches are rushed out only to be incorrect and cause another quick patch. As for problems encountered along the way... take note of them and move on. Be sure to come back to them, but leave them for now unless they have a bearing on the current issue. All in all, it's an ugly situation to be in and there's no elegant solution. Just make sure that you are moving in a direction where you aren't faced with such issues.
