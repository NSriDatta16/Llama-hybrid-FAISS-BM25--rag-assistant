From what I can gather from your question, You want a certain animation (the drop down of a menu) to occur after a certain timeout period. One way I would do this is leverage jquery's animate function and the fact that you can pass any property / value pair to it, to be animated So for your code, remove the setTimeout(iShowMenu,500); and then use this code for the main animation part of the function $(".sub-drop-old", this.parentNode) .animate({ fakeproperty:'fakevalue' // you would also need to move the contents of the inner function iShowMenu to the outer function showMenu Hope that helps...
