I went to http://www.rseek.org/ and entered agnes algorithm and found the CLUSTER package on CRAN has the following function details for function AGNES. Details agnes is fully described in chapter 5 of Kaufman and Rousseeuw (1990). Compared to other agglomerative clustering methods such as hclust, agnes has the following features: (a) it yields the agglomerative coefficient (see agnes.object) which measures the amount of clustering structure found; and (b) apart from the usual tree it also provides the banner, a novel graphical display (see plot.agnes). The agnes-algorithm constructs a hierarchy of clusterings. At first, each observation is a small cluster by itself. Clusters are merged until only one large cluster remains which contains all the observations. At each stage the two nearest clusters are combined to form one larger cluster. For method="average", the distance between two clusters is the average of the dissimilarities between the points in one cluster and the points in the other cluster. In method="single", we use the smallest dissimilarity between a point in the first cluster and a point in the second cluster (nearest neighbor method). When method="complete", we use the largest dissimilarity between a point in the first cluster and a point in the second cluster (furthest neighbor method). Clustering is a pretty huge topic and you'll find many packages for R that implement some form of it. When you have both attributes and covariates, combining clustering with ordination can sometimes yield more insight.
