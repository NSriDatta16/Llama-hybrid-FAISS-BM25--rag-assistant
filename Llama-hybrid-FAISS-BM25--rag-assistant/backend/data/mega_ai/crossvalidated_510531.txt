Classification model - As good as it gets?

So I am relatively new to all this and I apologize if I don't provide enough information, please let me know. I have been grinding away at a problem for a couple of weeks and I am at an impasse. I have a year's worth of clinic appointments from the practice I work at and am trying to create a model that will help predict the likelihood of a patient no-showing or late-canceling. At this time all of the data is in categorical factors. I have had the best success using a Naives Bayes model, sort of: AUC.5921 Accuracy.8785 Sensitivity.43179 Specificity.90748 Some of the models have had higher AUC and accuracy scores but then the sensitivity was in the toilet. If I am understanding correctly sensitivity is the ability to accurately predict true positive, when someone will actually miss their appointment. In addition to this I have used Random Forest, NeuralNet, Logistic Regress as well as different sampling methods (over, under, both, ROSE) to deal with my data being imbalanced (approx. 88/12). What I am coming back to is factor analysis. I feel like I am missing something. I get how to run it and such but I think it may not be effective in my case as all 5 components only account for 13% of variance. Is there something I should be doing differently to get better results out of this model or is there simply nothing to be done since the data appears to be too highly correlated? Again, I am happy to provide any code, outputs, sample data etc. I just wasn't' 100% sure on what would be helpful. Thank you
