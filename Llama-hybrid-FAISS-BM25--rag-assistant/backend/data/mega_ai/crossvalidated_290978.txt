Cross-validation is a method to validate a model, which is used mostly in cases when you have a very limited amount of data available. You never want to train on data on which you are validating. On the other hand, sometimes it is costly to totally remove part of the training set (for validation). Cross-validation is a middle-ground here. We use some part of training set for validation, but never train and validate on the same data in the same time. Cross-validation is an elegant solution to achieve that.
