determine which ad-hoc queries will most likely be run or limit the search criteria with stored procedures.. can you summarize data?.. treat this app like a data warehouse. create indexes on each column involved in the search to avoid table scans. create fragments on expressions. periodically reorg the data and update statistics as more leads are loaded. put the temporary files created by queries (result sets) in ramdisk. consider migrating to a high-performance RDBMS engine like Informix OnLine. Initiate another thread to start displaying N rows from the result set while the query continues to execute.
