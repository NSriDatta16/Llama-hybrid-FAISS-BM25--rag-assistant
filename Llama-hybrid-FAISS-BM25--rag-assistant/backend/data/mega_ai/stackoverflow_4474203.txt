Securing WCF Service

I'm trying to set up security on a WCF web service, using the ProtectionLevel attribute: [ServiceContract(ProtectionLevel= ProtectionLevel.EncryptAndSign)] This compiles, but Visual Studio throws exceptions when I try to update the service reference in another project (same solution). System.InvalidOperationException: The request message must be protected. This is required by an operation of the contract ('IStorageService','tempuri.org/';). The protection must be provided by the binding ('WSHttpBinding','tempuri.org/';). What else do I need to set up to get this to work?
