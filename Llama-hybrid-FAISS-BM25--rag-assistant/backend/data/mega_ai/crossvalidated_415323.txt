Multiple tests with effects all in same direction but only few significant

I have tests done looking at the brain activity in 12 different regions of the brain. It is a between subject design where there is a treatment group (N = 8) and control group (N = 14). Each participant had these scans done on the 12 different brain regions. Every effect for all 12 brain regions showed that the treatment group had higher brain activity than the control group. However, the problem is because of the low sample size only 2 of these effects were significant with the others p values somewhere between .05 and .20. From this is there any statistical analysis I can do to be able to say that overall the brain activity was higher in the treatment group compared to the control? I tried taking an average activity among the 12 brain regions for each individual and analyzing that but the sample size was still N = 8 and N = 14 so it wasnt significant. Would it be possible to combine all of the data together and do a t test on that making it N = 8*12 = 96 for the treatment group and N = 14 * 12 = 168 for the control?
