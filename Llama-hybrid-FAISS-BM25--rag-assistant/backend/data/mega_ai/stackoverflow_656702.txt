vim, ctags, and identically named identifiers

vim + ctags works well for C projects, since C does not allow function overloading and, in general encourages manual prefixing of symbols due to rudimentary scoping facilities. In C++, functions are frequently overloaded, and overridden in subclasses. This makes vim always jump to the tag in the wrong class on "Ctrl + ]" . Is there a way to make it behave a little more intelligently? I know I can bring a list with tag alternatives, but that's insanely annoying to always have to bring up this list, and find a needed tag by number whenever I want to jump to definition.
