Drag UIView between UIViews

I have a UIView object X that is contained in an UIView object A. I want to be able to touch X and remove it from object A and move it into object B (another UIView). Both Object A & B are inside of the same super UIView. A B _____ _____ | | | | | X | -> | | |___| |___| This is what I have so far. @implementation X_UIView float deltaX; float deltaY; - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { [self.superview.superview addSubview:self]; //pop dragged view outside of container view CGPoint beginCenter = self.center; UITouch * touch = [touches anyObject]; CGPoint touchPoint = [touch locationInView:self.superview]; deltaX = touchPoint.x - beginCenter.x; deltaY = touchPoint.y - beginCenter.y; } - (void) touchesMoved:(NSSet*)touches withEvent:(UIEvent*)event { UITouch * touch = [touches anyObject]; CGPoint touchPoint = [touch locationInView:self.superview]; // Set the correct center when touched touchPoint.x -= deltaX; touchPoint.y -= deltaY; self.center = touchPoint; } - (void)touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { //discover view that event ended was over and add self as a subview. } @end
