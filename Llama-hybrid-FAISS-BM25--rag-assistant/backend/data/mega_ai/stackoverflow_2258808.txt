I'm learning PHP on my own and I've become aware of the strip_tags() function. Is this the only way to increase security?

I'm new to PHP and I'm following a tutorial here: Link It's pretty scary that a user can write php code in an input and basically screw your site, right? Well, now I'm a bit paranoid and I'd rather learn security best practices right off the bat than try to cram them in once I have some habits in me. Since I'm brand new to PHP (literally picked it up two days ago), I can learn pretty much anything easily without getting confused. What other way can I prevent shenanigans on my site? :D
