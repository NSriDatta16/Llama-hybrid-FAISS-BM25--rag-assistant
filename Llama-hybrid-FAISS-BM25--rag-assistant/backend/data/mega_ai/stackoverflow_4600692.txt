How can I determine the width of the visible side of a 3d box from a centered fixed distance camera?

I have a 2.5d viewport wherein I am trying to express a visualization of the depth of a box with 45 degree 2D lines inwards as if it had no front and you were staring inside from a central point, like this: ------------- | \_______/ | | | | | | |_______| | | / \ | ------------- I want to draw the metaphor with real 3D geometry, in that the distance of the inner rect from the outer rect is correct, given a camera distance (say fixed at 2 feet for an average eye distance from the user's monitor) How can I derive the "common inner side width" from: the centered camera distance, the width and height of the box, and the depth I'm trying to represent? Thanks!
