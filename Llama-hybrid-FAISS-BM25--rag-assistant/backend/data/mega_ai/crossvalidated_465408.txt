Hi you can train in self supervised way your 4D time series. You can use a convolutionnal network you will have 4 inputs channels. You will use then a MSE loss between your input let's says last 2048 points and prediction set at the 256 points for example. In order to achieve a good accuracy you can train a convolutionnal VAE autoencodeur and use the encoder in your convolutionnal network for prediction. Like : Input -> Encode -> feedForward -> prediction
