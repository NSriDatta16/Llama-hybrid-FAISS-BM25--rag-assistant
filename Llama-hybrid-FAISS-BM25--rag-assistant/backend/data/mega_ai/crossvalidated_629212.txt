Removing immoralities in bayesian networks

In many toy examples of bayesian networks, including the ones used in university courses, there are immoralities in the graph (see here , for example). Is it common practice to leave them in the network, provided there are strong motivations to keep them in, or is it best to attempt remove all of them by adding edges?
