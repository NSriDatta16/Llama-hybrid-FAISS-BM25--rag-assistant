Since mapping() in your code seems to be a class method, replace it with: public function __call($method, $args) { // possibly validate $method first, e.g. with a static map return call_user_func_array($method, $args); } Examples: function foo($foo) { echo $foo; } function bar($foo, $bar) { echo "$foo - $bar"; } $this->foo('foo'); // outputs 'foo' $this->bar('foo', 'bar'); // outputs 'foo - bar' This means that your class shouldn't have the methods foo() or bar() for the __call() to be invoked. Seems to be a pretty complicated problem though. There's probably a more elegant solution to what you're trying to achieve? :)
