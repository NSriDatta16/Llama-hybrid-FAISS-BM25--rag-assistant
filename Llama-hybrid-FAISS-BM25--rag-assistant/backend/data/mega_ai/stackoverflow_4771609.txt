If you do approve of third party clients accessing your API, perhaps you could provide them with a slightly different, rate-limited interface and document it well (so that it would be easier to use and thus actually be used by third-party clients). One way to do this would be to have two different API URLs, for example: /api?client=ThirdPartyAppName&... for third-party apps (you would encourage use of this URL) /api?token= &... for your own JS Note that as you mention, it is not possible to put a complete stop to reverse engineering of your own code. Although it can take longer, even compiled, binary code written in such languages as C++ can be reverse engineered, and that threatens any approach relying on secrecy .
