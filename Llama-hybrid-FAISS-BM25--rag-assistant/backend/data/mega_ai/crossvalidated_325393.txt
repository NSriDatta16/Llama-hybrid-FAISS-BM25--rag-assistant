Handling error with spatially lagged variable that is related to but distinct from outcome variable. SAR, CAR, Durbin, or lagged X?

I am estimating a diffusion model in which I am using spatial lags to predict an outcome variable, but I'm having trouble specifying the distribution of the error term because the lagged variable is related to, but not the same as, my outcome variable. Specifically, my outcome is the emergence of an attribute in observation i,t given the presence of that attribute in j,t-3 I am pretty sure there is no spatial weights matrix that would allow me to use the outcome variable in a SAR model. In the three months after the property emerged, the weights matrix for the neighboring regions in a given month could point to the month in which the property emerged. But after 3 months, there is no information in the outcome variable to indicate whether the property continues to be present. So I can't use a standard SAR of the form: $$ y=ρWy+Zδ+ϵ $$ because there is no W which could be multiplied by y to create the predictor of interest. One way to characterize the relationship is: x implies a y in a neighboring region but not when, and y implies some of the x's, but not all. But because the outcome variable is so closely related to the main explanatory variable, I'm not sure how I should model the error term. One possible specification I've thought of is to make it an interaction between the lagged outcome variable (the property has emerged in the past) and a new spatially lagged predictor (the property was present in the previous three months), so the term would be: ρWyx. But the y contributes no information in this case, and the added x confuses the y-isolated form of the equation: $$ y=(I-ρWx)^{-1}Xβ+(I-ρWx)^{-1}u $$ Part of the issue is that I don't feel like I have an intuitive enough understanding of the distribution of the error term in a SAR model to be able to adapt the specification to other circumstances. Most descriptions of the model show the equation above and pay little attention to the error term and why/how it differs from a linear regression. So my questions are: Can you help me to get a more intuitive understanding of the distribution on the error term in SAR in general, why epsilon can't be distributed normally with mean 0 and constant variance when spatial lags have been controlled for, and how the proper distribution relates to the autoregression? How do I handle a lagged predictor that is closely related to the outcome variable?
