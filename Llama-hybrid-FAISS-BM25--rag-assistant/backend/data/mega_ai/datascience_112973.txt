CNN Deep Learning model fit problem with Tensorflow

I have the following problem: I'm trying to fit a deep learning CNN model in google colab with a dataset of cats and dogs, it is very popular in Kaggle, i've cleaned the dataset of none images with a method, and the model train well for a few iterations but in a moment the code throw the following error: And here a picture where the code works well in the first iterations, how i can solve this? I'm thinking it's a dataset problem but i'm not sure. I am a student of Deep Learning with Tensorflow Here it's my colab notebook: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1GzLma_-DMHOe1-injn4d_2KiI6kcwasZ?usp=sharing
