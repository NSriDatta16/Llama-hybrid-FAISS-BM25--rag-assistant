Including objects binding in MultiBinding command parameter

I am attempting to use a to pass two parameters to my ViewModel's command but am having issues getting the XAML parser to accept my attempts. Consider the following ListView contained within my UserControl which is bound to a collection of Ticket objects. The respective style ListViewItem And the referenced ContextMenu item where the source of my query sits; So here is what I am attempting to do; The context menu has a single item "Send ticket as notification" which, when selected, lists all the available Agents which can receive said notification. This works. When I click on one of these agent options, I want the context menu item to send both the ticket item that was clicked on from the listview to show the context menu (this works) AND the Agent item I selected from the context menu. I have half-achieved this with the MultiBinding Now although the actual set-up of the context menu seems some what complicated to me. The actual specification that one of the MultiBinding parameters should be the actual item bound to the clicked ContextMenu.MenuItem seems quite a simple command. The context menu correctly lists all Agents and so I would of thought that simply asking for this current object to be sent through as a command parameter, simple. I have also tried; as well as But all that gets sent to the Parameter converter is UnsetValue Thank you for your time and any suggestions you might have.
