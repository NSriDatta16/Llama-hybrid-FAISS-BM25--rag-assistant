Conditional probabilities with Discrete Time Markov Chain non-perishable inventory

Suppose $\{X_n : n =0,1,2,\dots \}$ is a DTMC that represents the inventory level at the end of day $n$ . We have inventory policy $(2,4)$ , i.e., if $X_n , we order enough units to have inventory level equal to $4$ by the beginning of the next day. We have the following demand curve: $P(D=1) = 1/6, P(D=2) = 3/6, P(D=3) = 2/6$ . We assume demand is iid and demand is lost for an item if it is not in stock. Then the goal is calculate the following probability: $$P(X_1 = 3, X_4 = 2 | X_0 = 2)$$ I attempted to rewrite this as $P(X_1 = 3, X_4 = 2 | X_0 = 2) = P(X_4=2|X_1 = 3, X_0 = 2)P(X_1=3|X_0=2)$ . So now I can calculate $P(X_1=3|X_0=2)$ using a transition matrix, but I am having trouble handling $P(X_4=2|X_1=3,X_0=3)$ since we do not know $X_3$ meaning we cannot apply the Markov property. Would something like law of total probability work here where I vary $X_3 =i$ across the sample space?
