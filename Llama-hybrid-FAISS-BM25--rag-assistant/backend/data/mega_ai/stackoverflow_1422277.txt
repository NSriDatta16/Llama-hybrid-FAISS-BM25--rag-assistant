I suggest you to check How to Design a Good API & Why it Matters A well-written API can be a great asset to the organization that wrote it and to all that use it. Given the importance of good API design, surprisingly little has been written on the subject. In this talk (recorded at Javapolis), Java library designer Joshua Bloch teaches how to design good APIs, with many examples of what good and bad APIs look like. http://www.infoq.com/presentations/effective-api-design Also you can read the book Practical API Design: Confessions of a Javaâ„¢ Framework Architect . I didn't read it so I'm not sure if it contents could be useful to you. Another resource to check: How To Design a (module) API
