Java Cloud APIs

I'm looking to write a Java (Groovy actually) web application that will need to talk to both AWS and Eucalyptus clouds for both compute and storage. So we're looking for a Java library that can talk to both. I know that Eucalyptus is supposed to be AWS API compatible so anything that talks to AWS should be able to talk to Eucalyptus but that has not been my experience. I've found some of the ec2 command line apps that should work with Eucalyptus but simply crash. Here's what I'm considering so far: typica jclouds Dasein AWS SDK for Java Cloud Foundry Do anyone have experience using any of these to talk to AWS and Eucalyptus? Are there any other similar APIs out there worth looking at? Thanks
