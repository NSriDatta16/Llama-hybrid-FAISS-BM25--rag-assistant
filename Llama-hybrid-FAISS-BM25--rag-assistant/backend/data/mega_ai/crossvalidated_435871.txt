could someone please double check my understanding of 2 forms that represent Machine Learning model?

This CMU Machine Learning Text Book says when we are interested in learning some target function $f : X → Y$ , we can more generally learn the probabilistic function $P(Y|X)$ . there are 2 forms above to represent a Machine Learning model. is reasonable to say kNN is an example of this form $f : X → Y$ while SVM is an example of another form $P(Y|X)$ could someone please double check my understanding about these 2 forms?
