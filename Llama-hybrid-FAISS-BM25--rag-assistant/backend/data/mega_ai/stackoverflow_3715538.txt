We regularly punch about 100KByte/sec through our USB CDC implementation, the PC is fast enough to receive all data. But it seems that the built-in limits are lower with usb-serial (CDC) than with mass-storage protocol (in our case ~600KB/s versus ~100KB/s CDC). The PC receive thread should have a buffer that's "big enough". Edit: I don't know Windows' Buffer sizes, or how to get them, though.
