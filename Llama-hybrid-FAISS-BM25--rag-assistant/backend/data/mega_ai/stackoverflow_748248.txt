Database agnostic table/view export software?

Trying to search for a more elegant/overall solution to our common/basic data export tasks I am convinced that there must be software out there that allows me to: Define and persist a "setup" (definition of file format, delimiters, encoding, column names etc) from a GUI Run on a schedule/from command line Work on both Oracle and MSSql However, I haven't found it yet... any tips?
