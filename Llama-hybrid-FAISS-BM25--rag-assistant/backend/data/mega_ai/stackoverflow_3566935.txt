How to make make syntax highlighting and keyboard behavior identical for VB.NET and C# in Visual Studio 2008?

C# Types have their own color (cyan by default). Enter completes the auto-complete suggestion. Visual Basic Types use Identifier color (black by default). Enter completes the auto-complete suggestion and adds a "()" and a newline. These and other seemingly minor differences are so enraging I can't get any work done. How do I make Visual Studio behave consistently? Failing that, any other solutions/suggestions? Edit: I don't care which way, I just want it to be consistent.
