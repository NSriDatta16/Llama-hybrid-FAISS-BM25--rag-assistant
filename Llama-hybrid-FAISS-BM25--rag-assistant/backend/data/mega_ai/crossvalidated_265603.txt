ADF test - interpreting the results

I have a time series $x$ and I want to run the ADF test to check stationarity in the sense of unit root. The series has lenght 60 so I apply lags from 1 to 11 as suggested by the literature (Schwert 1989). In matlab I run: [h,p]=adftest(x,'lags',2:11) The output is: h = 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 p = 0.7158 0.7889 0.6778 0.6989 0.6574 0.6658 0.6934 0.7161 0.6883 0.6855 How can I interpreter this result? The fact that h is zero shall be interpreted as It might not be stationary in the sense of the unit root. But the p-value is very high. So can I conclude something or not?
