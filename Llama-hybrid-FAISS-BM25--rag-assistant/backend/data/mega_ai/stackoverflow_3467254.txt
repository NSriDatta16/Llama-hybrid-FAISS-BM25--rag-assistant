How to store and display vector text+graphics images in Android without Flash?

What vector graphic formats can be used to display the in a view in an android application? As I understand, PDF is not an option at the moment, so what other options are there for storage and display of complex text+graphics? Unfortunately, I cannot use embedded browser with Flash because I need this app to work on Android versions before 2.2.
