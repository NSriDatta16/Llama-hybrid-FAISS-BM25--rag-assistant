Magento Configurable Options

I have a configurable option for Color. I have managed to display the labels (red,blue,green) for it within A tags on the product view page. What I want to do is when I click on red tell Magento that I've selected Red and when I click on add to cart it adds the product with the red selection. I'm not good at Javascript! Your help will be greatly appreciated. Thanks.
