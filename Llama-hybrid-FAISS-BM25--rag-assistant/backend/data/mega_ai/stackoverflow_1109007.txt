Beans, methods, access and change? What is the recommened practice for handling them (i.e. in ColdFusion)?

I am new to programming (6 weeks now). i am reading a lot of books, sites and blogs right now and i learn something new every day. Right now i am using coldfusion (job). I have read many of the oop and cf related articles on the web and i am planning to get into mxunit next and after that to look at some frameworks. One thing bothers me and i am not able to find a satisfactory answer. Beans are sometimes described as DataTransferObjects, they hold Data from one or many sources. What is the recommended practice to handle this data? Should i use a separate Object that reads the data, mutates it and than writes it back to the bean, so that the bean is just a storage for data (accessible through getters) or should i implement the methods to manipulate the data in the bean. I see two options. 1. The bean is only storage, other objects have to do something with its data. 2. The bean is storage and logic, other objects tell it to do something with its data. The second option seems to me to adhere more to encapsulation while the first seems to be the way that beans are used. I am sure both options fit someones need and are recommended in a specific context but what is recommended in general, especially when someone does not know enough about the greater application picture and is a beginner? Example: I have created a bean that holds an Item from a database with the item id, a name, and an 1d-array. Every array element is a struct that holds a user with its id, its name and its amount of the item. Through a getter i output the data in a table in which i can also change the amount for each user or check a user for deletion from this item. Where do i put the logic to handle the application users input? Do i tell the bean to change its array according to the user input? Or do i create an object that changes the array and writes that new array into the bean? (All database access (CreateReadUpdateDelete) is handled through a DataAccessObject that gets the bean as an argument. The DAO also contains a gateway method to read more than one record from the database. I use this method to get a table of items, which i can click to create the bean and its data.)
