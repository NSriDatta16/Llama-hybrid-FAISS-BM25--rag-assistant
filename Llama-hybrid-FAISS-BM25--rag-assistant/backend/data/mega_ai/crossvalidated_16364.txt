How do you find the average in this Poisson Distribution problem?

Suppose that the number of accidents occurring at a particular intersection each week is a Poisson random variable. It is estimated that the probability of having at least one accident in a week, at the intersection, is 0.98. Calculate the average number of accidents occurring each week at the intersection. Thanks in advance for the help!
