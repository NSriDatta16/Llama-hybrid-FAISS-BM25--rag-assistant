If the data is uniform, go with one table. If you ever need to SELECT across all websites having multiple tables is a pain. However if you write enough scripting you can do it with multiple tables. You could use MySQL's MERGE storage engine to do SELECTs across the tables (but don't expect good performance, and watch out for the Windows hard limit on the number of open files - in Linux you may haveto use ulimit to raise the limit. There's no way to do it in Windows). I have broken a huge table into many (hundreds) of tables and used MERGE to SELECT. I did this so the I could perform off-line creation and optimization of each of the small tables. (Eg OPTIMIZE or ALTER TABLE...ORDER BY). However the performance of SELECT with MERGE caused me to write my own custom storage engine. (Described http://blog.coldlogic.com/categories/coldstore/'>here)
