The idea of using Rich Web App as the UI for the sake of portability is quite reasonable - though cross-browser support does add quite a lot of work. Embedding the server wouldn't have occurred to me (I tend to work in multi-tier apps where we natuallry separate presentation layer to its own tier) but I can't see a fundamental reason not to do this - as you say single self contained executable does have some attraction. Even if you chose to deploy the HTML, images etc as files in a file system instead of parcelled into the app (and for ease of update you might do that) you overall approach makes sense to me.
