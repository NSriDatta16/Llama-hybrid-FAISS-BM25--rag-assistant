First of all,the equation you are looking for is not possible for random forest . This is because the nature of random forest algorithm inherently leads to destruction of any simple mathematical representation. Random forest works by building decision trees & then aggregating them & hence the Beta values have no counterpart in random forest. Though you do get the 'Variable Importance /Gini Index' values for the forest, which can be used for making sense of the model but not as a multiplication factor. Now to answer your question, from your code snippet it seems that you have stored you model as rf . To use this model for prediction, you can simply call the predict method in python associated with the random forest class. use: prediction = rf.predict(test) This will give you the predictions for you new data (test here) based on the model rf . The predict method won't build a new model, it'll use the model rf to use for prediction on new data. For a deeper understanding behind how a random forest model is built,you can check out the chapter on Random Forests from Elements of Statistical Learning For a simplified working example, you should check out yhatq article here: http://blog.yhathq.com/posts/comparing-random-forests-in-python-and-r.html
