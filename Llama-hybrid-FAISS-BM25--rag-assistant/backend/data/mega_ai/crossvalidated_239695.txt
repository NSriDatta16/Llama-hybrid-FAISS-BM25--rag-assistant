during a cluster analysis procedure, how would I approach finding an appropriate number of clusters within my data? What are alternatives to the approach sketched above? Different clustering techniques can follow different rules. k-means procedures often seek to minimize the within-sums of squares. Here is an example in R: http://www.statmethods.net/advstats/cluster.html These techniques do not follow a probability model, and are often based on a "best guess" approach. Model-based clustering approaches exist, one of the most known approaches uses a Gaussian-mixed model approach. The Mclust library in R uses this approach; here is a reference: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mclust/vignettes/mclust.html In comparison to k-means, mclust allows for model comparisons via a Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). For a summary on how mclust uses BIC for model selection, see the thread Mclust model selection Another issue is the fact, that I have "ordered, categorical" (ordinal) data in my dataset. I know that this might be a problem with kmeans. What are my alternatives algorithm-wise? Cluster Analysis, 5th edition, Everitt et al. on Table 9.1 discusses various clustering approaches for various data types. For mixed data types, model-based approaches are a suggested option. So mclust would be a good tool to use in your situation. Best of luck!
