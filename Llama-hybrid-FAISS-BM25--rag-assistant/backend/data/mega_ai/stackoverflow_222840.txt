I break mine up almost exactly the same way: reset.ccs - The standard reset from MeyerWeb typography.css - Fonts, sizes, line-heights, etc layout.css - All positioning, floats, alignments, etc. colors.css (or more appropriately skin.css) - All colors, background images, etc. These are then followed with IE-specific files included via conditional comments for the appropriate version. I haven't had the need to separate them further, though I do organize each file in separate sections (base elements, named elements, classes, etc.) UPDATE: I have changed my system a bit in the last few projects I have done. base.css - Contains the CSS from the YUI reset and YUI base CSS files (with attribution) main.css - Contains @import statements for the following: typography.css - Fonts, sizes, line-heights, etc layout.css - All positioning, floats, alignments, etc. theme.css - All colors, background images, etc. print.css - Overrides for the other CSS files to make the pages print-friendly. I also then use conditional comments to add any IE-specific CSS files if needed. My next step in improving this would be to add a build-process step to combine all of the CSS files into one file to reduce the HTTP requests on the server.
