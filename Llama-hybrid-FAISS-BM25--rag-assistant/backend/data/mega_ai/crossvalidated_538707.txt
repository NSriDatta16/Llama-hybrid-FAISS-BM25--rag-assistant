Great answers above, and not sure how much I can add here, but I feel there are three things to consider with imbalanced data, and new trade-offs you'll have to consider when rebalancing. I'd like to frame this in the context of predicting a minority outcome (a common task with imbalanced classes): By resampling, you may improve overall accuracy, but usually its the case that with severe class imbalance, you're actually trying to predict or otherwise describe features of the minority class. The best evaluation metrics here would then be F1 scores, precision, recall and the like. The resampling process (whether by SMOTE, or undersampling the majority class, etc.) disrupts the distribution of your data which naturally occurs, and training performed on these artificially created classes will usually perform poorly when applied to back to natural distributions. This creates sampling bias, in a sense. In my own work, I've found Random Forest Classifier does a bit better job than Logistic Regression, although it's pretty "data hungry" and will require enough minority samples (see point #2). It really depends on the question you're trying to answer and the types of data you have available. It's quite possible you may already have enough of the minority class to make useful predictions. Consider a class imbalance of 100:1. Would 1000 majority samples and 10 minority samples make for a useful classifier? Of course not. But what about 1,000,000 majority and 10,000 minority samples? The model you select may have enough of the minority outcome to make useful predictions. It's minority count - not relative proportion to the majority class - that is ultimately important. More of a general point is that we've become obsessed with correcting class imbalances, as if its a central problem. Left by the wayside are the far more important tasks of feature engineering and proper model selection as is necessary for predicting minority outcomes. I wrote a piece about this here: Why Balancing Classes is Over-Hyped
