Since you're a seasoned .NET programmer, you really should look at ASP.NET and MVC before turning to Rails and Django, at least if your goal is to get up-and-running quickly. It's always easier to leverage something that you already know in-depth. I was in a similar situation recently -- I had a project that I wanted to push out on Windows and Unix, and so rather than leveraging what I know well (Ruby/Rails), I jumped ship and gave Groovy on Grails a go. It was a really rewarding experience, and I'm really glad I did a few small projects in Grails, but in the end I had a tiny fraction of the productivity I did in the environment where I had a few years' experience, even after months of hacking away on Grails. So, pick up Django, Rails, Lift, or whatever you feel like doing -- it will help expand your mind, and give you different ways to look at solving problems. But if you want to get going quickly, use what you know (.NET) on a platform designed for you (MVC).
