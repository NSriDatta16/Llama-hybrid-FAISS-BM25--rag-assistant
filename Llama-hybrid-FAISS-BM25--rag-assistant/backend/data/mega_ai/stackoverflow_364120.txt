there is a difference between copying and dragging. Dragging is also called "filling" formulas.

When you fill a formula, fully qualified structured references can adjust the column specifiers like a series as summarized in the following table. So it basically means that the behavior you see is by design. If you want the reference to be absolute you should copy the formula and not drag/"fill" it.
