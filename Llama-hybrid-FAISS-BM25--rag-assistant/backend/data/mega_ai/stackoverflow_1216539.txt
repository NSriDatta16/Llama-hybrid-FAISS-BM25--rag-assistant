You can create Credentials in SQL Server (use Mgt Studio, under Security). Then create a Proxy in SQL Agent to use those credentials, telling it what kind of job steps can be used by the proxy. Then you get the choice to use that Proxy in the job step itself. So... I make accounts for various SSIS packages to run under, so that I can keep the SQL Agent Service Account low privilege, and use a proxied credential with slightly higher privilege (not admin though, just enough permission to connect to other systems, including the File System).
