Strategies for complicated inverse function approximation

I have a dataset G. There is a complicated set of mathematical functions I can use to calculated the values 'W' for any given point in G. f(G) $\rightarrow$ W To the best of my knowledge these functions f are not analytically invertible in closed form, so I want to use machine learning to attempt the inverse problem, to calculate/approximate the value of a point in G for any given point in W. f $^{-1}$ (W) $\rightarrow$ G. I am assuming here that the features of 'W' contain sufficient information to reconstruct G. Essentially this is a mapping question, I want an accurate 1-to-1 map from W-space to G-space. What sort of machine learning structures would work well for this sort of problem? Naively I am thinking neural networks because that is what I am most familiar with. Are there other better options?
