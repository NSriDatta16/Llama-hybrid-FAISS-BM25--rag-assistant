After staring at it for a good while, I came to the conclusion that I could, in fact, use Pearson's. I dropped the direct comparison with shoes bought and instead took "Brand", "Style" and "Material" as variables. For each user I take all the shoes they have bought, from that I calculate the number and kinds of brands, styles and materials and store these in dictionaries. So if the user bought 10 pairs of adidas these 10 would count as his rating of the brand. The intersect of the dictionary keys supplies the values for the Pearson. At the end I add them together and divide by 3; probably not the best or most elegant solution but it works.
