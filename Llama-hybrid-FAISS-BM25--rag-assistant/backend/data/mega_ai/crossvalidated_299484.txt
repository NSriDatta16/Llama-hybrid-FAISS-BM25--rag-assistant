How to correct for selection bias caused by a prior version of a logistic GLM?

I've looked for information on this, but there are a lot of different angles to addressing selection bias I'm lost on how to proceed. Here is the basic scenario: We collect data on n customers. Of those n customers, we follow up with on a certain number n_followup for additional screening. The decision of whether or not to follow up is based on a logistic regression with known parameters. We want to re-estimate the model with a newer dataset, and possibly add new variables as well. Changing the model specification is also on the table. I think I intuitively see the issue here -- just rerunning the model on n_followup is going to produce biased estimates, since we'd expect the previous model to have some predictive power. Is there a good way to correct this, either in the context of a GLM or better yet in general? Would some sort of weighting by the relative frequency in n_followup compared to n work? If I need to make some strong distributional assumptions that's fine. Thanks, I appreciate the help!
