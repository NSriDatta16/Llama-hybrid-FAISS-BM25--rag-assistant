By embedding do you mean distributing your program without the file? Then you can convert it to configuration initialization code in your build toolchain. Add a makefile step (or whatever tool you're using) - a script that converts this .cfg file into some C++ code file that initializes a configuration data structure. That way you can just modify the .cfg file, rebuild the project, and have the new values reflected inside. By the way, on Windows, you may have luck embedding your data in a resource file .
