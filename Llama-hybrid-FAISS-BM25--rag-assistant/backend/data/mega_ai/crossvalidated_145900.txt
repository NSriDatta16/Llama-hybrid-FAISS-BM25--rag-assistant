In theory: The structure of the network -- how many layers, how many nodes in each layer and what the activation function is -- gives you the general functional form of the network. Add the estimated weights to get the particular estimated function $\hat f$. All of this should in principle be known/available to the "user" of the network. In applications: Software that implements the neural network will often take the structure (number of layers, number of nodes and activation function) as arguments and will output the estimated weights if requested. Thus the explicit function $\hat f$ (the network's approximation of the underlying true function $f$) can be extracted, both in theory and in practice. However, I do not see how the true function $f$ could be extracted, and I think in general this may not be possible.
