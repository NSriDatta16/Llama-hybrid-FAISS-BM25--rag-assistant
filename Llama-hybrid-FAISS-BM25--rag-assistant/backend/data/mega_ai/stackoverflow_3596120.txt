Sounds like you need a primitive linking index document? Something like this: You can then write a program thats takes a number as an input, makes assumptions about how many entries there are per file and then loads the correct index? Or maybe you could specify the number of entries in each sub-file in the index file: You might be able to leverage XInclude to load the sub documents, for large XML files I'd suggest using the XMLReader in PHP, it'll consume lots less memory.
