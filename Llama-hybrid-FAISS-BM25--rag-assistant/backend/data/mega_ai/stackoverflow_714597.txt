Visual Studio 2008 Painfully Slow Under SVN

I have recently been through the pain of converting an legacy WebSite project to a (C#)Web Application Project. During this time I also migrated the code from VSS control to Subversion on a dev server. When debugging the application under VS2008 the project can literally take 4/5 minutes to completely load up. The majority of this time the Output Window states that it is loading symbols from Temp ASP.NET directory. Figuring this may be an issue that it is under SVN control, I exported the project and began debugging without source control and this resolved the issue. Can anyone suggest why this could be happening, ie. why under source control is it taking such a long time to debug?
