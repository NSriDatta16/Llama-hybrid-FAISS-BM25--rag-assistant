Repeated measures within factors settings for G*Power power calculation

I'm trying to perform a power calculation with G*Power. There are two quite important options, the meaning of which is not clear to me: "Number of groups" - what is this? I have a 2x2 repeated measures factorial design. Does this mean there are four groups, or, as the rest of the internet suggests, is this box for between-subjects factors? If it's for between-subjects factors, I assume this is 1 for a repeated measures factorial. "Number of measurements" - also not entirely clear. Is this the number of data points I collected per participant? What if they've been averaged before they go into the ANOVA? Or is this the number of within-subjects conditions? So 4 for my experiment? Any guidance on the meaning of these settings much appreciated - as far as I can tell these are undocumented.
