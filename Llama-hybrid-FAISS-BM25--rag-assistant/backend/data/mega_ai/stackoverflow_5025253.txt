You need an Entity Class and Address Class . Entity can be person, place, organisation, coffee shop kinda, whereas Address can capture Phone number, emailid, Lat/Long kinda stuff. Keeping Entity and Address will help you across diverse objects. and having many to many relation ship among entity and address would help, having loose coupling wud help on long run.
