How do I use the data from a full sample to inform my estimates about a subgroup?

Consider a sample of size $N$ with various observed characteristics: for example, gender and blood pressure. For the overall sample we have the average $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$ of blood pressure. In this case we're interested in the blood pressure for males only. We can obviously compute $\mu_M$ and $\sigma_M$. But doesn't this overstate our uncertainty? In other words, aren't we leaving out information contained in the rest of the sample? Is there a good approach for combining the overall sample data with the data from our subgroup of interest to attain a more "accurate" measure of our uncertainty?
