Bert model for document sentiment classification

I am trying to fine-tune a Bert model for sentiment analysis. Instead of one sentence, my inputs are documents (including several sentences) and I am not removing dots. I was wondering if is it okay to use just the embedding of the first token in such cases. If not, what should I do?
