Smoothing without losing data points

How would I smooth a series of data without losing the ends of a series? For example, if I have $i_1, i_2, \dots, i_n$ , and I apply a moving average, I lose the start and end of the series ( $i_1$ and $i_n$ , certainly, and perhaps more). I can't seem to find any smoothing method that lets me keep both ends of the series. Is this possible?
