Meaning of Intercept Parameter in a Bayesian Longitudinal HLM

I have been working through John Kruschke's excellent book on Bayesian Data Analysis but now have found myself in experimental-design territory not covered in the book: a longitudinal linear mixed-effects model. I would like to test the difference in linear trend over time between two groups. There is a two-level between-subjects predictor XGroup , a continuous within-subjects predictor XTime , and a subject-level predictor XSubject (equivalent of random intercept). I have included main effect and interaction betas for all of these variables, as well as the 'between x within' interaction bBxW and the 'subject x within' interaction bSxW (each participant's random slope). My specification of the likelihood looks like this: for (r in 1:nTotal) { y[r] ~ dt(mu[r], 1/ySigma^2, nu) mu[r] The (inverse) link function specification mu[r] is what I am interested in here, especially what the b0 intercept parameter represents. When testing HLMs using packages like lme4 , when the model includes an interaction between categorical and continuous predictors, the estimate of the (Intercept) coefficient represents the estimated level of the outcome variable at the reference level of the categorical predictor when the continuous predictor is 0. However in the models I am used to from Kruschke's book, as far as I understand it, the b0 represents the grand mean , which is the estimated level of the outcome variable averaged across groups when the within-subjects predictor is 0. My questions are: (1) what does the b0 parameter in my model represent, the reference level or the grand mean? (2) is the model specification equivalent to a random-slopes mixed-effects model, and if not, what do I need to change?
