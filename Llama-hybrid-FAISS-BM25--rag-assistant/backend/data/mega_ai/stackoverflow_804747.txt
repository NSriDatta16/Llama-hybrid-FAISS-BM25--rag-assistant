In my experience, the main issues with Oracle on Windows are a result of Windows file locking. For example, if the database was running and the data files for Oracle were locked by another process (i.e. a file system backup agent), we've had occurrences where the file has become corrupt. Unix/Linux on the other hand doesn't seem to have those issues (according to our DBA). In general, I've had no major issues with Oracle on a Windows Platform if steps are taken to ensure files are not locked by other processes. We now use RMAN to perform online backups and exclude all Oracle data files from the file system backup. It has been very stable for over 2 years now.
