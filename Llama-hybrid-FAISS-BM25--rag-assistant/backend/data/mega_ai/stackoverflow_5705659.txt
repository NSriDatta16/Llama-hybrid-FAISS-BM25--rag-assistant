How to Detect in Sub Process When Parent Process Has Died?

In python, I have a parent process that spawns a handful of child processes. I've run into a situation where, due to an unhandled exception, the parent process was dieing and the child processes where left orphaned. How do I get the child processes to recognize that they've lost their parent? I tried some code that hooks the child process up to every available signal and none of them were fired. I could theoretically put a giant try/except around the parent process to ensure that it at least fires a sigterm to the children, but this is inelegant and not foolproof. How can I prevent orphaned processes?
