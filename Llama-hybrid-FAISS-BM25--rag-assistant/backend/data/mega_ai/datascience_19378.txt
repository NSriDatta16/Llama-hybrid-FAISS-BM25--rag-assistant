How the vector of weights assigned to a neural network?

You have set of input nodes, hidden nodes and output nodes although I have one output node in my case. We assign weights to the connections between those nodes. So is there any pattern of assigning weights to those connections? This is one pattern of assigning weights to neural network. See the another way of assigning the weights. Please tell which one of the following is the correct way of assigning the weights to the neural network?
