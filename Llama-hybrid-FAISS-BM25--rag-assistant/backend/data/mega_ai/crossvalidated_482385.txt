There are not many practical texts on the subject, the one I have is "Nonlinear Time Series: Theory, Methods and Applications with R Examples (Chapman & Hall/CRC Texts in Statistical Science)", Douc et al Nonlinear TS are very difficult to estimate. I'd day they're impossible to work with unless you deal with a good theory that captures DGP very well, like those in physics and engineering. One of the co-authors Shumway also wrote a great book on time series, which is available free on his website https://www.stat.pitt.edu/stoffer/tsa4/tsa4.pdf
