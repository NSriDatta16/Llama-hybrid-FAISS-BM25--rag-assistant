What Stata does is perfectly fine and it is not a problem. Consistent estimation of IV/2SLS regressions requires that all the instruments appear in all first stages. In the two first stages you should see for $y_1$ that $z_1$ and $z_2$ have the largest effect whilst for $y_2$ it should be $z_3$ and $z_4$. The test statistics produced by ivreg2 are valid for your estimation problem and some of the are especially designed for this type of regression like the Angrist and Pischke F-statistic, or the Stock-Yogo critical values for the Cragg-Donald statistic. This is also described in the ivreg2 help file. If you still have your heart set on estimating the first stages separately you need to use a multiple-equation model and use 3SLS instead (see this post in the Statalist regarding this topic).
