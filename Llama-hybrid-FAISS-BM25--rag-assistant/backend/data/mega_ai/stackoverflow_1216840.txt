Why is the Eclipse IDE getting slower?

I have downloaded the latest Eclipse IDE, Galileo, and tested it to see if it good for developing web applications in Java. I have also tried the Ganymede version of Eclipse and find that is it also good. My Problem is that sometimes it hangs and stops responding while I am developing. Sometimes when I open a file, Eclipse hangs and does not respond for awhile. It seems that Eclipse is going slower and my job is getting slower because of the time that I am spending waiting for the response of Eclipse. When I went to NetBeans 6.7, it was good and the performance was good. The loading is faster and the IDE responds well during my development testing. My computer has 1 GB of RAM and a 1.6 GHz CPU. What can you say about this?
