I think the best thing to do here is to give you the documentation first: http://railsbrain.com/api/rails-2.3.2/doc/index.html Look up "has_many" (paying attention to :through) and "belongs_to", as well as "has_one", although I don't think you'll use the later. This blog post will help you with the has_many :through concept -- and I think after that, you'll be set. Let us know if there's anything that's not clear! class Account :email_address_people end class EmailAddress :email_address_people end I would get started with that. It's not tested, but if we see what breaks, then we can fix it.. :)
