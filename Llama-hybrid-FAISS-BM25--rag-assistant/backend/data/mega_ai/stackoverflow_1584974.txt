Simply put, XmlHttpRequest doesn't allow you to perform ajax calls across domains. Meaning, if you're website is mydomain.com, you can't use XHR to call out to pages (xml or otherwise) on someonelsesdomain.com. There are work-arounds, typically using flash (less elegant) or webservice proxies (more elegant). Google "cross domain ajax calls" for more help.
