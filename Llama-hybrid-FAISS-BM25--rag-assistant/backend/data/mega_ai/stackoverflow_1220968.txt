The best thing to do is profile the server and also pay attention to what kinds of locks are occurring during the query. If you are using any isolation level options, or the default, determine if you can lower the isolation level, which will decrease the locking occurring on the table. The more locking that occurs, the more conflicts you will have where the query has to wait for other queries to complete. However, be very careful when lowering the isolation level, because you need to understand how that will effect the data you get back. Determine if you can add where criteria to your query. Restricting the records you query can reduce locks. Edit: If you find locking issues, you need to also evaluate any other queries that are being run.
