Unknown language identification

I'm currently working with a dead network application that received packets for a chat. I checked that it received text like this one: hi there! {c:0000FF}foo{/c} sentence I have checked but have not found the language that uses that color syntax. It is some famous language or it's surely a self made script/library? Original application used c++ and python as developping languages. Thanks you all in advance, Rag.
