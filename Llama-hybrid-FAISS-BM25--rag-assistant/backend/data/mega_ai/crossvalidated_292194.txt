State variables and the Markov property A stochastic process satisfies the Markov property if the past is independent from the future given the present state of the system. In dynamic models, in time series models, what's referred to as state variables is generally some minimal set of variables that capture enough information so that the Markov property is satisfied. The Markov property is a highly desirable property for modeling! Examples: Rocket tracking Our state variables here may be the rocket position (x, y, pitch, yaw...), velocity vector, fuel level, etc... A simple AR(2): Imagine we have the simple AR(2) model $y_{t+1} = b_0 + b_1 Y_{t} + b_2 Y_{t-1} + \epsilon_t$. You could define $X_t = \begin{bmatrix} Y_t \\ Y_{t-1} \end{bmatrix}$ as a state variable. Simple macro-economics, neoclassical growth model You might have the level of capital $K_t$ and productivity $A_t$ as state variables. The state variables are generally some minimal set of variables such that additional information about the past or the present would be irrelevant. They capture the current state of the system.
