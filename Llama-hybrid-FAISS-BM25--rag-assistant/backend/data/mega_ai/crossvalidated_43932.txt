Reference category in multinominal logistic regression

I was wondering how you get beta values for the final model if you don't have a reference condition? I am running a multinominal logistic regression using a dependent variable that has 6 levels - there is no condition that was a control or justifies separation from the others, so I don't want a reference category. In the output the only table that will tell me what my beta values are is the one in which you state a reference category. Is there another way that I can find out the beta values so that I can report the regression equation? I hope that makes sense! I would really appreciate your help on this.
