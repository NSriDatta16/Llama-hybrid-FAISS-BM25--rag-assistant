LSTM time series forecasting on sparse dataset

I am working on the LSTM time series forecasting of solar energy production. The available data is one year on a half hourly basis. More than 60% of the data values are zero as the PV stations cannot produce solar energy at night. Now my questions are as follows, 1) If this big amount of zeros somehow affecting the learning process? 2) Is there any way to deal with such sparse data set?
