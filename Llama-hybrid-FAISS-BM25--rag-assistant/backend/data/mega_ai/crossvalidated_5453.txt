Why does continuous Bayesian analysis seem to give this contradictory result?

Let's say you have a process that generates data according to r = sin(t) + epsilon, where epsilon ~ N(0,V) is Gaussian noise. The unconditional variance of r is 0.5 + V. Let's say we're forecasting r with a model m, and that our forecast is "perfect" in that m = sin(t). Construct v = r - m, which is the forecast error, and will be ~ N(0,V). According to Bayes, we then have p(r|v) ~ p(v|r)*p(r), which is the the product of two Gaussian PDFs, one with variance V, the other (0.5+V). This product will itself be a Gaussian with total variance T = 1/(1/V + 1/(0.5+V)). The funny thing is that T Thank you in advance, -Jesse whuber, a derivation of the product of two Gaussian pdfs is from https://people.ok.ubc.ca/jbobowsk/phys327/Gaussian%20Convolution.pdf . The formula for the variance I gave, 1 / (1 / (V+0.5) + 1/V) seems to be accurate. Another way of writing this same expression is V*(V+0.5)/(V + (V + 0.5)) from which my equation for T/V follows directly - showing that T Perhaps you were citing the variance for the convolution of two Gaussian pdfs? The sum of the variances is correct for the convolution. I believe Bayes specifies the product, not the convolution, however, or do I have that wrong?
