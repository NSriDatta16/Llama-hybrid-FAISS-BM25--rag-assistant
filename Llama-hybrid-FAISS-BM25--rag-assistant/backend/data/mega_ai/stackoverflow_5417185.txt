Java Web Start and Folders

We currently have an Java application that can be deployed on clients or run as a shortcut from the server. We have intermittently received ClassNotFound exceptions when running the JAR from the server which looks like Windows dropping the network connection with only part of the classes from the JAR loaded (user opens a different screen then the problem is apparent). I am currently looking at the Web Start technology to allow us to run a single shortcut. However the application has several folders it requires to be in the same folder the JAR is launched (for configuration, logs, etc.). These folders will require full access for all users to allow them to write log files. There are lots of configuration files under the configuration folder hierarchy. The application also requires access to environment user settings (such as getting their user folder). It also requires certain command line parameters (including which folder to use for configuration, log file location, java memory usage, etc.) Edit The application also contains a reference to 2 signed JARs. These are: jh.jar mail.jar It looks like these are signed by SUN Microsystems. jh is used for help integration in our application whilst mail is used for email integration. I have now downloaded the latest versions of these files from java2s.com which do not have the signed equivalents. end edit The application is developed in Netbeans which compiles a single JAR file and copies the dependant JARs to the dist/lib folder. I enabled the Web Start functionality in Netbeans for the application and it generates the JNLP file. Bearing everything in mind is Web Start the way to go for an application like this? Can you include folders in a Web Start deployment? I could not find anything to do this in the XML structure for a JNLP file. Cheers, Andez
