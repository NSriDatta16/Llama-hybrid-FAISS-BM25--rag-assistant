NUnit with VS 2010 is no longer stopping at breakpoints

The answer to this has got to be simple, but I sure don't see it. I'm working on an MVC2 project under VS2010, with Unit tests written in NUnit. I debug the tests (and code) by starting the NUnit GUI, then clicking Debug -> Attach To Process in VS, and attaching to nunit-agent. This has all worked fine for some time. I added one additional test for a bug that I discovered this morning, and suddenly, my breakpoints are not being hit. NUnit just runs merrily along and says the test passes (which it shouldn't, since I haven't fixed the bug yet), without ever stopping at the breakpoint I have set on the very first executable line in the test method. I've looked at everything I can think of, including rebooting the machine, and I can't figure out what has changed. (FWIW, the test project is configured to run under .NET 3.5, and I'm running NUnit 2.5.4. I have added the 4.0 "supportedRuntime" flag and "loadFromRemoteResources" flag to the section of nunit.exe.config, and I have also tried attaching to nunit.exe instead of nunit-agent.exe. Note that I am NOT getting the disabled breakpoint buttons with the "source code cannot be loaded" messages. The breakpoints are the standard red ball, they just never get hit.)
