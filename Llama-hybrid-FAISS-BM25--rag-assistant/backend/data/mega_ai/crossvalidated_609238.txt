What is the "grid" in Bayesian grid approximations?

I tried looking for my specific question, but I only found partially related questions here , here , and here . I think my question is much simpler than what was asked and answered in these queries. I'm working through Statistical Rethinking by McElreath and there is a portion where they explain grid approximation for Bayesian statistics. The author uses this code to generate and plot the data, though I've made some minor formatting changes so it's more readable: #### Define Grid #### p_grid This is the plot: Conceptually, I get most of what is going on here. The code creates a flat prior, a likelihood of a result based off given arguments, and a resulting prior distribution. But my main question is what the grid here does. I know that p_grid takes a 20 number sequence from 0 to 1, but I don't quite understand why this is done.
