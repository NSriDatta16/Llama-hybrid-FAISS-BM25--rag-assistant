In PHP you could do it like this: $array = array(//an array of numbers); $average = array_sum($array) / count($array); With multiple groups of numbers you can do something like: $array = array( array(array of numbers, group1), array(array of numbers, group2), //etc. ); foreach($array as $numbers) { $average[] = array_sum($numbers) / count($numbers); } Unless you're looking for the median or mode. Ah, I see what you're asking now, you're not asking how to find the average, you're asking how to group the numbers up and find the average of each group. Lets see, you'd have to find the mode, $counts = array_count_values($array)); array_keys(max($counts)); will do that and the keys in $counts will be the values of the original array, with the values in $counts being the number of times that each number shows up. Then you need to figure out where the bigger gaps in the keys in $counts are. You could also array_unique() the array original array and find the gaps in the values. Wish my statistics teacher had done a bit more than play poker with us, or I could probably figure out the exact statistical method to determine how big the range checked to determine the groups should be.
