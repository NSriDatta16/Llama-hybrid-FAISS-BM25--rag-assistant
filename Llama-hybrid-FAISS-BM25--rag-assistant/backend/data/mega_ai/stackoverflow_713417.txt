The answer is really easy: It's pretty safe to say that it won't be possible in the next two decades. Before that we will probably get good translation tools. The last time I checked, the AI guys were struggling to identify the same car on two photographs shot from a slightly altered angle. Take a look on how long it took them to get good enough OCR or speech recognition together. Those are recognition problems which can benefit greatly from dictionaries and are still far from having completely reliable solutions despite of the multi-million man months thrown at them. That being said you could simply add an "offensive?" link next to user generated contend and have a mod cross check the incoming complaints. edit: I forgot something: IF you are going to implement some kind of filter, you will need a reliable one. If your solution would be 50% right, 2000 out of 4000 users with decent images will get blocked. Expect an outrage.
