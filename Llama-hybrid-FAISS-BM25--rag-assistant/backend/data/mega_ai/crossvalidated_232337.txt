ARIMA model not capturing the seasonality

I am trying to forecast the leakage rate through seals. Raw data consists of measurements of data which was recorded every second for 60 minutes. The frequency here is 60. To start with I used the first 30 minutes data to find the model that could predict the next 5 minutes data. What does seasonality in this data mean? I believe the model found using auto.arima function is not capturing the seasonality. Is seasonality in this data significant or should I remove them from the time series? If I had to include them in the model, how can I do so?
