there are several approaches you could make: Using vector paths and translation matricies together with two algorithms, The A* (a star) algorithm ( to locate best routes from what are called greedy functions ), and the "nearest neighbour" algorithm --- these are both commonly used for comparing path efficiencies for routes. you may not know it but the issue you have is known as the "travelling salesman" problem and has many many approaches. so look up traveling salesman problem A* Nearest neighbour also look at Random walk algorithm - for the most basic approach for a learned behaviour approach try neural networks "ANN" or genetic algorithms the mathematics for this type of problem are covered under what is called "graph theory"
