Treat the problem as an array of bayesian probabilities; initially, assume there's a 1/13 chance that the child is just below each level and, for completeness, a 1/13 chance they're off the top. Then: 1) Find the median level of your array i.e. the the level where the probability of being above it is closest to 50% 2) Ask the child a question from that level. 3) Use Bayes' Rule to update each cell's probability, assuming a 25% error rate. Terminate and return the most likely level when one cell hits a sufficiently high probability, or I guess when you run out of questions on a level. A more rigorous treatment of this algorithm is here ; I recommend reading it before implementing.
