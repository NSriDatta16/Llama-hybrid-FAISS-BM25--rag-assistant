I've come up with a solution to my own problem. It's not perfect, but it's alright. Since these are just ViewModels, there's not logic in them. So, I changed class DocumentViewModel to interface IDocumentViewModel and, voil√† , problem solved. I'd still like to get this working for inheriting classes, but that's more my stubbornness than any business case.
