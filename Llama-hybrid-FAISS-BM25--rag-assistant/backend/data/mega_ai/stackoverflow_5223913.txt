Drag and Drop icon question

I am dragging item from a datagrid and while dragging I could see all of the columns in the selected record, being getting dragged. However I only want to show one column (maybe name or id of the record)? Is there a way to achieve this? Also, could I show an icon or image instead of the record while dragging. Thanks Guys.
