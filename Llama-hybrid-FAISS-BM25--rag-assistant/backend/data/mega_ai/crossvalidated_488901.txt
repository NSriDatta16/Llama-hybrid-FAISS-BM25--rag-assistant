While you say we want unbiased estimators of the causal effect, generally we are interested in obtaining an accurate/precise estimate of a quantity of interest. When offered a range of estimators to choose from, a sensible selection criterion is to choose one that minimizes the expected loss, where loss is due to the estimation error. A convenient special case is square (quadratic) loss. Due to the bias-variance trade-off , a biased estimator may have lower expected squared error (lower expected loss) and thus higher precision/accuracy than an unbiased one. Bayesian methods take advantage of that as they introduce bias into their estimators but simultaneously achieve a reduction in variance. If the trade-off is favorable as compared to an unbiased estimator, i.e. the reduction in variance outweighs the squared bias, this looks like a good-enough reason for opting for Bayesian estimation. This applies not only to estimators of causal effects but also more generally.
