If using the file system is not possible, consider storing your images in cloud storage such as Amazon S3 . You can configure S3 objects so that they're public read but private write, so that only your software can add images to S3 but anyone on the web can view them. Depending on your security requirements, you can either encode the S3 secret keys in your WinForms app to construct PUT URL's or create a simple web service on the app server that authenticates the user and uses the secret keys on the server to create PUT URL's. The PUT URL's can then be returned to the client, which can use to upload the image data. Using S3, you'd then upload the images using HTTP PUT and both the editor and web browser would access the images as usual using HTTP GET. There are C# libraries available and plenty of sample code on the web for access to S3. You could actually do the same with your HTML data as well. Note that there are costs associated with S3 ( see pricing ) but assuming the costs are within bounds it's a great solution to this type of problem.
