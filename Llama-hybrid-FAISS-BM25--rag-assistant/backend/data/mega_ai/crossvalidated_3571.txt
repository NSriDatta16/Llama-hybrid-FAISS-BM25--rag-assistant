Here is another thought that is inspired by Stephan's answer : If some of your correlated regressors are meaningfully related (e.g., they are different measures of intelligence i.e., verbal, math etc) then you can create a single variable that measures the same variable using one of the following techniques: Sum the regressors (appropriate if the regressors are components of a whole, e.g., verbal IQ + math IQ = Overall IQ) Average of the regressors (appropriate if the regressors are measuring the same underlying construct e.g., size of left shoe, size of right shoe to measure length of feet) Factor analysis (to account for errors in measurements and to extract a latent factor) You can then drop all the correlated regressors and replace them with the one variable that emerges from the above analysis.
