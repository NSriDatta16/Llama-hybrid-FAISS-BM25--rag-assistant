Ward, k-means, and another method?

I conducted both Ward and k-means clustering. The main results were the same, but some results were different, affecting the cluster's interpretation. In such cases, it would be better to report both results, but if I perform another method, and if its result is the same as the result of Ward or k-means, then either interpretation could be robust. Would you please let me know if there is any recommended third method, perhaps from recently developed methods? I would like to use methods other than traditional methods such as simple, average, complete, etc.
