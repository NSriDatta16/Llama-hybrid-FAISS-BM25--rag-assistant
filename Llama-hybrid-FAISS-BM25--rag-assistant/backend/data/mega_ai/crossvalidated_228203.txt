Large time series

I have time series data, of some numerical measure. The time interval is in seconds (although I have gaps in the data - missing values). I have data from 2 consecutive months, while for each month I have all the days, and 24 hours a day. For each hour, I have 60 minutes, and for each minute I have values for the seconds. This sums up to a series with over 1 million observations. The question I need to answer is: Given a history of 20 seconds, is it possible to predict the rate of the numerical variable in the next 10 seconds? My variables are: Time variable (date+time), Month, Day, Hour and Minute (all extracted from the time variable), and the numerical variable itself. I am not sure how to approach this problem. Can you give me some advice please? So far I even failed in visually looking at it, the statistical software can't plot it due to the size of it.
