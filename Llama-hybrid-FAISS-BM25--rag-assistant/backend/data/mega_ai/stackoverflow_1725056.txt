There is no elegant way of representing a nice HTML tree structure in Javascript using strings. You will simply have to use a bunch of concatenation, which is always going to be ugly, and might I add that it performs terribly. This is what I do: Write my markup in my favorite editor with all the whitespace I want Save it in the same location as your JS file, with the same name + ".txt" as the extension My editor has find-and-replace with RegEx, so I do a replace-all with something like >[\s]* Copy the one-lined result over to my Javascript file as a string variable Undo the replace on the .txt file This implies, of course, that any time you change the markup you will need to re-do the replace and copy it over. I got into that habit pretty quickly, though. Additionally, jQuery will be able to process this faster because there will be less characters to parse.
