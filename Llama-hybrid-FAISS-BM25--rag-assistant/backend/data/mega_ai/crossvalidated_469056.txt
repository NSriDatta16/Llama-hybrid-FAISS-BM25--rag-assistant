What test should I use to check whether these two groups are statistically different?

I am writing my dissertation on the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on air quality. I am comparing air quality data from the first fourth months (January, February, March, and April) of 2020 with data that has been averaged from the last 3 years (2017, 2018, 2019) within the same months. So I have data for 2020 Jan, Feb, March, April and averaged data from the last 3 years (also Jan, Feb, March, April). I want to see whether there is a statistically significant difference between those two time categories (2020 and 'pre-2020' so to speak). So I checked whether the data is normally distributed using Shapiro-Wilk. My 'pre-2020' data is normally distributed for all 4 months My 2020 data is normally distributed for January, March, April but February is not normally distributed. I am therefore confused about which (Wilcoxon Signed or dependent t-test or other) test to do from here. side note: i'm assuming the previous years air quality affects the subsequent years', and therefore the two categories are not independent
