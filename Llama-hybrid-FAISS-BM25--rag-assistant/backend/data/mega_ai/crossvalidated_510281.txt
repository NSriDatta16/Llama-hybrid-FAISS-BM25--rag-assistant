Functional PCA for stationary signal

I just came across this technique: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_principal_component_analysis As far as I understand, if projects a signal onto a functional subspace that describe the "modes" with largest variation. These modes $f(t)$ are eigenfunctions of the correlation $G(s,t)=E[X(s)X(t)]$ . I was just wondering if for stationary signals, where $G(s,t)$ depends only on $s-t$ , this framework is equivalent to a Fourier decomposition on some discrete selected frequencies $\omega_k$ . My conjecture comes from the fact that in reciprocal space the operator $G(s,t)$ , depending only on time differencies, should be multipicative, even if than I am a bit confused on how to find the frequencies, if this is the case.. Maybe in such a case we have an infinite number of eigenvectors ( $e^{i\omega t}$ ), each one with a different eigenvalue ( equal to $\tilde G(\omega)$ ) ? But than how can such a PCA version be useful ? If the statement, or one variation of it, is true, is there some Python/R framework implementing this ?
