Without going into the details here, while it is technically possible to estimate essentially any model using just MCMC methods (e.g. the Metropolisâ€“Hastings algorithm), these methods can take an incredibly long time for particular models, particularly in cases with lots of parameters and complex dependencies between parameters. This is the case for state-space models, because your estimate of the state at time $t$ is influenced by your estimate of the state at times $t-1$ and $t+1$ . This is why more complicated, specialised techniques like the Kalman filter (or particle filters) are useful. They use information about the structure of the model to more efficiently (in terms of computation time) estimate the parameters than generic MCMC would.
