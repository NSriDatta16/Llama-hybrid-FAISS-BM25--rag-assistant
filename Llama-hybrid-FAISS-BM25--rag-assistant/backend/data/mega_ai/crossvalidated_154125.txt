I would not use (simple) Poisson regression for this data. Given that in both groups, you have the vast majority of subjects not having any infection, describing this with a Poisson model seems a little backwards; you're not getting much more information out of your data, unless something is an extreme outlier (i.e a subject with 10 infections). So basically, the only extra power you get is that you can now allow outliers to have heavy leverage. But the only times you'll have heavy outliers is when the model doesn't fit well and shouldn't be trusted anyways! In my head, this makes for a lose-lose scenario (or at least lose-tie scenario). If you really wanted to allow number of counts to have influence, you can try something like a zero-inflated Poisson. But my guess is that this is more modeling than you are going to care for, and it's likely not to add any power (unless you really think that conditional on the treatments not preventing infection overall at different rates, it still reduces number of infections at different rates. To me that seems odd.) So I'd suggest just sticking to odds ratios, unless the data's more complicated than I'm seeing.
