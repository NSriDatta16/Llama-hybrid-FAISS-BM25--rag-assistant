Forget of PCA for now. You don't need PCA here. k-means clustering (and Ward) are based on the idea of minimizing the sum-of-squares; and that value is related to variance. There are different kinds of variance. Here you need the simple one, although it supposedly is biased. For large data, the difference doesn't matter. To understand that statement, assume variance is the simple $$1/N \sum_{x_i\in S} ||x_i - \mu_S||^2$$ And not N-1. But now when looking at clusters, you want a cluster with many objects to have more influence. So for N objects, you take N times the variance. I.e., you take simply the sum of squares. The proper version of the equation is total-SSQ = within-cluster-SSQ + inbetween-clusters-SSQ = constant It says that minimizing the SSQ (and equivalent, minimizing variance of a cluster) increases the separation of clusters; and conversely.
