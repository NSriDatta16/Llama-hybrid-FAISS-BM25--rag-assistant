You will either have to draw the grip yourself or knock out the lower-right corner of your background. Given that your view is flush with the edges of the window, I'd just draw it myself and be done with it. Only trouble is I believe you'll have to handle drag-to-resize yourself if you do it this way (don't quote me, though). If so, you'll have to create an NSTrackingArea for that corner and handle drags in that area as window frame changes (size and origin).
