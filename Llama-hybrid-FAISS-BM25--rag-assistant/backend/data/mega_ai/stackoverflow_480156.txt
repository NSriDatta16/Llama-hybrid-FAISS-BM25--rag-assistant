How do I tell if a Drag Drop has ended in Winforms?

How do I tell is a Drag Drop has ended WinForms .net. I need to stop part of my form from refreshing it's view of data when a drag drop is in progress. I have tried using a flag but I don't seem to be capturing all the events I need to to keep the flag in sync with the progress of drag drop. Specifically I can't tell when the drag drop operation ends without a drag drop being completed, i.e. when the user drops the item on a control with allow drop = false, or when the user presses the ESC key. I have seen this question:- Check if a drag&drop is in progress But it doesn't address my issue satisfactorily (if someone gives me the answer to this question I'll answer that one with the answer together with what I already have).
