Make sure also to use block-level caching for the sites. Beyond this, one of the suggestions that I've seen implemented is to change dynamic blocks (such as blocks that grab product data dynamically) over to statically defined HTML if they don't change often. Once you've coded a site, tune it using YSlow and Firebug to make sure that as many files as possible are cached, and that the page size is minimized. Minimizing the number of HTTP requests to Apache will increase the capacity of your server. Finally, enable the flat catalog and flat category functions in Magento. This will force Magento to use fewer joins when retrieving catalog data, so your database load will go down and speed will increase considerably. Hope that helps! Thanks, Joe
