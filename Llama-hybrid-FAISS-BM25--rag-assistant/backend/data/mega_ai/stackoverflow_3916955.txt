Magento payment method with third party gateway

In the checkout process of Magento, I use only the credit card method. In the last step, I need to send all the information collected to an external url at my payment gateway. All the data is processed by the third party gateway, then redirects to my Magento website with the result of the operation. What should I do to achieve this? Where should I start to look? Do i need to modify the magento payment module code?
