Edit For some reason I thought this was tagged Microsoft SQL Server. I think the answer is still relevant though That's why the official recommendation is Use char when the sizes of the column data entries are consistent. Use varchar when the sizes of the column data entries vary considerably. Use varchar(max) when the sizes of the column data entries vary considerably, and the size might exceed 8,000 bytes. It's a trade off you need to consider when designing your table structure. Probably you would need to consider the frequency of updates vs reads in this calculation too Worth noting that for char a NULL value still uses all the storage space. There is an addin for Management Studio called SQL Internals Viewer that allows you to see easily how your rows are stored.
