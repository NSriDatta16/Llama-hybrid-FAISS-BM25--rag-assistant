Does zero_as_missing parameter affects categorical features? LightGBM

Dealing with categorical features while training LightGBM model implies encoding them as integers and providing categorical_feature parameter with their indices or names. LightGBM documentation says that: Tree decision rule works best when categorical features are presented by consecutive integers starting from zero and all negative values will be treated as missing values My question is: when zero_as_missing parameter is set, does it refer only to continuous features, and categorical will still be considered missing if their value is negative? zero_as_missing ï¸Ž, default = false, type = bool set this to true to treat all zero as missing values (including the unshown values in LibSVM / sparse matrices)
