Variable selection and validation dataset

According to Hastie & Tibshirani, we shouldn't use validation datasets to do variable selection; otherwise, we will overestimate the model fit. However, it seems quite often to select variables using validation or cross-validation. For instance, SAS enterprise miner allows us to select variables based on validation data r2 values, and it seems that this is the method SAS encourages us to use. What's the difference here?
