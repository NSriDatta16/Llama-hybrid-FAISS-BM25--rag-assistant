BNN predictive distribution $p(y(x)|D) = \int p(y(x)|w)p(w|D) dw$, what is $p(y(x)|w)$?

When we use approximation methods to try to approximate the predictive distribution, I am slightly troubled by $p(y(x)|D) = \int p(y(x)|w)p(w|D) dw$ . Since $y(x) = f(w, x)$ (as $y(x)$ is the neural network model) and $x$ is a fixed input - so surely $p(y(x)|w)$ is deterministic and therefore a point distribution? More generally can someone explain what $p(y(x)|w)$ actually is in the context of bayesian neural networks?
