After struggling in the comments to wrap my head around how to model this thing, I realized there is a non-sexy brute force way to do it. It doesn't take advantage of the times of delivery/arrival -- it's just a simple weighted average coming from the daily counts. Construct a table from historical data in which every row is one "day-in-shipment", and we have two columns: one for days_since_shipment and one for days_until_delivery . If a package was out for 5 days, this table should have 5 rows for that package. One with days_since_shipment = 0 and days_until_delivery = 5, then 1 & 4, etc. Calculate "conditional probabilities" of days_until_delivery given days_since_shipment . For each unique value of days_since_shipment , we want to know what % had days_until_delivery == 0, and what % had days_until_delivery == 1, etc. Calculate weighted average using current data Let's say #2 gives us the following for packages that have been our for shipment for 2 days: Probability of delivery in 1 more day (i.e., day 3): 45% Probability of delivery in 2 more days (i.e., day 4): 30% Probability of delivery in 3 more days (i.e., day 5): 25% Then, each package that has been out for 2 days contributes 0.45 to tomorrow's estimate, 0.30 to the next day's estimate, and 0.25 to the next next day's estimate. Repeat the process for all other values of days_since_shipment . edit: If you have any predictor variables, then you may want to look into a regression solution. Are these packages all being shipped from and to the same places? Or is there some kind of variation in this (sometimes shipped across 5 miles, sometimes shipped across 500 miles)? If that is true, then I think modeling this only as a function of "time since shipment" (whether through my approach or LmnICE's) is pretty limited. Ideally, you would take the "time since shipment" into account along with any other potentially useful predictors.
