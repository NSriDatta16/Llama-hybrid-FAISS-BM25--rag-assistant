How do I port code that contains #pragma optimize( "a" ) from VC++7 to VC++9?

I'm moving my C++ codebase from Visual Studio 2k3 to Visual Studio 2k8. Code contains #pragma optimize( "a", on ) MSDN says that it means "assume no aliasing". Later versions of VS refuse to compile this and MSDN doesn't seem to say what to do with code containing this #pragma. What does "assume no aliasing" mean and how to I make a decision on what to do with this line of code?
