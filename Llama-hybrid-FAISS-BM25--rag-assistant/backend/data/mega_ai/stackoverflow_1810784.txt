Bots usually doesn't parse Javascript, so your ajax code won't be instantly executed. And if they even do, bots usually doesn't maintain sessions/cookies as well. Knowing that, you could reject the request if it is invoked without a valid session/cookie (which is obviously set on the server side beforehand by the request on the parent page). This does not protect you from human hazard though. The safest way is to restrict access to users with a login/password. If that is not your intent, well, then you have to live with the fact that it's a public application. You could of course scan logs and maintian blacklists with IP addresses and useragents, but that goes extreme.
