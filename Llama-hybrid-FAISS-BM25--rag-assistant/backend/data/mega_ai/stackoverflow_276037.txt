Instead of creating a wrapper class around your List, have you considered creating an extension class (assuming you're using C# 3) public static class MyExtensions { public static float GetAverage(this List ) { // implementation } public static float GetTotal(this List ) { // implementation } } Of course, your properties become method calls ( maybe C# 4 will fix this ), but you would eliminate the wrapper entirely.
