Distribution comparison across different treatments

if I have a table like this In which, site = different sites of measurement (tissue or organ) type = different types of virus And I want to ask something about the data 1.What test can I use to test if the distribution of type is similar within site 1, site 2, site 3, etc. It looks similar, but I don't know to proof it statistically. To compare between two sites, I think we can use chi square goodness of fit test, but what if I want to do it simultaneously across all sites ? 2.Is there any ways to tell us that the distribution of type is dominated by only one type ? For example in this data set, we can observe that type 2 is the most dominant type across all sites. How can we do it statistically ? Thanks
