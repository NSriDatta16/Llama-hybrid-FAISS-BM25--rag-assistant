first you can set a MaxWidth on your treeview to avoid this vertical scrolling stuff. second, if you are actually adding a Tree item to your tree you can set the text, than register to the loaded event of the control, check his actual size and do the text modification. but the most elegant thing you can do in my opinion is work with data binding and hie hierarchical data template and a converter that will trim the text for you(you can send the tree item to the converter) hope this will help you
