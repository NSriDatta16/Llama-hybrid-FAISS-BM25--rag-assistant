I have recently done exactly this and found the two most valuable books to be: CLR via C# by Jeffrey Richter . Very well written and gives a great insight into the .net runtime - lots on the concepts you will already know from java such as garbage collection, threading, generics, etc. Plus really good in depth coverage of c# constructs like delegates and events that don't come with java (yet). and Pro C# and the .net 3.5 Platform by Andrew Troelsen . This is much more of a general text on the .net ecosystem. It has an excellent core language section, but then also gives a really good overview of the major libraries and apis - WPF, WCF, ASP.net, etc. Those should provide you a solid foundation and are both pitched perfectly for the experienced programmer. After that, you'll probably end up looking for something more specific to the technology you are working in - a detailed ASP.net book in your case - but I constantly refer to both of these, so it is money well spent imho.
