Since this is already answered. I have to mention when working with CLR languages, CLR/.NET Framework Integration sets MS SQL Server 2005/2008 apart from the rest. Following excerpt from here . By using languages such as Visual Basic .NET and C#, you can capitalize on CLR integration to write code that has more complex logic and is more suited for computation tasks. Additionally, Visual Basic .NET and C# offer object-oriented capabilities such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. You can easily organize related code into classes and namespaces, which means that you can more easily organize and maintain your code investments when you are working with large amounts of code. The ability to logically and physically organize code into assemblies and namespaces is a huge benefit that enables you to better find and relate different pieces of code in a large database implementation.
