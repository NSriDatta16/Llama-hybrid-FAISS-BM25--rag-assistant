I've encountered similar, and discovered several answers of which none has yet proven satisfactory. The media scanner runs in response to the system fired broadcast Intent ACTION_MEDIA_MOUNTED, which happens during boot. So 1st thing to check is reboot. From what I understand, the scanner will also will also run after Settings > Manage Applications > Media Storage > Clear Data - and re-populate the mediastore from the storage. I tried that and it worked without I'll effect.. I can't guarantee safety of course and wouldn't do this on a non-dev device. You can also manually mContext.sendBroadcast(new Intent(Intent.ACTION_MEDIA_MOUNTED, Uri.parse ("file://" + Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory()))); and put up some kind of notice while watching for the broadcast of intent ACTION_MEDIA_SCANNER_FINISHED. If you are importing media yourself, check out MediaScannerConnection to kick the scanner. Oh, and if you plan to go to devices such as Google's Nexus, you'll need to deal with INTERNAL_CONTENT_URI.
