Bayesian network to factor graph

I have a bayesian network with conditional probabilities as given by the diagram and I have converted it to factor graph. I just sort of read about factor graphs. Can someone be kind enough to let me know if I have done the factor graph representation correctly? I really appreciate your help. EDIT: After the comments, I thought about this again and came up with the following to express the joint distribution $$ P(w, \lambda, \phi | y) = P(y|w,\phi) \times P(w|\lambda) \times P(\lambda) \times P(\phi) $$ I hope it is correct. Note that $y$ is observed. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
