When the ACF is estimated from data I think also the error should be directly computed from the same data. I think that is generally the safest and most conservative approach. I would just store the resulting products of the signal with itself after each shift in the row of a matrix. Then you have the full distribution of values at each shift. Computing the column-wise average and the std/sem gives you a estimate of the AC and its variation. Bootstrapping and other resampling procedures on that matrix enable you to estimate the confidence intervals. This has the advantage that there are no special assumptions to be made and it can always be made compatible with your specific AC computation (normalization, padding etc.).
