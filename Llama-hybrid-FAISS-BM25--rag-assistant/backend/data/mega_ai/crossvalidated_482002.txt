Testing the same parameter across different models with the same covariates

Say I have three logistic regression models, with the same covariates in each model, but different outcome. Each model is structured as $Y_{ij} = \beta_{j0} + \beta_{j1}*Age + \beta_{j2}*Weight$ , where $Y_{ij}$ represents the $j^{th}$ outcome of interest for individual $i$ . I want to test the null hypothesis that $\beta_{j1} = 0$ in all three models (that is, for $j = 1,2,3$ - testing that age has no effect on outcome 1, 2, or 3). Is this possible in a single hypothesis test? Or would I have to run three separate hypothesis tests, one for each model? Is it theoretically feasible for a null hypothesis to span across three models like this, and can one single p-value for this hypothesis be reported? Clarification: The individuals in the study, and their covariates, are the same across the three models. Only the outcome is changing.
