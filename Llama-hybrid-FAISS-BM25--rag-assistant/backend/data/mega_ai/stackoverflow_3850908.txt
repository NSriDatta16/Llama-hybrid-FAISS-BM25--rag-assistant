A really good example I found is Riak , a distributed key-value store based on Amazon's Dynamo and built using Erlang and OTP. The tunable CAP controls let you dynamically "choose" your levels of consistency and availability; it chooses to focus on the A and P of CAP, which makes it eventually consistent. Riak is open-source, and there are a number of good articles online regarding its implementation. Another good example is Dynomite , PowerSet's Dynamo-clone-in-Erlang. Although the project has been dead for a while, it serves as a useful functional design document on how to build a Dynamo clone. These two projects are themselves based on Amazon's Dynamo , an incrementally scalable, highly-available key-value storage system. The technology is designed to give its users the ability to trade-off cost, consistency, durability and performance, while maintaining high-availability. The paper is a good read.
