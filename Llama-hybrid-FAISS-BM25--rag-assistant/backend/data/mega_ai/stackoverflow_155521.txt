Note that the Java Beans specification details a version-independent serialization method which allows for strong backwards-compatibility. It also results in readable "serialized" forms. In fact a serialized object can be created pretty easily using the mechanism. Look up the documentation to the XMLEncoder and XMLDecoder classes. I wouldn't use this for passing an object over the wire necessarily (though if high performance is a requirement,I wouldn't use serialization either) but it's invaluable for persistent object storage.
