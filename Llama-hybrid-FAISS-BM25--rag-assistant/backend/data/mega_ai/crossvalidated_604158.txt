Transformer model for statement consistency / stance detection

As an escience support programmer, I often get requests for research questions on checking a corpus for stances, or consistency with a particular statement. For example, one might wonder which news articles, tweets, etc are consistent with a statement like "Inflation is driven by fear" or with "Inflation is driven by lack of supply". This can give statistical insights in particular narratives. Question-answering models usually fail here, since it's hard to formulate such stances as an open question that would reference a particular part in the source. Sentence similarity or cosine similarity on embedding vectors usually measure similarity rather than consistency, and might easily break on negations. Furthermore, stance detection usually is trained on just one specific stance like anti-EU or pro-choice. I'd like to consider consistency asymmetrically, since "the flowers are red" is consistent with "the flowers are red and it rains", but not vice versa since the first statement doesn't state that it rains - although you could argue whether consistency is a valid term in this case. Are there models or machine learning tasks that measure consistency between sentences, or consistency of a sentence (statement) with a source text?
