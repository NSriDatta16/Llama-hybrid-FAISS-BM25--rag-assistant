More important than the algorithm is having an existing corpus of labeled data. Most ML algorithms need to train on a huge amount of text before they start producing useful results (for example a NLP algorithm was trained to generate fiction by reading the entire Harry Potter series). Do you have a list of known good and bad e-mail addresses? You can still try to group email addresses even if your data isn’t labeled, but it’s harder.
