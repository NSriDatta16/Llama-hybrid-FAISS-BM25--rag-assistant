Application gets too slow while drawing two bitmaps on a Canvas !

I have two bitmap overlapped .The top bitmap is transparent and when user touch to screen i copy pixels from another bitmap to top bitmap.My goal is to give to users the feeling of erasing image with touching to see another image.However it is not working properly especially when user drags his finger too fast on the screen.I made a few tests and i beleive drawing bitmaps to the canvas every time cause the lag but i don't know how to fix it.
