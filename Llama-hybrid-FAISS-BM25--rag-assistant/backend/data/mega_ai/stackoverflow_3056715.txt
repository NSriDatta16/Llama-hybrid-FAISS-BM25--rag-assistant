How can I detect whether a user has installed a specific iPhone app via JavaScript?

I'd like to build a mobile Web app that: If my iPhone app is already installed, launches it by redirecting to a URL handled by the app If my iPhone app is not installed, displays a web page encouraging users to download it from the App Store The problem is, I don't know how to detect whether the app is installed before redirecting. Does anyone know a trick for doing this? Maybe a JavaScript hack of some sort, leveraging the App registered URL in an iframe or similar?
