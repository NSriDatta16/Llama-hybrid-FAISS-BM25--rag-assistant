Adding variables to the model one by one, or at the same time

What are the benefits of adding the variables into a model one by one, as compared to adding them all at the same time? As I see in most research, the first model that is tested is consisted of all the control variables, then in the second model the first predictor is added, then the second one, and so on, until all predictors are in the model. Are there any benefits in using this approach, or would it be ok to have just do two models - one with just the controls, and one with controls + all other predictors. (p.s.) - am interested in this with regards to logistic regression
