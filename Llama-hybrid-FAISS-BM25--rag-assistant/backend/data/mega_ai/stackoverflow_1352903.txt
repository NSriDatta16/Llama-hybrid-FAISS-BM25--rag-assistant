I don't consider my personals need to be paramount here -- if I've written the code, I'm already better placed to retrace it in the future if and when that's needed, than anybody else; so it's the "anybody else" I put first and foremost -- a present or future teammate that will need to understand the code (ideally) as thoroughly as I do. Besides, with mandatory code reviews as a prereq to committing ANYthing to the codebase (an excellent practice, and the unfailing rule at my present employer), I'm likely to be called up on it should I ever let my attention slip (it does happen -- which is why I LOVE those mandatory code reviews, as applied to myself as well as everybody else!-). A "variable set only once at startup" is a special-enough case that may be worth adding to your team's guidelines -- treating it as "closer to a constant than a variable" may make a lot of sense, but that only helps if the same rule/guideline is used consistently across the codebase. If the rule is not there I would check if there's consensus about adding it; otherwise, I would NOT break the guidelines for the sake of my personal tastes... that's the root of "egoless programming" and "team ownership of the codebase", two principles I serve with burning ardor. BTW, were I on a single-person team in terms of coding guidelines (it happens, though it's not an optimal situation;), I think I'd have no trouble gaining unanimous consensus by myself that treating "set-once at startup" variables as constants in terms of naming conventions!-). But with a larger team, that's more work, and it could go either way.
