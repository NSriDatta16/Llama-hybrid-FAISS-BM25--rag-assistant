I would argue that the solution to your problem would be to establish best practices for source code modification. Discourage people from going into UI code and arbitrarily jiggling the components around in the designer. Any reasonable UI modifications should be easily mergeable. Your best bet is to try and educate people as to the best way to merge in any given source control system. Also, as helpful as the designer is, ignorance of what code is being automatically generated in the background will be significantly detrimental in the long-term. People who insist on locking checked-out files for the reasons you stated in your post typically wait long periods of time to check their code in. Naturally, the more time passes, the more code gets modified, so it makes merging difficult for these people. Checking in early, often, and incrementally requires people to think about their changes in stages, and for some coders, this is a rather painful cultural/psychological adjustment.
