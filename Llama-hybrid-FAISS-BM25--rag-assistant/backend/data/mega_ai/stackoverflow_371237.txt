Generating sets of integers in C#

In F#, you can generate a set of numbers, just by saying [1..100]. I want to do something similar in C#. This is what I have come up with so far: public static int[] To(this int start, int end) { var result = new List (); for(int i = start; i By doing this, I can now create a set by saying 1.To(100) Unfortunately, this is not nearly as readable as [1..100]. Has anyone come up with a better way to do this in C#? Is it more readable if it is lowercase? 1.to(100), for instance? Or, is "To" a bad word? Is something like 1.Through(100) more readable? Just looking for some thoughts. Has anyone else come up with a more elegant solution? EDIT: After reading the responses, I have re-written my To method using the range: public static int[] To(this int start, int end) { return Enumerable.Range(start, end - start + 1).ToArray(); } I am still looking for thoughts on the readability of 1.To(100)
