my understanding was that it had little to do with CPU, but the latency in opening of repeated sockets to the other side of the world. even if you have infinite bandwidth, connect latency will slow down the whole process. amplified if your page has dozens of objects. even a persistent connection has a request/response latency but its reduced when you have 2 sockets as on average, one should be streaming data while the other could be blocking. Also, a router is never going to assume a socket connects before letting you write to it. It needs the full round trip handshake. again, i dont claim to be an expert, but this is how i always saw it. what would really be cool is a fully ASYNC protocol (no, not a fully sick protocol).
