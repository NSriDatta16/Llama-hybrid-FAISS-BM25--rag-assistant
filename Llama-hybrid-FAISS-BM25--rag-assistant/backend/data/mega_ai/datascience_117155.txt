What you’ve described can’t happen in math, so there’s either a missing detail, a bug in your code causing you to input something other than what you intend to input, or something wrong with the function (the last of which I find unlikely). I disagree with the sklearn implementation of $R^2$ , but for the same data set, $R^2_{1,sklearn}>R^2_{2,sklearn}\iff MSE_2>MSE_2\iff R^2_{1,Dave}>R^2_{2,Dave}$ . This is because $R^2$ , either via the sklearn implementation or that way I prefer, is a strictly decreasing function of MSE. $$R^2=1-\dfrac{MSE}{denominator}$$ (This denominator is some kind of sum of squares that is related to a model that predicts the same value every time. Your function and I disagree on what the one value should be, but you could pick $5$ or $17$ or $\pi$ as the denominator, and MSE and that definition of $R^2$ should move in opposite directions.) If you evaluate the $R^2$ of two different models but on the same data, the denominator stays the same. Thus, increasing/decreasing $R^2$ corresponds to decreasing/increasing MSE. (If your implementation of an MSE calculation involves an $n-p$ denominator instead of $n$ or $n-1$ , then the above does not apply. This could be the kind of missing detail I mentioned in the last sentence of my first paragraph.) I have answered this question on Cross Validated Stack Exchange and believe in my answer.
