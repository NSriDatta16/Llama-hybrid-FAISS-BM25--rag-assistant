Qt: Pass pointer to QObject in QMimeData

Is it possible to pass a pointer to a QObject using QMimeData during drag-and-drop operation? QMimeData only has this function for storing data: void QMimeData::setData(constQString &mimeType, const QByteArray &data) but I can't find a way to safely encode a pointer into a QByteArray. To clarify my goal: I need to pass a pointer to a QObject from a model to the target widget during the drag-and-drop operation. Edit: As far as I undrestand Mime data is all about passing application independent data from one place to another: urls, colors, html code. In my case I need to pass a pointer to a resource object eithin the application. How to you usually deal with this kind of drag-drops? Thanks Anton
