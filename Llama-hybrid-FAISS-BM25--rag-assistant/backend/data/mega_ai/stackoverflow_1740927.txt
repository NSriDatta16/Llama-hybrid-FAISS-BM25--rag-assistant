There are a few different solutions to handwriting/gesture recognition. The one that I have learnt about is with artifcial neural networks, in particular multilayer perceptron network. In a nutshell you feed in some test samples thats are correct, you then train this network and then use it to test on the new input. Similar things in flash that also use this network are those 20 question games. There are a few other ways to do it, some simpler and some probably more complicated but my knowledge on them is poor.
