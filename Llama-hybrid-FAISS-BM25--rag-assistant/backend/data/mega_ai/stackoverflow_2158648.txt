Here's what I'm thinking, you're going the wrong way about this,(unless I missed the boad on what you want to acheive) what you need to do is work with javascript to interact with the browsers url. Thjis is assuming that you want to be able to go back on a page without reloading content. Basicaly a java script would override the reloading, and when you hit back, the page doesn't reload, but the javascript notifies the flash what change in has occurred. Have a look at the gaya framework for how they do it or lookat http://www.robertpenner.com/experiments/backbutton/backbutton.html
