What exactly is the alpha in the Dirichlet distribution?

I'm fairly new to Bayesian statistics and I came across a corrected correlation measure, SparCC , that uses the Dirichlet process in the backend of it's algorithm. I have been trying to go through the algorithm step-by-step to really understand what is happening but I am not sure exactly what the alpha vector parameter does in a Dirichlet distribution and how it normalizes the alpha vector parameter? The implementation is in Python using NumPy : https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.random.dirichlet.html The docs say: alpha : array Parameter of the distribution (k dimension for sample of dimension k). My questions: How do the alphas affect the distribution?; How are the alphas being normalized?; and What happens when the alphas are not integers? import numpy as np import pandas as pd import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # Reproducibility np.random.seed(0) # Integer values for alphas alphas = np.arange(10) # array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]) # Dirichlet Distribution dd = np.random.dirichlet(alphas) # array([ 0. , 0.0175113 , 0.00224837, 0.1041491 , 0.1264133 , # 0.06936311, 0.13086698, 0.15698674, 0.13608845, 0.25637266]) # Plot ax = pd.Series(dd).plot() ax.set_xlabel("alpha") ax.set_ylabel("Dirichlet Draw")
