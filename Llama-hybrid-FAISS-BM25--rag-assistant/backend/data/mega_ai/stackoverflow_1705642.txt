How do I limit the following cursor to a specific area

I have a flash cs3 file where I want a mask to move on the y axis (up and down) when the user is scrolling over the navigation area. In my code, I have: maskMC.startdrag(); How do I limit the area where the mask will move, then make it return it back to it's original position when the user moves away from the specific area (in this case the navigation).
