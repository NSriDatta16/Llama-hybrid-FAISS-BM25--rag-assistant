They can estimate a covariance matrix because they're working with vector-valued time series. This is a time series where the value at each time point is a vector, rather than a single value. $x(t) = [x_1(t), ..., x_n(t)]$. You could also think of this as a set of multiple time series (one for each element of the vector). Equation 1 in the paper says exactly how they're getting the covariance matrix.
