Which hierarchical model is most appropriate for my data?

I would like to ask your opinion about the best way to model my problem: I have patient-level data on hospital spending per year, along with patient-level information (hospital id, hospital specialty, age, sex, prior hospital use...etc.) In addition, I have a variable on the hospital-level indicating whether or not the hospital was contracted by the insurer that year (contract=1 if contracted) I would like to run a fixed effects-type of analysis to see how a change in the contract type affects average spending per patient. I would like to see this broken down by specialty. Unfortunately, there is no patient in my dataset that received treatment both before and after a contract-type changed. Therefore, I am forced to evaluate change in average patient spending per hospital (and specialty). My initial starting point was a fixed effect: fe but this gives me an error, as I have more than one observation per hospital_id and time. So the solution has to be some kind of a multi-level setup. I am using this website to familiarize myself with multi-level modelling but I am confused about which model would best fit my situation.
