That's what I would expect to happen. The detection algorithm probably just keeps trying, in order, the encodings you specified in mb_detect_order and then returns the first one under which the bytestream would be valid. Something more intelligent requires statistical methods (I think machine learning is commonly used). EDIT: See e.g. this article for more intelligent methods. Due to its importance, automatic charset detection is already implemented in major Internet applications such as Mozilla or Internet Explorer. They are very accurate and fast, but the implementation applies many domain specific knowledges in case-by-case basis. As opposed to their methods, we aimed at a simple algorithm which can be uniformly applied to every charset, and the algorithm is based on well-established, standard machine learning techniques. We also studied the relationship between language and charset detection, and compared byte-based algorithms and character-based algorithms. We used Naive Bayes (NB) and Support Vector Machine (SVM).
