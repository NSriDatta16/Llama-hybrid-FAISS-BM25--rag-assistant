Here's the easiest way . A plain html form with enctype="multipart/form-data" and a controller action taking a HttpPostedFileBase as argument. Later if you want to get funky you could enhance it with some flash upload controls and jquery stuff and even support drag and drop from your desktop through HTML5. But the basic bare bone is a plain HTML with input type="file" elements. Remember that no matter what technique you decide always make sure to provide a fallback scenario with the basic stuff (the same way gmail does it) so that for example users sitting behind corporate firewalls or with Flash disabled would still be able to use your site. That's the only method that's guaranteed to work.
