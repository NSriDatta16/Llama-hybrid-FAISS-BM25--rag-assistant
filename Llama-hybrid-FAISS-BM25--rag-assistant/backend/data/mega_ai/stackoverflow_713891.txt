As everyone else has said don't do this; however, I was in the same boat. I have a rule that says all my tables are stored in singular form. Organization not Organizations, Asset not Assets a PartsCatalog has many Part etc. Well I have a User table so what do I call it? I ended up escaping it [User]. Now I regret that decision because I am always forgetting to escape the table; however, I've not come up with a better name yet: Member is the leading candidate.
