The 'half life of mean reversion' is the average time it will take a process to get pulled half-way back to the mean. Look at urca for the cointegration test. For half life of mean reversion check out these two articles: Exploring mean reversion and cointegration with Zorro and R: part 1 Exploring mean reversion and cointegration: part 2 The author computes the half life of mean reversion as: y
