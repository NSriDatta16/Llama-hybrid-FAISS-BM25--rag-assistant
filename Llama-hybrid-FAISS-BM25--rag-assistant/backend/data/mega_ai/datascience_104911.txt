Dataframe group certain rows

I am wondering if there is a way or I just need to loop through my dataframe to group rows where my index is greater than, in other words based in the following dataframe: import pandas as pd data = {"Name": ["Apple", "Carrot", "Pear", "Tomato", "Orage", "Pineapple", "Mandarin"],"Value": [10,5,6,3,8,9,9]} df = pd.DataFrame(data) print(df) I will get something like Name Value 0 Apple 10 1 Carrot 5 2 Pear 6 3 Tomato 3 4 Orage 8 5 Pineapple 9 6 Mandarin 9 If I sum all the values I should get 50, is there a way that I can create a "summary" of this dataframe, for instance display the first 3 and group the rest so my results looks like: Name Value 0 Apple 10 1 Carrot 5 2 Pear 6 3 Other 29 Where 29 is 50 minus (10+5+6) and other was just a random name i gave it?
