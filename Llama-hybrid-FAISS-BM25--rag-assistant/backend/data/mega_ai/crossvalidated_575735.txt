Let's look at the sum at the heart of the logistic regression: If you chose two dummy variables $Z_1, Z_2$ , that sum would include something like $\beta_1 Z_1 + \beta_2 Z_2$ with the betas your estimated parameters. Assuming you encoded your 4 categories as described, you would get: $c_1$ : $\beta_1$ (because $Z_1 = 1, Z_2$ = 0) $c_2$ : $\beta_2$ $c_3$ : $0$ $c_4$ : $\beta_1 + \beta_2$ Therefore, baked into your choice of encoding would be that the effect of category 4 is the same as the effects from category 1 and 2 combined. That's normally not what we want and therefore we need a third dummy variable.
