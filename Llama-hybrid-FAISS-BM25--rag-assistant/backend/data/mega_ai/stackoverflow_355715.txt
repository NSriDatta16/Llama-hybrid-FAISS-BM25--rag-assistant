As long as the early returns are organized as a block at the top of the function/method body, then I think they're much more readable than adding another layer of nesting. I try to avoid early returns in the middle of the body. Sometimes they're the best way, but most of the time I think they complicate. Also, as a general rule I try to minimize nesting control structures. Obviously you can take this one too far, so you have to use some discretion. Converting nested if's to a single switch/case is much clearer to me, even if the predicates repeat some sub-expressions (and assuming this isn't a performance critical loop in a language too dumb to do subexpression elimination). Particularly I dislike the combination of nested ifs in long function/method bodies, since if you jump into the middle of the code for some reason you end up scrolling up and down to mentally reconstruct the context of a given line.
