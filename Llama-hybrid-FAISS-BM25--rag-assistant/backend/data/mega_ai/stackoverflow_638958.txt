I've been having the same problem for years. And yes, I know, "always use the source view" and "programmers should just write the code." But there are times when you just want to drag a control from the toolbox and plop it on the page in design view or link a control to a datasource without typing everything out. So, definite flaw in VS. Design View is almost unusable when using Master Pages & Content Place Holders.
