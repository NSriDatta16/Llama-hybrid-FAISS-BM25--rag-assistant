If you wrap your image download & update in an NSOperation, the updates will happen as the table-view scrolls. Another benefit of NSOperation, is you can cancel the operation as the cell glides off-screen. It will feel a lot more responsive to the user.. especially if they scroll a long list quickly. The Apple tech-talk this year encouraged this technique. If your lists aren't that long, or you would prefer them to continue loading, you can manipulate the NSOperation priorities instead.
