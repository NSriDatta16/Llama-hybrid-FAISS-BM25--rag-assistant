Integrating command-line generated python .coverage files with PyDev

My build environment is configured to compile, run and create coverage file at the command line (using Ned Batchelder coverage.py tool). I'm using Eclipse with PyDev as my editor, but for practical reasons, it's not possible/convenient for me to convert my whole build environment to Eclipse (and thus generate the coverage data directly from the IDE, as it's designed to do) PyDev seems to be using the same coverage tool (or something very similar to it) to generate its coverage information, so I'm guessing there should be some way of integrating my external coverage files into Eclipse/PyDev. Any idea on how to do this?
