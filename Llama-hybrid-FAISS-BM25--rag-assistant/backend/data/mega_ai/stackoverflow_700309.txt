I think it is not exactly the right tool for the job. GlazedLists was created to support mostly Swing or SWT based UIs. You can get it to work well as a backing model for the HTML table on the server side, but you would have to create the rendering code yourself. In this URL you can see that the documentation mentions that it can be used with swing or SWT out of the box, but no HTML mentioned: http://sites.google.com/site/glazedlists/propaganda/features#TOC-Swing-or-SWT All said, however, it does make a good backing model. Creating the rendering code might not be so hard.
