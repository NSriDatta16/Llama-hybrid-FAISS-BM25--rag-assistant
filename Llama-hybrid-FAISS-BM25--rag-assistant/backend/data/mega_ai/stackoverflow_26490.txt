I essentially do the same thing Jon does, but here are a few other ideas: Use Guides in Photoshop (and lock to them). Figure out all of your dimensions for each box/ region ahead of time. Collect all of your dimensions and color hex values into an info file (I use a txt file) that you can easily reference. This will reduce your alt-tab tax and selecting colors in Photoshop multiple times. After all my Guides are in place, I slice out the entire website into my images folder, starting with photos and grouped elements, and ending with the various background tiles/images, should they exist. (Tip: Use ctrl -click on the layer preview to select that layer's content). Notes on using Photoshop: Use Guides or the Grid. Use the Notes feature for any pertinent information Always use Layer Groups for similar elements. We need to be able to turn entire regions off in one click. Put all 'header' content in one Layer Group. Always name your layers. You can put each page template in one PSD file and use nested Layer Groups to organize them. This way we don't have to setup all of our guides and notes for each page template on a site.
