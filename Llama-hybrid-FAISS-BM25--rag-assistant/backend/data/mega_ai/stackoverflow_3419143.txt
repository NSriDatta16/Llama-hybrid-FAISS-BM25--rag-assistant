The best way? Include a request in the header comment of the script saying to the effect of "if you use this script, please drop me a line at myname@email.com". Placing any hotlinks, pop-ups or any other kind of nonsense not only discourages people from using your script, but could actually impose a performance penalty and can be easily disabled. If you don't want people to use your script, don't place it anywhere where the public can get to the source. If you want people to use it, don't obsess over usage....if it becomes popular you definitely will hear from users (who will be asking for enhancements and/or bug fixes).
