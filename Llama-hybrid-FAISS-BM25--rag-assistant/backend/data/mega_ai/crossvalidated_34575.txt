Firstly, principal components and factor analysis are quite different methods. PCA is normally used more as a data reduction technique, while factor analysis is more concerned with finding a latent structure. On the cross loadings, the oblique rotation allows the factors to be correlated, but typically one would not want items to load on multiple factors. In this case, I would probably examine the factor loadings using other oblique rotations such as oblimin to see if these cross-loadings still appear. Cross loadings of below .3 are often ignored, but if you have multiple samples with the same cross-loadings, then this may be an indication that the item is indeed associated with more than one factor. Typically, these items are discarded, and I would probably do so unless you have a strong theoretical or practical rationale for retaining them. Finally, it sounds like you have two samples. In this case, I would perform EFA on your first sample, and then use the second sample to validate your model. This will raise the probability that you are modelling something real, rather than noise.
