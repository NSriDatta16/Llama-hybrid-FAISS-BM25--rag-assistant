Alternatives to Using ARIMA for forecasting

I've been dealing with mostly univariate time series data and am wondering what alternative models exist for forecasting instead of ARIMA, ARMA, AR and MA processes, I know about exponential smoothing, however it can only forecast for one period ahead. Is there any other model which allow me to forecast multiple periods ahead which is not of the classes listed above?
