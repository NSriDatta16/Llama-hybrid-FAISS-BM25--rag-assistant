System.Diaganostics.Process (when one process internally uses another)

I've been using C# System.Diagnostics.Process to monitor the output of a command line utility. The process I'm monitoring "internally" launches a second process, and as soon as it does, I receive no further output from the process object. What's frustrating, is, if you execute the very same command (that I'm launching with the System.Diagnostics.Process object) with cmd.exe (manually), the console outputs every line I need to be seeing in my C# app! However, if I (for testing purposes) launch cmd.exe with the System.Diagnostics.Process object, and run the command, it still stops outputting at the same point that it did previously (launching process1.exe directly); at the point the second.exe is utilised. I thought this test would consolidate all output from all processes involved, but it didn't. How can I get all this output into my C# application?
