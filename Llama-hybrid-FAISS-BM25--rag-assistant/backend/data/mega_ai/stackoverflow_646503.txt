I'd use a regular expression, for the reasons the manager gave, pluss a few (more portable, easier for outside programmers to follow, etc). Your counter argument misses the point that his solution was fragile with regard to local changes while yours is fragile with regard to global changes. Anything that breaks his will probably break yours, but not visa-versa. Finally, it's a lot easier to build slop / flex into his solution (if, for example, you have to deal with multiple minor variations in the input).
