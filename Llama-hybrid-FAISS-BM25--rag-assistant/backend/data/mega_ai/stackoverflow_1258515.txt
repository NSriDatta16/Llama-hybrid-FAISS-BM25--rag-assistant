From a KISS perspective Workflow is nothing but queues and rules engine are just if else - we have a document system for which we have workflow like processing. We considered websphere's workflow and also WLI from weblogic but a simple one with JMS (MDBs as well as wake up consmers) with persistent storage has worked very well for us without any issues. I think you are taking the right approach here - good luck!
