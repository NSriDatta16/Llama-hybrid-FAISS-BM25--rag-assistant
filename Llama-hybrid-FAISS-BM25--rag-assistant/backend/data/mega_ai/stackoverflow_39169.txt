I have used this solution before to share a assembley info.cs file across all projects in a solution I would presume the same would work fro a resource file. Create a linked file to each individual project/class library. There will be only one copy and every project will have a reference to the code via a linked file at compile time. Its a very elegant solution to solve shared non public resources without duplicating code. filename for Visual Studio To Dispaly.resx add that code to the complile item group of a csproj file then replace the paths with your actual paths to the resx files and you sould be able to open them. Once you have done this for one project file you should be able to employ the copy & paste the linked file to other projects without having to hack the csproj.
