Consider Bayesian Networks which you can use to estimate conditional probabilities (bnlearn is quite user friendly: https://pypi.org/project/bnlearn/ ). However, bnlearn will require you to discretize continuous variables (see their documentation). You can then e.g. model $P(Y|X_1=x_1, ...)$ , where $Y$ indicates your subgroup. This is also what logistic regression models. For Bayesian Networks the cardinality of Y may, however, be higher than 2 and you can incorporate prior knowledge in the structure of the conditional probabilities (which is encoded in a directed acyclic graph). Given these conditional probabilities you can then compute the relative risk or the risk difference ...
