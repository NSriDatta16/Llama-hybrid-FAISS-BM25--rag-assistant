I found a simple way to auto-detect file encodings - change the file to a text file (on a mac rename the file extension to .txt) and drag it to a Mozilla Firefox window (or File -> Open). Firefox will detect the encoding - you can see what it came up with under View -> Character Encoding. I changed my file's encoding using TextMate once I knew the correct encoding. File -> Reopen using encoding and choose your encoding. Then File -> Save As and change the encoding to UTF-8 and line endings to LF (or whatever you want)
