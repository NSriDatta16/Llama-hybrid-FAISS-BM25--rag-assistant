Before you toss your time series into arimax , make sure you check if they are stationary. This is a crucial assumption for time series regression. If some of the time series on the RHS are $I(1)$, you'd get meaningless result, the so-called spurious regression in the econometrics literature. You can see it with a few lines of 'R' codes. Try use the S&P 500 for $y_t$ and Nasdaq for $x_t$. $y_t = \alpha + \beta x_t + \epsilon$ As you toss in more and more data, the regression R squared gets better and better. In fact, as $N \rightarrow \infty$, the p-value of your coefficient approaches zero and your $R^2$ approaches 1. This is a famous paper : Phillips, P. C. (1986). Understanding spurious regressions in econometrics. Journal of econometrics, 33(3), 311-340.
