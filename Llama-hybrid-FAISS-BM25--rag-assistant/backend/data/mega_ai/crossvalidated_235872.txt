What is the formula for Standardized Root Mean Residual (SRMR) in the context of latent variable models (e.g., SEM, CFA)?

SRMR is a measure of badness of fit commonly used in the context of evaluating latent variable models. I understand that it in some ways measures the average discrepancy between the model implied covariance matrix and the observed covariance matrix. And I understand that there is a standardisation process to make it more interpretable regardless of the metric of the covariance matrix. However, I'm still looking for a more precise formula that explains how the averaging occurs and how the standardisation occurs. What is the formula for SRMR? And therefore, what it is the concrete interpretation of a given value?
