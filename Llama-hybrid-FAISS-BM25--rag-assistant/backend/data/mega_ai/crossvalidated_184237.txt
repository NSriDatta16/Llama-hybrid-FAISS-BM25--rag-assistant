MCMC with dependent variables

I want to run Metropolis-Hastings on a problem which involves two parameters that are not independent. I.e. I want to estimate both of these parameters. At the moment I'm trying to understand if this is possible and if so how or what to watch out for... I considered implementing a single-component-MH, but as far as I understand that's only for independent variables? Edit 1) Maybe as a first try I could rephrase the question as: what are (in-)dependency requirements on the variables in Metropolis-Hastings? If there are any. 2) Why I think the dependency is a problem, is that I am seeing clear dependence in the traceplots of the two variables. Our professor said that is a bad thing (I guess that's because the chains are not moving around the state space as freely as they should)
