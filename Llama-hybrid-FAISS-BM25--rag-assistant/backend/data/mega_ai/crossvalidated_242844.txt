Experimental design before and after with control group

I have a project which test effectiveness of two factors (two levels, receive and not receive the factor). There are three stage consecutively through time, and the factors are imposed in the second stage. Let's call the first stage baseline period, the second stage short term test, the third stage long term test. Question is how to test the effectiveness of the two factors? What kind of statistical method would you recommend? I'm trying to use multiple linear regression with interaction term, while the before and after with control group through three stages in time series confused me on how to interpret the results?
