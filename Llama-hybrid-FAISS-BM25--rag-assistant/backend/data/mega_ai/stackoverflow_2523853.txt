How to override a Magento administration panel?

I would like to know how have I do to add a field in the customer administration at system->configuration->Customer settings panel. Have I create the system.xml file from the core and paste in the local folder with the same path? and have I maintain all the content of the file or I can write only the portion interested? thanks
