[A tentative answer from a non-expert in time series analysis] You have departed from the usual and I believe the correct order of steps in this sort of analysis. First one examines the raw time series to determine whether there is a secular trend, i.e., whether the mean value of the series is systematically changing as a function of time. If it is, you difference the series once (subtract each value from the following value, or for seasonality from a value a certain number of lags ahead). Then you examine the resulting series to see whether a secular trend remains (which would prompt additional differencing) or whether you can proceed to the next step. That next step is to examine the autocorrelations and partial autocorrelations of the differenced series (if applicable) to see whether you have white noise or whether it makes sense to fit a model to the series. Confidence intervals are a function of the sample size, which is static here.
