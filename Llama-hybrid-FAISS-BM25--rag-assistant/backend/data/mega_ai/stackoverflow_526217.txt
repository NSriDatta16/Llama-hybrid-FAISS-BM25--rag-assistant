I am definitely in favor of abstraction, but not in this execution. Your friend raises a good point, What if how you determine if a member is in a group is going to change? You've got a ton of refactoring to do, good luck with that! However, I see the argument of placing confusing functions in the wrong places. I'd say you've got an incorrect organization, why not attach them to the specific relationship model object? example: user.groups.in_group?("admin") or group.members.add_user(user) That to me looks much more elegant, its a bit more verbose, but your separation is more relevant.
