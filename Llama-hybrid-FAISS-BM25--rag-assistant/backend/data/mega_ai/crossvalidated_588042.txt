You need to keep track of the total number of observations in each case, not just the percentage survival. If you only have 5 observations, an estimate of 20% survival (1 of 5) isn't very reliable. If you have 5,000 observations, an estimate of 20% survival (1000 of 5000) would be highly reliable. With the actual counts in hand, a simple way to model this would be a binomial logistic regression. If you really want to know "which hydrogel was best overall (in all medias)," then you would use a simple additive model with the types of hydrogel represented as one 4-level categorical predictor and the media as another 4-level categorical predictor. In R you could model this as the following generalized linear model: mod1 where the data would be in 16 rows, with each row having labels for the hydrogel and media and the number of associated success and fail observations. If you suspect that the relative performances of hydrogels might differ among media, you could include an interaction term between those predictors: mod1 This UCLA web site has examples of how to perform logistic regression with several software systems.
