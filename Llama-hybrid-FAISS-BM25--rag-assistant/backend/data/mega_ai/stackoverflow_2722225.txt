I could not tell if you were looking for some PHP/Magento code or if you are looking to access the database directly. It might be "better" to create yourself a custom module that fetches this info using the Magento/Zend framework, but since I don't know the code off the top of my head I'll redirect you to the following link which has a very nice SQL query that will pull that info for you (and more). http://www.magentocommerce.com/wiki/groups/207/fedex_-_shipping_view You probably just need to add something like this to the end to filter the last 7 days where so.created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL 7 DAY
