When starting, it takes a while to set everything up. If you add tests, coverage, static code inspections, duplicate search, documentation build and deploys, it can take a long time (weeks) to get it right. After that, maintaining the build can be a problem. e.g, if you add tests to solution, you can have the build detect them automatically based on some criteria or you have to manualy update build settings. Auto detection is much harder to get right. Same for coverage. Same of documentation generation...
