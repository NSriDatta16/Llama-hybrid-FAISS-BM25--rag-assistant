I always use: STRUCT theStruct = {}; // for C++, in C use {0} It's shorter, standard, therefore more elegant, and I don't really care about the theoretical differences. We are talking about code for a concrete OS here. Another advantage is you can also immediately set the struct size in the first member like this: STRUCT theStruct = {sizeof(STRUCT)}; Many Win32 structs require you to set the size in a first member.
