Bug tracking / project management / planning JIRA (not free but $10 for 10 users) There are various modules to add to this. I use GreenHopper which is an agile process addon. YMMV. If you like gant chart planning, there is a MS Project pluggin (I've not used it) Also checkout YouTrack . This integrates with TeamCity as a bug tracking tool. It's quite cheap, but I didn't get on with it in the beta. YMMV. There are loads bug tracking systems. This will be where you spend most of your time so I would select one that suits the way you work, rather than one that integrates with your source control (unless you have a very strong requirement for change control/auditability) CI / automated build All CI servers will integrate with your source control. I would hazard a guess that all CI servers can be made to work with all source control systems so in this sense they are all integrated. I used TeamCity for a while which is awsome. I stopped because I hit the 20 projects limit, and we couldn't afford to upgrade :( I would recommend starting with TeamCity as it is very easy to setup. Its actually quite easy to change your CI server as long as you keep the actual build in a script. Also available is Hudson . This is free. There are addons to integrate with SVN + JIRA (in fact the addon scene in Hudson is a real strength). This means that commits to SVN containing links to issues generates a html link between the hudson build/ jira issue / svn commit making it easier to match code changes to features. Hudson works, but to me it seems like a beta product. This could change rapidly but I don't have the confidence in it that I had in TeamCity. However, I shouldn't complain because it's free and I haven't even contributed a bug report :) The other main CI server is CruiseControl which I've not used. Build scripts Nant / msbuild / rake / others. I use msbuild which with a bit of head scratching can be made to do the business. I've not used to others. Test frameworks In .Net land I would guess that NUnit is probably the best supported and most widely known. There are others, especially those that encourage BDD . Wikis Not sure what you are after here (I've not used TFS) There are loads of free wiki engines to choose from. Full disclosure, I've not used any!
