Learning Curves and interpretations

I've trained 4 classifiers on an undersampled dataset. I plotted the learning curve for each classifier and I got the following results : I see that for the Log Reg, both curves seem to converge and that adding more data will not help at some point. For the SVC I have no idea (rather than adding more data seems good ! ) for Knn : adding more data will increase both accuracy for Random Forest : I have no idea. I would love to understand how to read these curves. Thank you very much ! :)
