For the image problem, a common technique used is sparse coding ( Andrew Ng ppt ) for dimension reduction. Maybe a sparse autoencoder, if you feel the sparse coding performance is not powerful enough. Sounds like you are trying some convolutional neural network. Did you do something along the lines of the description here and it was not effective?. Sparse Coding Scikit-learn implementation -Edit Sorry, I didn't read all the way through. I am not sure what you are trying to do by computing the squared euclidean distances between the vectors. I am not sure what is applicable anymore, but sparse coding still might be a viable solution and PCA is definitely worth trying since it is computationally less expensive.
