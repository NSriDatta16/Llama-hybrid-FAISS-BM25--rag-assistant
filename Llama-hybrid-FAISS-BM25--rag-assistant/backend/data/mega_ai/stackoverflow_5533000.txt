Regex to match a word suffix only when it appears as part of larger word?

The following regexp matches the trailing 's' on a word or word fragment: /s\b/i Is it possible to only match the trailing s if it is a part of a larger word? That is, for example, the suffix s in the string "words" is matched, but if someone entered a string "s" by itself, there would be no match. Thanks for your advice
