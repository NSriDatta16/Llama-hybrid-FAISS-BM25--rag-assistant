David Dorward answered this already, and I'd have added a comment instead of an answer but wasn't sure the code would show up right, so.. With this $('.some_button').click(function () { $('p').text($('textarea').val()); }); and foo&lt;br&gt;foo Clicking the button shows "foo foo" in the paragraph. Is that what you need? --Addendum-- Ok.. I am only a starting JavaScripter, so not sure how bad this is :-) But the following replaces special characters by their HTML equivalents while replacing linebreaks with a . String.prototype.htmlents = function() { var trans = {'&':'&amp;', '"':'&quot;', '\'':'&#039;', ' ':'&gt;'}; var arr = this.split(''); for (var i=0;i \n')); }); }); Remembered I've had to do something similar before, and still had the htmlents() lying around from that time. Feel free to criticise :-)
