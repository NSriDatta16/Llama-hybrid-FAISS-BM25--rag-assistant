Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0 Pragma: no-cache ...so IE won't store the file in the Temporary Internet Files folder. However the mechanism used to directly 'Open' a file from the browser in IE often requires it to be opened from inside Temporary Internet Files. Directly opening a file from a browser is generally unreliable, especially in IE; 'Save as' works better. Consider replacing the cachebusting headers with an alternative method, such as add a '?randomstring' parameter to the URL. Also consider adding a "Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=..." header, which will stop a plug-in trying and failing to display the file in the browser UI.
