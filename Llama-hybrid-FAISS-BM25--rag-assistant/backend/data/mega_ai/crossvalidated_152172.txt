Meta-analysis in R with standard errors instead of standard deviations {metafor}

This is the formula I would need to use to perform a meta-analysis in R using the package metafor: REmodel Note that sd and n refers to standard deviations and sample size. The problem is that the dataset I am using (data gathered by others) contains se values, but not sd and n . Is there any way I can still do the meta-analysis using the data I have without sd and n? Thanks EDIT: After following Wolfgang’s suggestion below, it seems I am doing something wrong because rma can’t calculate vi (all NA’s), and returns this error: REmodel
