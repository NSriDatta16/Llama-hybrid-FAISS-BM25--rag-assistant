Regression Analysis of Time as Independent Variable in Experiment

we conducted an experiment on a sample of 30 persons. For every person, we observed the outcome variable every 15 minutes, so for each person 10 times. IV: Time (in Minutes) DV: Interval Scale [1;9] n = 30 people, 10 observations each Whatâ€˜s the ideal method of analysis for this? Can I simply run a simple linear regression model on the 300 IV->DV pairs, ignoring the person? Or, is it important linking observations to persons? How would you analyse this? Thanks!! Tried a simple Linear Regression Model Researched Cross-Sectional Time Series Analysis and Panel Data Analysis, but unsure about their fit
