how to change values between tags in a string

If I have the following string: str="hello %%one_boy%%'s something %%four_girl%%'s something more" how would I edit it to get the following output from printing str: "hello ONE_BOY's something FOUR_GIRL's something more" I have been trying to use 'gsub' and 'upcase' methods but am struggling with the regex to get each word between my '%%' symbols.
