MRF vs Bayes nets : Unpreciesly (but normally) speaking , there are two types of graphical models: undirected graphical models and directed graphical models(one more type, for instance Tanner graph). The former is also known as Markov Random Fields/Markov network and the later Bayes nets/Bayesian network. (Sometimes the independence assumptions in both can be represented by chordal graphs) Markov implies the way it factorizes and random field means a particular distribution among those defined by an undirected model. CRF $\in$ MRF : When some variables are observed we can use the same undirected graph representation(as the undirected graphs) and parameterization to encode a conditional distribution $P(Y|X)$ where $Y$ is a set of target variables and $X$ is a (disjoint) set of observed variables. And the only difference lies in that for a standard Markov network the normalization term sums over X and Y but for CRF the term sums over only Y.
