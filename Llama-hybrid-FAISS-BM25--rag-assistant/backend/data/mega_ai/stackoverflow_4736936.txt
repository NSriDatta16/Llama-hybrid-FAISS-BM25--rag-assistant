As Bajafresh says: premature optimization is the root of all evil. But supposing this really is a problem: One option is to duplicate the field and analyze once throwing out numbers, and the other time throwing out everything but numbers, then indexing the latter as a numeric field. Numeric fields have a special storage mechanism, which means that only a very few unique terms will be stored (usually less than 256, at the cost of some precision). Of course, this will mean that phrase queries will not work, but other kinds should still be fine (assuming you mess with the query parser enough to get this to work).
