I wanted to sum up what ultimately I've found works well for this case and roll up what's been discussed in some of the comments. Since I am basically wanting to know how many events occurred out of series of independent Bernoulli trials, we can model this as a Poisson Binomial distribution . The mean of that distribution (which is my estimate) is the sum of all the probabilities. The variance of that distribution is also known: the sum of all (1 - p i )p i . That already gives me the standard deviation (the square root of the variance), so I've gotten a little bit of what the stakeholder wants. We know that often the Poisson Binomial approaches normal with larger number of parameters (constituent probabilities from the trials), and luckily because of the nature of my problem, I will almost always have a large number of parameters. When that's the case, we can get an interval by simply taking the mean +/- 1.96 * sdev. That's not an assumption I can just make easily though, so I did a bit of modelling to find out find out what are the typical probabilities for a given widget batch (the example scenario above), and what are the more extreme probability distributions, each at the different likely parameter/probability sizes. I then calculated the Poisson Binomial mean, sdev, and 95% intervals using the approaches noted and ran monte carlo against them, doing this many times (with different draws from the middle and the extremes) to try and get as much coverage of the possible probability distributions I could run into. I compared the mean, sdev, and interval estimates against those retrieved from monte carlo by their percent error (treating the monte carlo result as the "right" answer). Long story short, the mean and sdev values are in line with Poisson Binomial quite well. And the confidence intervals, while possibly being up to 5% off in the more extreme cases, are well within our business need for low parameter sizes, and have almost no error for higher parameter sizes (which is most of our cases). So ultimately I used what I can from the known moments from the Poisson Binomial distribution directly, and then back those into intervals assuming normality (which works well enough for our specific use case).
