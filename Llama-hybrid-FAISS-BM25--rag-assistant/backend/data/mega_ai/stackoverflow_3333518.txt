CCNet live updates to LCD TV

I am working on Agile project and we use an automated build which runs on a build server using Cruise Control.Net. We have alse integrated various things like NUnit test execution Code coverage using NCover FxCop for code analysis StyleCop for source code analysis We also fail the builds if certain criterieas like acceptable code coverage are not met. I would like to know if there is any free tool which can be used to display the various outputs of cruise control and reports onto a LCD TV at periodic interval. These outputs should show the near realitime status of the latest build including Build summary NUnit test summary FXCop Summary StyleCop violation NCoverCovergae summary report When I say near real time I mean it should refresh the TV screen every few minutes, may be 10 or 15 minutes. I have various projects running for which I would like to display each of the above mentioned reports. Any help in this regards will be highly appriciated.
