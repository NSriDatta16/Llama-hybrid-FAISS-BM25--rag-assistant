Flash transparent JPEG through Flex

In Flash, via the authoring environment, you can put bitmaps in your movie that are compressed with JPEG but still support full alpha transparency, something JPEG does not support out-of-the-box. Is there a way to achieve the same when embedding bitmaps via the Flex [Embed] tag?
