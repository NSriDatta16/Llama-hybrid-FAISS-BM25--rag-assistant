How can I rotate a 3D array?

Currently, if I want to compare pressure under each of the paws of a dog, I only compare the pressure underneath each of the toes. But I want to try and compare the pressures underneath the entire paw. But to do so I have to rotate them, so the toes overlap (better). Because most of the times the left and right paws are slightly rotated externally, so if you can't simply project one on top of the other. Therefore, I want to rotate the paws, so they are all aligned the same way. Currently, I calculate the angle of rotation, by looking up the two middle toes and the rear one using the toe detection then I calculate the the angle between the yellow line (axis between toe green and red) and the green line (neutral axis). Now I want to rotate the array would rotate around the rear toe, such that the yellow and green lines are aligned. But how do I do this? Note that while this image is just 2D (only the maximal values of each sensor), I want to calculate this on a 3D array (10x10x50 on average). Also a downside of my angle calculation is that its very sensitive to the toe detection, so if somebody has a more mathematically correct proposal for calculating this, I'm all ears. I have seen one study with pressure measurements on humans , where they used the local geometric inertial axis method, which at least was very reliable. But that still doesn't help me explain how to rotate the array! If someone feels the need to experiment, here's a file with all the sliced arrays that contain the pressure data of each paw . To clarfiy: walk_sliced_data is a dictionary that contains ['ser_3', 'ser_2', 'sel_1', 'sel_2', 'ser_1', 'sel_3'], which are the names of the measurements. Each measurement contains another dictionary, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] (example from 'sel_1') which represent the impacts that were extracted.
