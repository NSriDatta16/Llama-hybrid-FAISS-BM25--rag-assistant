If you experiment with priors and select one in terms of its performances on the data at hand, it is no longer a "prior". Not only does it depend on the data (as in an empirical Bayes analysis), but it also depends on what you want to see (which is worse). In the end, you do use Bayesian tools, but this cannot be called a Bayesian analysis.
