Yes, Dirichlet Process Mixture Models do this. With MCMC, for modest $n$ you get an item similarity matrix (O(n^2) so you will likely run out of space for this output before your inference algorithm stops working). You also get a particular clustering with each sample, and the distribution of $k$. The interpretation of the results is likely to be different than any finite $k$ methods, e.g. you're almost assured to get a mean $k$ which is non-integer.
