There is no one right answer as how to normalize data. I found this good article by Nayak et al. (2014) that give different normalization techniques for financial time series data. I haven't seen your specific technique before. In general I think the issue is that while you account for the data loss of a normal min/max normalization with the lokal window $k$ , over long periods of time, you have the same issue as min/max that your data can grow outside of the window. I personally would start with z-score normalization (described in Nayak et al., 2014). $p'_t = \frac{p_t-E(p))}{\sigma(p)}$ I think that'll probably suit you well, but play around with other ideas depending on the range of your data.
