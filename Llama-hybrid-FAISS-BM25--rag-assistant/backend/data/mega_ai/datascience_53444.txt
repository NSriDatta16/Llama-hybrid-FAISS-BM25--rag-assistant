If PCA doesn’t help, then I don’t think that your problem has to do with the correlation between the images. I think your problem is just that your classifier has trouble learning the problem properly if the classes are too imbalanced. If that’s it, then the possible solutions are: Get more data (always :-) ) Undersample the large class (use only 10% of the examples of that class, for instance) Oversample the small class (duplicate examples from that class) Adjust your loss function to assign higher cost to errors on the small class When the problem of the imbalance is addressed, I would expect PCA to allow the model to learn more easily, so I would try to put that back in.
