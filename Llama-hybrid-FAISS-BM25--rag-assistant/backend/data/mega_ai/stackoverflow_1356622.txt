May not be the answer you are looking for, but take a look at ChaiScript for embedding in your C++ application. According to their website, ChaiScript is the first and only scripting language designed from the ground up with C++ compatibility in mind. It is an ECMAScript-inspired, embedded functional-like language. ChaiScript has no meta-compiler, no library dependencies, no build system requirements and no legacy baggage of any kind. At can work seamlessly with any C++ functions you expose to it. It does not have to be told explicitly about any type, it is function centric. With ChaiScript you can literally begin scripting your application by adding three lines of code to your program and not modifying your build steps at all.
