How to use django's manage.py sql* commands with mysql

How are the sql* commands meant to be used? They just output sql, so is there an elegant way to pass it to mysql? ./manage.py sqlindexes [app] gives me the mysql code - do I just note it down and then type it in? (edit: erm...copy and paste for others. heh.) Pardon my ignorance, and please let me know if there's a completely different but better way of using it.
