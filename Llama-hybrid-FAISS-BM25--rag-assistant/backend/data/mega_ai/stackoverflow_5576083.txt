jsoup quotes and spaces

I am trying to pick, using Jsoup, the paragraph inside the following HTML snippet: Very short paragraph. For that, I am using the following Java code snippet: Elements divs = document.select("div[class=abc ]"); for (Element div : divs) { Log.v("iwashere", String.format("div[class=abc ]")); Elements ppp = document.select("p[class=de]"); for (Element p : ppp) { Log.v("iwashere", p.text()); break; } } The problem is that, for some reason, Jsoup doesn't seem to pick up the "div[class=abc ]" (the Log.v("iwashere") never shows up in the log. At first, I thought that the trailing space may be a problem, so I also tried Elements divs = document.select("div[class=abc]"); but that didn't help either. What could be the problem in the above code?
