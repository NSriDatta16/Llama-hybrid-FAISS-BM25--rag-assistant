In the last layer of autoencoders, you'll be regressing your input back. So, if the input data has a larger range than that of activation function, last layer's activation is dropped so that the neuron outputs have actually the ability to regress the output range. You could've sometimes convert your input to the output range of the activation function, but typically the former method is preferred. This is even crucial when the data range is unbounded.
