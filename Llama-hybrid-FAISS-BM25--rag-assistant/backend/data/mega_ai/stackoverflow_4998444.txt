Introduction The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a standardized general-purpose modeling language heavily oriented towards the field of object-oriented software engineering. UML includes a set of graphic notation techniques to create visual models of object-oriented software-intensive systems. The UML specifications and their development process is managed by the Object Management Group (OMG). History UML has been evolving since the second half of the 1990s and has its roots in the object-oriented methods developed in the late 1980s and early 1990s. It was created and developed by Grady Booch, Ivar Jacobson and James Rumbaugh at Rational Software (AKA the three amigos ) during 1994â€“95, with further development led by them through 1996. In 1997 it was adopted as a standard by the Object Management Group (OMG) and has been managed by this organization ever since. In 2005 the Unified Modeling Language was also published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) as an approved ISO standard. Since then it has been periodically revised to cover the latest revision of UML. The current release of the specification can always be found at: http://www.omg.org/spec/UML/Current .
