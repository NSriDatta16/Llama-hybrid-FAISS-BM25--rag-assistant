Note that the apparent 'bias' disappears when you make mx=0 , as in: library(txtplot) f Think about it this way: your independent variable $x$ has mean 1 and standard deviation sx . When sx is very small, $x$ is almost indistinguishable from the constant 1 intercept 'variable', so a logistic regression 'has a hard time' disambiguating the effect of $x$. This is much easier when the variation in $x$ (and thus the resultant variation in the odds of the dependent variable) is larger.
