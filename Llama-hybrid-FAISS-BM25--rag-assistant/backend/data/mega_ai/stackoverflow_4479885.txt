Light weight, behavior driven multi-agent robot simulator?

Looking for a robot simulator that's multi-agent, light weight, behavior driven, and scriptible, visual runtime -- it's likely 2D too. There is no requirement for the logic to be output to the real world. Aside from behaviors related to sensor/motor combos - it'd be nice if it was possible to code sensor to respond to color/size/speed/etc (prey/predator/mating) and have events that happen as a result contact (death/birth/energy-gain). So, far I've looked at the following, none of which have semi-complex behavior assignment, rendering and reporting: BugWorks: multi-agent, behavior driven, light weight, visual runtime -- but not scriptible as far as I'm able to tell; meaning you can use a GUI, and save it, but their no code output to edit directly. One thing that is nice is there's a reproduce function; although the implementation is odd, it produces one robot per click (it's not based on robot interaction) and appears to take an average of all the attributes of all robots presents; better than no function though. More info Guido van Robot: not multi-agent, but it's got it's own simple scripting language for the robot and environment, with a debugger built in. More Info Algodoo: It's got 2D Physics, point-n-click interface, but very heavy on the graphic card, so I have tested it out much. More info Any suggestions?
