Cross validation is not the only way to compare different models. Several model selection criteria, such as the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) or the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) can precisely be used to compare different hypotheses when the number of observations is small and all samples need to be used for training. The main concept behind these selection criteria is to penalize the likelihood of a model with its complexity (i.e. with its number of free parameters).
