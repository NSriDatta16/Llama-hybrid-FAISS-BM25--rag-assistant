Trackbar Thumb Dimensions

Does anyone know whether it is possible to programmatically determine the dimensions of the thumb of a System.Windows.Forms.TrackBar . (By thumb I mean the bit you drag around!) I know you can get things like scrollbar widths from the System.Windows.Forms.SystemInfo class but there doesn't seem to be anything for trackbars. Thanks.
