There are three methods in your UIApplicationDelegate implementation that have to finish within 5-6 seconds or the iPhone will kill your application (this does not apply to when you are attached with a debugger and on the simulator). I'm not sure if the exact time interval is documented anywhere, but that's what I determined experimentally. There are two on startup, applicationDidFinishLaunching: and application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions, and one on shutdown, applicationWillTerminate. You'll want to check out that any network access or time-consuming operations in those methods are performed asynchronously, so that the method can return quickly. That's the only thing I know of that would cause watchdog crashes on startup. As for more hints on the stack trace, if you are using OS 3.0 and the 3.0 SDK, Organizer should do this before. Just make sure you're keeping the dSYM files from the -exact- build available on the hard drive to spotlight somewhere. Then when you look @ the trace under the Organizer in XCode, it should add symbols automatically for you.
