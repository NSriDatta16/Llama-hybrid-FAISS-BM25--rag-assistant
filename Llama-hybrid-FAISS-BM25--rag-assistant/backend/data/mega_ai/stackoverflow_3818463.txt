Execute permission on a stored procedure that does an insert, update, or delete is sufficient. You do not need to grant those permissions at the table level. In fact, I would discourage that approach. Using a stored procedure gives you more control over how the change occurs. For instance, you may wish to do some checking prior to allowing the update. Using a stored procedure can also help prevent major accidents--like deleting all the rows in the table because someone forgot the WHERE clause!
