I like to have seperate projects for my model, data access and business logic. I also have interfaces at each layer. This makes tests with mocks simple to implement, keeps my code organized and keeps my controllers light. If I placed all of the layers in the models folder, it wouldn't feel organized enough for me(just a personality thing). I also like to have the option to expose web services for my apps, so this makes all of the same logic, models and data access available for those services.
