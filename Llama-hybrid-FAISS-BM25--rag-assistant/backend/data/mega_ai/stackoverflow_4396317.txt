What am I supposed to see in the "Build History of Hudson" diagram?

When clicking on Build History in the Web UI of the Hudson CI, I get a list of builds that happend in the past. Fine. But above that is a diagram, sort of a timeline that I can drag back and forth. But there is nothing in that timeline!? What is supposed to be displayed there?
