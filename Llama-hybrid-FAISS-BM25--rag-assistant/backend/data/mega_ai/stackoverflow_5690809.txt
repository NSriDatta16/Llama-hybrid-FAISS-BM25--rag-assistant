A reason why they might not want you to use UNION, JOIN or DISTINCT is that some of those queries might be slow if you try to force an "optimized" solution. I'm not too familiar with query optimization techniques but usually if you use some of those aggregators and JOINs, you might slow down your query rather than just letting the query optimizations run through and organize your SQL based on your table structure and contents.
