Workflow - choosing the appropriate host environment

The application that I'm designing will retrieve and store content from a variety of disparate sources on a schedule. In some cases, the content will be retrieved based on a time interval (think stock quotes), and in other cases the content will be retrieved based on a custom schedule (MWF @ 2pm). Many of the processes lend themselves to MS Workflow. The built-in SQL tracking service will provide a lot of value. The content sources are sufficiently different that each different type of content retrieval will be a custom workflow. My question is, how should I host, monitor,schedule, and expose the Workflows? Requirements: Must be able to monitor the health of each content "agent" via admin UI Must be able to start and stop individual workflows via admin UI Workflows are recurring based on a schedule, but not necessarily "long-running" "Service" must have high availability Windows service, Workflow Service, ASP.Net, WCF are all available to me, and I'm open to other suggestions as well.
