For univariate time series forecasting, once you have fit a model and you want to predict new values, the only input to the model is the number of future time steps you want to perform predictions for. Keep in mind that in a real world business scenario (as opposed to testing the accuracy of the model) the future hasn't happened yet, so there are no inputs available to be fed to the model. For testing purposes, as I mentioned, the prediction function only takes the number of future steps as an argument. The test data set is used then for evaluation purposes, to be compared to the forecasts, not as an input to the model. For ARIMA and SARIMA models, the output of the model is fed back to the model recursively to generate future forecasts in the following matter: Suppose that our ARIMA model is a simple AR(1) model. Generate a forecast for one step ahead $\hat{y}_{t+1} = a*y_t$, then use that to generate a forecast for two steps ahead $\hat{y}_{t+2} = a*\hat{y}_{t+1}$, etc...until you have $\hat{y}_{T}$ for your desired $T$ steps ahead. If your model is an AR(2) model. Generate a forecast for one step ahead $\hat{y}_{t+1} = a*y_t + b*y_{t-1}$, then use that to generate a forecast for two steps ahead $\hat{y}_{t+2} = a*\hat{y}_{t+1} + b*y_t$, $\hat{y}_{t+3} = a*\hat{y}_{t+2} + b*\hat{y}_{t+1} $, etc...until you have $\hat{y}_{T}$ for your desired $T$ steps ahead.
