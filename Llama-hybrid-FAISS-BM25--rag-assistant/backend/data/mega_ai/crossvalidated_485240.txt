For many models it will make sense to combine the two cohorts together before imputation and use mice on the combined data to impute them simultaneously. However, there could be times when you would want to specify different imputation methods or use different variables for imputation in different cohorts. For example, if some variables are only measured in certain cohorts then imputation in those cohorts may be specified to take advantage of the extra information. It is possible to impute them separately and combine the imputations using mice::rbind. In the below R code I impute one set of data using predictive mean matching and the other using Bayesian linear regression, then combine the two sets of imputations and fit a glm to the combined imputations. library(mice) set.seed(123) N = 100 x1
