If you're using g++, you can build your project for coverage. When you run over some sample code, you can then view the coverage of your program using gcov . This output includes the call tree, and you should be able to see calls to constructors, and the functions that are calling them. The only downside I can think of is that you will only get output for code that is actually executed, and so you'll need to have good test cases. That being said, performing coverage analysis is well worth it anyway. Finally, I highly recommend that you use lcov to view the results!
