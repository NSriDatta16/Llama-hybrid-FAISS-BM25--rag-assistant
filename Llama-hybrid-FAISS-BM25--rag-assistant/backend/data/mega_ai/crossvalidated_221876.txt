There are some publications using auto encoders instead of RBMs. This article is really interesting: https://www.nicta.com.au/pub-download/full/8604/ There is also works on content-based recommendation using deep learning techniques such as this from spotify: http://benanne.github.io/2014/08/05/spotify-cnns.html Another very recent (2016) publication is "Deep Neural Networks for YouTube Recommendations" https://research.google.com/pubs/pub45530.html - It feeds a deep network with user activies and video embeddings and dense features as well Those works could lead you to great references also.
