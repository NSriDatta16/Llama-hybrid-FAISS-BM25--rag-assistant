The following explanation of MVC is taken from the codeigniter user guide. The Model represents your data structures. Typically your model classes will contain functions that help you retrieve, insert, and update information in your database. The View is the information that is being presented to a user. A View will normally be a web page. A view can also be a page fragment like a header or footer. It can also be an RSS page, or any other type of "page". The Controller serves as an intermediary between the Model, the View, and any other resources needed to process the HTTP request and generate a web page. http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/overview/mvc.html Edit: Example of what you may include in each entity Controller (this file is targeted by the browser) members_model->get_posts($_POST['member_id']); //Output the view require('members_posts.php'); ?> Model View All posts by member Obviously, this is an extremely simplified example but hopefully this gives you a rough idea of what should be going where.
