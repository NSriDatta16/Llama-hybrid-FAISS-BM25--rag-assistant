What math/stats knowledge does learning Bayesian probability require?

I study undergraduate "pure" math and philosophy. I know that a number of philosophers use Bayesian probability to augment their epistemic logic. My school teaches Bayesian probability as a brief part of a fourth year class. Enrolling in it requires completing a series of stats classes that are outside of my path. However, for a few reasons, I suspect that those prerequisites exist to prepare students to learn the other elements of the class that includes the lessons on BP, and that learning BP doesn't require a three year trek through non-Bayesian probability theory. That said, I really don't know. Perhaps I'm wrong. What math/stats knowledge does learning Bayesian probability require?
