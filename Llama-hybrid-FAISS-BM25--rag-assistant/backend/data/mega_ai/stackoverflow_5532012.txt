"Multi-dimensional arrays are not supported" error when saving an object to IsolatedStorageSettings.ApplicationSetting

I have tried searching Google and here and haven't come up with anything good. Any help would be appreciated. Wherever I try try to add my own object to the user settings the app falls over. The Game class is fairly simple, a few string and int properties. If its relevant I can update the post with the full details. Whenever I set the value of CurrentGame1 it falls over on the save method with the error "Multi-dimensional arrays are not supported.". Will I need to serialize the object? I would rather not have the complication if I can avoid it private Game CurrentGame1 { get { if (IsolatedStorageSettings.ApplicationSettings.SingleOrDefault(z => z.Key == "Game1").Key == null) { IsolatedStorageSettings.ApplicationSettings.Add("Game1", new Game()); IsolatedStorageSettings.ApplicationSettings.Save(); } return IsolatedStorageSettings.ApplicationSettings["Game1"] as Game; } set { IsolatedStorageSettings.ApplicationSettings.Remove("Game1"); IsolatedStorageSettings.ApplicationSettings.Add("Game1", value); IsolatedStorageSettings.ApplicationSettings.Save(); } }
