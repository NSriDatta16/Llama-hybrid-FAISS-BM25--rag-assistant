Wrap bold/strong tags around first occurrence of keyword inside content fragment?

I'm looking for the simplest way to wrap bold tags around the first appearance of a predefined keyword phrase, when that phrase does not appear in a heading tag or as an html attribute value. After the first match is found, exits the routine. For example, if the keyword is "blue widgets", and the content was: blue widgets and accessories for blue widgets can be found here Then after the routine filters the content, it would return: blue widgets and accessories for blue widgets can be found here However, if the first occurrence of the word "blue widgets" were in an attribute or a heading tag, it would skip over those and go to the next one. For example, This is a site about blue widgets We've got lots of blue widgets and blue widget accessories... In the above content, only the appearance of the keyword in the sentence "We've got lots of blue widgets and blue widget accessories"... would be bolded. Can someone give me an example of how this can be done?
