find command with -regex and -exec, regex help needed

I have a directory with a bunch of person images in it. Unfortunately the system the images are coming from has its own unique IDs for a bunch of person images that are not used in any other systems at the business (ie guests have a picture but aren't actually in the employee/customer db....just in the picture server's storage). Fortunately pictures of 8 or more integers followed by an extension are unwanted (I've seen .bmp and .jpg...but there could be others). I've attempted the following find command as a test before I swap the ls -lh with an rm -f and script the removal of the photos for other systems. I am guessing I am misunderstanding regular expressions, as that is usually the case, but everywhere I look sure seems like the following should work for what I am looking for. The \d{8,} does not appear to be working as removing it finds everything just fine, but I don't want everything....just those with 8 or more integers followed by whatever. What am I overlooking here? find /path/to/dir -regex '\/path\/to\/dir\/\d{8,}.*' -exec ls -lh {} \; Thanks.
