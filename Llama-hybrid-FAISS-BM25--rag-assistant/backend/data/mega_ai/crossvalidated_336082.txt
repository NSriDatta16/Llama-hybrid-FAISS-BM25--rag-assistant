sparse canonical correlation with PMA package in R - correlation coefficients

I'm new to canonical correlation analysis. I'm running a sparse canonical correlation analysis in R using the PMA package. My first question is why the correlation coefficients associated to the canonical dimensions Cor(Xu,Zv) do not strictly decrease. My second question is whether there is a way to select the most significant canonical dimensions (something like the 'elbow method' in PCA).
