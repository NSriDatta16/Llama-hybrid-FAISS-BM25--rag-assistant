From what I know, you have two options: Use Gears (abandoned) or Web Storage to store and sync local data, combined with heavily javascripted web pages that can detect loss of connection and work against the local data store. Use the Sync Framework with a rich client ( WinForms , WPF or possibly Silverlight OOB if it gets supported). The Sync Framework does not require a local installation of a database, instead it uses SQL Server Compact , which is simply a local file.
