Here is an excerpt (p.340) from our book Monte Carlo Statistical Methods that gives an answer to this question: Example 9.1. Normal bivariate Gibbs. For the special case of the bivariate normal density, \begin{equation} \tag{9.3} (X, Y) \sim {\cal N}_2 \left( 0, \left( \begin{array}{cc} 1 & \ \ \rho \\ \rho & \ \ 1 \end{array} \right) \right) \;, \end{equation} the Gibbs sampler is Given $y_t$ , generate \begin{eqnarray}\tag{9.4} X_{t+1} \mid y_t & \sim &{\cal N}(\rho y_t,\ 1 - \rho^2) \;,\\ Y_{t+1} \mid x_{t+1} & \sim &{\cal N}(\rho x_{t+1},\ 1- \rho^2). \nonumber \end{eqnarray} The Gibbs sampler is obviously not necessary in this particular case, as iid copies of $(X,Y)$ can be easily generated using the Box-Muller algorithm (see Example 2.8). Note that the corresponding marginal Markov chain in $X$ is defined by the AR $(1)$ relation $$ X_{t+1} = \rho^2 X_t + \sigma\epsilon_t,\qquad \epsilon_t\sim\mathcal{N}(0,1)\,, $$ with $\sigma^2 = 1-\rho^2+\rho^2(1-\rho^2) = 1 - \rho^4$ . As shown in Example 6.43,the stationary distribution of this chain is indeed the normal distribution $$\mathcal{N}\left(0,\frac{1-\rho^4}{1 - \rho^4}\right)$$
