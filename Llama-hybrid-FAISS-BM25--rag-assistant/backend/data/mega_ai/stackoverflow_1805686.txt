How to make a control resizable by the user at runtime [.NET Winforms]?

It is in Winforms. I have a UserControl that is anchored TOP, BOTTOM and LEFT. I would like to allow the user to drag its right border somehow and resize it horizontally. The control is placed right into the form, no panel or groupbox to place a "Splitter". Any idea how to make a control resizable at runtime by the user?
