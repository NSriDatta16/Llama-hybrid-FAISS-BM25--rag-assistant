If I can help it, I would almost never give a number like "24 hours". Doing so makes several implicit assumptions: The estimate is accurate to within an hour. All of the figures in the number are significant figures . The estimate is not sensitive to conditions that may arise between the time you give the estimate and the time the work is complete. In most cases these are demonstrably wrong. To avoid falling into the trap posed by (1), quote ranges to reflect how uncertain you are about the accuracy of the estimate: "3 weeks, plus or minus 3 days". This also takes care of (2). To close the loophole of (3), state your assumptions explicitly: "3 weeks, plus or minutes 3 days, assuming Alice and Bob finish the Frozzbozz component". IMO, being explicit about your assumptions this way will show a greater depth of thought than the analyst's POV. I'd much rather pay attention to someone who's thought about this more intensely than someone who just pulled a number out of the air, and that will certainly count for plus points on your side of the negotiation.
