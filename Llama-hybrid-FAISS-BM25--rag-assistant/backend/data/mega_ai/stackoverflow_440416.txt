Meaningful comments serve several purposes: If you're looking for a particular change in a version history, they let you quickly scan through the file's history (eg: "Hey, I know we fixed a bug about the flicker of this widget sometime in March last year. Do you remember what was the fix for that?"). They encourage you to make atomized commits. If you end up making check-ins with generic comments, that probably means you're doing too many things at once. As mentioned earlier, they let you know why things changes. Sure, a diff can tell you, for instance, how the tax computation changed for item such and such. But it won't tell you that it's because law XYZ for taxation changed. They make it easier to write release notes, or equivalent documentation.
