I think the confusion comes from the definition of support vectors : a point $i$ is defined as a support vector precisely if $y_i(w^Tx_i+b) = 1$ . The inequality $y_i(w^Tx_i+b) \geq 1$ must hold for all data points, but the support vectors are the data points for which this constraint is attained the least. Support vectors satisfy $y_i(w^Tx_i+b) = 1$ ... because that's how they are defined ! For more information (and especially to have a nice graphical explanation of the role of support vectors), you may want to have a look at the excellent lecture notes written by Andrew Ng on SVM , which are freely available and are a must-read.
