SLOC (Source Lines of Code) is a generally accepted measure of size. Your question only ask about size, but I bet that you're being asked to come up with these metrics so that management can scope the level of effort necessary to support this application. In that case I would look at the complexity of the code as well. You might want to download a trial version of Understand it works with many programming languages, will give you the metrics you need and the free trial will last you long enough to get the numbers that management needs. As for metrics here is what I would take a look at: Cyclomatic Complexity V(G) is a good measure of complexity. SEI Maintainability Index is good for looking at how difficult it will be to maintain the codebase. Code to comment ratio of at least 15% and other necessary high level and low level design documents. Realize that most of these will be out of date, but they still help your people to get started. Test Coverage would also be something else to look at. Do they have unit test at all? Code is easier to maintain when you have a nice unit test suite that you can run to give yourself a "reasonable" sense that you didn't break anything. 80% test coverage is usually the minimum.
