I found this documentation online in regards to the OpenGL ES 1.0 specification There are several reasons why one type or another of internal state needs to be queried by an ap- plication.The application may need to dynamically discover implementation limits (pixel component sizes, texture dimensions, etc.), or the application might be part of a layered library and it may need to save and restore any state that it disturbs as part of its rendering. PushAttrib andPopAttrib can be used to perform this but they are expensive to implement and use and therefore not supported.Gen- erally speaking state queries are discouraged as they are often detrimental to performance.Rather than trying to partition different types of dynamic state that can be queried, tops of matrix stacks for example, no dynamic state queries are supported and applications must shadow state changes rather than querying the pipeline.This makes things difﬁcult for layered libraries, but there hasn’t been enough justiﬁcation to retain dynamic state queries or attribute pushing and popping. That and this other link here seems to indicate that you'll need to keep track of those bits yourself. No help for you there. glut just calls the system code, yeah? (wglSwapBuffers, glxSwapBuffers) Try this here eglSwapBuffers and maybe this book out Sorry I don't have a more concrete answer for you.
