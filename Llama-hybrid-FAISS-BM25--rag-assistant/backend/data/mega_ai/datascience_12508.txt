Why initialization of Xgboost DMatrix reducec features number?

I am trying to understand following case: when I create new xgbost DMatrix xgX = xgb.DMatrix(X, label=Y, missing=np.nan) based on input data X with 64 features I got the new DMatrix with 55 features What the magic is doing here? Any advise would be great!
