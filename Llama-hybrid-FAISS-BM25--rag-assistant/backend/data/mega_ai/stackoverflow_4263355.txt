Judging just from the naming scheme, it sounds like Scene is not a UIView . The touch event method is called on whatever UIView is touched -- in this case, your EAGLView . If you'd like the Scene class to handle it, you can just call the method directly: -(void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { [myScene touchesBegan:touches withEvent:event]; }
