How to justify the use of categorical variables as continuous variables in logistic regression?

One question again to be clarified: Can I use the variables as noted below [(3) a,b,c etc] as continuous variables in my logistic regression and if so what will be my explanation in the paper that I am writing. I have the following sets of variables: A Categorical (binary) variable Ayurveda and Allopathy Test variable (binary) "Spirituality is a scientific subject": Agree and Disagree Then I have a number of participant perspectives/characteristics such as: (a) Do you believe there is life after death: 1) yes, 2) no, 3) not sure (b) To what extent do you consider spiritual 1) Very 2) moderate 3) slightly 4) not at all (c) How often would you say the experience of illness increase patientsâ€™ awareness of and focus on R/S: 1) Rarely 2) Never 3) sometimes 4) Often 5) Always 6) Not apply (d) etc= several more such variables with multiple choices as above Please advise.
