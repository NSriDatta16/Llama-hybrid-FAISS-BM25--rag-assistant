Because they are not the same quantity. It is not the conditional distribution of $\mathbf{z}$ , but rather it is an expectation taken with respect to this distribution. In other words, the quantity $Q(\theta \mid \theta_{\text{old}})$ is the expectation of $$ \log p(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{z} \mid \theta) \tag{1} $$ taken with respect to $$ p(\mathbf{z} \mid \mathbf{x}, \theta_{\text{old}}), $$ where $\theta \neq \theta_{\text{old}}$ . The process is sort of intuitive. Usually you maximize (1), but you don't have access the hidden variables. So you pick some parameter $\theta_{\text{old}}$ , then average out the hidden stuff. This gives you new function to maximize over all $\theta$ : $Q(\theta \mid \theta_{\text{old}})$ . Once you pick a new parameter, you keep just keep repeating the steps.
