How to recognize swipe gesture in UIScrollView

I'm trying to recognize left/right swipe gesture in a UIScrollView . I've tried to create UISwipeGestureRecognizers and associate them with the scroll view. It works but very rarely. Most of the time I do not get called. Why? How can I reliably get swiping left/right to work? Can I use the gesture recognizers or do I have to somehow handle it myself in touchesBegan/Ended Thanks
