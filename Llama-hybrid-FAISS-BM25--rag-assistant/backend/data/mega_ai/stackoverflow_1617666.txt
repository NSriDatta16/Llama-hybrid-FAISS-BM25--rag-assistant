Using Python, how do I get an array of file info objects, based on a search of a file system?

Currently I have a bash script which runs the find command, like so: find /storage/disk-1/Media/Video/TV -name *.avi -mtime -7 This gets a list of TV shows that were added to my system in the last 7 days. I then go on to create some symbolic links so I can get to my newest TV shows. I'm looking to re-code this in Python, but I have a few questions I can seem to find the answers for using Google (maybe I'm not searching for the right thing). I think the best way to sum this up is to ask the question: How do I perform a search on my file system (should I call find ?) which gives me an array of file info objects (containing the modify date, file name, etc) so that I may sort them based on date, and other such things?
