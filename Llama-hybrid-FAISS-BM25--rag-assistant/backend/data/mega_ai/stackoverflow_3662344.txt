It's totally possible. I've done a lot of direct Coldfusion - Notes integration in the past 12 years and the newer versions of Notes should have many integration points (scripts, agents, COM, etc) to create/edit calendar events. Adam's angle might be good enough for you, I'd try that out. If you're looking for something to be a little more direct (between the coldfusion and notes server directly, like sharepoint), there's options as well.
