There's not a particularly elegant way to do this in NMAKE. If you can, you should use GNU Make instead, which is available on Windows and makes many tasks much easier. If you must use NMAKE, then you must use recursive make in order to do this automatically, because NMAKE only expands wildcards in prerequisites lists. I demonstrated how to do this in response to another similar question here . Hope that helps.
