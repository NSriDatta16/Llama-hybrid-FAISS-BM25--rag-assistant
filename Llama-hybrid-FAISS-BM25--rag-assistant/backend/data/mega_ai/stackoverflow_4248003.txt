Resharper offers so many benifits in terms of developer productivity. It also improves better design by suggesting many improvements to the code on the fly. i have been encouraging people in my team to use all the shortcuts from Resharper and try and get off the habit of using mouse. Its not to say that you shouldn't be using mouse at all. But Resharper offers so many rich features that as a developer you can almost forget to make use of mouse. Here is a small blog post I wrote about how to make use of resharper to clean code http://nileshgule.blogspot.com/2010/10/refactoring-clean-code-using-resharper.html (This does require few mouse clicks here and there :)) There are various addins for resharper like Stylecop, NUnit etc which help other tools integrate with resharper and offer better user (developer) experience. Hope this helps.
