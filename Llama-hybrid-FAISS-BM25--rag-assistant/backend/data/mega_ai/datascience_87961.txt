Explanation of why Neural Networks are non convex

Why having a symmetry of values for the hidden state imply that the neural network is non convex? I could not find an intuitive answer for this yet. Also, if we consider a Fully Connected network wtih ReLU non linearity(which is convex) then it is a composition of convex functions and ReLU is also non decreasing. Still the overall optimization problem becomes non convex.
