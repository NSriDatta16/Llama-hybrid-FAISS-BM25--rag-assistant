You may want to focus your attention on tweaking the caching settings on the client end. If the images are being sent by the server, then its not likely to be an IIS issue. If the HTML for the images is being sent to the browser, its not an ASP issue. That leaves the client. The proxy may be mitigating some of the issues, and/or it could be a factor in how IE6 decides to cache images, etc.
