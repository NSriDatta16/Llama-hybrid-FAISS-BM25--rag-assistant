Mercurial: Fix a borked history

So working on a project recently (by myself - no other developers), I somehow managed to seriously bork the history with some (apparently) bad merges from cloned repositories. What I would like to do - need to do - is fix this by just deleting the last 8 commits (according to hg glog ) Yes, I have made a few changes to the code after the borking began, however, only a few tweaks here or there - nothing I can't fix fresh from memory. How can I get rid of the last 8 commits and start over from where I messed up?
