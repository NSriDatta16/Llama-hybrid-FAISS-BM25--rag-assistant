How to display a students rank out of hundred students using PHP & MySQL?

I'm trying to get the rank of a certain student out of a class of a hundred, I want to be able to display the students rank. I'm trying to get the rank of a student by grades and grade points. For example if student 1 has 2 A+ grades with a total of 10 points and student 2 has 3 B- grades with a total of 10 points student 1 will rank higher. I was wondering how would I be able to do this using PHP & MySQL? Here is the PHP & MySQL code I have so far. $gp = array(); $dbc = mysqli_query($mysqli,"SELECT grades.*, homework_grades.*, users_homework.* FROM grades LEFT JOIN homework_grades ON grades.id = homework_grades.grade_id LEFT JOIN users_homework ON homework_grades.users_homework_id = users_homework.id WHERE users_homework.user_id = '$user_id' AND users_homework.grade_average = 'A+'"); if (!$dbc) { print mysqli_error($mysqli); } else { while($row = mysqli_fetch_array($dbc)){ $gp[] = $row['grade_points']; } } echo array_sum($gp); Here is my MySQL tables. CREATE TABLE homework_grades ( id INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, grade_id INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL, users_homework_id INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL, user_id INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY (id) ); CREATE TABLE grades ( id INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, letter_grade VARCHAR NOT NULL, grade_points FLOAT UNSIGNED NOT NULL DEFAULT 0, PRIMARY KEY (id) ); CREATE TABLE users_homework ( id INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, user_id INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL, homework_content LONGTEXT NOT NULL, grade_average VARCHAR DEFAULT NULL, PRIMARY KEY (id) );
