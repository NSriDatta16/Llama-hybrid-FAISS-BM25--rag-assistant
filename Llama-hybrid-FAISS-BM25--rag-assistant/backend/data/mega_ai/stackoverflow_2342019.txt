What causes "error C2856: #pragma hdrstop cannot be inside an #if block" in VS C++?

There was a program what I could compile under 2008 for a while. Note I can compile the program using cl and in Ultimate++ IDE. It is a fairly large program , so I am not going to post it here. I cannot compile it in Studio. The error is 1>c:\program files\microsoft visual studio 9.0\vc\include\xstring(1735) : error C2856: #pragma hdrstop cannot be inside an #if block which seems to be idiotic as there is no hdrstop in there. Precompiled headers are turned off. This is what is there: if (_Mysize (_Dest, _Dest_size, _Myptr() + _Off, _Count); return (_Count); } void __CLR_OR_THIS_CALL swap(_Myt& _Right) { // exchange contents with _Right Thanks.
