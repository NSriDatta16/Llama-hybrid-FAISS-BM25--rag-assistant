Calculate probability (area) under the overlapping area of two normal distributions

I have two normal distributions defined by their averages and standard deviations. Sample 1: Mean=5.28; SD=0.91 Sample 2: Mean=8.45; SD=1.36 You can see how they look like in the next image: How can I get the probability to obtain an individual from the overlapping area (green)? Is the probability the same as the area?
