Found an other way which did the needed by simulating the behaviour of keyEvent( which i doubt if exist in iphone sdk). Basic outline of the procedure is like -push the content to pasteboard -call the paste function on UITextField so when button is pressed, content corresponding to the button is copied to pasteboard and then paste function is called on the UITextField, so that the content get inserted into it. Detailed description of steps can be found here: http://dev.ragfield.com/2009/09/insert-text-at-current-cursor-location.html
