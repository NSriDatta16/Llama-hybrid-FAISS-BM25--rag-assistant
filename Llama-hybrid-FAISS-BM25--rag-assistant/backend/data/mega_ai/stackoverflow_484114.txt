I expect that the language designers just didn't see enough of a need to add binary numbers. The average coder can parse hex just as well as binary when handling flags or bit masks. It's great that some languages support binary as a representation, but I think on average it would be little used. Although binary -- if available in C, C++, Java, C#, would probably be used more than octal!
