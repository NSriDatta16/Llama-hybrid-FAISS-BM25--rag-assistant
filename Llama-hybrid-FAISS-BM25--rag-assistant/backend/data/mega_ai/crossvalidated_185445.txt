Can Principal Component Analysis be used on stock prices / non-stationary data?

I am reading an example given in the book, Machine Learning for Hackers . I will first elaborate on the example and then talk about my question. Example : Takes a dataset for 10 years of 25 share prices. Runs PCA on the 25 share prices. Compares the principal component with the Dow Jones Index. Observes very strong similarity between PC and DJI! From what I understand, the example is more like a toy to help newbies like me understand how effective a tool PCA is! However, reading from another source , I see that share prices are non-stationary and running PCA on share prices is absurd. The sources from where I read totally ridicule the idea of calculating covariance and PCA for share prices. Questions : How did the example work so well? The PCA of share prices and DJI were very close to one another. And the data is real data from 2002-2011 share prices. Can someone point me to some nice resource for reading up on stationary / non-stationary data? I am a programmer. I have a good math background. But I haven't done serious math for 3 years. I have started reading again about stuff like random walks, etc.
