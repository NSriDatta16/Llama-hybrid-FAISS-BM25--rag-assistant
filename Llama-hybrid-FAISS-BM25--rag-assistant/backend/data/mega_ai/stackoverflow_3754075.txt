Thanks for your quick hints! I was finally able to track the problem down: The element had a "float:left;". This apparently caused the following text to move "left/up". My solution: I inserted an empty with a "clear:both;" between the dd element and the following text. If anybody has a more elegant solution, I'd still be interested!
