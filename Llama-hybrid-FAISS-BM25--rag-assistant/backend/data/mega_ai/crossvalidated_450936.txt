In your case, you can try RNN or CNN. For the RNN, you can let the model see the previous few numbers to predict the next one(or a few ones), and if the prediction is within one standard deviation there is no problem. Here is an example: RNN based Time-series Anomaly detector . If the numbers are categorical you can train a language model and score the sequence by the perplexities for each number. If the perplexity is larger than a threshold you can make it as abnormal. Or you can try a bidirectional LSTM and get the final state and concatenate them as the feature and add a logistic regression on top of it. And you can also use CNN with a particular large kernel size and max-pooling as a direct classification problem. But be cautious since CNNs are position invariant.
