Can I run multiple independent test-control split tests on the same target audience?

I'm interested in the statistical validity of performing multiple randomised test-control experiments among the same target audience at the same time. As a simple example consider below: I have 30,000 app users. I promote a discount on some shoes to 28,000 and don't promote to 2,000 by randomly assigning into test & control groups. I promote another discount on some shirts to a newly selected random 28,000 and don't promote to the 2,000 again. 2 and 3 were done within days of each other and sales were measured for some weeks after. A colleague is concerned that the results from 3 aren't valid since the promotion from 2 would have compromised the control group. Our objective is to measure the increased propensity to purchase the products (i.e. test propensity / control propensity). Based on that, my intuition was that because the effects of the first promo would be felt to the same degree in the the test and control groups of the second experiment (on average due to an independent random assignment), that results would still be valid in inferring the increased value attributable to the second experiment. Is that the correct? I know there is multivariate testing also where we could look into combinations, however my company isn't really at the maturity to analyse that yet.
