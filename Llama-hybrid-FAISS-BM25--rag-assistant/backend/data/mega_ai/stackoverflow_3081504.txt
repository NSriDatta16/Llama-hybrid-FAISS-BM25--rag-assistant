If your are concerned about code bloat then I would encourage you to look at Aspect Oriented Programming as an alternative. This will allow you to specify the contract in the aspect and then wrap any classes or methods of classes in the contract. If your contract is going to be used in more than one class then this would be a cleaner way to implement this. Unfortunately the support for AOP in C# is not great but there are a couple of libraries that add this functionality. And as I also have the same feeling towards other C# implementations as you have found with Contracts it all seems fine at first until you lift the hood and start using it in a serious fashion.
