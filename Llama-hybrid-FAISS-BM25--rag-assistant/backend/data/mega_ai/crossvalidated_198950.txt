Should you smooth a data vector before or after training?

Suppose I want to use a deep neural network to map an input vector $x$ of length $a$, to an output vector $y$ of length $b$. In my training data, each $x$ is associated with a $y$. $y$ is a discretisation of a smooth function. However, I know that my measurements of $y$ in the training data are noisy. So what I want to do is to do some smoothing on $y$. Which of the following two options is most sensible: 1) For each training datum, smooth the $y$, and then use this smoothed $y$ in the training pair. 2) Train with the original noisy $y$'s, and then smooth the output of the neural network.
