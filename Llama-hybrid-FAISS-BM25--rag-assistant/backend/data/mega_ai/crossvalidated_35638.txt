Zen used method 1. Here is method 2: Map $x$ to a spherically symmetric Gaussian distribution centered at $x$ in the Hilbert space $L^2$. The standard deviation and a constant factor have to be tweaked for this to work exactly. For example, in one dimension, $$ \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{\exp[-(x-z)^2/(2\sigma^2)]}{\sqrt{2 \pi} \sigma} \frac{\exp[-(y-z)^2/(2 \sigma^2)}{\sqrt{2 \pi} \sigma} dz = \frac{\exp [-(x-y)^2/(4 \sigma^2)]}{2 \sqrt \pi \sigma}. $$ So, use a standard deviation of $\sigma/\sqrt 2$ and scale the Gaussian distribution to get $k(x,y) = \langle \Phi(x), \Phi(y)\rangle$. This last rescaling occurs because the $L^2$ norm of a normal distribution is not $1$ in general.
