The other option would be to use an apache redirect either in httpd.conf or a .htaccess file that redirects all image requests ( .gif| .jpg|*.png|etc, etc) to your getImage.php script. Then getImage.php would pull from the database, send appropriate headers and output the binary data. The advantage of this over Flavius Stef's answer is that then your tags could have a regular looking source (/path/to/image.jpg) rather than an obvious retrieval system. It would also clean up your apache access logs at the same time.
