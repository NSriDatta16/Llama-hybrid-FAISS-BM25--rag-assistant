Axis SOAP responses in different format is it the same?

I am getting two different responses from different Magento installations. They considered to be the same and both should work but second response can’t be parsed by my Axis Java client app. And I don’t know if certain newer version of Axis can parse both. The question is: From the SOAP format form of view should these both responses parsed well to the same result? Response 1: 100000056-1 0 ... Response 2: increment_id 200000281 parent_id 0 ... Update: Both installations use the same Magento version 1.3.2.4. Second installation is running PHP 5.2.13. Could it be related to PHP version or installed PHP soap frameworks?
