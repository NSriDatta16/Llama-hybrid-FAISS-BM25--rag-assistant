Qt Icon embedded in Executeable

I have some buttons on a tabwidget. These buttons need to have some icon on top of them. I am aware of QPixmap that will allow me to put an image on top of a button, but I see that these constructors take a filepath as a parameter. I want to avoid dragging icons around in a file after I build. I would like to embed these icons in the executeable somehow, so as to reduce the baggage that I need to lug around in order to make it work. How can I accomplish this? I am interested in hearing ways to accomplish my goal of not needing to drag icon files around with the executable; please focus on this aspect if you are confused about some terminology I may have used, as I am still learning Qt.
