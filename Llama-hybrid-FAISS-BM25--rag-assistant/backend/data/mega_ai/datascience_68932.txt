Distribution plot of word embeddings

I have a list of sentences and a 10 dimensional embedding for each of the sentence. I am trying to visualize these embeddings so that i can see if several sentence embeddings form a cluster such that these have similar embeddings which in turn mean similar context's. How can i do this in python? Also, i am wondering if there's any good metric or method using which i can form cluster's or calculate similarity between sentences that can tell me how close two sentences are?
