How about keeping it in memory? Storing that many words would take just a few megabytes of RAM, and otherwise you'd be accessing the file frequently so it'd probably be cached anyway. The advantage of keeping the word list in memory is that you can organize it in whatever data structure suits your needs best (I'm thinking a trie). If you can't spare that much memory, it might be to your advantage to use a database so you can efficiently load only the parts of the word list you need for any given query - of course, in that case you'd want to create some index columns (well at least one) so you can take advantage of the indexing capabilities of SQL.
