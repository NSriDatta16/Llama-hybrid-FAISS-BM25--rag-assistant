I don't know whether ASP.NET has some special rules (due to automatic compilation) but certainly in C# itself there are no rules saying you have to organise your folders to match your namespaces. It's a good idea from a maintainability point of view though. Are you sure it's the compiler and not just another bit of ASP.NET (or even ReSharper?) complaining?
