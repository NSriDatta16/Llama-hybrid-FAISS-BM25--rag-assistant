Can we create the controls using Scriptaculous.js and prototype.js or this library is for giving the effects on control

I am New for the technology. I want to know that "Can we create the controls using scriptaculous.js and prototype.js or this library is for giving the effects,Drag n Drop,Auto Completer?." Because i have seen in dojo.js they have their own controls as we create in dojo.(Button,CheckBox etc...) I want to know about which is the best library to used for Effects,Animation etc. (scriptaculous.js,prototype.js vs dojo.js vs jQuery vs YUI). Please comment on it. Regards, Mauunusanghi
