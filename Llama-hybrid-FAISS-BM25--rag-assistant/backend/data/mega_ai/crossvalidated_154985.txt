Streaming K-medoids

Mahout, Hadoop machine learning library, contains an implementation of Streaming K-means algorithm that is based on the following paperworks The Effectiveness of Lloyd-Type Methods for the k-Means Problem and Fast and Accurate k-llleans For Large Datasets . By analyzing this approach I came up to an idea to implement K-medoids algorithm in a similar fashion like Streaming K-means. I'm looking for a validation of this idea - can someone give me opinion about it, is it a good idea, and if not, what are the flaws?
