This is an excellent opportunity to use a stored procedure. Crozin's response will work, but I prefer to keep this sort of logic in the database. Reasons: If you decide to add/remove/rename columns at a later date - or if you're lucky enough to have a DBA on your project - it'll make things quite a bit easier to maintain. If you're generating your word list from user input, it will help prevent SQL injection. I limit the rights of my site's db user account to the ability to execute stored procs. In either case, the logic remains the same. Split the paragraph into words, and compare the keyword column against that list using "in". Alternatively, if you're dealing with large amounts of text, it might be more efficient to split and pivot the resulting word list into rows (perhaps in a temporary table), and select from a join: select * from keywords join #paragraph_words on keywords.keyword=#paragraph_words.keyword; (you'll have to check the syntax, as I don't have time to validate it just now). The set operators (like IN ) likely won't perform as well as a join, though, as I said, this would be overkill if you're only dealing with a short word list.
