Nonparametric tolerance intervals for discrete variables

Suppose you have a bunch of people rate how much they liked a movie on a discrete scale from 1 to 10, and you would like an interval [ l , u ] such that with (at least) 95% confidence, (at least) 90% of all people who see the movie will rate it no lower than l and no higher than u . [ l , u ] is then a (two-sided) tolerance interval with 95% confidence and 90% coverage. (To be clear, 95% confidence implies that if you repeated this procedure many times, 95% of the produced intervals would get at least 90% population coverage.) Of course, we generally want [ l , u ] to be as narrow as possible while still meeting our requirements. I've seen various nonparametric methods for constructing tolerance intervals for continuous random variables. I've also seen methods for constructing tolerance intervals for binomial and Poisson variables. (The R package tolerance implements several of these methods; Young, 2010.) But what about discrete variables when the distribution is unknown? This is generally the case for rating scales like the one in my example, and assuming a binomial distribution doesn't seem safe because real rating-scale data often exhibits weirdness such as multimodality. Would it make sense to fall back on the nonparametric methods for continuous variables? Alternatively, what about a Monte Carlo method such as generating 1,000 bootstrap replicates of the sample and finding an interval that captures at least 90% of the sample in at least 950 of the replicates?
