Read text file and get components iPhone Objective-C

I have a text file that currently looks like this: What do you call an Italian man with one toe? Roberto!! What is the best time to go to the dentist? 2:30 (Tooth Hurty)!! Why was the doctor mad? Because he had no patients!! I just wanted to know how I can get the text inbetween the and the parts and then put them into an array.
