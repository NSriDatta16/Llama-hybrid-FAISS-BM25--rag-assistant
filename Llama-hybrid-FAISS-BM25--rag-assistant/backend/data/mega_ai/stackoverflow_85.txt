Flat file databases

What are the best practices around creating flat file database structures in PHP? A lot of more matured PHP flat file frameworks out there which I attempt to implement SQL-like query syntax which is over the top for my purposes in most cases. (I would just use a database at that point). Are there any elegant tricks out there to get good performance and features with a small code overhead?
