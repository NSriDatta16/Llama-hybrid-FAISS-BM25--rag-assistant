VB 6.0 SavePicture Method Problem

I am using the following code to save an image created on a Form to a bitmap file: SavePicture Form1.Image, Output_Dir + Patternname + ".bmp" DoEvents Now the image created on the form is a 1600x1200 pixel image (which looks correct); however, when I save the file using the above code the image is always saved as a 1920x1200 pixel bitmap. 1920x1200 is the current resolution of my screen. Here is the code used to set the width/height of the form image: Form1.ScaleMode = vbPixels Form1.AutoRedraw = True W = 1600 H = 1200 Form1.Width = W * Screen.TwipsPerPixelX Form1.Height = H * Screen.TwipsPerPixelY Form1.Show I cannot seem to understand why the form image looks correct at 1600x1200, yet when I save the program adds an extra white block of 320X1200 to make the bitmap 1920x1200.
