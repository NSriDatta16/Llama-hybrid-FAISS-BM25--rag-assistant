The keyword extern means "the storage for this variable is allocated elsewhere". It tells the compiler "I'm referencing myGlobalvar here, and you haven't seen it before, but that's OK; the linker will know what you are talking about." In your specific example it's not particularly useful, because the compiler does know about myGlobalvar -- it's defined earlier in the same translation unit ( .c or .cc file.) You normally use extern when you want to refer to something that is not in the current translation unit, such as a variable that's defined in a library you will be linking to. (Of course, normally that library would declare the extern variables for you, in a header file that you should include.)
