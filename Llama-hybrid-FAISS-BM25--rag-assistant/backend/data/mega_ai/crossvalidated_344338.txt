What does linear time series refer to?

In some papers or documents, "linear times series" seems to refer to a time series that can be modeled as a linear AR (auto-regressive) model. In other places, "linear time series" seems to refer to a time series with a linear trend. When someone just drops "linear time series" out of the blue without any context, what do they mean usually?
