Using BERT to extract a list of words and phrases from documents

I have a list of words and phrases (~3k items). What are my options to extract them from documents (~3M of job descriptions) with NLP? I do not have labeled data. For example my list of words and phrases look like, Leadership Microsoft Office AWS . . . Python Programing Language The result I am looking for is a matrix(3K x 3M) with binary values inside. Doc # Leadership Microsoft Office AWS ... Python Programing Language 1 1 0 0 1 . . . . . 3M 0 1 1 1 Regex - This is the most straightforward solution comes my mind. However, this solutions is not robust and cannot capture different word/phrase forms. For example, people might write MS Office instead of Microsoft Office . Similarly, people might write Amazon Web Service rather than AWS . Is there a solution to utilize a Large Language Model such as BERT? If I create a labeled data using, for example, AWS Ground Truth , is there a way to utilize the results to build a model and extract the list of words/phrases?
