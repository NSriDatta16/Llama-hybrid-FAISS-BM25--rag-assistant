I suppose this is supposed to be a Bayesian question If the prior for $p$ is $\operatorname{Beta}(\alpha, \beta)$ with density proportional to $p^{\alpha-1}(1-p)^{\beta-1}$ and you then observe $k$ successes and $n-k$ failures in $\mathbf{X}$ with likelihood proportional to $p^k(1-p)^{n-k}$ then the posterior density for $p$ given $\mathbf{X}$ is proportional to $p^{\alpha-1+ k}(1-p)^{\beta-1+ n-k}$ so the posterior distribution for $p$ is $\operatorname{Beta}(\alpha+k, \beta+n-k)$ If $\mathbf{X}$ is a single observation and is a success then this mean the posterior distribution for $p$ is $\operatorname{Beta}(\alpha+1, \beta)$ I now believe you think you are asking a different question, where different values of $p$ are drawn from $\operatorname{Beta}(\alpha, \beta)$ giving $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$ , and then each $X_i$ is drawn from $\operatorname{Bernoulli}(p_i)$ ; you want to know the distribution of those $p_i$ corresponding to $X_i=1$ . This is equivalent to the final line of my initial answer on a single successful observation: the distribution in question is $\operatorname{Beta}(\alpha+1, \beta)$ To try and convince you, here are a couple of simulations in R of $10^6$ initial draws, first with $\alpha=2, \beta=2$ and then with $\alpha=2, \beta=8$ , drawing the simulated densities for the successful cases (black) and comparing this with the theoretical densities for $\operatorname{Beta}(\alpha+1, \beta)$ . They are a very close match set.seed(2021) positives and the chart above, starting with $p\sim \operatorname{Beta}(1,2)$ , shows a $\operatorname{Beta}(2,2)$ distribution for the $p_i$ corresponding to $X_i=1$ . and the chart above, starting with $p\sim \operatorname{Beta}(2,2)$ , shows a $\operatorname{Beta}(3,2)$ distribution for the $p_i$ corresponding to $X_i=1$ . Then positives(10^6, alpha=2, beta=8) and the chart above, starting with $p\sim \operatorname{Beta}(2,8)$ , shows a $\operatorname{Beta}(3,8)$ distribution for the $p_i$ corresponding to $X_i=1$ .
