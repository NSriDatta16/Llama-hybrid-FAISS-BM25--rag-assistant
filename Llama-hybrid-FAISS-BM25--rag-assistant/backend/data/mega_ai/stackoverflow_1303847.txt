I use FlowPlayer, though it's been over a year since I've looked for anything better. http://flowplayer.org/ You can serve .mp4 videos with h.264 and aac instead of .flv to users who have Flash 9.0.115 or higher, which will give you slightly better quality for your bandwidth (or less bandwidth for the same quality) at the cost of higher cpu usage. Embedding the flash with wmode=window also reduces cpu usage vs wmode=opaque or transparent, at the cost of not being able to overlay html elements over the flash. If serving from IIS, you may need to add the .flv mime type so that IIS won't generate false 404 errors (as a "security" feature). http://it.toolbox.com/blogs/rymoore/adding-flv-mime-type-in-iis-4198
