Magento is build upon Zend Framework. I think basic knowledge of ZF will get you af good head start. Try have a look at 'ZendFramework in Action'. That's where i started with ZF. ZFiA will probably give you a good insight into the MVC-pattern and directory-structure of ZF. This you should be able to project onto Magento. And i'm currently working on 2 ZF projects. I have yet to do a Magento shop, but it's in the commings. Played around with Magento, right after the release. And must say that there were lots problems just to get it to install and to perform good. So haven't been playing with it since. It's my impression that it's evolved since then, and the performance issues should be ironned out. Still not an application you should run on a 1-buck shared hosting.
