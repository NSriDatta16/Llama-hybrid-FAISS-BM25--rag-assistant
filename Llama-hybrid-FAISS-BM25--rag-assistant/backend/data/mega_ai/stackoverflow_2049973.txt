the problem with your expression is that it matches the empty string, meaning that if you do: >>> p = re.compile('b*(abb*)*(a|)') >>> p.match('c').group(0) '' and since re.match attempts to match the start of the string, you have to tell it to match it until the end of the string. just use $ for that >>> p = re.compile(r'b*(abb*)*(a|)$') >>> print p.match('c') None >>> p.match('ababababab').group(0) 'ababababab' ps- you may have noted that i used r'pattern' instead of 'pattern' more on that here (first paragraphs)
