mod_rewrite: How to I permit a user with no redirection/rewriting

I'm working with mod_rewrite for Windows (via an ISAPI filter) and haven't yet seen documentation on how to set up RewriteRule to permit the existing url with no changes. RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} !.*iPhone.* [NC] RewriteRule () http://DontWantToRedirect/orAlterURL [R,NC,L] My goal is to create a rule to permit only iPhones with OS 4.0.1 to connect to my server. There are other rules in play here, so I have to keep the logic if - then - passthrough w/no change
