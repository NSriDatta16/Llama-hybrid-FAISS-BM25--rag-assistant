How to redirect a parent page to a child page in Sitecore 6?

I have this Newsletter page, that has the actual newsletters nested underneath it for each month of the year. I want to be able to have the parent page redirect to the latest published page. What would be the best way to do that? I don't really have any idea of where to start with this one... Should I make a sub layout user control and programmatically redirect? Or is there a more elegant way to do it... Thanks in advance!
