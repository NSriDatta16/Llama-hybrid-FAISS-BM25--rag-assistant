You could handle that in the home controller, but the controller method would not be very elegant. I'm guessing something like this might work (not tested): routes.MapRoute( "Root", "{controller}/{view}", new { controller = "Home", action = "Index", view = "" } ); Then in your HomeController: public ActionResult Index(string view) { switch (view) { case "": return View(); case "register": return View("Register"); default: // load user profile view } }
