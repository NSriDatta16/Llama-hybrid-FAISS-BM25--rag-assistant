Consider something like a typical parameter list: parameter_list: parameter | parameter_list ',' parameter ; Since you don't care about anything like precedence or associativity with parameters, this is fairly easy to convert to right recursion, at the expense of adding an extra production: parameter_list: parameter more_params ; more_params: | ',' parameter more_params ; For the most serious cases, you might want to spend some time in the Dragon Book. Doing a quick check, this is covered primarily in chapter 4. As far as seriousness goes, I'm pretty sure ANTLR simply won't accept a grammar that contains left recursion, which would put it into the "absolute necessity" category.
