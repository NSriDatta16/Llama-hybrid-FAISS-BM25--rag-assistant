I liked the answer given by Dave harris. just though I would come at the problem from a "low risk" perspective, rather than profit maximising The random walk you are doing, assuming your fraction bet is $q$ and probability of winning $p=0.5$ has is given as $$Y_t|Y_{t-1}=(1-q+3qX_t)Y_{t-1}$$ where $X_t\sim Bernoulli(p)$ . on average you have $$E(Y_t|Y_{t-1}) = (1-q+3pq)Y_{t-1}$$ You can iteratively apply this to get $$Y_t|Y_0=Y_0\prod_{j=1}^t (1-q+3qX_t)$$ with expected value $$E(Y_t|Y_{0}) = (1-q+3pq)^t Y_{0}$$ you can also express the amount at time $t$ as a function of a single random variable $Z_t=\sum_{j=1}^t X_t\sim Binomial(t,p)$ , but noting that $Z_t$ is not independent from $Z_{t-1}$ $$Y_t|Y_0=Y_0 (1+2q)^{Z_t}(1-q)^{t-Z_t}$$ possible strategy you could use this formula to determine a "low risk" value for $q$ . Say assuming you wanted to ensure that after $k$ consecutive losses you still had half your original wealth. Then you set $q=1-2^{-k^{-1}}$ Taking the example $k=5$ means we set $q=0.129$ , or with $k=15$ we set $q=0.045$ . Also, due to the recursive nature of the strategy, this risk is what you are taking every at every single bet. That is, at time $s$ , by continuing to play you are ensuring that at time $k+s$ your wealth will be at least $0.5Y_{s}$ discussion the above strategy does not depend on the pay off from winning, but rather about setting a boundary on losing. We can get the expected winnings by substituting in the value for $q$ we calculated, and at the time $k$ that was used with the risk in mind. however, it is interesting to look at the median rather than expected pay off at time $t$ , which can be found by assuming $median(Z_t)\approx tp$ . $$Y_k|Y_0=Y_0 (1+2q)^{tp}(1-q)^{t(1-p)}$$ when $p=0.5$ the we have the ratio equal to $(1+q-2q^2)^{0.5t}$ . This is maximised when $q=0.25$ and greater than $1$ when $q it is also interesting to calculate the chance you will be ahead at time $t$ . to do this we need to determine the value $z$ such that $$(1+2q)^{z}(1-q)^{t-z}>1$$ doing some rearranging we find that the proportion of wins should satisfy $$\frac{z}{t}>\frac{\log(1-q)}{\log(1-q)-\log(1+2q)}$$ This can be plugged into a normal approximation (note: mean of $0.5$ and standard error of $\frac{0.5}{\sqrt{t}}$ ) as $$Pr(\text{ahead at time t})\approx\Phi\left(\sqrt{t}\frac{\log(1+2q)+\log(1-q)}{\left[\log(1+2q)-\log(1-q)\right]}\right)$$ which clearly shows the game has very good odds. the factor multiplying $\sqrt{t}$ is minimised when $q=0$ (maximised value of $\frac{1}{3}$ ) and is monotonically decreasing as a function of $q$ . so the "low risk" strategy is to bet a very small fraction of your wealth, and play a large number of times. suppose we compare this with $q=\frac{1}{3}$ and $q=\frac{1}{100}$ . the factor for each case is $0.11$ and $0.32$ . This means after $38$ games you would have around a 95% chance to be ahead with the small bet, compared to a 75% chance with the larger bet. Additionally, you also have a chance of going broke with the larger bet, assuming you had to round your stake to the nearest 5 cents or dollar. Starting with $20$ this could go $13.35, 8.90,5.95,3.95,2.65,1.75,1.15,0.75,0.50,0.35,0.25,0.15,0.1,0.05,0$ . This is a sequence of $14$ losses out of $38$ , and given the game would expect $19$ losses, if you get unlucky with the first few bets, then even winning may not make up for a bad streak (e.g., if most of your wins occur once most of the wealth is gone). going broke with the smaller 1% stake is not possible in $38$ games. The flip side is that the smaller stake will result in a much smaller profit on average, something like a $350$ fold increase with the large bet compared to $1.2$ increase with the small bet (i.e. you expect to have 24 dollars after 38 rounds with the small bet and 7000 dollars with the large bet).
