EDIT : In fact, there is an R package that will do an appropriate transformation: the 'metafor' package. Details can be found at wviechtb.github.io/metafor/reference/escalc.html. Search for "Cronbach's alpha" for the appropriate section. Credit to @Wolfgang for this information. ORIGINAL ANSWER : Rodriguez and Maeda (2006)[1] offer a solution. They note that the ratio $$(1-r_\alpha)/(1-\rho_\alpha)$$ is an F distribution with degrees of freedom = $(n-1)$ and $(J-1)$ , where $r_\alpha$ is the sample $\alpha$ , $\rho_\alpha$ is the population $\alpha$ , and J is the number of items[2,3]. Thus, "a nonlinear monotonic normalizing transformation of the sample coefficient alpha [is]: $$T_i=(1-r_\alpha)^{1/3}$$ [4] They point out that this transformation is biased, but it is less biased than Fisher's r to z transformation (and is also less biased than ignoring this issue entirely). They further note that the bias in Fisher's transformation is usually ignored[1,4], so (my interpretation) it is probably ok to ignore here as well. Therefore, using this transformed $\alpha$ coefficient, the weighted mean transformed alpha can be computed with the formula: $$\overline{T}=\Sigma w_i T_i/\Sigma w_i$$ where $w_i=1/v_i$ and $$v_i=\frac{18J_i(n_i-1)(1-r_{\alpha i})^{2/3}}{(J_i-1)(9n_i-11)^2}$$ (See Hakstian & Whalen, 1976[4] for a derivation of this formula). The variance of $\overline{T}$ is $\overline{v}=1/\Sigma w_i$ with a standard error of $\sqrt{\overline{v}}$ , enabling calculation of a confidence interval. These values can be transformed back into $\alpha$ with the formula: $$\hat{\rho}_\alpha=|1-\overline{T}^3|$$ where $\hat{\rho}_\alpha$ is the estimate of $\rho_\alpha$ . Rodriguez and Maeda[1] provide SPSS syntax to calculate these values, which may be helpful in creating code in your statistics program of choice. References [1] Rodriguez, M. C., & Maeda, Y. (2006).
