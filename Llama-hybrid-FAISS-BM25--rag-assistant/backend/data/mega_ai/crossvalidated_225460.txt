The central limit theorem, What it means

For instance I have a hypothetical data like the one below Month # Households total revenue Average revenue Jan-15 113 51791 458.3274336 Feb-15 196 43819 223.5663265 Mar-15 207 85322 412.1835749 Apr-15 348 95057 273.1522989 May-15 152 18265 120.1644737 Jun-15 155 42235 272.483871 Jul-15 198 12005 60.63131313 Aug-15 246 44688 181.6585366 Sep-15 299 51006 170.5886288 Oct-15 197 54446 276.3756345 Nov-15 239 58685 245.5439331 Dec-15 326 33685 103.3282209 Jan-16 179 85471 477.4916201 Feb-16 137 33720 246.1313869 Mar-16 163 68143 418.0552147 Total 3155 778338 3939.682467 Now, the CLT suggests that because the sample size( # hh) is sufficiently high, the average revenue will have approx a normal distribution. but, can we say that about the distribution of the overall average revenue? In that case, our sample size (which I think would now be the number of months) isn't sufficiently high so can we not approximate the distribution of average overall revenue to a normal distribution and use t-test kind of tests?
