What is the loss function used for CNN?

For example, in AlexNet, they never specified what loss function they were using. https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf The output is a probability vector of dimension $1000 \times 1$ So either they are using Euclidean distance with one-hot encoded cateogries. Or some multi-class logistic regression loss. Can someone help?
