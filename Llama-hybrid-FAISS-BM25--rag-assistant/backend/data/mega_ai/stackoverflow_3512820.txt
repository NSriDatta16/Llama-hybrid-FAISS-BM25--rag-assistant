Upgrading a PHP/MYSQL application?

I'm looking for inputs into how I can manage the upgrade process itself of a homegrown php/mysql application. Meaning, if we have a 'stable' version of our php/mysql application working on our production server, and we now want to upgrade it to the next version that we've worked on - how do we go about doing that elegantly? What practices should I be implementing? What I was planning to do was just to Ask the developers to stop checking in code after all stability / functionality tests are done Take the application offline*** (Q: how should I prevent ppl for logging in / accessing public pages? Best practices for that?) but allow access to developers through a secret login page / url Log onto the production server and check out the latest version locally*** Have the developers/testers test their code through the secret access page / url*** After that is done, we restore access to all by removing this secret access page / url, removing the site-under-maintenance page and restoring access to all. ***NOTE: A simple way of doing this would be to rename /myapp/ to /myapp.old/ and put the new application version into /myapp.new/ Developers would access /myapp.new/, test to their satisfaction and then after we're done, we would rename this back to /myapp/ (this is just the basic idea)
