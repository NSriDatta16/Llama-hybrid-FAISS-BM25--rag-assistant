You can write the dual SVM objective as maximizing a concave function. Since maximizing is the same thing as minimizing the negative of the objective, and the negative of a concave function is convex, concave maximization and convex minimization are really the same thing; we tend to still use the phrase "convex optimization", because "convex minimization/concave maximization" sounds dumb.
