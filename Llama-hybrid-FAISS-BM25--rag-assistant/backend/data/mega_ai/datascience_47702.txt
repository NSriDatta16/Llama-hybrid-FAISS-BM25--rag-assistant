Convolution Neural Networks on microcontrollers

I am wondering if an already trained convolutional neural network can be represented as a formula just like a perceptron can ( $x_1w_1 + x_2w_2 + \ldots =$ PREDICTION). I know that the formula could be a lot more complicated like this, but in general would it be possible to train a CNN in Python or Matlab, get the weights and create an arithmetic, exponential, whatever formula made with those acquired weights? I want to do this because I am trying classify in a PIC32 which I think does not have the capacity to perform a CNN within itself. Or do you know if there is a "c library" that can do CNNs?
