Train a regular classification network but for regression. When you introduce fully-connected layers have the tabular features concatenated to one of them. Concatenated them to the one with fewer features like 50-100 or else they may not be given that much importance due to the presence of too many features. Alternatively, if you want random forest features, you could concatenate the output of the forest to the last layer or concatenate its features into the neural network. If you want to use the image features in the random forest, you would have to use an auto-encoder to compress the representation to a small number and use those as features for your forest.This is called representation learning.It was done here (for tabular) and it won the Kaggle challenge: https://www.kaggle.com/c/porto-seguro-safe-driver-prediction/discussion/44629#latest-532540 .
