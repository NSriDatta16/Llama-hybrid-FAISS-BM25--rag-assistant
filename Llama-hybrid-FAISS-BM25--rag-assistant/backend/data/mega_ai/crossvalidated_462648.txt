How to calculate $P(A, B | C)$ from Bayesian Network?

I have this bayesian network: A -> B -> C I need to calculate $P(A, B|C)$ . How can I do that? I tried doing: $P(A,B | C) = P(A|B,C)P(B|C)$ But I don't understand where to go from that considering I don't have any CPT that can help me in solving $P(A|B,C)$ . I only have CPT's where $B$ is dependent on $A$ and $C$ is dependent on $B$ . Also, what should I read to be able to solve such weird flows' probabilities in the BN?
