Persist row order in Flex AdvancedDataGrid

I have an AdvancedDataGrid that I allow the user to drag/drog the rows to reorder them and also allow them to sort on columns. I want to save the row ordering so that the next time I load up the data, the row ordering is preserved. I have a bindable array collection to the data grid. The array is a collection of a custom AS object. I tried just using the bindabled array collection I give to the datagrid but the order always stays the same. thanks.
