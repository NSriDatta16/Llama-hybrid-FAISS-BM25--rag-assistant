If you take a look to the clickableTextCell html code generated by gwt you will see something like (taken from gwt showcase) Click Robert So I will recommend u doing something like: ClickableTextCell cell = new ClickableTextCell(); cell.addStyleName("yourStyle"); and in you style.css do whatever you want. .yourStyle div{ text-decoration:underline; }
