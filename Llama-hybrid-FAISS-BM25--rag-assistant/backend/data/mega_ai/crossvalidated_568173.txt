Approximating a 1-d Kalman Filter with non-Gaussian Observation Noise

I'm looking for a Bayesian filter where observations are generated according to $s_t = \gamma s_{t-1} + w_p$ and $w_p \sim Normal(0, \sigma_p^2)$ . Both $\gamma$ and the variance of the process noise $\sigma_p$ are known. However, different from the classical Kalman filter, the observational noise is not assumed to be Gaussian. Is there a specific name for this kind of filter? I'm particularly interested in comparing the Kalman filter's estimates to the optimal estimates for a problem where the observation noise is only approximately Gaussian. Hence, I tried to recursively compute the posterior (numerically) using simple grid approximation, but I'm struggling with the marginalisation part: $$p\left({s}_{t} \mid {m}_{1: t-1}\right)=\int p\left({s}_{t} \mid {s}_{t-1}\right) p\left({s}_{t-1} \mid {m}_{1: t-1}\right) {d} x_{t-1}$$ How would something like this look with a simple grid approximation? Is it feasible?
