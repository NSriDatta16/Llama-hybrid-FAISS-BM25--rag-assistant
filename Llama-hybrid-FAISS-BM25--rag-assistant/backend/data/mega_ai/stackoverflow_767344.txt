I don't know of any studies that exist, but to get you thinking about both sides of the issue, here's a paper against forcing password changes: Managing network security â€” Part 10: Change your password And an instructional site for an educational institute that makes at least a somewhat compelling case (Written by a Ph.D.) for forcing users to change their passwords frequently. These are the main arguments the site gives FOR forcing password changes, after the link to the page: "Why Do I Have to Change My !@$%#* Password?" If you're required to change your password at least every six months, someone who's hacked your password and has been accessing your account without your knowledge will immediately be shut out once your password is changed. Some may think this is an uncommon scenario, but people commonly sell an old computer and forget to erase passwords they may have saved for dialing in or for accessing their email. If you change your password at least every six months, hackers who may be trying to crack your password using brute force (as described above) basically need to start over because your password may now have been changed to some pattern they've already tried and rejected. Forcing a password change also discourages users from using the same password on multiple accounts. (Using the same password on multiple accounts is bad because then your password is only as secure as the least secure of the systems sharing that common password, and if your account does get compromised, the bad guy suddenly has access not just to one account, but to multiple accounts, magnifying the scope of the problem). As far as "research" goes, these might not cut it, but seem to be at least a good introduction to both sides of the argument.
