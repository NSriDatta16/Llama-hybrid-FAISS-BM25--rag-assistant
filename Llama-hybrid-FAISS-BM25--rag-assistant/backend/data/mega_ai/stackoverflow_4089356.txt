Good Free/Open Source graphics library for C#

Im looking for a good Open Source or Free library in C# using GDI+ or DirectX. I would rather like using GDI+ than DirectX. The idea is to be able to graphicate nodes from a graph, so all I need is drawing circles, arrows and pointers.. nothing fancy, I don't want to use highly overloading libraries. Thanks to all! [EDIT] I understand what you all say, but perhaps I didnt explain myself. I know how to work with GDI++ or WPF, but these is the deal: Im looking for a library that provides some extended functions allowing not just to draw, but to control the shape (drag around, etc..) Im not very pro-WPF in this particular case, because is not an application relying much on UI and I just want to show the graph and allow to rearrange nodes, nothing fancy. I'll take a look on the link given anyways. I hope now that those who thought this was a lame question get the point. Thanks again
