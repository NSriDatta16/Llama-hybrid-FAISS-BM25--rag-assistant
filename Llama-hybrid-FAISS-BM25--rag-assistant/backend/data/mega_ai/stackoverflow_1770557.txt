Embedding background images in an e-mail

I'm trying to use an embedded image in an e-mail as the background image, i've got the following code to embed it: LinkedResource backgroundLink = new LinkedResource("..\\..\\background.gif"); backgroundLink.ContentId = "BackgroundImage"; backgroundLink.TransferEncoding = System.Net.Mime.TransferEncoding.Base64; htmlView.LinkedResources.Add(backgroundLink); m.AlternateViews.Add(htmlView); Then in the e-mail body i've got the following code to test: test It doesn't display, but when i put it in as an image like this is is fine: Does anyone one know why it won't display as a background? Many thanks in advance :)
