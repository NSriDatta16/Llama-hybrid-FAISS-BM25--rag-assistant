The license file only gets created when you add a control to the form. It won't do anything if you open a form with existing Infragistics controls. If you delete all the lines in the license.licx file after adding the control everything should work. Our environment has a checked in license.licx file that is empty and we make source control ignore the license file so any changes on a developer machine won't make it into the build machine or anywhere elsewhere.
