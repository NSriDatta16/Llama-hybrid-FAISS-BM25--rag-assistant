Finding Similar Strings without case sensitivity - iPhone

In my application there is a tableView & a search bar. I have an NSMutable array to fill data in tableView. Now, whatever user types in a search bar - data should be filter accordingly & tableView should be reloaded. I have implemented following code in my application on textField resignFirstResponder. My question is within this code. -(BOOL)textFieldShouldReturn:(UITextField*)txt { [txt resignFirstResponder]; // on textfield resign searchData will be called [self searchData]; return YES; } -(void)searchData { // N -> total elements & i for loop NSInteger n=[CategoryDtlArray count],i; //CategoryDtl is my custom class & it's objects are stored in my array CategoryDtl *tmpCat; // dtl string -> which is needed for comparison NSString *dtl; for (i=0; i it should be displayed in table // else not. // "How to implement this?" // String comparison without case sensitivity } } Thanks in advance for helping me.
