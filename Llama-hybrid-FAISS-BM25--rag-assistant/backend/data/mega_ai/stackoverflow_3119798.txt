What is the user variable set to? run a simple invoke command from the directory with the Capfile which should try to execute on every server listed. Does it successfully connect? cap invoke COMMAND="echo 'Hello World'" If that won't run then likely your user is not the same as your ssh passwordless agent. You could also look in the SSH logs on the server and see if you can tell what agent is actually trying to connect unsuccessfully.
