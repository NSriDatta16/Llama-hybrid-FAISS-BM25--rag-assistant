I just use a combinatioin of tabs and windows, with each window containing a logical grouping of tabs. In both FF and Chrome, I can drag tabs between windows to reorgaize them as desired. Also, on Linux or OS X, you can use multiple workspaces, each with one or more browser windows. I dunno -- maybe Windows 7 has workspaces too now?
