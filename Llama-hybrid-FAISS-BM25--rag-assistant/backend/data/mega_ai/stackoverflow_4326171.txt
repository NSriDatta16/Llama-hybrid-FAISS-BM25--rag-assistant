Linq-to-Sql Count

I need to do a count on the items in a joined result set where a condition is true. I thus have a "from join where where" type of expression. This expression must end with a select or groupby. I do not need the column data actually and figure it is thus faster not to select it: count = (from e in dc.entries select new {}).Count(); I have 2 questions: Is there a faster way to do this in terms of the db load? I have to duplicate my entire copy of the query. Is there a way to structure my query where I can have it one place for both counts and for getting say a list with all fields? Thanks. Please pay especial attention: The query is a join and not a simple table thus I must use a select statement. I will need 2 different query bodies because I do not need to load all the actual fields for the count but will for the list. I assume when I use the select query it is filling up with data when I use query.Count vs Table.Count. Look forward to those who understand what I'm asking for possible better ways to do this and some detailed knowledge of what actually happens. I need to pull out the logging to look into this deeper.
