Suspiciously high Multivariate PSRF from gelman.diag()

I am using "Multivariate PSRF" statistics from gelman.diag() function to analyze my MCMC chains. Now I analyzed convergence 471 variables (parameters for each site). How is it possible that "Multivariate PSRF" says 1.248096 , when psrf for each of 471 sites ranges from 0.9996 to 1.012 max? Psrf CI is 1.044 max! It seems Multivariate PSRF grows with the number of variables, which is definitely not desired of convergence assessment. I think I can safely say that the model converged, but the Multivariate PSRF suggests otherwise... so is it computed wrong or something?
