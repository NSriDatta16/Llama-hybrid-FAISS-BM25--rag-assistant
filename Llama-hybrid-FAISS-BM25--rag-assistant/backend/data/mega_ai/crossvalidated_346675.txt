regression - Considering all interactions between variables. PLS, Regression, or neither?

I am dealing with a dataset where p>>N and I have executed several different techniques to understand what are the most important features. These include, lasso regression, random forests, adaptive boosting forests, and mixed selection. I have no way of verifying these feature are better outside of the subspace only containing them outperforms (in terms of ROC) my full feature space. I am considering building a regression with every single interaction between all 1000 variables I am dealing with to gain significance in which interactions are most important. Is there a better way of going about this? This feels very brute force, but also feels very thorough. I found a very helpful link at executing this. This equips me with the formula() syntax to get at every interaction between a single variable. Is there a better way than looping through my entire dataset and manufacturing a formula string that concatenates every variable separated by a * to get all of the interactions? Is this really the best way? I was considering looking at covariances and correlations, but I think the regression gets at the spirit of both in addition to a p-value for significance in a relationship to the response existing. Does PLS account for this any better? Does PCA give us sufficient information to know how many significant features exist?
