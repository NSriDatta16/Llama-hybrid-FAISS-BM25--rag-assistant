If its possible to get progress callbacks from the python module i would suggest finding out how many bytes are processed pr second ( By simply storing where in the file you where at start of the second, and where you are at the end ). When you have the data on how fast the computer your on you can off course save it, and use it as a basis for your next zip file. ( I normally collect about 5 samples before showing a time prognosses ) Using this method can give you Microsoft minutes so as you get more samples you would need to average it out. This would esp be the case if your making a zip file that contains a lot of files, as ZIP tends to slow down when compressing many small files compared to 1 large file.
