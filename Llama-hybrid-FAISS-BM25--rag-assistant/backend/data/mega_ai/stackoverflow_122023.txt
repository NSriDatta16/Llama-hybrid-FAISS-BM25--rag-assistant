The second and third would be invalid because it is an implicit upcast -- which is a dangerous thing in C++. This is because the class which you're casting to has more functionality than the class it is being assigned, so unless you explicitly cast it yourself, the C++ compiler will throw an error (at least it should). Of course, this is simplifying things slightly (you can use RTTI for certain things which may relate to what you want to do safely without invoking the wrath of bad object'ness) -- but simplicity is always a good way to approach problems. Of course, as stated in a few other solutions, you can get around this problem -- but I think before you try to get around the problem, you may want to rethink the design.
