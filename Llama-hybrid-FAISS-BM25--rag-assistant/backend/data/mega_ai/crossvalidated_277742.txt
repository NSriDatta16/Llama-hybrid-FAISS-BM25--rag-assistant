R results two different values of Cronbach Alpha

I'm a programmer and I needed to do a Cronbach's alpha method to compute statistics. I tried to write a code but I got two values of alpha: library(psych) MyData The result was raw_alpha std.alpha G6(smc) average_r S/N ase mean sd 0.47 0.96 1 0.36 24 0.044 3.6 0.68 lower alpha upper 95% confidence boundaries 0.39 0.47 0.56 Am I doing the analysis correctly, as I have been told by an expert that the alpha should be $>0.8$ in this analysis and data rather than $0.47$, or is the value $0.96$ the correct alpha value?
