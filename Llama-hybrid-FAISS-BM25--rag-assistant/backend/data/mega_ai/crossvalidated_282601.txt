This is ultimately a somewhat common thing to wonder about generalized linear models with non-normal data (i.e., why can't I just use linear regression), which is more general than the specific case with count data. It most commonly comes up when discussing logistic regression. @Kjetil b halvorsen's answer to Goodness of fit and which model to choose linear regression or Poisson contains a lot of good information, but it may be helpful to put the basics in a simpler and more concise form. If the response data are counts, the residuals from an OLS regression cannot be distributed normally, no matter what. A linear (OLS) regression would assume they are, which could cause some problems. The conditional variance of count data almost always changes as a function of the conditional mean. This means that you would have heteroscedasticity. A linear (OLS) regression assumes homoscedasticity, which could cause some problems. The decimal predictions is not really a problem, because the predicted values ($\hat y$s) are supposed to be conditional means, not necessarily values you will observe. Instead, a big problem is that the model will imply negative predicted values for allowable predictor ($X$) values, whether or not they actually exist in your dataset. Note that a negative mean count is nonsensical. The above is the standard justification for using a generalized linear model (e.g., a Poisson regression or a logistic regression) instead of OLS regression with a non-normal variable. But I've always thought the biggest problem is just that a linear model is the wrong way to think about your data, and that in the end, we are supposed to be thinking about our data and using the model to help us do so.
