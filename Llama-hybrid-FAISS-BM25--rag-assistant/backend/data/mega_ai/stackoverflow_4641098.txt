Best method sequence for Ruby on Rails model?

In Rails, we offen write a lot of code in our models such as class methods, plugin methods, named_scopes, callbacks... I am wondering if there is a good pattern to organize the sequence. I saw the best example in a presentation before, but now I forgot. Anyone have suggestion? Thanks
