What is the exception that is thrown? If an exception is thrown then I would assume that there is a critical section of the Session object that needs to be synchronized or handled with more care and maybe not the entire session. I have not had reason to utilize them much, but I know there are channels as part of the wicket-ajax.js (found in org.apache.wicket.ajax package). These control how multiple AJAX calls are handled. They might be worth a look. In this file is the following comment: /** * Channel management * * Wicket Ajax requests are organized in channels. A channel maintain the order of * requests and determines, what should happen when a request is fired while another * one is being processed. The default behavior (stack) puts the all subsequent requests * in a queue, while the drop behavior limits queue size to one, so only the most * recent of subsequent requests is executed. * The name of channel determines the policy. E.g. channel with name foochannel|s is * a stack channel, while barchannel|d is a drop channel. * * The Channel class is supposed to be used through the ChannelManager. */
