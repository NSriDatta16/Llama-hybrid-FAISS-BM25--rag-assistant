There are at least two different approaches: Create a single embedding space then use a distance metric for continuously measured vectors. The embedding space can be pretrained, fine-tuned, or trained from scratch. One example is the StarSpace package . Use a distance metric that combines features measured on different scales. One example is Gower’s distance which uses a combination of Manhattan distance (continuously measured features), rank order (ordinal measured features), and Sørensen–Dice coefficient (categorical measured features).
