It's not entirely clear what you want to do. If you want to create a display object at the top of your application, then create a new layer directly on stage. That can have anything you like in it, and you can make it draggable or whatever you wish. If you want to create a Flash window that floats above the browser, then you can't. Or rather, you can, but you need to create a new window using JavaScript (called from ExternalInterface, see this StackO question ), load in a new SWF, and then link the two SWFs using LocalConnection. This is really unsatisfactory though, because LocalConnection is broken (in a whole host of ways).
