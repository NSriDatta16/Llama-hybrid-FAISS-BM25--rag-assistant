No. How else could you implement operator= ? You have to dereference this in order to return a reference to yourself. Note though that I'd still store the items in the STL container by value -- unless your object is huge, overhead of heap allocations is going to mean you're using more storage, and are less efficient, than you would be if you just stored the item by value.
