NLP Question: Where can I find a list of all open compound words (with spaces in them), like "peanut butter" or "high school"? [close

I already have a list of "1-gram" words, which include closed compound words like "skyscraper" or "weatherman." However, I'm also interested in compiling a list of "2-gram" words that take on a meaning completely different than their two halves, such as "rubbber band." Using any modules/resources/methods, how can I accomplish this? (I tried downloading Google's Ngram files, but lots of the "2-gram" were nonsensical, like "and I" or "what was.")
