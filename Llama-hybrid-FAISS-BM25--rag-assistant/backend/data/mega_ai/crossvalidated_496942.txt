RF's don't really have any assumptions. Multicollinearity will affect the variable importances, if this is of interest to you, although this is in part dealt with by feature bagging. What may be of interest to you is the bootstrapping procedure. By default, RF perform a vanilla bootstrap to generate resamples. This is a problem for time series data, because the autocorrelation in the data is not preserved or, as in your case, a sort of missing random effect for each individual to model the time dependence. Some options: 1) modify the bootstrapping procedure to perform a different kind of bootstrap (good luck) suited for time series/dependent data (such as block bootstrap), 2) normalize the time component, so that it is comparable between the patients, although not the same as a random effect in a linear model.
