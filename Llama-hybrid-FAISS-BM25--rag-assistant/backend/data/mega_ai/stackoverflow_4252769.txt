According to Wikipedia, the behavior of a VUMeter is defined in in ANSI specification C16.5-1942. The needle full rise and fall time is supposed to be 300 mSec, averaging loudness over that duration. I would try a 1-pole low-pass filter on the needle angle to approximate that angular rate, and animate the meter manually on a frame-by-frame basis using CADisplayLink based drawRect animation. View animation might not give the same responsiveness.
