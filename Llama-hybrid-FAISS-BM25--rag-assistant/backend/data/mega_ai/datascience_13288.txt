Does the phenomenon of over-fitting of data varies with training algorithms?

Suppose I have a dataset which I want to train using Neural network and SVM. Is it possible that with my dataset after training, the Neural network is overfit while the SVM is not? Like can a dataset be overfit for one training algorithms and not be overfit for another training algorithm? Is it even possible? Or if it is not overfit for one training algorithm, can be assume that it will not be overfit for other training algorithms too?
