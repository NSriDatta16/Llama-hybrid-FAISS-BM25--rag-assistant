CNN high confidence on wrong classifications

I've trained a CNN for alphanumeric digits classifcation on about 2M image samples. The network is rather simple: conv->relu->maxpool->conv->relu->maxpool->flatten->dense->relu->dense->softmax Accuracy is very good, I get over 99% on the validation set, but what troubles me is the fact that the network's prediction confidence is always very high (98%+) even for samples that are misclassified. I thought it could be a problem of overfitting, so I saved a checkpoint of the network every 2000 steps during training, but almost all of them show the same behaviour (saved for the first two checkpoints or so, where te network's accuracy is still not good enough). I tried researching the problem, but I'm not even sure what's the most appropriate search query, so I didn't come up with much. What other reasons might be for the network excessive confidence in its predictions?
