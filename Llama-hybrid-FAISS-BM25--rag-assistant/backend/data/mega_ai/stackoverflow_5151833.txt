It all depends on your requirements, which you have not stated too clearly. Do you want Internet storage (web/dav/ftp/sftp) or storage within your own network? If you are looking for a solution which is available for almost every OS and where the storage is located somewhere in our wonderful Internet-verse, webdav/s could be the solution. I'm not really sure, if I understand the statement "files on FTP that you yourself can assign". Please be a little bit more specific.
