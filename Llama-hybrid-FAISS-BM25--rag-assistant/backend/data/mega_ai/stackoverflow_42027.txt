I would seriously consider using a third party dll to do this rather than code it yourself. I don't know the full details of the 10 TM projection, but I worked on a project that required coordinate conversions between many different coordinate systems to a high degree of accuracy, including UTM and Lat/Long. We found that the maths involved was way too complicated. Perhaps take a look at the open source PROJ.4: http://trac.osgeo.org/proj/ They seems to support a huge range of conversions, and so I hope Alberta 10 TM will be covered.
