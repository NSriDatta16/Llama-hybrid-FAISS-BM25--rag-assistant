I would recommend the brand new " AI for Medical Diagnosis " course on Coursera . In this course, you will learn how to apply Machine Learning (ML) techniques to concrete problems in modern medicine. Moreover, it focuses on several medical imaging problems. You can also look at some of our works [1, 2, 3], where we introduce these topics across the breast cancer diagnosis. Finally, we have some interesting and easy sample of some tools for medical imaging analysis. References [1] Francisco M. Calisto, Alfredo Ferreira, Jacinto C. Nascimento, and Daniel Gonçalves. 2017.
