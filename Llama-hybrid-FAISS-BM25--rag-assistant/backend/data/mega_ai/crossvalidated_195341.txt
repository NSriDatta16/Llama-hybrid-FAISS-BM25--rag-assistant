State space model affected from future events?

I understand that a state-space model is a common model where the current observation $y_t$ depends on the current state $x_t$. Is there any common model where the current observation $y_t$ depends on the future states $x_{t+1}, x_{t+2}, x_{t+3},...$? I'd like to know a popular model representing future states' effects, and also inference method of its parameters. I think it's common phenomenon where the current observation depends on the future ones. For example, someone might need to leave home for her office earlier than usual because she has an appointment with a customer in that morning. The future event, which is the appointment, has a effect to the current observation, which is her behavior. Likewise, stock price also depends on the future event like next IR announcement and business statistics. I searched on google scholar with "time series future event", and get to know Trend Impact Analysis . However, it does not look employing formal statistics model like state space model. The following image is a graphical representation of a state-space model and the model in my question. Update (9:21AM Feb 14 2016) In my understanding of @ZacharyBlumenfeld's comment, my problem can be represented as the following graphical model. I think this model is similar to Figure (b). How do I predict future value $y_{t+i}$ on this model? In Figure (c), $x_t^{(i)}$ denotes the belief of $x_{t+i}$ at $t$.
