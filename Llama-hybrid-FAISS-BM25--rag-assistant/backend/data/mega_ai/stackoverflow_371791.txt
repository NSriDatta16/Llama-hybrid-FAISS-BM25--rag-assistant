.htaccess redirect with fragment

I need to issue a redirect, using .htaccess, to a URL with a fragment (also known as an anchor), but it's automatically escaping the #. At the moment I want a hard-coded fragment, but for the sake of others if you know how to take it from the URL too that would be good. Ideally I should be able to use QSA as well. For example: http://www.exameple.com/test?foo=bar should become 1) http://www.example.com/?foo=bar#MYVALUE or taking the fragment from the url: 2) http://www.example.com/?foo=bar#test My (non-working) code looks like this: RewriteRule /test http://www.example.com/#MYVALE [R,QSA]
