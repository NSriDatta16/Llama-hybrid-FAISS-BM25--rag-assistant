Looking for a library for simple protocol implementation

I need to implement a simple over-the-network interaction in C++ and I've been wondering whether there are libraries that do that already. My protocol basically sends messages and receives responses. Each message is just a set of 3-4 values of basic data types. I would like to find a library (or libraries) that can do one or more of the following: Serialize the values into an efficient byte array (I cannot use text based serialization). Send the message and wait for the result (it can either lock or receive the response asynchronously, I don't care). It has to be able to correlate between the sent message and the response. Ideally I would like to be able to write something like this: // On the sending side bool send(const string& str, int x, char y) { Message msg; msg > str; msg >> x; msg >> y; if (some conditions...) return true; // the message was handled successfully else return false; } Pay attention that cool_library::send returns true not when the message was successfully sent but when the other side responded with success result. All this lengthy explanation is just to show that I need a simple functionality. Nothing fancy. I can even send and receive the buffers myself but I need something that can correlate messages to responses. I don't want to go for RPC because it seems to me as an overkill. Thank you.
