DockPanel is just a common Panel for arranging elements around the edges of the container with the option of having the last element fill the remaining space. It does not do any sort of VS type docking/undocking/pinning/unpinning. For something like that you would need a custom control. You could try a free one like AvalonDock or purchase ones like Infragistics XamDockManager or from the other component vendors.
