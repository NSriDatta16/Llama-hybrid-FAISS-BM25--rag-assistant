This question has been asked before if you search in Google. Some advice: Reset your referrences from tools->choosetoolbox items in VS Put your dll in bin foler of your project, THEN do the whole AJAX set-up. Don't put the dll on your desktop as the referrence will always point to the desktop and if it is deleted then problem Make sure First put the Toolkitcontrol on the page Then if you are still unable to drag and drop onto the page like me, drag and drop into the source view
