Time series_Calculation of monthly rolling average

How do we calculate monthly rolling average? I have monthly 2 years of data . I know that if it is 2 months rolling average ,we need to take the average of every 2 months . But since I need monthly rolling average,I am assuming that it would just be the mean of each month and prepare a chart having means of each month . Please correct me if I am wrong.. I need to show this in R.
