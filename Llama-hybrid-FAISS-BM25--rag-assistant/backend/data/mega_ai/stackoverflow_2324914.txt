How to void overlap of 2 images when drag and drop in C#?

I want to drag and drop images in a panel and want to avoid overlap of images.The images are dragging from another panel and I want to build a layout from that images. I was able to drag and drop images to the panel and want to avoid overlap when dropped. private void panel1_DragDrop(object sender, DragEventArgs e) { // this.Cursor = Cursors.SizeAll; Control c = e.Data.GetData(e.Data.GetFormats()[0]) as Control; if (c != null) { mycontrol = c; c.Location = this.panel1.PointToClient((new Point(e.X, e.Y))); this.panel1.Controls.Add(c); } } e.X and e.Y must not be lied on top of other controls in the panel. How can I do that? Please give me a appropriate solution. Thank you.
