I recall that Url Routing by default first checks to see if the file exists, and commas are not legal in filenames, which is parhaps why you are getting errors. IIS may have legacy code that aborts the request before it can get to asp.net for processing. Scott Hanselman's blog post talks a bit about this and may be relevant for you. As general comment: Url rewriting is typically used to make a url friendly and easy to remember. ~/page.aspx?id=1,2,3,4 is neither worse nor better than ~/page/1-2-3-4.aspx : both are difficult to use so why go through the extra effort? Avoid creating new url forms just because you can. Users, help desk, and other developers will just be confused. Url rewriting is best utilized to transform ~/products/view.aspx?id=1 ~/products/category.aspx?type=beverage into ~/products/view/1 ~/products/category/beverage
