Yet another way - COUNT doesn't count NULLs (except for COUNT(*) ): SELECT TeamId, COUNT(DECODE(IsNew,'N',1)) CountIsNotNew, COUNT(DECODE(IsNew,'Y',1)) CountIsNew FROM Agent GROUP BY TeamId; Or, if you prefer CASE: SELECT TeamId, COUNT(CASE IsNew WHEN 'N' THEN 1 END) CountIsNotNew, COUNT(CASE IsNew WHEN 'Y' THEN 1 END) CountIsNew FROM Agent GROUP BY TeamId; (note: the "1"s could be any literal value)
