You usually don't "combine" (as in add) the running times to determine the overall efficiency class rather, you take the one that takes the longest for each worst, average, and best case. So if you're going to perform insertion sort and then do a binary search after to find an element X in an array, the worst case is O(n^2) and the best case is O(n) -- all from insertion sort since it takes the longest.
