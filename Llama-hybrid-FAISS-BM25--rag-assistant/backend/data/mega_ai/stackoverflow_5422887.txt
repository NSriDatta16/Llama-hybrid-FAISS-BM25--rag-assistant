If your project really does consist of logically independent areas then I don't see a downside. Any routing situation can be implemented with minimal effort, so that's not a dealbreaker. One think you will have to keep in mind is that your project is going to have one extra level of directory nesting. For example, you can't just look in the views directory and get a good idea of all of your views, because they will all live in directories corresponding to their namespace (the same goes for tests). This is often desired, however, as it helps things stay a little more organized.
