using IsolatedStorageFile with Silverlight 4

I am looking at writing a silverlight app that I plan to use OOB setting to enable use on both PC and mac. I have been doing a little investagation on the isolationstoragefile and what I understand is it will work for both pc and mac without a problem.....Is that correct? The application I am building is going to be a business application that will submit details back to the main database if there is an available connection. If not then I want to store the information locally until there is an available connection. My question is lets say I have 3 user accounts using the same machine. Can I have the isolationfile stored in the same place? or must it be under the user profile? I don't want to have orphaned records which I could see happening if the data is stored on each user's profile. Any advise would be great!
