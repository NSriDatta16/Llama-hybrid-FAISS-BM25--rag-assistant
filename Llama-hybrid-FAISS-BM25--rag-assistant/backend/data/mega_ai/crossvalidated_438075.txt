Maybe use something like the following (simpler, more direct) R code to show that averages of a dozen standard uniform random variables are difficult to distinguish from normal. set.seed(1126) a = replicate(5000, mean(runif(12)) shapiro.test(a) Shapiro-Wilk normality test data: a W = 0.99965, p-value = 0.565 plot(qqnorm(a)) Then use R code to show that averages of 50, or even 100, standard exponential random variables are easy to distinguish from normal. What is the distribution of $A = \bar X_{100}?$ set.seed(1127) a = replicate(5000, mean(rexp(100))) shapiro.test(a)$p.val [1] 1.675877e-06 However, averages of 1000 standard exponentials are more difficult to distinguish from normal. set.seed(1127) a = replicate(5000, mean(rexp(1000))) shapiro.test(a)$p.val [1] 0.2413559
