Spring AOP: how to get the annotations of the adviced method

I'd like to implement declarative security with Spring/AOP and annotations. As you see in the next code sample I have the Restricted Annotations with the paramter "allowedRoles" for defining who is allowed to execute an adviced method. @Restricted(allowedRoles="jira-administrators") public void setPassword(...) throws UserMgmtException { // set password code ... } Now, the problem is that in my Advice I have no access to the defined Annotations: public Object checkPermission(ProceedingJoinPoint pjp) throws Throwable { Signature signature = pjp.getSignature(); System.out.println("Allowed:" + rolesAllowedForJoinPoint(pjp)); ... } private Restricted rolesAllowedForJoinPoint(ProceedingJoinPoint thisJoinPoint) { MethodSignature methodSignature = (MethodSignature) thisJoinPoint.getSignature(); Method targetMethod = methodSignature.getMethod(); return targetMethod.getAnnotation(Restricted.class); } The method above always returns null (there are no annotations found at all). Is there a simple solution to this? I read something about using the AspectJ agent but I would prefer not to use this agent.
