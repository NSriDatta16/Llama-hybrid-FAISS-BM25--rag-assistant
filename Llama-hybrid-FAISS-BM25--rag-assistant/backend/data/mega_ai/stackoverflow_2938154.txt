what's the right way to bind sqldatasource to asp:label in asp.net 4.0?

Is it possible using Eval? If so, can someone post a short fragment to illustrate? My SqlDataSource returns 1 record with 3 fields, I'd like to Format these into a string. eg: Record Field 'Name' = 'Jack' Field 'Amount' = 100 Field 'Date' = 12.02.2010 asp:Label text should end up being: Welcome Jack, last payment was 100 on 12.02.2010 if another control than asp:Label is appropriate, that would be good to know also.
