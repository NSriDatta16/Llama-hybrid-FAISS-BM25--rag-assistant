Using style sheets on large sites is an excellent idea. However, it only really works when you apply your team standards to the style. It makes sense to have a singular template controller that links your style sheet(s). It also makes sense to appoint someone on the team as "keeper of the style" who all changes to the style sheet should go through before making substantive changes. Once the style standards are agreed upon and defined, then all of the controls in the site should implement the styles defined. This allows developers to get out of the business of coding to style and simply coding to the standard. Inputs are inputs, paragraphs are paragraphs, and floating divs are a headache. The key is standardization within the team and compliance by all of the developers. I currently lead a team site that has upwards of 30 style sheets to control everything for layout, fonts, data display, popups, menu and custom controls. We do not have any of these issues because the developers very rarely need to edit the style sheet directly because the standards are clearly designed and published.
