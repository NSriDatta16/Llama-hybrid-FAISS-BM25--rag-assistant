I think the answer to this question is simple. Write it in what you know. The biggest reason is "UPGRADES"... with Magento being as high profile, the possibility of being hacked with older versions increase every day. Therefore, when they release new versions, you are going to want to upgrade. With that in mind, are you going to want to add all of your changes into each new version as it is released? Probably not. If there is a solution to write this as a separate tool, that is what you should do. PROS TO BUILDING OUTSIDE OF MAGENTO No need to re-integrate the upgrades every time a new version of Magento is released. Code is easier to maintain. Tool is easier to write in something you are familiar with. No learning curve. Integration speed will be much quicker. More flexibility since you do not have to fit inside Magento code limitations.
