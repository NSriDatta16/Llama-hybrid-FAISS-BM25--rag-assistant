As you correctly point out, $U=F_X(X)$ will be uniform . Consider now that we have (somehow) identified some sufficiently "normal-like" continuous strictly monotonic distribution function on (0,1) (which we'll call $G$). Then $Y=G^{-1}(U)$ has distribution $G$. So $Y=G^{-1}(F_X(X))\sim G$ So if we can find some suitable $G$, we're done. Possible distributions with the kind of properties you want: The beta distribution . This is very often used as a distribution for the binomial parameter in Bayesian statistics. If you choose the two parameters to be approximately equal and larger than 2, then you have something that looks roughly normal. The inverse cdf is widely available. A suitably truncated normal . Rescale a normal so that it has mean near the middle of (0,1) and most of its probability in (0,1). For example, $N(\frac12,\frac16^2)$ truncated to the unit interval. The inverse cdf is fairly convenient and (if you don't need the tails of the original distribution) this can avoid the need to go via the uniform. Logit-normal , for some parameter values; to get those, rescale your normal to have a suitable parameter combination such that the logit-normal looks like you want. Typically you'll want $\mu$ not too far from $0$ and $\sigma A standard Bates distribution . Take the mean of $k$ independent standard uniforms. The inverse cdf isn't particularly convenient if you're doing this from scratch, but if you can find an existing function to do this (or the related Irwin-Hall, followed by a rescaling), this may be convenient. Raised cosine . Specifically, the one with $f_Y(y) = 1+\cos(\pi(2x-1))\mathbb{I}_{(0,1)}$. There are many other fairly obvious choices; for example a suitably truncated $t$ would allow you to push up the kurtosis a little (I think all of the previous examples have lower kurtosis than the normal; you may in some circumstances want to get it a bit closer to that of the normal); you could also consider scale mixtures for example.
