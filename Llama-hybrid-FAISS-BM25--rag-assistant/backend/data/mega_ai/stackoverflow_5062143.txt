AS3, scroll content by dragging content. Like on a phone. no scroll bar. flash

I am trying to figure out how to scroll content in a action script project by dragging the content. This would be the same functionality as seen on a phone using touch gestures to move content. I would like to do this with the mouse. I do not want a scroll bar. I want to drag a Movie clip with my mouse to scroll the content in the movie clip. Does anyone have any tips or urls for me to check out? thanks cp
