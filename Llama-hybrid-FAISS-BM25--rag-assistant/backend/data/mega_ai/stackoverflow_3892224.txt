AppFabric ErrorCode :

I have installed AppFabric on the server. I have created a cluster of a single computer . I have also create a cache named "Gagan". used the following commands in order Use-CacheCluster -Provider xml -ConnectionString \NB-GJANJUA\Cache Start-CacheCluster Result is that the cache service is up and running ..so far so good. I then setup my web.config file like below But as soon as I launch my site , it comes up with this error Parser Error Message: ErrorCode:SubStatus:There is a temporary failure. Please retry later. (One or more specified Cache servers are unavailable, which could be caused by busy network or servers. Ensure that security permission has been granted for this client account on the cluster and that the AppFabric Caching Service is allowed through the firewall on all cache hosts. Retry later.) Source Error: Line 44: Line 45: Line 46: Line 47: Line 48: Is there something that I am missing ? Note : I have already referenced the Microsoft.ApplicationServer.Caching.Client and the Microsoft.APplicationServer.Caching.Core assemblies THanks for your time and patience With Regards Gagan Janjua
