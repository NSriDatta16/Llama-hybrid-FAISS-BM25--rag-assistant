First of all $R^2$ is not an appropriate goodness-of-fit measure for logistic regression, take an information criterion $AIC$ or $BIC$, for example, as a good alternative. Logistic regression is estimated by maximum likelihood method, so leaps is not used directly here. An extension of leaps to glm() functions is the bestglm package (as usually recommendation follows, consult vignettes there). You may be also interested in the article by David W. Hosmer, Borko Jovanovic and Stanley Lemeshow Best Subsets Logistic Regression // Biometrics Vol. 45, No. 4 (Dec., 1989), pp. 1265-1270 (usually accessible through the university networks).
