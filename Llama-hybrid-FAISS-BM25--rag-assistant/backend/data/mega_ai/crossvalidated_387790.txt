Why would you introduce a constant in a moving average model, when you already have the option of differencing?

In the online forecasting book of Hyndman ( https://otexts.com/fpp2/MA.html ) firstly the use of differencing is explained. After that he shows the formula for a moving average model: $$y_t = c + \varepsilon_t + \theta_1 \varepsilon_{t-1} + \theta_2 \varepsilon_{t-2} + \ldots + \theta_q \varepsilon_{t-q}$$ I don't see why to add the constant denoted by 'c' in the upper formula. Is there any difference between introducing 'c' and using first differencing before trying to fit a MA model? Furthermore, introducing 'c' would imply that it actually Ã­s allowed to have a nonstationary time series. It seems like I'm making a mistake in my thinking...
