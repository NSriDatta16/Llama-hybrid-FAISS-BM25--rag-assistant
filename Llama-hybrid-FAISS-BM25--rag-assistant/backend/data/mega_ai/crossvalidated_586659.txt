You say: "My goal is to show that when I change a particular parameter in the model from Value A to Value B, it has a consistent influence upon the dynamics." For doing that, you need some metric $M$ (e.g. some numeric value) that describes this "influence upon the dynamics". E.g., if the change in dynamics is a change in variance (fluctuation, volatility) in the time series, then this would be your metric $M$ . Once you have that, the rest is fairly standard statistics. You simply check whether the ten values of $M$ obtained with A are significantly different from the ten values of $M$ obtained with B. Depending on what you can assume about the data, you could look into e.g. the t-test or the Mannâ€“Whitney U test . Note, that the question of what inner dependencies (auto-correlation) your time series are having is not really relevant in this approach.
