Howto connect eclipse tasklist (Mylyn) to google code?

I'm using Eclipse Galileo. I want to connect the eclipse tasklist to a google code project. I need a connecter to do this. Connectors can be installed via Task Resoitory view -> add TaskRepopsitory -> Install more Connectors. But I can't see that one of the listed connectors will support google code. I searched the web and read about the Web Templates Connector. But most information I found refer to eclipse Ganymede. There is a download on this page. Its a zip file wich contains the Web Templates Connector. I was not able to add this site to the eclipse update sites. I downloaded the file and added it to the update sites via the "add Archive" function. But it seems eclipse is expecting a jar file there and stops the installation because the hashcodes are not equal. How do I install the Web Templates Connector to eclipse Galileo? Is there another connector which I can use ? Thanks in advance.
