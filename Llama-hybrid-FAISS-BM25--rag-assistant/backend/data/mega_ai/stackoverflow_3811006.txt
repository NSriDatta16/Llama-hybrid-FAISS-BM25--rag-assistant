Where to store the unit test classes?

So far I've always stored my unit test on my HDD, as I'm the only one in the company to actually care about them, but I'm thinking of cheking them in the repository in order to use them in my CI server, and look into code coverage, so I'm wondering... where do you find the corresponding projects to be better stored in a SVN repository? along with the projects they "cover", or in their own project structure? Idea 1: Project A\trunk\Project A Project A\trunk\Project A.Tests Idea 2: Project A\trunk\Project A Unit Tests\trunk\Project A.Tests I see their own pros and cons to both possibilities, so I just want to get a small push :P.
