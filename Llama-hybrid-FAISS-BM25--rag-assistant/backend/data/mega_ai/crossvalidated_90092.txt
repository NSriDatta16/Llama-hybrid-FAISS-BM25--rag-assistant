What do I call a set of datasets

For training a Machine learning model, I have 3 datasets: Training Validation Testing Normally I obtain there by dividing up the full dataset into pieces. I've created a function in my code to return the 3 of them in a record (ie named tuple, ie structure) an I need a name to refer to the grouping of the 3. Currently I am using Learning_datasets, but that isn't great. Is there some kinda of commonly used phrase or term? Like a set of trees is called a forest.
