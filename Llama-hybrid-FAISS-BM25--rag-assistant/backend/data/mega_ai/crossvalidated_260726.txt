What non-Bayesian classifiers could be used in a naive Bayes model?

Bayes' theorem [is used] in the classifier's decision rule, but naive Bayes is not (necessarily) a Bayesian method. - Wikipedia . I have applied naive Bayes assumption to LDA, but it has a Bayes classifier as the sole classifier. To what other non-Bayesian classifiers or learning models could the naive Bayes assumption be applied?
