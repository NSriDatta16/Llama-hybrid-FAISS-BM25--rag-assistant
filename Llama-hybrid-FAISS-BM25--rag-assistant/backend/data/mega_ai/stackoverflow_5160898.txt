Most Instructive Open Source Android Projects?

I'm looking to compile a list of instructive open-source Android projects. My criteria for instructiveness: High code quality Good API coverage, demonstrating how various parts of the API interact Continually improved, showing that the designs are in fact maintainable Good aesthetic quality In other words, the apps that as intermediate to advanced Android developers we should be looking to for guidance, and not simply tutorials that demo a few concepts.
