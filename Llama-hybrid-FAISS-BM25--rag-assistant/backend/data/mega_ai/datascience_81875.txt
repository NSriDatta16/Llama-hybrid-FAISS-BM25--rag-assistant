Using constants in input of a ML Model

I'm currently building a binary classifier. My input is a sequence of 32 time-steps. Certain time-steps of the input will be constant (ex: t-0 will always be 0, t-5 will always be 9, etc) Does it make sense to add these time-steps as features into the model? Im thinking its not since: The model will have to pay attention to these features and they will add a type of noise/bias into the model - since there isnt any new information to be gained from them. Am i thinking about this correctly?
