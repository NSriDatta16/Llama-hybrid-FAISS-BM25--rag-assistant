See the music embedding portion of this blog post by John Resig . (For some reason, the Mario game that Resig links to plays sound for me in Firefox but not Chrome or Safari; it'd be worth investigating why). The idea is that you use a data URI to embed a base64 encoded version of your data within the HTML file itself. So you could write Javascript to continuously generate data in the MIDI format , then encode it in base64 , and then inject it into an HTML5 element
