Best pattern for change notification (events or delegates)

I have a solution where i pass a collection of items from a source to a presenter. When the source is updated I want to be able to notify the presenter to show the new result. What comes to mind is to make a ChangeNotification class, pass it along with the result and have that class notify the presenter. Now as I see it this can be implemented in two ways, either ChangeNotification can have events that the presenter subscribes to, or it can have delegates that the presenter sets and the source calls if it is not null. The benefits of using events is that more than consumer can react to the notification and you can hook up reactive extensions to it, the downside is that you have to manage subscribe/desubscribtion of the events for proper garbage collection. Delegates are simple but you lose some flexibility. What is the most elegant pattern for situation like this? Is there some other way I haven't thought of?
