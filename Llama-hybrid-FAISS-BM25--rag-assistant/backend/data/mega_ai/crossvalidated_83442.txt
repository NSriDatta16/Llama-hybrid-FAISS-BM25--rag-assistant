Algorithms/methods to create more features of a limited amount of features?

So, let's suppose that I have a set of 20 features - some of them are continous and some of them are binary. Is there an algorithm/method/solution to create more features ( combine/transform ) those features ( for example by using 2 of them to create another feature )? I want to do this to give a linear SVM more features to look at - is this a good thing to do or a big no-no? Would this be called increasing the dimensionality of the dataset? Can I extract more data out of those 20 numbers by creating new variables of their combinations? If this matters at all, I use a linear kernel.
