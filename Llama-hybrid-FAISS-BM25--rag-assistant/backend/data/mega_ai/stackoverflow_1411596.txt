Modifying JPEG headers in C#

I'm trying to open a file to bytes, convert it to a string, modify some data (think Steganography) and convert the file back to bytes and save it as a jpeg. So far, everything I've tried has corrupted the file in converting it to a string. I've tried converting it to a 64-bit string, but of course that's a bit hard to modify the data in :P Any suggestions on how I can do this properly, without corrupting my file?
