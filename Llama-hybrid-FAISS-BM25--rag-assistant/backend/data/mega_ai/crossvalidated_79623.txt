Optimal Rotation Before Curve Fitting

I am fitting a 1-dimensional polynomial to a set of data points $\{(x_1,y_1,z_1),...,(x_N,y_N,z_N)\} \subset \mathbb{R}^3$ using least squares regression. My first instinct was to choose $x$ as an explanatory variable and perform regression on the sets $\{(x_1,y_1),...(x_N,y_N)\}$ and $\{(x_1,z_1),...,(x_N,z_N)$ separately. This would yield two functions $f_y, f_z$. My curve would then be given by $\{(x,f_y(x),f_z(x)) : x \in [a, b]\}$. Where $a,b$ are appropriately chosen. However, I don't think this is optimal as the x-coordinates may be identical in a worst-case scenario. My instinct is that I should perform PCA on the data-set beforehand and use the principal axis as my explanatory variable. Is this optimal in some sense or are there better ways to do this?
