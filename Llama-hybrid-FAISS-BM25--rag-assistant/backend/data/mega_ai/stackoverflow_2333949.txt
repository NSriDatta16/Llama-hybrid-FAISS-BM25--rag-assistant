With Zend Framework, what is the difference between Module and Package

I devlopp web applications with Zend Framework. For now, I have a huge library, wich contains each an every things, used by a couple of web applications. I am thinking of reorganising it, using the concept of "Module". But I am not sure about the difference between Module and Package. What I understand is : a Module contains a part of a web application (pages, models...) a Package is a group of class in the library Am I seeing it right ? And how to know where should go my classes (model of a module, or library) ? Because for example, I have some classes to do the translations. I have "model" classes, to represent a language, a text and its traductions... And I have kind of an "API" class that is just here to translate a string into a language. I would say that I need a module for the model classes and the web interface to edit the traductions, and the API class would go in the library ? Is that right ? Isn't that weird to have 2 kind of classes, one for the module and one for the library. I guess that's an open question about API, librairie and application architecture.
