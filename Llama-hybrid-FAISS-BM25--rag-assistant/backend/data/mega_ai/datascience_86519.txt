XML files are generated when you train the Haar Cascade Classifier. From the OpenCV docs : Object Detection using Haar feature-based cascade classifiers is an effective object detection method proposed by Paul Viola and Michael Jones in their paper, "Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features" in 2001. It is a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained from a lot of positive and negative images. It is then used to detect objects in other images More information on Haar cascades can be found here . Some tutorials for training Haar Cascades are available. Link 1 Link 2 Link 3
