If you want to identify autoregressive model for your time series then you can use sample partial autocorrelation function (SPACF). If it shows that SPACF dies after one lag you can try to make forecasts with AR(1) model. Suppose then that your series shows seasonality with cycle of k periods. If your SPACF shows that there are significant peaks at lags 1 and k then you can try AR-model with lags at 1 and k.
