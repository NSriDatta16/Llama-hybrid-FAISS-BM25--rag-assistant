How to interrupt select/pselect running in QThread

I have a QThread that reads from a socket and sends a signal (QT signal) when there are any data available. This would be easy with blocking read(2), but i need to be able to stop the thread from outside without waiting for too long. If I were using pthread I would use pselect and pthread_kill(thread_id, some_signal) , but QThread doesn't seem to have any similar methods. And adding a dependcy on pthread to this project doesn't seem to elegant. I also don't want to use the other ugly methods like constantly trying to read from the socket with some relatively small timeout. Edit: The sockets are not TCP, but bluetooth L2CAP.
