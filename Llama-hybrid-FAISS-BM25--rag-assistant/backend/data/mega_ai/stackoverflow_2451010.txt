QR code - where can I find (free) code to embed my own generator on a web page?

couldn't find it exactly from earlier questions, but I am probably repeating an earlier question, so apologies upfront ;-) I am looking for a simple code to embed a QR 2D code generator on a website I am building. I assume their should be some free open source code for that but I could only find paid software. Can anyone point me in the right direction? would be mostly appreciated! best regards, Robbert
