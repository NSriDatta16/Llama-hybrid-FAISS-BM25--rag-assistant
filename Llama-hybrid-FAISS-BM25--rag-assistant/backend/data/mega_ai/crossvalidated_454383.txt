Your problem is very similar to the problem of predicting daily ridership in the Paris metro which is open 18 hours of each day . It had two powerful seasonal factors DAILY and HOURLY. Your 71 quarterly values has a quarterly and 5 year seasonality thus it requires multiple deterministic seasonality components. I introduced you data to AUTOBOX , a piece of software that I had to re-configure (expand it's functionality) based upon multiple seasonal-deterministic factors and a possible arima component and latent anomalies. Here is your data , Here is the Actual/Fit and Forecast for the next 20 quarters (5 years) The hybrid model is here using when needed quarterly seasonal dummies AND seasonal dummies reflecting the 20 period cycle. and here in more detail and here . It includes an arima component (1,0,0) and a pulse indicator at period 61 suggesting a change in trend within the 5 year cycle . N.B. this not-so-subtle characteristic is visually obvious and found automatically using Intervention Detection procedures detailed here http://docplayer.net/12080848-Outliers-level-shifts-and-variance-changes-in-time-series.html and every place good time series statistical process are adhered to. The forecast plot with 95% forecast intervals is here using monte-carlo procedures is here Here is the 1,000 value simulation for the first period out . . All models are wrong but the model presented here is less wrong then a lot of other models and can be improved by incorporating weighted least squares to deal with a deterministic change ( before and after period 41 ) in the variance of the errors. Look closely at the plot of the original series.
