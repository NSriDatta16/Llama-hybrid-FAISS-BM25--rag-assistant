I think that in this case it is totally acceptable to break the pure theory of REST in this situation. In any case, I don't think there is anything actually in REST that says you can't touch dependent objects in business cases that require it. I really think it's not worth the extra hoops you would jump through to create a custom transaction manager, when you could just leverage the database to do it.
