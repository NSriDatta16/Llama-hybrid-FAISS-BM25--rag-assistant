Going back to django's documentation , you can: new_query_set = query_set_1 | query_set_2 This works as a logical OR which is actually addition without duplicates. This answers the addition aspect and AFAIK does not hit the db at all ! new_query_set = query_set_1 & query_set_2 This works as a logical AND. Still missing how to subtract QuerySets. It's hard for me to believe this has not been dealt with elegantly by the community...
