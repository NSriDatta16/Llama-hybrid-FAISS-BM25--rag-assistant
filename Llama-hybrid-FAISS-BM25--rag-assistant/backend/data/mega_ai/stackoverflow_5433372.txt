How do web browsers implement a text search?

I would like to build an application that contains HTML web control, and enables searching and highlighting multiple phrases in the html area, like it's implemented in web browsers today. The main idea is to make the search ignore the html special tags, and refer only to the real text (the inner html). I know that the solution will include editing the DOM, but I'm not sure how this could be implemented. I searched a lot over the net, and I read also the post of Zavael , but unfortunately I couldn't find any suitable answer. Any answer, example or direction will be appreciated.
