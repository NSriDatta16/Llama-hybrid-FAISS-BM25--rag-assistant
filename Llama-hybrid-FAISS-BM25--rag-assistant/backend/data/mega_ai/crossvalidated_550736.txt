It's a bit hard to know what you're asking and how to answer it without completely explaining logistic regression, but the sigmoid curve $$ P(Y=1|X) = \frac{e^{a+bx}}{1+e^{a+bx}} $$ and the linear logit regression equation $$ \text{logit}(P(Y=1|X))=a+bx $$ are equivalent ways of writing the same relationship. There is no transformation. The former makes it clear that we are modeling a probability using a sigmoid curve; the latter makes it clear that we are modeling the logit of the probability using a linear function. The two equations emphasize different parts of the relationship, but they express identical information. To see how, note the definition of the logit: $$ \text{logit}(p) = \text{log}\left(\frac{p}{1-p}\right) = \text{log}(p)-\text{log}(1-p) $$ Inserting the sigmoid model for $p$ , we get \begin{align} \text{logit}(P(Y=1|X)) &= \text{log}\left(\frac{e^{a+bx}}{1+e^{a+bx}}\right)-\text{log}\left(1-\frac{e^{a+bx}}{1+e^{a+bx}}\right) \\ &= \text{log}\left(\frac{e^{a+bx}}{1+e^{a+bx}}\right)-\text{log}\left(\frac{1}{1+e^{a+bx}}\right) \\ &= \text{log}\left(e^{a+bx}\right) - \text{log}\left(1+e^{a+bx}\right) + \text{log}\left(1+e^{a+bx}\right) \\ &= \text{log}\left(e^{a+bx}\right) \\ &= a + bx \end{align}
