I think I was overthinking this. For purposes of an example, below are some numbers similar to what I might see as results from the two different methods: Linear Extrapolation: 26.4+/-0.4 ksi Exponential Extrapolation: 26.8+/-0.6 ksi The maximum value from the linear extrapolation is 26.4 + 0.4 = 26.8 ksi. The minimum value from the exponential extrapolation is 26.8 - 0.6 = 26.2 ksi. Therefore, the estimated result is (26.8 + 26.2) / 2 = 26.5 ksi. The associated uncertainty is (26.8 - 26.2) / 2 = 0.3 ksi. Therefore, the reported result is 26.5+/-0.3 ksi. This can be generalized by saying the reported result is the average of the maximum end of the range for the minimum result and the minimum end of the range for the maximum result. The associated uncertainty is half the difference of these two values. Obviously, the assumption is that both predictions are sufficiently close together that their ranges overlap. Someone more experienced with statistics may be able to explain cases where this assumption is invalid. Additionally, they may be able to explain what I said in more technical terms. In any case, any input/feedback would be welcome. Edit: I just did some more research on this. The plot below shows the curves from the original post with vertical lines defining the +/-1 standard deviation. The location of the vertical lines for the purple curve was calculated by first determining the percentage below the peak the +/-1 standard deviation results were for the red and blue curves. The same relative location on the purple curve is where the vertical purple lines are located. As you can see, the results are not exactly the same as what I described above. The actual result from this calculation is 26.52+/-0.33 ksi. However, when the significant digits are reduced such that there is only one digit of significance in the uncertainty, the result is the same as what I described previously. Ultimately, if you need a quick approximation, the method provided initially should be pretty close, but if you're concerned about being precisely correct, use the method described in my edit above.
