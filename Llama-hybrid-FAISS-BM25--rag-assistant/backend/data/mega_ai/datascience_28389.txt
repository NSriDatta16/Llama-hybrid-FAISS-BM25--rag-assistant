We can add a lot of other features to the given data-set. Week Differences. Day, Month etc. Time Differences as well. And then creating group by views of the data-set as well After that we can use a RF to help use see what are the feature importance of different attributes/columns etc. After that you can also go for Dendograms(hierarchial clustering) to see what columns are irrelevant. And the process continues with different models, doing EDA's etc..
