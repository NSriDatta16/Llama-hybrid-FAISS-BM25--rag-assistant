To answer the question: For PHP, I think a shopping cart, address book and forum would be good projects. Those usually cover a wide spectrum of web-programming topics - sessions, registration, database, form processing and authentication. Personally speaking: It looks like you looking more of an architecture person than a coding guru. I wouldn't penalize the applicant because he cannot come up with the name of an obscure function or need to refer elsewhere. The key thing is that he has the initiative and know where to look (heaven knows how many times I need to look up PHP.NET). A good question for an architecture guy, IMHO, is to tell him you have a data-set, but you have three different ways of displaying them and each view has different operations. If his answer is just a gigantic SWITCH-CASE, then he may be the wrong choice.
