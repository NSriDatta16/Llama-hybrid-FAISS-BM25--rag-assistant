HTML 5 - Sneaky stuff

HTML 5 is the new W3C definition for HTML and will likely represent the direction the internet goes as people find the next killer apps that work in it. There are the much publicized 'public' coding features like the tag, but I'm wondering what low-level coding tricks people have found so far that could be important, useful, interesting or all of the above. Some examples I've come across thus far: Drag-and-drop events that control data transfer - eg: document.addEventListener("dragstart", function(event) { event.dataTransfer.setData("image/png", slides.imageRep()); event.dataTransfer.setData("slides", slides.serializedRep()); // etc. }, false) 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional graphics through extension of the element. Context-aware html blocks (as a bonus - the obselecense of the and tags - woohoo!) tag for ideographs and I'm not sure if this is new, but the tag - these dynamically updateable tags are going to make the web a richer experience. Anyone played with these and found some interesting examples of them put together? Some demo code perhaps?
