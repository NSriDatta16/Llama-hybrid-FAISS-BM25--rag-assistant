Suppress "does not implement protocol" warning in GCC

I want to suppress a particular warning while developing an iPhone app in Xcode. The warning is: "warning: class 'XXX' does not implement the 'XYZ' protocol" I understand I use the directive: #pragma GCC diagnostic warning "-Wxxxxxxxxxxxx" But I don't know what the xxxxxxxxxxxx should be. Any ideas? (Assumption: there is a valid reason for doing this. And I need to do this because otherwise I can't enable the treat warnings as errors option.)
