Using Date & StrToTime

I've been using the following bit of code without any issues till it finally landed on a windows server and decided to produce an error: $date = date('F d, Y', $data->e_date) date($time_format, strtotime($date.' '.$data->e_time)) *(e_date is stored like this: "1293559200", and e_time is stored like this: "18:00")* The error is as such: date() [function.date]: Windows does not support dates prior to midnight (00:00:00), January 1, 1970 in ... To my understanding this is because I am using strtotime within the date function . So what I'm wondering is what is an elegant method of solving or rewriting this? Should I be feeding the entire strtotime in a new variable, i.e. $newdate and then back to date in that form, or otherwise? Thank you!
