Persisting multiple DTOs mapped to a single entity

I guess this has been asked before here , but I'm still confused about the correct approach to be taken. I have a WPF client application which talks to a WCF service to retrieve data. On the Service side , I have a large entity ( around 25 properties) and I have three forms in my client app . On each form, I need the facility to edit certain properties of my domain entity. I do not want to return the large entity through the service as I need just 3-4 of its properties on each form. Hence I have created three DTOs ( we are using AutoMapper) , one for each screen. The service returns DTOs and this works very fine as far as the retrieval goes. My question is how do I persist my DTOs. We are using NHibernate in the service layer. If I pass my partial DTOs to the service to persist , I would need to reload my large entity every time to perform the update. Is this the only way to handle this scenario ? What other options do I have if I need to display partial views of one single entity on the UI .. besides sending across the whole entity over the wire ..or creating three DTOs? Thanks.
