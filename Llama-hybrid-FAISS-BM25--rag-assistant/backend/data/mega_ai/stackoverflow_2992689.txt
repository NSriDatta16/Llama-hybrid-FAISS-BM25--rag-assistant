snmp, how to retrieve ip connected to the router with MIB-II

I want to create a program that acts as manager and that queries the router (or sets a trap) to obtain the list of ip connected to it. My router has these functionalities: SNMP v1, v2c, built-in MIB-I, MIB-II agent. Is it possible to retrieve these informations quering the MIB-II agent of the router in a standard way (not vendor dependent)? Bye
