If you want a DSL, then you don't really want to embed an existing language, you want to create a "Domain Specific Language". To me that means a lot more than just changing some keywords and not using parenthesizes. For instance, right now I'm working on TV Scheduling right now. When we create fake guide data for a test, we always add a comment that looks like this (cut directly out of the test I'm working on): * TIME:8.....30....9.....30....10....30....11....30....12....30.... * 4FOX:____________[Spotlight.............][Jeopardy..]____________ * 6CBS:[Heroes....][Heroes....][Heroes....]________________________ * 8HMK:xx[A.River.Runs.Through.It....][Blades.Of.Glory...]_________ If I have to create more guide data, I'll directly interpret those comments as a DSL (Making them a long string or string array instead of comments). That would be an appropriate DSL. If you're just after embedding a flexible language, Groovy or JRuby are both made for this, as is BeanShell. There is, in fact, an entire API built around replaceable plug-in scripting languages so that you should be able to drop in any JVM language you want and not change your code a bit.
