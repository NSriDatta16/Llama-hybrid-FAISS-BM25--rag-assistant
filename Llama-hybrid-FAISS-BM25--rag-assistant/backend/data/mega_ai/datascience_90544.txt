Can machine learning algorithms predict random number No, absolutely not . ML is not a magical process, it works by identifying patterns in the data. In the case of supervised learning (i.e. with training) it means finding in the features the most relevant indications to help predict the target variable. Randomness is the complete opposite of "patterns", by definition something truly random is not predictible in any way. Intuitively if a human with a lot of time cannot do a task, then ML cannot do this task either.
