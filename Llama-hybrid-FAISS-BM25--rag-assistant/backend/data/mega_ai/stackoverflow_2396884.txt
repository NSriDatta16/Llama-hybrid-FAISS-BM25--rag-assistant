NGINX : Allow users to password protect directories themselves?

To my knowledge Nginx can only password protect directories from within the configuration file(s). That works nicely, but is not a real option for end-users who A) can not edit the configs and B) would break the configs if they could Right now I am thinking about a webbased representation of the directory structure where they can point and click - rewriting the configs and re-kill-HUP-ing Nginx... But somehow the whole idea feels like I am about to rewrite cPanel v0.0.1 ;-) Anybody here had the same problem and came up with an elegant and maintainable solution? I have full control over the server. Thanks!
