How to reconstruct an image after performing PCA on face image dataset (eigenfaces)?

I've performed PCA on face images dataset and I'm not sure how can I use the most informative principal components to show the "reduced" image. The original image is 96*96 pixels (96*96 = 9216) and I use a sample of 70 images here (70 rows and 9216 column). We get 70 principal components (min{num of samples, num of features}=70). How can I re-construct a 96x96 image in order to show the eigenfaces? I want to show my students how the eigenvectors "predict" the real data. The dataset I'm using can be downloaded here . The code: install.packages("foreach") file ='C:\\I\\Love\\Data Science\\face.training.csv' data_all = read.csv(file , stringsAsFactors=F) dim(data_all) #7049 31 # use only 70 first images data = data_all[1:70,] names(data) str(data) # extract the images data im.train
