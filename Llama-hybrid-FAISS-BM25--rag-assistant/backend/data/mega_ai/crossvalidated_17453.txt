I assume from the your phrasing "process" that this is time series data. If so with 15 possible supporting variables I guess you want to select the best 9 to use as predictors for some output series. After taking into account any unspecified deterministic structure such as pulses,level shifts,seasonal pulses and/or local time trends you could form a Transfer Function (ARMAX MODEL). After validating that the parameters haven't changed over time and the variance of the errors is constant or at a minimum rendering both of these two assumptions to be true via appropriate Gaussian fixup strategies you might have a useful model. Since you didn't design/ortogonalize the study but simply observed , you can't unambiguosly state how much variability is explained by each input or refer to each input separately as having any partial effect. Collectively the coeffficients ( including any needed lags ) for any and all of the input series can be said to best predict the output series.
