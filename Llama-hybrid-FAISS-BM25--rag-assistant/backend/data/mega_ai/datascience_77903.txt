If you are trying to hide the actual data values, one standard way to make private data available publicly is to process the dataset through PCA or similar algorithms. Also use one hot encoding or embedding for categorical/text data, renaming the columns. Reverse engineering this data exactly would be very difficult, maybe even impossible. There may be ways to get similar data back, but you can mimimize even that by performing a 2nd step: reducing the number of output features to convolute the original data using another dimensionality reduction method after using PCA such as SVD, LDA, etc After this process, the data is not quite the same, but is usually similar enough to the original dataset to be useful for most use cases.
