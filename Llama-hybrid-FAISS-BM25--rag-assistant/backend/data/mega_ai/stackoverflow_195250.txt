On Mac OS X, you can use the HID Manager to get direct visibility into which HID elements are being actuated on which devices. That should work not just for keyboard but for all HID devices — mice, game pads, etc. — though of course you can restrict what your code pays attention to to only specific devices or devices of a specific class. You'll need to be familiar with the concepts of USB device matching and USB Human Interface Device communication in general, but if you are then it should be fairly straightforward to get something up and running with the HID Manager on Mac OS X Leopard (10.5).
