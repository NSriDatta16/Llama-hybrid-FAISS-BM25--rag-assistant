I studied the Android Launcher code to see how they did drag and drop. I really like their object model. What they did, and it might be good for you to consider, is move the responsibility for handling drag and drop out to the ViewGroup in which all the draggable views are inside of. Touch events get handled there rather than in your views. Two of the key classes: DragLayer – implements a custom ViewGroup, which coordinates movement of views on the screen. The Launcher DragLayer is a subclass of FrameLayout. DragController – This object is the controller that does most of the work to support dragging and dropping. The other thing they do is not move the actual view until you drop the object you are dragging. It does not look that way though because on the screen you see a bitmap constructed from the view moving as your finger (or pointer) moves. I built a simple example and wrote it up. See http://blahti.wordpress.com/2011/01/17/moving-views-part-2/ Source code of the example is there too.
