Any tips on how to organize Eclipse environment on multiple monitors?

I can't find a good way of putting Eclipse windows on two monitors. Currently I just detached (clicked on a header and dragged) a few windows to a secondary monitor (package explorer, console, and outline) while leaving primary monitor with maximized source editing window. It works pretty well except few annoying issues. Detached windows are not in focus while you are editing your code. Which means that, for example, last build shortcut ( Alt - Shift - X , Q ) doesn't work because it can't find build file (because package explorer is not in focus). Also "Selected resources" option in a file search menu is not picking up current package selection. So I was wondering is detaching windows a right way to go? Do you have any better solutions so at least package explorer stays in focus? Thanks. PS. Btw "unable to find build" error started showing up only in 3.4 ver for some reason.
