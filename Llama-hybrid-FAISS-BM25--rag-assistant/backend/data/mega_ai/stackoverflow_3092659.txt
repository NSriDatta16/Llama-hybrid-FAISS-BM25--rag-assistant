This is not CSS3 specific, but as you are asking for a concise way to handle the styles and do mention modernizr (which works by adding classes like no-borderradius to your element if that feature is not available), I thought it might be helpful for a generally improved way to organize your CSS. There is LESS that allows the use of variables, mixins or nested rules in CSS (see the link for examples). This however requires you to compile your .less files into valid .css. To avoid this, there is/will be less.js (see also: Less.js Will Obsolete CSS ) which enables you to include .less files directly in your page (useful at least during development). I think LESS does not require you to learn a lot of new syntax rules and might help to organize fallback CSS right next to the "real" style.
