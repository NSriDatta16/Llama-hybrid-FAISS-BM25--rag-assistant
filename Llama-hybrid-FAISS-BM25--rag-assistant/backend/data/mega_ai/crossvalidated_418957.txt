This looks like a semi-supervised problem. Click on that tag in the first sentence to see a list of such posts at this site. Maybe you should estimate a logistic regression (or some other direct probability model) on the labeled data, and then use that model to predict probabilities for the unlabeled data. Then you can add those predicted probabilities to the data, there is no need to do a hard classification (or it can wait until really needed.) Some commenters ask about accuracy . You should avoid such a measure, since it is not a proper scoring rule. Use some proper scoring rule in its place, see Using proper scoring rule to determine class membership from logistic regression and this sored google search for ideas.
