JsTree with dnd plugin, always copy

I have 2 trees using jsTree and dnd plugin. I want that each drag operation to be a copy instead of a move. There is a "copy_modifier" which works Ok when pressing a modifier key, but I want copy to be the default behavior without the modifier. Any ideas? Thanks, Adrian
