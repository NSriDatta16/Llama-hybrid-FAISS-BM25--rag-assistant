Naming convention and structure for utility classes and methods

Do you have any input on how to organize and name utility classes? Whenever I run in to some code-duplication, could be just a couple of code lines, I move them to a utility class. After a while, I tend to get a lot of small static classes, usually with only one method, which I usualy put in a utility namespace that gets bloated with classes. Examples: ParseCommaSeparatedIntegersFromString( string ) CreateCommaSeparatedStringFromIntegers( int[] ) CleanHtmlTags( string ) GetListOfIdsFromCollectionOfX( CollectionX ) CompressByteData( byte[] ) Usually, naming conventions tell you to name your class as a Noun. I often end up with a lot of classes like HtmlHelper , CompressHelper but they aren't very informative. I've also tried being really specific like HtmlTagCleaner , which usualy ends up with one class per utility method. Have you any ideas on how to name and group these helper methods?
