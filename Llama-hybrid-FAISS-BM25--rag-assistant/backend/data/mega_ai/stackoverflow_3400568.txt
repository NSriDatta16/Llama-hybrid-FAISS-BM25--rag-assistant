Animated List Rearrangement (JQuery UI Sortable)

I'm trying to build a sortable listed thats animated. Apples Bananas Cavemen Let's say I've selected Apples and I want to switch it with Cavemen, I want to click on Apples, drag it to cavemen and have bannas and cave men animate up to the proper positions. I am aware that JQuery UI Sortable allows for some level of this functionality, but I'm not sure if there is a way to specify something during a pause before the DOM changes or through some cloning. $( ".selector" ).sortable({ change: function(event, ui) { ... } }); Would it be possible to manipulate sortable to provide this level of functionality, or would I be better off writing a plugin from scratch?
