Why are my file permissions on Apache being reset?

We recently switched from using PCs at work to Macs, so I'm new to the *nix way of doing things. I have the default Apache running that shipped with 10.5, but I've noticed that when I drag files from a Windows server to my machine, the permissions are changed. Specifically, I'm writing data to an XML file, and occasionally after swapping some files back and forth, it stops working. Can someone help me understand why this is happening and how I can either force Windows to respect the original file permissions (they were set on my machine when I created the file) or apply a less secure set of default permissions when the files are moved from Windows to Mac? A couple facts to be aware of: I'm using the Cornerstone Subversion client. I can use Terminal if you spell it out for me. Ultimately I'm uploading these files via Transmit to a Linux server in another location. I'm already familiar with using Get Info to change the file permissions, but maybe I'm doing something wrong. I'm logged in as root. (I know, bad bad bad.) I should also mention I know this is a simple question that should have a simple answer, but I've googled up and down without finding it. I need your help. Thanks.
