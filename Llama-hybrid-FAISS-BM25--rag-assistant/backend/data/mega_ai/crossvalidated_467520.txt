In Deep Learning only 3 things are required, Data Model Loss Function For Image Segmentation we have input data and output data of same size for height and width. The output 3rd dimension varies depending on number of classes you have. for example input 3 channel RGB image and output mask of 5 classes have dimentions 3 x H x W to 5 x H x W, So we need a to have model whose input and outputs are matching dimensions so we usually use U-Net for such tasks And this is per pixel classification task. So any classification loss function can be used. Other things are same e.g. calculating Loss, BackPropagation, Optimizers, etc. Therefore answers to your questions are, 1,2) Image segmentation is per pixel classification task where your output size is same as input size (approx.) You have labels for per pixel as a class index e.g. 1 is cat, 2 is dog, etc. For labels to visualize we usually color code them i.e. same class have same color. Per pixel loss is calculated and backpropagation is done. 3) If we talk about calculations then as compared to classification then lot of calculations are required at the second half of the network. 4) If you trained your model well then model learns the object's details so well that can recognize objects in an unseen image. For ensuring that we fed lot of unseen image to the model calculate accuracy, precision, recall using matrices such as Intersection Over Union threshold.
