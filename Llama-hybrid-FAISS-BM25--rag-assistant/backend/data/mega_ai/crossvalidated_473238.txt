Can a permutation test be used on time series to quantify an effect of the marketing campaign?

I am trying to accept or reject a hypothesis that a marketing campaign had positive effect on sales of some product. I am working with time series of monthly sales. The series is not stationary (it has positive linear trend). I would like to use permutation test as I find it simpler to explain in comparison with t-test, however I wonder if my approach below is correct: Remove the trend from the series and make it stationary. State the significance level $\alpha = 0.05 $ $\mu_b=$ mean of sales before campaign $\mu_a=$ mean of sales after campaign State the null hypothesis $H_0: \mu_a - \mu_b = 0 $ State the alternative hypothesis $H_a: \mu_a - \mu_b > 0 $ Compute empirical difference of means: $\mu_e = \mu_a - \mu_b $ Generate large number of permutation replicates Compute the probability (p-value) of obtaining $\mu >= \mu_e $ from permutation replicates Compare the p-value to $\alpha$ Is this method valid on time series, or do I need to use t-test?
