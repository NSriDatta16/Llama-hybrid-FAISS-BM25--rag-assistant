Rails and CouchDB - Architectural Concerns

I am working on a project that is going to use CouchDB for flexible storage of documents. The requirements of my system are a neat match for CouchDB for storage. BUT My question really boils down to this: Should I keeop using ActiveRecord and MySQL as well ... there are a raft of handy Plugins that are all readily available for use with ActiveRecord (such as authentication and access control). Just wondering if the advantages of leveraging existing plugins is worth the extra management overhead and possible integration issues (working across disparate datastores).
