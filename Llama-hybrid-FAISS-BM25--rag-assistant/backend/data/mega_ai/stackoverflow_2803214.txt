To add to BalusC answer: It's true that plain JSP is rather outdated (specially if used with scriplets, no so much with EL expressions). But your choice of alternatives depend highly (though not univocally) on the web framework you decide to use. And beware that in this area there are many much more alternatives (or fragmentation) than in .NET, some more oriented to the MVC pattern (Struts, Struts2, Stripes, Spring MVC) some more component-based (JSF, Tapestry, Wicket), and some others (GWT). No clear winner here. See for example here .
