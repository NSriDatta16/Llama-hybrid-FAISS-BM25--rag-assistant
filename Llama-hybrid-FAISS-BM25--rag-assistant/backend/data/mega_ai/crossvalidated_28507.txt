One strategy would be to see your design as containing 5 groups, which we could label: C, M2050, M2100, E2050, E2100 You could then set up various planned contrasts that examine questions of interest. Here are some example contrast weights for testing various research questions: C M2050 M2100 E2050 E2100 Comparison +4 -1 -1 -1 -1 Control versus other 0 +1 +1 -1 -1 Moderate versus extreme 0 +1 -1 +1 -1 2050 versus 2100 You could achieve something similar, by first testing whether control is different to the average of the other four groups and then performing the $2\times2$ ANOVA omitting the control group. The default tests in the $2\times2$ are likely to correspond to many of the planned comparisons you would do anyway (i.e., M versus E, 2050 versus 2010, and the interaction between amount and duration ). However, the contrast approach might be slightly more powerful because your error variance may be smaller (its based on deviations from the four non-control group means rather than one overall non-control mean). In previous questions, you've asked about SPSS, so here's an example of testing a contrast using GLM in SPSS . And here's a lecture on how to do it using R .
