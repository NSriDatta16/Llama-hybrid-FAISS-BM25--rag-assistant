If you need collection of objects, have a look at SplObjectStorage . The SplObjectStorage class provides a map from objects to data or, by ignoring data, an object set. This dual purpose can be useful in many cases involving the need to uniquely identify objects. Or, if you want a simple accessible tree structure, consider using SimpleXml. That wouldnt allow you to use custom page objects easily though. You dont seem to do much more with the page objects besides adding HTML to it, so it might be feasible in your case. For more advanced needs, see the Composite Design pattern
