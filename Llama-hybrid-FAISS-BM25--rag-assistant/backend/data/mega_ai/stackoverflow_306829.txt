The dot isn't inherently dangerous, but people do tend to rely on it too heavily. In fact, it occurred to me awhile back that a good way to improve your regex skills would be to stop using the dot--or at least, try to use it as little as possible. This will force you to think about how regex matching works, and to explore those other, more advanced features that you've never gotten around to learning. As with many other tools, it's easy to get stuck at a middling level of regex-fu and never really master them. This strikes me as a good way to drag yourself over that hump. Note that I'm not saying you should never use the dot again. just give it a rest for a few months while you find out what else regexes have to offer.
