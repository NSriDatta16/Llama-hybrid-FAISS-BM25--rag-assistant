You can look at the user-agent header ( $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] ). For example, an iPhone user-agent looks like: Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; U; CPU iPhone OS 3_0 like Mac OS X; en-us) AppleWebKit/420.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/3.0 Mobile/1A542a Safari/419.3 An Windows XP one might look like: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1 ; en-US; rv:1.9.2.10) Gecko/20100914 Firefox/3.6.10 And so on. See a simple script here . You can also use get_browser() (you'll need browscap though) Note that this header can easily be faked and thus shouldn't be used for anything mission critical.
