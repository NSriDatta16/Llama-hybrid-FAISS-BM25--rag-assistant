Direct comparisons, as your table shows, are not appropriate because the base observation is not runners but rather one runner in one race. For instance, imagine a country with poor overall running ability, but a talented runner participated in many races, leading to numerous observations. This runner's presence would introduce a severe positive bias into the mean estimates of this country. In my opinion, there are two methods: Take the average of each runner's performance and treate it as a measurement of their "real ability" of running (with measurement error, of course). Then, you can use a t-test or linear regression to compare the means of different countries with robust standard errors. Use random-effects models: here, i denotes a particular runner and j denotes a particular race.
