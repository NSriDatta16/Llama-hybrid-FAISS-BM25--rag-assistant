The standard location for Windows application to store their (permanent) application data is referenced by the %APPDATA% (current user) or %ALLUSERSPROFILE% (all users) environment variables. You can access them using, e.g. (only rudimentary and not very elegant error checking!): import os app_path = os.getenv("APPDATA") + "\\MyApplicationData" try: os.mkdir(app_path) except WindowsError: # already exists Now you have your own directory for your app.
