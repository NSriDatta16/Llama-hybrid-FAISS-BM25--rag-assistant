Check the width after the content has been loaded into it. You can check the width, or the outerWidth: $("#openfrag").width(); $("#openfrag").outerWidth(); outerWidth includes padding and borders. If you're setting a default width with CSS, you may consider removing that (as it overrides the natural width) or replacing it with min-width instead (assuming the future width will be larger).
