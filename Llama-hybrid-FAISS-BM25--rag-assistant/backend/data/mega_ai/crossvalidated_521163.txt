One standard measure of roughness is volatility . This arises from transforming each series $X_t$ into $\log(X_t)-\log(X_{t-1})$ , and taking the standard deviations of the results. (Ordinarily the standard deviations $\sigma$ need to be annualized. So if we start with daily stock prices from years with $252$ trading days, the volatility is $\sqrt{252}\sigma$ ; if we start with quarterly revenue data, the volatility is $2\sigma$ . For the data here, we don't need to annualize, but the data may be too small for significance.) Now we can interpret the question Are two time series significantly different in roughness, as measured by volatility? as Are the standard deviations of the transformed series significantly different? or equivalently Are the variances of the transformed series significantly different? We can answer this with an $F$ -test , if the distribution of log-returns can be assumed normal, or with some of the other tests discussed at the same Wikipedia article. As a side note: that lowest revenue line on the graph certainly looks less volatile than the others. Perhaps that company's revenue comes from long-term sales contracts, e.g. contracts signed in 2015 which determined a good amount of revenue for 2015-2019. In that case its revenue would look like an averaged version of the patterns from similar companies with shorter sales contracts.
