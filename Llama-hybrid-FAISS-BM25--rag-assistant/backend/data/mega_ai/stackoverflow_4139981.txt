Working with node-sets in Xpath 1.0

I'm working with CALS tables which has multiple colspec elements with tgroup element as a parent. In xpath 2.0 the following works: colspec/substring-before( @colwidth , '*' ) In xpath 1.0 it complains: Unexpected token - "substring-before( @colwid" There has to be a way to accomplish this. I need to sum the number values before the asterisk so that I can convert the relative column widths to percentages. At this point in the day I can't even think of an inelegant solution.
