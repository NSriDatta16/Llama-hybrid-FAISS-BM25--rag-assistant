AX uses a relational database and hierarchies are easily represented in a relational database. The coming release, AX 2012, will provide relations between organisations (DirParty table), see http://64.4.11.252/en-us/library/gg731820(AX.60).aspx But it will most likely not provide relations between (arbitrary?) objects as you describe. A possible general table structure for a "relation" table: RelationType RefTableId1 RefRecId1 RefTableId2 RefRecId2 The RelationType could be an enum of fixed relations or an id of a record describing the relation.
