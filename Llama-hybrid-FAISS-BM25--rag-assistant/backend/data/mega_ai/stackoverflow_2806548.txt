Using a javax.servlet.Filter with Compojure

I'm trying to build a simple web site using Clojure / Compojure and want to feed apply a servlet filter to the request / response (i.e. a standard javax.servlet.Filter instance). e.g. if the current source code is: (defroutes my-app (GET "/*" (html [:h1 "Hello Foo!!"])) ) I would like to add a filter like this: (defroutes my-app (GET "/*" (FILTER my-filter-name (html [:h1 "Hello Foo!!"]))) ) Where my-filter-name is some arbitrary instance of javax.servlet.Filter. Any idea how to do this effectively and elegantly?
