I am not sure if there are other benefits but I would like to look at it using couple of examples. 1) Cache all the page loading data in isolated storage so that the app does not have to hit the server if the page had to be refreshed (like due to popup blocker). More info here: Using Silverlight Isolated Storage for Local State Backup 2) Isolated Storage is a great alterative to using cookies especially if you are working with large sets of data. Examples of use include undo functionality for your app, shopping cart items, window settings and any other setting your application can call up the next time it loads.
