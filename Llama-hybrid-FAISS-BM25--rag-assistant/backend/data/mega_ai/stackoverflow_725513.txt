To my knowledge there is no way to back up or replicate your StateServer service. Another issue when using StateServer in a web farm is if your cluster allows for the same browser to reach different machines on different requests they could have different session data on each request! (edit: Martin pointed out below that you can fix this by sharing a single StateServer instance among multiple web servers). For your purposes option 2 or 3 would be more fault tolerant, and I will throw in another idea: for small pieces of data try using cookies for session storage.
