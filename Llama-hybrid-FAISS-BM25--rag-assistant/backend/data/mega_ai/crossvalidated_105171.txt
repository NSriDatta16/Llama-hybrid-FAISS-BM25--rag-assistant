Confidence intervals for predictors in multivariate logistic regression

I've got a question. I am dealing with medical data which contain 5 predictors and 1 binary outcome. When I try to classify the data using all 5 predictors I get 0.84 area under roc-curve which is quite good for me. However when I consider confidence intervals for these 5 parameters, I see that just 1 of them is significantly different from 0, its confidence interval doesn't include value "1". For all other predictors confidence interval include value 1 (from 0.78 to 1.2, for example). When I try to classify the dataset based on just this 1 predictor (the one with good confidence interval), I still have good confidence interval for it but the area under roc-curve is 0.74 and combinations of specificity and sensitivity are really worse than in first example. The question is: how should I treat the situation when not all of the predictors are significantly different from 0? Can I consider such deciding rule as a good one and use it in further analysis? Thanks a lot!
