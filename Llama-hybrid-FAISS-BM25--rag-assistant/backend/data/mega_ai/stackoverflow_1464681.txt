Have you compared the source of the pages in the different browsers? Are they the same, or are there major differences? If not, then you'll need to work on your CSS - and for that there are few better tools than Firefox and Firebug. If the source of the pages is different, then you're falling foul of an ASP.NET feature that checks your user agent against a list of Browser Capabilities or the Browser Definition files - and in earlier versions of the framework, these were woefully out of date - what rendered as a in IE would come out as a single cell in Firefox. Since ASP.NET 2.0, you've also been able to change the behaviour of controls with Control Adaptors - for example the CSS Control Adapters will output styled divs for most of the tabular controls (login, registration, repeaters, etc) - which again can be targeted to specific browsers.
