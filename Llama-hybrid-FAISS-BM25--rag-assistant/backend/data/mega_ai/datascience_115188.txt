Tensorflow - do I need to learn computer vision before linear (timeseries) regression?

I'm a newbie to tensorflow / keras and I am currently working my way through Deep Learning with Python (2nd edition) by Francois Chollet. I understand the basics of Computer vision and the MNIST examples but I'm not really interested in computer vision. My question is do you think it would be safe to skip the computer vision chapters and just focus on my interest(s) in regression machine learning + time series forecasting? Thank you
