Prior to Android 1.5, Bluetooth support was limited to the headset/handsfree profile. No "audio" other than the phone conversation could be redirected over Bluetooth. Having installed Cupcake on my G1, I have now used Bluetooth stereo audio with my Motorola S9 headphones perfectly. The whole stack is even smart enough that they automatically pause the music/video, switch over to the headset profile when a call comes in and then back when the call finishes.
