jQuery Sortable - Select and Drag Multiple List Items

I have a design where I have a list of "available boxes", users take boxes by dragging them from the "available boxes" list to their "My Boxes" list. Users more often than not take multiple boxes at a time (max 20), once they have finished with the boxes they drag them back to the "available boxes" list to return them. jQuery sortable allows me to drag one box at a time which from a user perspective is undesirable. I've been unable to come up with a simple solution to the issue. I may have to come up with a different UI method entirely, but first does anyone have any suggestions on how this might be accomplished? Thanks!
