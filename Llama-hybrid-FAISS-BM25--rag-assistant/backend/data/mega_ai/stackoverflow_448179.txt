Organizing Actions in a Swing Application?

My current application has a JFrame with about 15 actions stored as fields within the JFrame. Each of the actions is an anonymous class and some of them are pretty long. Is it common to break actions into their own classes possibly within a sub-package called actions? If not, how's this complexity usually tamed? Thanks
