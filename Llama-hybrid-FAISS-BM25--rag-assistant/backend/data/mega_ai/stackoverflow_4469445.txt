Cannot upload images when WordPress is sat on a virtual host configuration

This is my first post to this Forum, please forgive me if this has been answered elsewhere--I did search and was unable to find an answer to my particular problem, so any help would be greatly appreciated. I am working on a WP site for a client who wants to upload images to new posts (who doesn't hey?). In setting up the site I have done the following: 1) Enabled File Upload by CHMOD default dir to 777. 2) Changed max file size. 3) Changed allowed filetypes to include necessary file types. When I try to upload anything I get the following error: “Bobst Expertfold 80 110 (Dec 2010).jpg” has failed to upload due to an error The uploaded file could not be moved to /var/www/vhosts/glossopcartons.com/httpdocs/wp-content/uploads/2010/12. The above error mentions 'glossopcartons.com', this WP site is actually sat on glossopcartons.co.uk. It's obvious that there is some kind of virtual host configuration going on and the image is trying to be uploaded to a folder on a different domain (glossopcartons.com instead of glossopcartons.co.uk). I don't manage the hosting, I have just been assigned with the build. However, I have access to the plesk cpanel but I dont know what I need to do? Does anyone know what is causing this problem? The site has actually been made live and this issue has been spotted after the launch(everything worked fine on the test server), and I am scratching my head trying to figure it out. Is there something I can put in my wp-config.php or .htaccess file to tell WP to upload to a different location. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Dan
