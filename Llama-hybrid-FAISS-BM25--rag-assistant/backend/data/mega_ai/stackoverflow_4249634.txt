I'm not really a Windows mail server expert, but... SMTP is a mail transport agent only. The protocol itself is "just for sending emails." Where are you sending them? If they're going to a remote server, you'll need to get them off of that server however you otherwise would (POP and IMAP are popular standards for getting email). If the local machine is the server on which the mail sits and waits to be retrieved, you'll still need a mail server (again, POP or IMAP generally) to listen for incoming connections to fetch the mails. I wouldn't call SMTP "outdated" as it's still very widely used across the internet. It's the standard mail transport protocol. How have you configured this in the past? Did previous versions of the Windows SMTP service also provide POP/IMAP/etc. support?
