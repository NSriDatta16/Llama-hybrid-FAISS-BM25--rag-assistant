First steps learning to predict financial timeseries using machine learning

I am trying to get a grasp on how to use machine learning to predict financial timeseries 1 or more steps into the future. I have a financial timeseries with some descriptive data and I would like to form a model and then use the model to predict n-steps ahead. What I have been doing so far is: getSymbols("GOOG") GOOG$sma Then I have fitted a randomForest model to this data. fit Which seems to fit surprisingly well: > fit Call: randomForest(formula = GOOG$GOOG.Close ~ GOOG$sma + GOOG$range, data = GOOG) Type of random forest: regression Number of trees: 500 No. of variables tried at each split: 1 Mean of squared residuals: 353.9844 % Var explained: 97.28 And tried to use it to predict: predict(fit, GOOG, n.ahead=2) But this prediction ofc did not work. I try to predict the Close, should I lag the other variables by as many steps as I want the prediction, before fitting the model? Probably a lot of other stuff I should take into account as well but these are really my first steps trying out machine-learning.
