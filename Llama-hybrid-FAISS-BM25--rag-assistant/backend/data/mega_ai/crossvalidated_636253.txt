Gaussian models assume constant residual variance. Since the residual variance is part of the prediction interval, you're adding the same constant term across all months. To fix this, you should use a family in which the variance is a function of the mean, or vary the residual variance term as a function of the predictors. I'll demonstrate how to model the residual variance with a Bayesian model (though I think it is possible to do this with GEEs, I don't know how). library(tidyverse) library(brms) library(tidybayes) d % pivot_longer(names_to = "Month", values_to = "Value", -Year) %>% mutate(Month = factor(Month, levels = month.abb), tm = ym(paste0(Year, Month))) dtrain % filter(Year % add_predicted_draws(fit) %>% mean_qi %>% ggplot(aes(tm, .prediction, ymin = .lower, ymax = .upper)) + geom_line() + geom_ribbon(alpha=0.5) theme(aspect.ratio = 0.61) You can plainly see the prediction interval is narrower in the summer months now. We can plot the predicted residual variance to further demonstrate this. Below, you can see the residual standard deviation in the summer is nearly one quarter of that in the winter months
