What's the simplest way to embed (new) file information in a drag?

I want users to be able to drag elements from my program onto the desktop to create files from them. What's the simplest way to embed this information into a DataObject so explorer will accept drops and create the appropriate file(s)? My experience with drag and drop is limited, and so far the only way I can think of is to actually create the files in a temporary directory and attach their paths to the DataObject via a DataFormat of "FileDrop"... but there must be a better way.
