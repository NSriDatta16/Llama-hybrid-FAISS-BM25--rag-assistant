C#, introduce a DragOver delay

In my application I catch a DragOver event and then perform an action. I'd like to wait for half a second before performing the action, the action should not be performed after that delay if the drag operation has ended. The only way I could think of to implement this feature is something like this: Function DragOver Event If TimerTimeReached Then PerformDragAction Else If Not TimerStarted StartTimer End End Function Function DragLeave Event If TimerStarted StopTimer End End Function Is there a better way to perform this operation?
