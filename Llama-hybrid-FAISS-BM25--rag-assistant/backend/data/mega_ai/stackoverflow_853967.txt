Just curious, what filesystem are you using? NTFS is not a shared storage file system. In other words you can't have more than one node writing to the filesystem at a time. I would suggest virtual directories under the site in IIS. This will probably require a little bit of restructuring the layout of your code, but shouldn't be too major. So, you would have the root home dir of the site with the web.config that is specific to that machine and then a vdir mapped to whatever shared filesystem resource you setup.
