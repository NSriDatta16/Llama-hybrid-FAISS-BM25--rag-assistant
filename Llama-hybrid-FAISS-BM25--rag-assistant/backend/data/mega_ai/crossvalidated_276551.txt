Using a significant loading derived from PCA

I am currently reading a paper about energy efficiency in housing where the authors carried out PCA to explain the characteristics of dwellings with poor energy efficiency. They ended up with three components. Component 1 has a positive significant loading for one characteristic and negative for another; Components 2 and 3 have only positive significant loadings. The authors then get factor scores for each component. I've got my own data so I am trying to understand how that significant loading is used. I thought that I could just multiply the number of dwellings with a certain characteristic by the significant loading they came up with (I was thinking of it as being a "weight" to the population) but I've read a bit more about PCA and I'm sure it can't be simple - can it?
