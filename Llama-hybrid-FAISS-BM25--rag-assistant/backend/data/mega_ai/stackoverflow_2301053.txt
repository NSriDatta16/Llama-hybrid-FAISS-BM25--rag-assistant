How to test UIViewControllers at build time?

I'm a big believer in testing, but not a very good practitioner. I've done pretty well at getting coverage on my model objects and programming them in a TDD style. I'm actually enjoying it so much I'd love to extend this to my controller layer, particularly my UIViewController subclasses. Unfortunately, many UIKit classes don't function in independent tests. However, I'm unhappy with the restriction of only running my dependent tests on the device. It's really important to me to run all unit tests before every build, and it seems to me like its possible and worthwhile to unit test (as opposed to other types of testing) controller code. My question is simply this: How do I test UIViewController s in such a way that the tests run before every build? I am aware of a couple of different solutions to this problem, but don't know a whole lot about the various benefits of each one.
