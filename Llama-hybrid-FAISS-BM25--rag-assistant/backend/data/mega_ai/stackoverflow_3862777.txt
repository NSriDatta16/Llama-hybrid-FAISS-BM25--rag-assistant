The SIP mechanism to let you know that Alice's phone was picked up is an event notification which is documented in RFC 3265 Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)-Specific Event Notification and the specific event package for INVITE relatedd notifications is RFC 4235 An INVITE-Initiated Dialog Event Package for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) . In short SIP events work on a subscribe/notify basis where one SIP user agent can subscribe to a notification server for notifications about events that happen on a different useragent. Unfortunately support for SIP events is not that widepread and even when it is supported can be a bit flakey, Asterisk for example used to generate very strange NOTIFY requests.
