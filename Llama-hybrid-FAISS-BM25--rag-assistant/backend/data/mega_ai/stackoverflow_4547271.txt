XSLT: moving a grouping html elements into section levels

I'm trying to write an XSLT that organizes an HTML file into different section levels depending on the header level. Here is my input: HEADER 1 CONTENT Level 1 para Level 1 para Level 1 para Level 1 para Header 2 CONTENT Level 2 para Level 2 para Level 2 para Level 2 para I'm working with a fairly simple structure at the moment so this pattern will be constant for the time-being. I need an output like this... Header 1 CONTENT Level 1 para Level 1 para Level 1 para Level 1 para Header 2 CONTENT Level 2 para Level 2 para Level 2 para Level 2 para I had been working with this example: Stackoverflow Answer However, I cannot get it to do exactly what I need. I'm using Saxon 9 to run the xslt within Oxygen for dev. I'll be using a cmd/bat file in production. Still Saxon 9. I'd like to handle up to 4 nested section levels if possible. Any help is much appreciated! I need to append onto this as I've encountered another stipulation. I probably should have thought of this before. I'm encountering the following code sample Level 1 para Level 1 para Level 1 para Level 1 para Header 2 CONTENT Level 2 para Level 2 para Level 2 para Level 2 para As you can see, the is a child of while in my first snippet, was always a child of a header level. My desired result is the same as above except that when I encounter as a child of , it should be wrapped in . Level 1 para Level 1 para Level 1 para Level 1 para Header 2 CONTENT Level 2 para Level 2 para Level 2 para Level 2 para
