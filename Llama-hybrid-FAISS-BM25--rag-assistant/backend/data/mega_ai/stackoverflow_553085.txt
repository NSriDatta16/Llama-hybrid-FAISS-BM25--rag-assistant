Explicitly using private can improve readability in certain edge cases. Example: /* Tomorrow when we wake up from bed, first me and Daddy and Mommy, you, eat breakfast eat breakfast like we usually do, and then we're going to play and then soon as Daddy comes, Carl's going to come over, and then we're going to play a little while. And then Carl and Emily are both going down to the car with somebody, and we're going to ride to nursery school [whispered], and then when we get there, we're all going to get out of the car... */ int spam; /* Does this style look at all familiar?
