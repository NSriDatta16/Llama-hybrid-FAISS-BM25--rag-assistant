Mixing Zend and Old Procedural code

We have a really old legacy code base that uses globals like they're going out of fashion - nearly all of the inter-page communication is done via globals and sessions or both. This could be changed as a last resort but ideally I don't want to touch any of it as everything I touch could introduce more bugs :-p. Anyway, We're incorporating a new "module" into the application which was written completely in zend and is really nice and modular. My aim is to get zend running as the backbone and the old legacy code to run as a sort of module/controller within zend and once it has control just execute normally and do whatever it wants. The 2 issues I have: I need to get Zend to see that I'm using legacy URL's (login.php, show.php, etc) and pass execution to a specific controller; I'm embedding an entire application inside a function of another and this breaks the default behavuour of variables appearing in the global scope as globals - i.e. they're now just local variables of this method and thus can't be seen without first specifying that they are globals. If there's another way this could be done I'd be happy to hear it :-p Cheers, Chris
