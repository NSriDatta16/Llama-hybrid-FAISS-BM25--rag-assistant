Construct a SOAP Request to a WebService using Axis2 Library in Java?

I need to be able to construct a SOAP request using Apache Axis2 and provide the IP address and user agent in the SOAP header to the webservice. Is there a code sample that describes how to do that? Thanks in advance for the help! Best wishes Ruchi Kaur.
