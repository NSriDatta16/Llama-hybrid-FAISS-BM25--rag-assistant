i) PCA only looks for orthogonal components because it is computationally easiest. Linear algebra already had convenient computational solutions for finding orthogonal basis vectors (the eigenvalue problem) so PCA copped it. There may very well be "better" basis vectors that are not orthogonal, but limiting the search to only orthogonal vectors severely limits the subspace (and also makes computation easier). For instance, page 9 of A Tutorial on Principal Component Analysis goes into detail on how PCA fails miserably to deduce the "right" basis for the movement of a ferris wheel, as there is no orthogonal basis to describe its motion. ii) Well, the easiest thing we could say about these new solutions is they would not be orthogonal! If your data set is not orthogonal, such as the ferris wheel example, then PCA would not be able to find these solutions.
