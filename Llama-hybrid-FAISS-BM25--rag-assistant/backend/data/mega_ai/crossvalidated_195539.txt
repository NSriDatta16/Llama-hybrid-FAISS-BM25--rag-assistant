deriving shrinkage factors for beta binomial distributions

I am confused by the derivation of shrinkage factors currently online on sites like Wikipedia and ProbWiki. To be on point, I am confused how we get quickly from $\theta_i \sim Beta(\mu,M)$ to $E(\theta)=\mu$. Isn't the expected value of the distribution $Beta(\alpha,\beta)$ just $\frac{\alpha}{\alpha+\beta}$? I am pretty sure it is, but then does the derivation here changed notation along the way? Or it's not correct at all? What is the correct result (and derivation), and what is a good source on that, if these are not? Otherwise the exercise seemed reasonable, but doesn't behave well in simulation. For context, my application is based on estimating group-level means (of a Bernoulli variable), but shrinking towards the population mean, the more the smaller the group. This is an Empirical Bayes exercise, or fitting a hierarchical or multilevel model but caring only about the point estimate, not going fully Bayesian. This somewhat to similar to what is discussed in this blogpost , though not for normally distributed coefficients (as for teacher value added), but recovering the Bernoulli failure rate for each unit.
