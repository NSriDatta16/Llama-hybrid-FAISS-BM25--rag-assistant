This is not practical in Winforms, every Control has a native Windows window associated with it. A window is a very expensive operating system object, create more than 50 of them and your user interface will noticeably start to drag because of the amount of overhead involved in drawing the controls. You very quickly reach that practical upper limit by nesting controls like you are intending to do. You can customize the appearance of a TreeView by using its DrawMode property and the DrawNode event. The MSDN library article for TreeView.DrawNode has a decent example. It is also a popular component type in 3rd party component vendor collections. They add lots of bells and whistles to their version.
