Parse XML structure in .net 2

I have the following xml fragment I am trying to retrieve the value of the number in the "buy" attribute for the converter that has c1="XXX" and c2="ZZZ". I can't use linq to XML unfortunatley or this would be easy (for me). So I guess I am stuck using xpath I've created an XPathNavigator but can't get the syntax to get the valu I want Anyone, any idea how to do this?
