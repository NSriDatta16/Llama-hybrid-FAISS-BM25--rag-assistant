what's the GUI framework visual studio is using by default?

as far as i know, visual studio is a GUI code generator among other things, you drag a button and put it on the window, a code is written for you behind the scene. my Question is: what's the GUI framework Visual studio is using by default??? i know it integrates with some GUI toolkits as Fox, GTK and QT .
