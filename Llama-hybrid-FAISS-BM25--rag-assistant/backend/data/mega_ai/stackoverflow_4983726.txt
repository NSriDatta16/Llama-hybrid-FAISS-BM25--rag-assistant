As for telling java where to find ConferenceHandler (and I apologize for sounding stupid - homework questions are asked by newbs) I am using Blue Jay, and all I have to do is click on the main, and the program runs. I have no idea how to do this from command line. The place to look is in the documentation for the java command; e.g. here . Pay particular attention to the stuff that talks about the classpath and the different ways of setting it. Also read this page . I realized that it was a problem with classpath, and no matter what I did, I couldn't fix it. So I took all of the original classes, and pasted them all into a new folder, and it worked like a charm. That's a Voodoo solution. You really need to understand the problem. To that end, lets revisit some comments above: The stacktrace indicates otherwise. They're packageless (in other words, in the default package, if BlueJ is telling that you literally somehow). â€“ @BalusC I wish I knew what that meant..... - @unit What @BalusC means is that the stack trace tells you the full name of the class that it was trying to load. ... Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: ConferenceHandler ... And the full name (in this case) is ConsoleHandler ... not some.pkg.ConsoleHandler . What is not entirely clear is why this is occurring, but I suspect that you were actually running old .class files that didn't match the source code you were looking at. And your Voodoo solution could well have "fixed" this by replacing the old .class files with new stuff. But if that's the case, you need to understand what is wrong with the way you are building / deploying. Otherwise, you'll trip over this kind of thing over and over again.
