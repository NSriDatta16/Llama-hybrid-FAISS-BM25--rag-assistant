Why is the speed of fully connected neural network very fast no matter how large the prediction dataset is?

I used tensorflow(GPU and CPU) to train a 5-layers fully connected DNN with few parameters (Less than 300 parameters). And then I use it to predict two datasets with data sizes of 1000 and 1 million, respectively. I found that not only the dataset with size of 1000 completed the prediction in 0.05 seconds, but also the dataset with size of 1 million completed the prediction in 0.05 seconds. Why? Why can DNN predict such a huge dataset quickly? Why does the size of the data set affect the speed of DNN so little ?
