Convolutional Neural Networks regularization

I'm working on CNN and I have a question about regularization. Max-norm constraints (a form of gradient clipping) apply a rescale of the weight vector that satisfies $|W|_2 PS: Reference that says they are different. G. Hinton, N. Srivastava, A. Krizhevsky, I. Sutskever, R. Salakhutdinov. 2012. Improving neural networks by preventing co-adaptation of feature detectors. We use the standard, stochastic gradient descent procedure for training the dropout neural networks on mini-batches of training cases, but we modify the penalty term that is normally used to prevent the weights from growing too large. Instead of penalizing the squared length (L2 norm) of the whole weight vector, we set an upper bound on the L2 norm of the incoming weight vector for each individual hidden unit. If a weight-update violates this constraint, we renormalize the weights of the hidden unit by division. Using a constraint rather than a penalty prevents weights from growing very large no matter how large the proposed weight-update is. This makes it possible to start with a very large learning rate which decays during learning, thus allowing a far more thorough search of the weight-space than methods that start with small weights and use a small learning rate.
