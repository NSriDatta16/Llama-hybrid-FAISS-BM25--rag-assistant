How to setup data properly for regression analysis to calculate price elasticity?

I am working on a project to try understand Linear Regression a bit deeper (they say experimenting is key and getting lost is part of the process) :( In this project, let's assume I have a watch shop. I want to calculate price elasticity of demand for my watches but how do I setup the data as in my mind there are two options: I have 100 watch styles and each have their own prices and quantity sold for a period of time, so the first setup looks like: Watch Styles Price Quantity Style 1 900 10 Style 2 1500 20 Style 3 1000 30 ... ... ... Style 100 2000 50 Alternatively, I can set my data as a transactional time series (monthly for 2 years worth of data). Now the 'price' variable will be the average unit price of watches sold per month and 'quantity' will be the aggregated monthly figure. Month Avg Price per Month Quantity April 2019 1225 110 May 2019 1135 150 June 2019 1575 75 ... ... ... April 2021 2050 15 Which data setup is appropriate to run the regression analysis and why? $$ ln(Quantity) = c + \beta\ ln(Price) + Error $$ After reading some marketing research papers, it looks like the setup using (2) is favored for elasticity calculation. So how do we interpret the regression results if we use (1) instead?
