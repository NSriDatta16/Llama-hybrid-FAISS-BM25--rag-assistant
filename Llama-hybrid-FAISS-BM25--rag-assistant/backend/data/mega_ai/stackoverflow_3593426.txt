It would be great if Xcode could keep itself and the file system in sync. Unfortunately it doesn't. One reason for wanting it to is so the hierarchy in your SCCS matches the one in Xcode. I fall back to keeping things organized in Xcode, and leaving the file system separated into not much more than "Classes" and "Resources".
