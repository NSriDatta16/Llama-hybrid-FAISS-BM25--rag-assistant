Effects of Clustered Index on DB Performance

I recently became involved with a new software project which uses SQL Server 2000 for its data storage. In reviewing the project, I discovered that one of the main tables uses a clustered index on its primary key which consists of four columns: Sequence numeric(18, 0) Date datetime Client varchar(9) Hash tinyint This table experiences a lot of inserts in the course of normal operation. Now, I'm a C++ developer, not a DB Admin, but my first impression of this table design was that that having these fields as a clustered index would be very detrimental to insert performance, since the data would have to be physically reordered on each insert. In addition, I can't really see any benefit to this since one would have to be querying all of these fields frequently to justify the clustered index, right? So basically I need some ammunition for when I go to the powers that be to convince them that the table design should be changed.
