If the project builds then you haven't deleted them, you've probably dragged them into another group[ by mistake :) Open all the other groups and you might see the Classes folder as a subfolder. Just drag it back out again. NB Go to Build->'Clean all Targets' and then build it again. If it builds without errors then my answer is probably right. If it doesn't build then I'm absolutely wrong :)
