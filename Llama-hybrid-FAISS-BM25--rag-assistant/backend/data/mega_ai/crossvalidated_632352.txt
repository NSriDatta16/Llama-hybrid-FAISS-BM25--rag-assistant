I do not know if this can help after so many years. Maybe it can be useful for the record, and in case someone will come across this thread in the future. I wanted to just point out an old scholarly contribution in which a weighted average of Cramer's V (sometimes called Cramer's phi) was proposed for stratified tables. The paper is: Sakoda, J. M. (1977). Measures of association for multivariate contingency tables. In Social Statistics Section Proceedings for the American Statistical Association (777â€“780). ( LINK ) Hope this helps
