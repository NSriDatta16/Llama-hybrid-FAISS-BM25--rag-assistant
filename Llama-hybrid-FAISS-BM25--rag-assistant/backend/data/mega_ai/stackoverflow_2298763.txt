how to calculate a negative acceleration?

I'm implementing the scrolling behaviour of a touch screen UI but I'm too tired in the moment to wrap my mind around some supposedly trivial piece of math: y (distance/velocity) |******** | ****** | **** | *** | *** | ** | ** | * | * -------------------------------- x (time) f(x)->? The UI is supposed to allow the user to drag and "throw" a view in any direction and to keep it scrolling for a while even after he releases the finger from the screen. It's sort of having a momentum that depends on how fast the user was dragging before he took off the finger. So I have a starting velocity (v0) and every 20ms I scroll by a amount relative to the current velocity. With every scrolling iteration I lower the velocity a bit until it falls below a threshold when I stop it. It just doesn't look right when I decrement it by a fixed amount (linear), so I need to model a negative acceleration but fail to come up with a decent simple formula how to calculate the amount by which I have to lower the velocity in every iteration. Update: Thank you for your responses so far but I still didn't manage to derive a satisfying function from the feedback yet. I probably didn't describe the desired solution good enough, so I'll try to give a real world example that should illustrate what kind of calculation I would like to do: Assume there is a certain car driving on a certain street and the driver hits the brakes to a max until the car comes to a halt. The driver does this with the same car on the same street multiple times but begins to brake at varying velocities. While the car is slowing down I want to be able to calculate the velocity it will have exactly one second later solely based on it's current velocity. For this calculation it should not matter at which speed the car was driving when the driver began to break since all environmential factors remain the same. Of course there will be some constants in the formula but when the car is down to i.e. 30 m/s it will go the same distance in the next second, regardless whether it was driving 100 or 50 m/s when the driver began to break. So the time since hitting the breaks would also not be a parameter of the function. The deceleration at a certain velocity would always be the same. How do you calculate the velocity one second later in such a situation assuming some arbitrary constants for deceleration, mass, friction or whatever and ignoring complicating influences like air resistance? I'm only after the kinetic energy and the it's dissipation due to the friction from breaking the car. Update 2 I see now that the acceleration of the car would be liniear and this is actually not what I was looking for. I'll clean this up and try out the new suggestions tomorrow. Thank you for your input so far.
