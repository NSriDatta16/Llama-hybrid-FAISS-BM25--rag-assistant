If you reject the $H_0$ so there significantly enough evidence to say that the time series has not a unit root.. If you cannot reject the $H_0$, you did not proof anything.. Therefore $H_0$= unit root Moreover, if your times series contain unit root, you have to change your inference for many statistical procedures. Hope this helps you
