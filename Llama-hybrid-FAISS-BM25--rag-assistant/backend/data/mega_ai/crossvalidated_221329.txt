What is an acceptable R squared range for cross sectional data linear regressions?

May I know an acceptable R squared range for a cross sectional data analysis using linear regression? I think the requirement for this is lower than time series or panel data but would like to know even a rough idea on this. For my straightforward question, is r squared of 0.16 or 0.17 acceptable under this condition?
