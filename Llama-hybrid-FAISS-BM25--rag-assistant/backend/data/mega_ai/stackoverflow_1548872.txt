IE6 - text is hidden with no reason?

For a veeery long time I've had this problem but always I managed to avoid it somehow (by removing elements or changing order) and now here it is again and I have no idea how to get rid of it. First, it appeared in my admin panel, but only few users acces that so it's not big problem (nobody uses IE6), but now this problem is appearing on my index page of portal and I must get rid of it because 15% of portal visitors are IE6 visitors. Here's LINK to test version of portal: If you open this page in IE6 you can see that second news (titled: Test one) doesn't have any text, only image. Well, if you make mouseover on that image you will see that there is some text. This problem occurs only when I enter paragraf whose height isn't bigger that image's height. If I enter same image but with some more text this show/hide problem disappears. I hope someone knows why is this happening because this problem has been torturing me for few years but I never figured out what is the main cause of this problem and how to avoid it. Any help is welcome! Ile EDIT: Here is solution for this problem: http://www.positioniseverything.net/explorer/peekaboo.html
