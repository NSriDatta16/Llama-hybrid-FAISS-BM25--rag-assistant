A) Simply += with thumbContainer.innerHTML Never do this. This has to serialise all the content to HTML, add a string to it, and parse it all back in. It's slow (doing it in a loop is particularly bad news) and it'll lose all JavaScript references, event handlers and so on. IE's insertAdjacentHTML will do this more efficiently. It's also part of HTML5, but not widely implemented elsewhere yet. using appendChild? Yes, that's fine. If you've got a lot of thumbs it will start to get slow (but not as bad as reparsing innerHTML each time). Making a DocumentFragment to insert multiple elements into the container child node list at once can help in some cases. Combining DocumentFragment with Range can do more still, but gets harder to write compatibly since IE's Range implementation is so StRange. Either way, since you don't seem to be doing anything with the individual shell nodes, why not simply join all the thumbernail HTML strings together before parsing? for (var child in shell.childNodes) { Don't use for..in on sequence types, it won't do what you think. It's only meant for use against Object used as a mapping. The correct way to iterate over an Array or NodeList is plain old for (var i= 0; i .
