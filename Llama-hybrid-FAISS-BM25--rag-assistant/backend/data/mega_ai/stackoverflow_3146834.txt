I don't really understand what you're asking for here, but I'll give it a shot. Firstly, remember that jQuery is just a series of functions written in Javascript. The this keyword is literally the same in "both" contexts. Perhaps you want to get the actual DOM element instead of the jQuery object? You can use .get() : // let's say there's a single paragraph element var obj = $('p'); // obj is a jQuery object var dom = obj.get(0); // dom is a DOM element
