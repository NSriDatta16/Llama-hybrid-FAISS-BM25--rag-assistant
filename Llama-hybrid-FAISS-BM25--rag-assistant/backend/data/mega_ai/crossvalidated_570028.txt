PCoA plots in R on presence/absence community data: rows filled with zeros give an error

I am currently making PCoA plots on Presence/Absence community data. My rows are populated with samples and my column headings are different taxa that were detected. However, since the experiment is a degradation experiment, some of the samples have rows filled with zeros (absences). The only way the distance matrix calculation will work is if I remove these zero-filled rows. However, since these rows are biologically meaningful (it means nothing was present after decay) and not just missing data, I was wondering if there was a way to keep them and avoid the "NaN" error I would get otherwise. I am using the package 'vegan' and the function 'vegdist' to calculate my distance matrix. Here is an example of the code: distance_matrix Thanks in advance for your help and/or suggestions!
