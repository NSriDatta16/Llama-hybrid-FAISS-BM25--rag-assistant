I am doing similar project as yours recently. The object need to be classified is small and I am using Fine-Tuning which can helps from overfitting because I have small dataset size(1500+). However, when I input the whole image into the network, it just doesnt work. The explanation for this could be: CNN is a process of downsampling. When your Region of Interest(ROI) is small, it has a high chance that you will lose the information of ROI at the end of the CNN layers. What I could suggest is you better crop the training data on the area you are interested. It can help CNN to know where to learn. When you testing, you could crop the test data before feeding it into a CNN. In this way, you will have a better chance to know how many cells are in the whole image. I did same thing in my project. I am able to achieve $90\%$ on cropped data and $80\%$ on whole image. If you already figure out a better or an efficient way, please share it with me if possible.
