A very common solution for this problem is to use setTimeout function. The way you do it is that you separate the process into smaller pieces a then execute those pieces one after another using the setTimeout function. I think this http://www.julienlecomte.net/blog/2007/10/28/ should help you. There is also another option introduced by HTML5 WebWorkers. This new standard should allow you to execute long running tasks in a separate thread and then report any results in a callback. You can read about it here robertnyman.com/2010/03/25/using-html5-web-workers-to-have-background-computational-power/ Unfortunatelly, it is not supported by IE according to html5demos.com/
