The discriminant function in linear discriminant analysis

This is the bayesian probability for class 'k'(sigma is same for all k classes), assigning the observation to class with maximum pk(x) with Ï€k as the probability of response variable belonging to the kth class This is a statement from the book Introduction to Statistical learning Taking the log of the bayesian above equation and rearranging the terms, it can be shown that this is equivalent to assigning the observation to the class for which the below equation is largest. There is the summation term which remains , how we do we go about eliminating it?
