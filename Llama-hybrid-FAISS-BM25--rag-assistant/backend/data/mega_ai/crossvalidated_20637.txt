In addition to the other text there are two books introductory books in Springer's Use R! series that cover time series: Introductory Time Series with R and Applied Econometrics in R There is also an advanced econometrics text in the series, Analysis of Integrated and Co-integrated Time Series with R . I have not used these but have found several others in the series to be excellent.
