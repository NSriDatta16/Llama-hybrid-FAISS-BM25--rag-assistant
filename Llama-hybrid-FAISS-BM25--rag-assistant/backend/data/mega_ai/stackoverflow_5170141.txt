TFS Build Agent Issue

We've just set up our first Build Agent with TFS to run unit tests on a separate server from our main build. This will be great but we have an error that doesn't seem to have a good answer: DLL has already loaded from a different location. It cannot be loaded from a new location within the same appdomain. The DLL is of course a specific library within out project. Anyone have experience with this issue? Thanks!
