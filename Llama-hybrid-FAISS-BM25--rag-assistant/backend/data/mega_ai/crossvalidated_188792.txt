This is a great question and a common one as well. The property you seem to be interested in is ergodicity . If a stochastic process you're interested in is ergodic, then (roughly) these "different day" observations that you see can be combined to assess how successful the weather predictions are; can be combined to derive some convergence results. If the process does not exhibit ergodicity, however, then—as you stated—one would need to observe the same day several times and see if this probability of rain is accurate or not. Ergodicity is difficult to verify with real data and is typically taken as an assumption. For a rigorous, but empirical treatment of ergodicity, check out this chapter of E. Zivot's time series book. For a very nice intuitive example, watch this video from 16:55.
