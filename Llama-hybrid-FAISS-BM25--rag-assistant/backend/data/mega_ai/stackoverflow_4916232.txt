iPhone app autorotates on one device, but not another

Does anyone know of a reason why an iPhone would autorotate on one device, but not another? I can't reproduce it on my iPhone, iPod Touch, or any of the simulator devices. Are there any device settings I should be paying attention to? The offending iPhone has the same SDK version installed (4.2.1), but is a different model (MC319LL) than mine (MC605DN).
