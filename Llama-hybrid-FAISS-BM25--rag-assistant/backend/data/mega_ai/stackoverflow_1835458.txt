Text read and replace algorithm

Looking at this: MENU_ITEM_BACK#0="Back"; MENU_ITEM_BLOCK_CHANNEL#0="Block"; MENU_ITEM_CLOSE#0="Close"; MENU_ITEM_DETAILS#0="Details"; MENU_ITEM_DIAGNOSE#0="Diagnose"; MENU_ITEM_DOWNLOAD#0="Download"; ...and so on (over 500 lines). What would be the best way to automate copying the label name into the label itself. For example, MENU_ITEM_BACK#0="Back"; would become MENU_ITEM_BACK#0="MENU_ITEM_BACK"; I am most familiar with Java but have no objections to any other programming languages, although I am not very familiar with regular expressions (coded ones at least). EDIT: It have come to my attention that the '#0=' are not always constant. Sometimes they can be replaced by a very arbitrary number such as '#6548135='. The answers given were good but since I am not familiar with regular expressions, how would you accommodate this? Note that I do not want to copy the number, just the label.
