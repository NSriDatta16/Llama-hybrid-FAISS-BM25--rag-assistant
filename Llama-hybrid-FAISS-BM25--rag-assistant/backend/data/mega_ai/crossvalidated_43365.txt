Tutorials for feature engineering

As is known to all, feature engineering is extremely important to machine learning, however I found few materials associated with this area. I participated to several competitions in Kaggle and believe that good features may even be more important than a good classifier in some cases. Does anyone know any tutorials about feature engineering, or is this pure experience?
