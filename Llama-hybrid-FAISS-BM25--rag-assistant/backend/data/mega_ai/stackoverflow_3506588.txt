I certainly understand your reason for needing a 3d bar plot; i suspect that's why they were created. The libraries ('toolkits') in Matplotlib required to create 3D plots are not third-party libraries, etc., rather they are included in the base Matplotlib installation . (This is true for the current stable version, which is 1.0, though i don't believe it was for 0.98, so the change--from 'add-on' to part of the base install--occurred within the past year, i believe) So here you are: from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D import matplotlib.pyplot as PLT import numpy as NP fig = PLT.figure() ax1 = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d') xpos = NP.random.randint(1, 10, 10) ypos = NP.random.randint(1, 10, 10) num_elements = 10 zpos = NP.zeros(num_elements) dx = NP.ones(10) dy = NP.ones(10) dz = NP.random.randint(1, 5, 10) ax1.bar3d(xpos, ypos, zpos, dx, dy, dz, color='#8E4585') PLT.show() To create 3d bars in Maplotlib, you just need to do three (additional) things: import Axes3D from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d call the bar3d method (in my scriptlet, it's called by ax1 an instance of the Axes class). The method signature: bar3d(x, y, z, dy, dz, color='b', zsort="average", *args, **kwargs) pass in an additional argument to add_subplot, projection='3d'
