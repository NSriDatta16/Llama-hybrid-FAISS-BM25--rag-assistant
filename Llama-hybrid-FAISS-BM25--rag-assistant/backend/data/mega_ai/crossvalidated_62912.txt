The inverse gamma distribution is a right-skew, continuous distribution on the positive half of the real line. It is the distribution of the inverse (reciprocal) of a random variable which is gamma distributed. Explicitly, the density function takes the form: $$p(x;\alpha,\beta) = \frac{\beta^\alpha}{\Gamma(\alpha)} x^{\alpha-1} \exp \left( -\frac{\beta}{x}\right)$$ It is often used as a prior distribution used in Bayesian statistics. For example, it is a conjugate prior for the variance parameter of a normal distribution. Reference: Wikipedia on Inverse Gamma
