See my answer to a similar question here . Long story short, do a fast Fourier transform of the data, discard redundant frequencies if your input data was real valued, separate the real and imaginary parts for each element of the fast Fourier transform, and use the Mclust package in R to do model-based clustering on the real and imaginary parts of each element of each time series. The package automates optimization over number of clusters and their densities.
