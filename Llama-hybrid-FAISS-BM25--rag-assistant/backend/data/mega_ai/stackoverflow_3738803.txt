I recommend using a Comet framework like Atmosphere . It will automatically choose a transport mechanism for your messages, which can be websockets if you're lucky (but as this is abstracted away, you do not have to worry). Anyway it is great value if you do not have to deal with individual requests / responses and all the error sources and browser bugs that you will encounter. I've been there. There be dragons. :-)
