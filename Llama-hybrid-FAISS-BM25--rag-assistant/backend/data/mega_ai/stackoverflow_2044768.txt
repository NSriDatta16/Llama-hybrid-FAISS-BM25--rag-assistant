Simple Automatic Backup Solution for Magento?

I've recently started work on developing a site using Magento. All of my files and DB are on a linux-based remote web hosting server. What I'd like to implement is some sort of system where all of my files and the database are backed up once per day "just in case". I'd also like to be able to use the same system to manually back everything up before making any major changes. I've explored using a solution like Git or SVN in conjunction with CRON MySQL dumps; but they seem to be overkill for my needs. Any ideas? Thanks in advance for taking the time to read this and reply.
