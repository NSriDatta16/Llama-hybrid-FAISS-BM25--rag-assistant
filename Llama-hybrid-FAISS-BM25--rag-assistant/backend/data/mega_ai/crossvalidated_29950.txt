As pointed out in the comments and as discussed here , it is extremely difficult to think of practical examples where the LLN fails to hold for the probability of an event. I think this illustrates the strength of Kolmogorov's result. It is also important to point out that it pacified the debate between Bayesian and frequentists. It means that you do not need to worry about the question "what is a probability?", but only about "can I measure it?". Still, there is one obvious case when it is impossible to get IID sampling of an event: when it happens only once . In that case the LLN does not apply and we are back to good old debate on what is a probability. But I think this is also outside the scope of this forum so I'll just cite some references from the top of my head. Henri Poincaré in Science et Méthodes (1914) emphasized the deteministic nature of randomness. Chance is an effect of the imprecision of our measure instruments. Paul Lévy in Calcul des probabilités (1925) advocates that probabilities of single events are meaningful only if they are close to 0 and 1. Bruno de Finetti proposed to define probability as a coherent weighing scheme of prior beliefs. More recently, Peter Walley in Statistical reasoning with imprecise probabilities tried to extend de Finetti's definition to make probability a representation of human knowledge. This list is obviously very biased and incomplete to say the least.
