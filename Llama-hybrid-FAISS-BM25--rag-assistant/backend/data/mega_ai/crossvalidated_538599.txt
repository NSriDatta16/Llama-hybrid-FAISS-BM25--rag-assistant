What is the word for top performing model?

I'm blanking on the basic ML vocabulary term for the best performing model in the literature. "Industry best" works, but there's a specific term that's used everywhere that I can't find at the moment or recall. The winner of imagenet would be called this. BERT would be called this when it first came out.
