This is an easier problem if you break it into smaller steps. Instead of putting all your code into one main method, I'd recommend breaking them into several smaller classes. Focus on one, get it working, then move onto the next thing. Your first problem is data retrieval. Java's an object-oriented language: start with an Employee class. package model; public class Employee { private String id; private String name; private String phone; private String address; private String email; private Date birthday; private Gender gender; // Constructors, getters/setters, equals, hashCode, toString and behavior follow. } Once you have that written and tested, write a data access object to deal with the database: package persistence; public interface EmployeeDao { List find(); Employee find(String id); List Write an implementation for this and get it tested. Only worry about the JTable when you've got these working. Your problems will be isolated to the UI at that point, because you've got the persistence sorted out.
