I would try classifying using tree based models( Random Forest short explanation ) since they are less sensitive to outliers than linear models. Addressing the different data-sources can be done by a creation of a categorical feature that describes data source. Use this feature and train a tree, analyze if the the tree use this feature in its first steps(In Sklearn its quiet simple). If it is high, look at the sub-trees after each split, if the features used in each sub-tree are different than you should consider training a different model per each data-source. Hope this helps
