As natch3z has mentioned, if you don't have a programming background it might be worthwhile starting a little simpler than the oracle tech stack. By Oracle tech stack, I am assuming using things like oc4j, ADF, oracle DB etc all within Oracle's JDeveloper IDE. Even though technologies like this can be powerful and achieve what you want, it might be a little overwhelming for a beginner. It might be a little more advantageous to start off with something like the Eclipse IDE and work you way through some simple tutorials. There's nothing worse than starting with something difficult and getting discouraged due to being overwhelmed.
