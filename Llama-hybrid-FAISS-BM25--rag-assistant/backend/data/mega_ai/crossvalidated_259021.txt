Measuring connectivity between clusters in an organizational network in R

I'm trying to conceptualize a network analysis problem and figure out where to start in terms of analysis techniques in R. Apologies as I'm fairly new to all this. Basically, I have a employee network for an organization which spans multiple geographies. I want to define metrics to calculate how well the nodes in a specific geography are connected to the nodes in geographies other than its own. Also, I am looking for any libraries/ functions that already exist in R to perform such calculations. I understand there is a wealth of network analysis techniques out there, but I'm at a loss where to start really.
