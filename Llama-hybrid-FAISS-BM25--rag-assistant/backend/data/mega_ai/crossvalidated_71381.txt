Estimating parameters in multivariate classification resulting zero determinant sample covariance matrix

Newbie here typesetting my question, so excuse me if this don't work. I am trying to give a bayesian classifier for a multivariate classification problem where input is assumed to have multivariate normal distribution . I choose to use a discriminant function defined as $\log (likelihood \times prior)$. However, from the distribution, $f(x \mid\mu,\Sigma) = (2\pi)^{-N \times d/2}\det(\Sigma)^{-N/2}exp[(-1/2)(x-\mu)^{\top}\Sigma^{-1}(x-\mu)]$ i encounter a term $-\log(det(S_i))$, where $S_i$ is my sample covariance matrix for a specific class i. Since my input actually represents a square image data, my $S_i$ discovers quite some correlation and resulting in $det(S_i)$ being zero. Then my discriminant function all turn $\infty$, which is disastrous for me. I know there must be a lot of things go wrong here, anyone willling to help me out?
