Jquery: possible to change the text selection color in a textarea with jquery? css doesn't work :(

textarea::selection { background:#0099ff;} That's how you specify a text selection color for chrome in CSS, i know it's different for different browsers but I wanted to know if there's a way to change the selection color inside of a textarea, because the code above wont work for chrome, now, in the code above if i changed textarea to p then it would work on all the paragraphs. I noticed that the code above does work if I select the ENTIRE textarea, but not when selecting text in it.
