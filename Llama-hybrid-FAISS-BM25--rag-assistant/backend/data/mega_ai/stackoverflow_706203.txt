Why the registry? The appropriate place to store these kind of serialised objects is usually in the users' Application Data folder or Isolated Storage . Though of course the method of serialisation is up to you. XML, binary etc, it's essentially a file on disk. You could consider things like "Local Database" or SQL Server Express, depending on your data and concurrency needs. Some applications do store a Most Recently Used (MRU) list in the registry, but that's just by iterating all the values of a given key. I don't recommend that approach.
