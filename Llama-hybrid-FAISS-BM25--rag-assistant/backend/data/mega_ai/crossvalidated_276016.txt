Including a predictor that cannot be assessed in preverbal/non-verbal children

I'm building a prediction model (logistic regression, using R) with data obtained in children younger than 18 years. Twenty-five percent are less than 2 years old. One of my candidate predictors requires that a child have sufficient verbal skills to report a particular symptom. By design, all children less than 2 were considered 'Pre-verbal/Non-verbal'. Some older children were also felt to be 'Pre-verbal/Non-verbal', e.g. 64% of two-year-olds and 32% of three-year-olds. Currently the candidate predictor variable is coded as a factor with 6 levels (no, mild, moderate, severe, unknown severity, pre-verbal/Non-verbal). I created a second binary variable 'verbal' where 1=verbal and 0=nonverbal. How should I best include this symptom as a predictor in my model? It does not seem quite right to include the 'pre-verbal/Non-verbal' category in my symptom variable.
