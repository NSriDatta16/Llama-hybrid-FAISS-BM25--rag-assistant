What is a dimension? To put it simply, if you have a tabular data set with m rows and n columns, then the dimensionality of your data is n: What is a manifold? The simplest example is our planet Earth. For us it looks flat, but it really is a sphere. So it's sort of a 2d manifold embedded in the 3d space. What is the difference? To answer this question, consider another example of a manifold: This is so-called "swiss roll". The data points are in 3d, but they all lie on 2d manifold, so the dimensionality of the manifold is 2, while the dimensionality of the input space is 3. There are many techniques to "unwrap" these manifolds. One of them is called Locally Linear Embedding , and this is how it would do that: Here's a scikit-learn snippet for doing that: from sklearn.manifold import LocallyLinearEmbedding lle = LocallyLinearEmbedding(n_neighbors=k, n_components=2) X_lle = lle.fit_transform(data) plt.scatter(X_lle[:, 0], X_lle[:, 1], c=color) plt.show()
