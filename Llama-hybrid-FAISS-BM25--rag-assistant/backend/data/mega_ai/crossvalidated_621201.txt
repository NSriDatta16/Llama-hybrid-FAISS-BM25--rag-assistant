Problem for a math formula in Weight Uncertainty in Neural Network

I am studying the paper "Weight Uncertainty in Neural Networks" by Blundell et al (2015, on arXiv), and there is a formula I don't get page 4, namely formula (3) in step 5: I don't understand how they obtain formula (3). Moreover, it looks like with chainrule, I have $\partial f(w,\theta)/\partial\mu = \partial f(w,\theta)/\partial w$ . Could someone explain to me ? I am not very good with differentiation.
