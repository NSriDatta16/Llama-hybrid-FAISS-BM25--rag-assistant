Can you get a map of the heap? Most likely it's fragmented so those 100M of objects are spread out across the entire memory space. The memory needed is both a function of allocated objects and how fast they're being allocated and then de-referenced. That error means the memory area is too small for the work load, the garbage collector is consuming a lot CPU managing it, and it went beyond the allowed threshold.
