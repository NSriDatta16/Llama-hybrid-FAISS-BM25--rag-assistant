I think in this case you are thinking too big. Agile is about breaking things down into more managable pieces and then working against that. The whole idea of Agile (XP in particular) is that you do your testing first so that you cut the number of bugs out and because plane software needs to have a very high code coverage for its testing it fits in quite neatly I think. You aren't going to 'refactor' the mechanics of the plane but you will tweak them if they are unsafe and thats the whole iterative approach for you. I have heard of Air Traffic Control software written with Agile Methodologies pushing it forward.
