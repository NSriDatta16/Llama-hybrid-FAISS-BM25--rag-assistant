The correct answer is: it depends. There are a lot of stakeholders in the browser arena and some ( cough Microsoft cough ) have a history of hostility towards public standards. While many tout the video tag as a reason to use HTML5 it should be pointed out that MS don't support it all and Apple and Nokia are being tricky about format support (Apple own Quicktime, Nokia is an MP4-AVC patent holder). Other features like the storage proposal are based on the idea that users and vendors won't simply disable these features out of security concerns (like cookies are often blocked now). The essential problem with HTML5 is that conformance by browser vendors is optional. It can dictate anything it wants but it can't make browser vendors comply. This provides vendors the opportunity to hold the spec to ransom, or ignore it, or "embrace and extend" it as their interests dictate. From what I've seen on the WHATWG list most of HTMLs success will be in areas where there is little or no ability to profit from non-conformance. This basically means things like caption and dialog tags, custom attributes and other things that the majority of web developers will never use, understand, or care about. I basically see it going the path of Open GL 3.0. Being mangled by corporate agendas until it's a shadow of its anticipated glory. It'll come too late to be of much value and there will be a hundred different implementations of HTML5 based on browser vendor and version so that designers 10 years from now will still be writing to HTML4 just to have some consistency in their pages. Pretty much everything depends on Microsoft, since anything not supported by IE will see sporadic and lacklustre adoption. Given Microsoft's history in this area, combined with their apparent absence from the WHATWG discussions, their aggressive promotion of Silverlight and Windows Presentation Framework, their substandard HTML rendering/creation in Office (see the Outlook 2007 controversy) and their slow adoption of CSS3.0 and HTML5 features it's hard to have much confidence they'll play ball.
