I haven't seen the compiler get slower over time, but it's been a long time since we used Delphi 6. It seems to be generally agreed upon in the Delphi community that, if you don't want to upgrade to the latest and greatest (Delphi 2007 or 2009), then Delphi 7 is the best/fastest/most stable. You might consider upgrading. KibitzGetOverloads sounds like something from the kibitz compiler -- the "background" compiler that gives you code-completion, background error highlighting, code tooltips, etc. Sounds like you'd be better off checking the call stack of the command-line compiler, not the IDE; you'd get something more helpful. I have never found compiles to be faster after deleting the DCUs. DCUs are there to make the build incremental, therefore faster. If you're seeing faster compiles after deleting all DCUs, check your hardware. Have you defragged your hard disk lately? How much free space do you have on the drive?
