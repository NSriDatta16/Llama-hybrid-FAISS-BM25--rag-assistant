If you mean you have visits at 6w and 6mt, then you may be able to determine at what exact day the patients stopped taking their medication, meaning the best way would be survival analysis, with inadherance as "failure" event. Besides showing the Kaplan-Meier curves, you could use a Cox regression model to evaluate the effect of other variables on your outcome. If you have time-varying covariates, like employment, you can model these as such. If, on the other hand, you only have the 2 timepoints at 6w and 6mt, you could go for a logistic regression model at each of these points, with inadherance as your outcome variable and your measured "risk factors" as explaining variables.
