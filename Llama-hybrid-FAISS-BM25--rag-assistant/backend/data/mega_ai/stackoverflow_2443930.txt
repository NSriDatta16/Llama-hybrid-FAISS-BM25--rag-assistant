The control you probably want is System.Windows.Forms.FlowLayoutPanel (see FlowLayoutPanel@msdn ) It is available from .NET v2 and greater. flowLayoutPanel1.FlowDirection = FlowDirection.TopDown; .... // for each result... flowLayoutPanel1.Controls.Add(newGrid); I have used it before to achieve a similar effect. I have not however tried to re-size the items within it, they were fixed in height (re-sized width-wise to fit the parent). You should be able to create each XtraGridControl instance with the required data and add it to the controls as above. PK :-)
