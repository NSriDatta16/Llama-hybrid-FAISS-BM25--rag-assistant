AWS GPU instances are an option, if you want to do CUDA development. If you don't want to leverage the cloud, you can look into the Nvidia Jetson TK1 development kits. They are about 200 dollars (in July 2015), have 192 CUDA cores, a quad-core ARM processor, and 2GB of RAM. Conversely, the same amount of money could buy you a 640 CUDA core GeForce GTX 750 Ti, or maybe a 1024 CUDA core GTX 960. A GT 720 with 1GB RAM and 192 cores could be had for 45 dollars (in July 2015). You don't have to use NVidia GPUs with deep learning. GPUs will increase the speed dramatically, though. There is very little support for non-NVidia GPUs with common deep learning toolkits.
