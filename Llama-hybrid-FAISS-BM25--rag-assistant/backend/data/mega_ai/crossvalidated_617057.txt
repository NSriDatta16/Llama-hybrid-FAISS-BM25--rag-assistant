While I am with Tim that there is more to the story than statistical significance, the source of your complex $z$ -stat is that you have miscalculated $\hat p$ as $1.45$ . As $\hat p$ is a proportion, $\hat p$ cannot exceed $1$ . Your $n$ is the total number of classification attempts, which cannot be lower than the total number of correct classification. Since your two models each attempt $648$ classifications, your $n=2\times 648=1296$ . With such a value of $n$ , you get $\hat p=0.725$ , leading to a real $z$ -stat. ADDITIONAL INFO If you are interested in the topic of comparing machine learning models, I recommend a read of Benavoli et al. (21017). While the authors make a case for Bayesian methods, the paper also goes through more classical techniques. Finally, note the issues with classification accuracy as a measure of model performance. Why is accuracy not the best measure for assessing classification models? Academic reference on the drawbacks of accuracy, F1 score, sensitivity and/or specificity REFERENCE Benavoli, Alessio, et al. "Time for a change: a tutorial for comparing multiple classifiers through Bayesian analysis." The Journal of Machine Learning Research 18.1 (2017): 2653-2688.
