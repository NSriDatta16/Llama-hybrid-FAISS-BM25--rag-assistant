Speech Recognition & Programming

Has anyone had success with Dragon Naturally Speaking voice recognition software when it comes to programming? I am wondering because I think it would be a lot faster than me typing by hand, and easier on my carpol-tunnel. I program from day to day in visual basic 6 ide, visual studio 2008 ide + team explorer, writing emails, and chatting over Windows Live IM. I have a need for a command-based interface where I can bind voice commands to keystrokes, switch between spelling / saying words / saying words without spaces, etc. Any comments are much appreciated.
