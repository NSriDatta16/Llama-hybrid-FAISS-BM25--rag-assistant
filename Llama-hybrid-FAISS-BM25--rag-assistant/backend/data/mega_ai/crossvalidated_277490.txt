training set has 12 features and unknown set has 3 features to predict from in xgboost model

I have run into a strange problem. The xgboost model I built was trained using 12 known features to predict 'y'. This was on a clean dataset that had all the features populated. But, now the unknown set on production has only 3 features. The rest of the features are just NULL. Can I continue to use the same model to predict on production? Or should I re-train the model with only 3 features and then move code back to production?
