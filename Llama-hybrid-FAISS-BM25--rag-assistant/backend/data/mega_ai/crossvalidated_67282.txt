When is covariance a reasonable measure of correlation?

I am brushing up on statistics for a data science course. I saw an example of variables that are highly dependent, but still have 0 covariance ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance#Uncorrelatedness_and_independence ) Now ... what I want to know is: when would covariance be a good measure of correlation, and when not. What kind of data is suitable for analysis using covariance, and what isn't?
