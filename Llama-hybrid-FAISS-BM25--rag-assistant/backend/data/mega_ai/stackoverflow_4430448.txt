jquery sortable items

I have a list like so . Main Child 1 Child 2 I would like to be able to make two sets of sortables one within the the other. Just like you would drag a fold to another folder or a file to another file an a tree directory. However I JUST NEED it to be sortable within the parent so it should not move outside the parent. I tried containment but no luck any other suggestions ?
