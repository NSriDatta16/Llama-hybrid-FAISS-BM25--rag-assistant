In this Bayesian formula, W is your "feature", i.e., the thing you observe. You must carefully define first what is W. Often you have many alternatives. Let's say that, in a first approach, you say W is the event "message contains the word Viagra". (That is to say, W have two possible values: 0 = "message does not contain the word V..." 1="message contains at least an occurrence of that word"). In that scenario, you're right: P(W|S) is "Probability that word W appears (at least once) in a spam message." And to estimate (better than "calculate") it, you count , as the other answer says, "(Number of spam messages containing at least one word V) / (Number of all spam messages)" An alternative approach would be: define "W = number of ocurrences of word Viagra in a message". In this case, we should estimate P(W/S) for each value of W (P(W=0/S) P(W=1/S) P(W=2/S) ... More complicated, more samples needed, better (hopely) performance.
