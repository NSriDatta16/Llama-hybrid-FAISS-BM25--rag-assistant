Ok, I found a solution! It's ugly and it breaks the 'rules of encapsulation,' but at least it does the job. Remember this is just for special cases ! jQuery can handle its own helper removal just fine. In my case I had a helper that was sometimes the original element and sometimes a clone, so it wasn't always appropriate to delete the helper after reverting. element.draggable({ stop : function(e, ui) { /* "dropped_on_droppable" is custom and set in my custom drop method ".moved_draggable" is custom and set in my custom drag method, to differentiate between the two types of draggables */ if (!ui.helper.dropped_on_droppable & ui.helper.hasClass('moved_draggable')) { /* this is the big hack that breaks encapsulation */ $.ui.ddmanager.current.cancelHelperRemoval = true; } }, Warning: this breaks encapsulation and may not be forwards compatible
