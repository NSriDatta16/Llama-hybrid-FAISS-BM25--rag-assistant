radio button values not being submitted

I must be losing my mind... I have a form with some radio buttons, but no matter what, the POST is only including the NAME of the radios, not the value of whichever is selected: With the 2nd radio selected (val 2; ds_p), and submited, this is the var_dump: ["storage"]=> string(1) "0" in fact, it is that exact same var_dump no matter which is checked. WTH is going on? thx. ps, the form is loaded into another div via jquery, if that matters. edit: it appears to be something with the ajax. this is the code that loads the form: $.get('/page/init/', function(data){ $("#form_txt").html(data); }); edit 2: just to be clear: it behaves the same whether I submit via a "submit" button, or if I submit it through ajax serialize() .
