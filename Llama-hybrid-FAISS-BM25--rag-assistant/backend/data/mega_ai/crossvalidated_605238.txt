Probably not. As you allow the model more flexibility to fit the (in-sample) data, you let it use that flexibility to get a smaller value of the loss function. The genius of conventional neural networks is not just that they limit this flexibility but that they do so in a clever way that makes sense from the standpoint of how humans see (or how we think we see).
