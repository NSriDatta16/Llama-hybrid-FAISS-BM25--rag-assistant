Lots of answers here, all with a theme. The best way to do it really depends on context (because context determines the easiest navigation method), so I'll make some assumptions about the context. If the section you want to indent or comment is a single paragraph (eg, you want to indent or comment everything from the cursor up to the next blank line), you can indent with: >) If the cursor is not on the start of the paragraph, but the section you want to indent is a single paragraph and the cursor is in the middle, use >ip Finally, suppose you want to indent a block of code delimited by {}, and the cursor is in the middle of that block. Use >i{ To comment, in each case just replace the > with v and use the above commands to make a block selection, then do a text replace like s/^/#/. The key is the navigation commands. I highly recommend :help v_a
