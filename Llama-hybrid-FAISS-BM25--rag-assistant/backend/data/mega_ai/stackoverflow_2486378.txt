The question isn't completely clear on scope, but I have a hunch that PyPy, embedding other full languages, and similar solutions might be overkill. It sounds like iamgopal may really be interested in something more like Interpreter Pattern or Little Language . If the language you want to support is really small (see the Interpreter Pattern link), then hand-coding this yourself in Python won't be too hard. You can write a simple parser (Google around; here's one example ), then walk the AST and evaluate user expressions. However, if you expect this to be used for a long time or by many people, it may be worth throwing a real language at the problem. (I'd recommend Python itself if your users are already familiar with basic Python syntax).
