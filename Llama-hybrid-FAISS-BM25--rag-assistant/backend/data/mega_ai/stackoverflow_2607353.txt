I totally agree with James Westgate. If you use the web.config, you don't have to take care about this issue. In case that you can't use the web.config for any reason I would say that your approach is correct. Storing the value on the Application storage you're avoiding to read the connections string over and over again from disk. If you need to change the connection string, you would have to restart the application. A connection string is not supposed to change everyday so this shouldn't be a problem. BTW: I don't like very much the logic asking in which environment you are. That shouldn't be necessary at all...
