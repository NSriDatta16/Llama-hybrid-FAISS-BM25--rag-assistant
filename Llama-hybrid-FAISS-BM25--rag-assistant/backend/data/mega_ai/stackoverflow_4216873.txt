java data-structure to simulate a data tree

I need help defining what approach to use. I have a SOAP response giving me an xml file. I need to end-up with 3 correlated lists displayed on screen. When you select one item on the first list, the corresponding choices will appear on the second list etc. I am only interested on how to organize efficiently the data after it is extracted from the xml stream. Here's an xml snippet: Acer A1 Android Acer A1 J2ME Acer A2 Android Samsung E400 Android So, I will have something like manufacturer={"Acer", "Acer", "Acer","Samsung"}, model={"A1","A1", "A2", "E400"}, platform={"Android","J2ME","Android","Android"}. Here comes the fun part: I need to massage the data so that I can use it to display 3 lists. After selecting Android, Acer and Samsung become available. If Acer is selected, then model A1 and A2 are available. All lists need to be sorted. Currently I'm using Sax to parse the data into a vector of objects, containing manufacturer, model, platform fields. All I can think of is a TreeMap like structure. Any suggestions would be appreciated.
