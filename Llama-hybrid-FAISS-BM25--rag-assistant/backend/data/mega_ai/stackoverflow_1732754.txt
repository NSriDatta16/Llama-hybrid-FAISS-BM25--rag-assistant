How to direct my users to my iPhone enabled site?

I have made an iPhone friendly version of my site, that I want to direct my users to. The big question now is how to direct my users to this site. There are a few alternatives: Redirect the user based on the user agent, e.g. if the user agent sent by the browser contains "iPhone" or android or whatever. If the user agent matches the above criteria, display a notice on the original site telling the user that an iPhone version is available. Which one is the most user-friendly? Another dimension to consider is the SEO aspect. How do I show Google that my site is iPhone capable?
