You can try this paper [1]. This work is about matching train and test distribution matching and estimation of density ratio $P_{test}(x)/P_{train}(x)$. However, it is designed in such a way that instead of computing the density ratio of train to test, it computes density ratio of train to some convex combination of train and test distribution i.e $\alpha P_{train} + (1 - \alpha)P_{test}$. Now, by setting $\alpha$ close to 1, they are able to do outlier detection and in fact it is one of their experiments in their paper. Now, this method does not use the training set labels, but just the training set points. As @Anony-Mousse has already pointed above (+1), you can also try out one-class SVMs for the same as well, which can use the labels.
