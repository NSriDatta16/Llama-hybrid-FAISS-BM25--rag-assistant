Identifying trends when data points are averages with standard errors

I am trying to use a regression to identify trends in the poverty rate over time in county level Census data. I cannot use smaller geographies in my regression because the rates provided by Census tract do not cover all the groups I am looking at. I only have one data point for each year for the county, and it comes from the American Community Survey, so it is not a census and each data point has a SE. How should I approach the regression? A simple regression with one data point for each year would not reflect the unreliability of the underlying data. I was considering transforming each data point into n data points randomly distributed around the observed value according to its SE, but I am concerned that the extra data points will affect the p values. Is that the correct way to proceed or is there a better way?
