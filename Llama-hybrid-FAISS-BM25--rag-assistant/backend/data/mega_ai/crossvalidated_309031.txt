Relationship between coupled matrix factorization and CCA

Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) computes a low-dimensional shared embedding of two set of variables $X$ and $Y$ such that the correlations among the variables between the two sets is maximized. On the other hand, the Coupled Matrix Factorization (CMF) tries to jointly factorize $X$ and $Y$ into a set of low rank components. A CMF with $l_2$ regularization on the factors can be expressed as: \begin{equation*} \begin{aligned} & \underset{A,B,C}{\text{min}} & & \alpha \|X - AB^{\top} \|_F^2 + \beta \|Y - AC^{\top} \|_F^2 + \lambda (\| A \|_F^2 + \| B \|_F^2 + \| C \|_F^2) \\ &\text{subject to}& & \alpha + \beta = 1\\ \end{aligned} \end{equation*} What is the exact relationship between CCA and CMF? Is the relationship analogous to the relationship between PCA and Factor Analysis, where in the latter the components are subject to orthogonality constraint, but for more than one set of variables? Any pointers or explanations is highly appreciated.
