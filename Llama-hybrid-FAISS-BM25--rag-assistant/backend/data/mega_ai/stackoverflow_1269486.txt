I tried a little experiment with my routes and this seemed to work # route to the even action map.connect 'foo/:code', :controller => 'bar', :action => 'even', :requirements => { :code => /\d+(2|4|6|8|0)/ } # route to the odd action map.connect 'foo/:code', :controller => 'bar', :action => 'odd', :requirements => { :code => /\d+(1|3|5|7|9)/ } It seems a little hacky to me and I won't argue that it is probably quite fragile, but it does get the job done. Edit : I didn't put any anchors (^ or $) in the routes because they are not allowed in the Routing requirements. The framework implies that they are there. So according to the routing parser, /\d+(1|3|5|7|9)/ == /^\d+(1|3|5|7|9)$/
