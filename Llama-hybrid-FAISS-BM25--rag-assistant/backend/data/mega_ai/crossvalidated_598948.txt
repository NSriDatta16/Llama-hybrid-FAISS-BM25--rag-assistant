Are random forests ideal for feature selection with two completely independent datasets?

I have two independent dataframes: Observation of animal frequencies in a site: Each row represents a site, where the animal frequencies (response variables?) sum up to 100 and the other variables (predictors?) are factors. Animal 1 Animal 2 Animal_n Altitude Region Geography_Type Chronology Site_Type 10 40 20 10 North Coast Roman Urban 25 25 50 100 South Mountain Late Roman Farm ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... Presence absence observations of plants in a site : each row represent a site. Plant 1 Plant 2 Plant_n Altitude Region Geography_Type Chronology Site_Type 0 1 1 10 North Coast Roman Urban 0 0 1 100 South Mountain Late Roman Farm ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... Unfortunately, I cannot combine these dataframes in any way as the observations come from different sites/chronologies and the observations with a matching site ID and chronology are too few (less than 40). In other words, I have no unique ID and I can't concatenate/combine/merge the dataframes in any way. My goal is to select the features that are most important for the decision of having certain plants or certain animals at certain altitudes, regions, site type, etc. My initial thought was to use a random forest, but it would not work as I cannot combine the dataframes. What should I look into to solve this type of problem? Ideally, I need something supervised because I need to know what are the most important factors. I am sorry about the question, I am trying using random forests for the first time.
