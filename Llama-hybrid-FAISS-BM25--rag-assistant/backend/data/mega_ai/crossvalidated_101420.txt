Multiple Correspondence Analysis percentages, and points near to one axis

I have done a multiple correspondence analysis based on 10 factors: every factor is a Yes or No question. The first factor give 22.3% of the total variance and the second 13.6%. I am used to Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and to having a high percentage (>70%). Question1: Is a total percentage of 35% (22+13) enough for an MCA? Question2: base on the image attached, is there any implication when the variables are close to the second axis? Any other comment about the MCA I have done is appreciated.
