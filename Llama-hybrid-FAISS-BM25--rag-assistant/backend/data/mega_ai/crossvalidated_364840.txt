Reverse causality

I have 4 time series, $y, x_1, x_2$ and $x_3$, and I'm running the following reduced form VAR: $ \Delta y_{t} = A_1 \,x_{1,\,t-1} + A_2 \,x_{2,\,t-1} + A_3 \,x_{3,\,t-1} + \varepsilon_t$ Is there any chance the regression estimates may suffer from reverse causality? My guess would be no, since it's unlikely that the future can affect the past, right?
