If I create a transient property in the model, isn't this managed by core data then?

Just to grok this: If I had a transient property, lets say averagePrice, and I mark that as "transient" in the data modeler: This will not be persistet, and no column will be created in SQLite for that? And: If I make my own NSManagedObject subclass with an averagePrice property, does it make any sense to model that property in the xcdatamodel file? Would it make a difference if I would simply create a property in my subclass and not model that in the entity? (I think: yes, it doesn't matter at all ... but not sure)
