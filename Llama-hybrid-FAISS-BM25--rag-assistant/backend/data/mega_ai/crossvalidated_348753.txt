Machine Learning and Deep Learning(neural nets)

"If you know Machine Learning, then you will not believe in Deep Learning(artificial neural nets). If you believe in Deep Learning, that means you don't understand Machine Learning" Am I right? (this is not a subjective question) Reasons (Upon request by Florian) Deep learning and neural nets is an incomplete as a theory due to following reason The solutions that fit training data are infinite. We don't have precise mathematical equation that is satisfied by only a single one and that we can say generalizes best. Simply speaking we don't know which generalizes best. On being put on hold, I am clarifying this : @Tim and others, Ah I see What you are getting at. The word 'believe'.....i used it in a totally an informal way, in the sense that, "I dont believe means, I dont accept it as a theory"....and don't want it to have any bearing on its practicality. I clarify, I am not in anyway intending to say that they are not practically useful, infact they are in much vogue in many practical applications, which everyone knows. No issues with that. I am talking in a theoretical sense, some things we cannot accept as a theory in some abstract sense, although they may be very useful in parcticality. By using word, "believe" i mean "accepting as a theory", and not bearing anything on practical engineering significance. I hope this should solve the ambiguty. I am in no way talking about the practical significance. Sometimes people should give some importance to theoretical questions like this one. It won't hurt anyone. Edit in response to answer by Shimao : I illustrate two examples of the infinite possible solutions (functions represented by network post training). Out of the solutions A and B (both fit training data), one is extremely useful and the other is a totally useless. (These are two extreme examples. (There is no mathematical proof that regularization by minimizing sum of weights solves this problem or make the problem have unique solution. The regularizations are thumb rules).
