How to employ something such as openMP in Cython?

Basically I have a problem that is pretty much embrassing parallel and I think I've hit the limits of how fast I can make it with plain python & multiprocessing so I'm now attempting to take it to a lower level via Cython and hopefully openMP. So in short I am wondering how I can employ openMP with Cython, or if I'll have to wrap some raw C code and load/bind to it via Cython? Or can I have Cython compile down to C code then modify the C code to add in the openMP pragmas in then compile to library and load it into Python?
