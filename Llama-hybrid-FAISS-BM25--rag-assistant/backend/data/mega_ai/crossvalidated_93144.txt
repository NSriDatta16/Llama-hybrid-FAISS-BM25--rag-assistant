nnetar return negative forecast values

I am confused about using nnetar . All my training time series data are positive numbers, but the forecast results obtained from nnetar returns negative numbers. The following is my code myts However, if I forecast only short period of time e.g., h = 10 or 20. The returned values are positive. Did I do anything wrong ? Thank you.
