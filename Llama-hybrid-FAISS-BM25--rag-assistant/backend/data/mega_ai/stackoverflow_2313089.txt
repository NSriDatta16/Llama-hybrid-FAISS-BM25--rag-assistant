Errors when Upgrading Flex 3.2 to 3.5

Here's are the errors: VerifyError: Error #1053: Illegal override of allowInsecureDomain in _SwdModule_mx_core_FlexModuleFactory. ReferenceError: Error #1065: Variable _SwdModule_mx_core_FlexModuleFactory is not defined. SwdModule is a module used within the organization and there's an application that loads this (and various other modules) at run time. I've read on other stack overflow and various web site that this error was caused because the modules and the main app. were compiled using different Flex SDKs. I verified and checked up on this, but all of my SWFs are compiling using 3.5. Can anyone think of anything else why this error would be occuring? Thanks.
