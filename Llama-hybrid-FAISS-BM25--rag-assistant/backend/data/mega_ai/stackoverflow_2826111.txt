I am developing an application using services and Remote interface. Are you sure that is necessary? If the activities and the service are in the same application, please do not use AIDL to access them, as that adds overhead for no value. Use the local binding pattern instead, even if you also support AIDL for third-party applications to connect to. passing x with my intent when I call the new Activity I doubt this is possible or safe. redo this.bindService(new Intent(y.this,z.class), mConnection, Context.BIND_AUTO_CREATE); in the onCreate() of my new Activity I suspect this is your only option. For a local service, binding operations like this are fairly inexpensive. That is why I encourage you to use the local binding pattern for services within your application, not AIDL.
