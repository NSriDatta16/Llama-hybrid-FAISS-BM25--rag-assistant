How to safely remove orphaned values in the Windows registry?

I had an application installed on my windows machine which I removed, but it has left an orphaned drive icon under "My Computer". Having dug through the registry, to find it by name, it seems to be associated with a GUID that occurs in other parts of the registry. I'd like to write a quick C program to do the job, once I understand what it is I need to remove. I understand the API, but what is all that cr*p in the registry? Short question: what registry values do I need to remove to reliably delete the unused drive icon? Longer question: where do I find out how the windows registry is organised at that level, to achieve the required result? I've looked on MSDN, but either the information I require is not there, or I don't know what I'm looking for (I'm not a windows programmer, but I do know a little about coding...). RTFM answers welcome, I'd just like to know which FM to R...
