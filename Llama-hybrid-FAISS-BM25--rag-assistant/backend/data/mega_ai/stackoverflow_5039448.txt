Objective-c class create methods

Let's say we have a class Base. @inerface Base : NSObject { } +(id) instance; @end @implementation Base +(id) instance { return [[[self alloc] init] autorelease]; } -(id) init { ... } @end And we have a derived class Derived. @interface Derived : Base { } @end Which reimplements the init method. Now we want to create an instance of Derived class using class method +(id) instance . id foo = [Derived instance]; And now foo is actually a Base class. How to achieve foo to be a Derived class in this case? Should I reimplement all the class method for derived classes ? (actually immplementation will be totally the same). Is there a more elegant way ?
