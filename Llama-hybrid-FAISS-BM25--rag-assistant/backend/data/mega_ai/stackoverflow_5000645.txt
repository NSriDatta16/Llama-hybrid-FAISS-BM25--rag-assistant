how to add view to notification?

I want to add one icon to the notification bar for mediaplayer. Now on dragging the notification bar I want to add view like four buttons. How can I do that? This functionality is in default player of android. When a user exits the screen, the player keeps playing in the background and when we drag the notification there is functionality to play, pause, next and previous.
