The problem is very similar to the problem of CNN use for sentiment classification. The details can be found in http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D14-1181 . An example of a github implementation is : https://github.com/deepanwayx/CNN-For-Sentence-Classification-In-Keras The 2 groups are positive/negative movie reviews; the files are in https://github.com/deepanwayx/CNN-For-Sentence-Classification-In-Keras/blob/master/data/rt-polarity.neg You need to do some parsing to split the data into positive and negative groups. This ought to be pretty straightforward for the details you are describing. An interesting point to note is that your results are also related to the topic of sentiment analysis. I am guessing a negative sentiment will correlate strongly with a poor score. You could probably get away directly with an out-of-the-box sentiment classifier too. Play around with this demo: http://nlp.stanford.edu:8080/sentiment/rntnDemo.html to see how the results look. You can alternatively resort to training your model too :)
