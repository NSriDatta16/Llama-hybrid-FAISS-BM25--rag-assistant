function contentHash(domNode) { ... // return unique id based on content / dom node. } var myUniqueSalt = ... // unique salt for your unique id's window.localStorage.setItem(uniqueSalt + contentHash(domNode), "{'x':" + x + ",'y':" + y "}"); ... var position = JSON.parse(window.localStorage.getItem(uniqueSalt + contentHash(domNode)); object.x = position.x; object.y = position.y; Something along those lines should suffice. You want a unique salt to ensure no-one overwrites your location in localStorage and then you want to get a unique id from your content that your storing the position. Simply store the position as a JSON string then use JSON.parse to get your position object later. of course check for whether the getItem returns an empty string and if so use the default. I'll go even further to recommend you use backbone.js to store your data and connect it upto backbone.js-localstorage . Which overwrites the backbone.sync method so the models are saved locally. This means you don't have to serialize your data into localstorage nor serialize it out of local storage.
