Overloaded functions: C: AddUserName(int userid, NameInfo nameinfo); AddUserAge(int userid, int iAge); AddUserAddress(int userid, AddressInfo addressinfo); C++ equivalent/replacement: User::AddInfo(NameInfo nameinfo); User::AddInfo(int iAge); User::AddInfo(AddressInfo addressInfo); Why it's an improvement: Allows the programmer to express the interface such that the concept of the function is expressed in the name, and the parameter type is only expressed in the parameter itself. Allows the caller to interact with the class in a manner closer to an expression of the concepts. Also generally results in more concise, compact and readable source code.
