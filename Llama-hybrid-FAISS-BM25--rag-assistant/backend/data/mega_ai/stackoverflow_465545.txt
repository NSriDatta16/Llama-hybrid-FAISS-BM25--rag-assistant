How to get mouse position over a certain control

Windows Form I'm using the DragOver event on a layoutpanel and the DragEventArgs returns the X/Y coordinates of the mouse in relation to the screen. I know there is a function to translate this in to the position of the mouse over the control, but I'm having difficulty locating it.
