What are the differences between File System and SQL Server deployments for SSIS packages?

I have an SSIS package that needs to be deployed to SQL Server agent. It has 2 external dependencies (2 assemblies, both installed in the GAC) Now the package runs just fine under a File System Deployment but when we deploy to SQL Server agent it fails with 'Object reference not set to an instance of an object' within the task that requires 1 of the external dependencies Just to let you know, this external dependency is an Interop assembly to the right fax com api What is the main differences between File System deployment and SQL Server deployment. I think if I can understand this a bit more then I may be able to diagnose the issue.
