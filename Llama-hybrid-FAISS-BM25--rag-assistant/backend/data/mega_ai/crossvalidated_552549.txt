The condition for an ARMA model to be stationary is not that the AR coefficients are all below unity. Instead, it is that the roots of the characteristic polynomial of the AR part are outside the unit circle, or in other words, their moduli are above unity. See e.g. this lecture note from University of Minnesota, specifically slide 64 but also the slides before it. Or see any time series textbook , as stationarity of ARMA models is commonly covered there. In your case, one needs to solve the equation $$ 1-1.6614z+0.6829z^2-0.5717z^3+1.1751z^4-0.5859z^5=0 $$ and figure out if any of the roots has a modulus equal to or lower than unity. In that case, your series would be nonstationary. The forecast package in R has the functionality to find the roots of the characteristic polynomial, and explicit code for that is available here ; perhaps there is something similar in Python, too. What I get after some fiddling with the code above is the following: Four out of five roots are visible in the range that the plot covers. No roots can be found inside or on the unit circle, so it seems we do not have an indication that your process is nonstationary.
