Re-calibrating Intercept on logistic regression models for unbalance data

I have data-set that I’m modelling using logistic regression as land.cover~H1+H2+H3+H4+H6+H8+H14. My response and categorical variables are binary. However the number of 0 and 1 in my response variable are very disproportionate, 0 = 18217207 and 1= 206504. Following the advice of this blog: http://r-statistics.co/Logistic-Regression-With-R.html , I decided to balance these proportions in the training and test data, to assure that the logit model works. The main issue with that is that the intercept of my model changes. I want to transform the coefficients ( log odd ratio) to probabilities using this formula, where β0 is the intercept and βx are the coefficients. p= exp(β0 + β1*x1 + … + βk*xk)/(1+exp(β0 + β1*x1 + … + βk*xk)) For that, I need to recalibrate my intercept to represent the real prevalence of the land cover. Do you know any methodology to do that? I leave a piece of my code where I show the balance of 0 and 1 in the training data. > data.model.200 land.cover H1 H2 H3 H4 H6 H8 H14 1: 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 2: 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 3: 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 4: 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 5: 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 --- 18423707: 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 18423708: 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 18423709: 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 18423710: 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 18423711: 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 > table(data.model.200$land.cover) 0 1 18217207 206504 # Create Training Data input_ones $land.cover == 1), ] # all 1's input_zeros land.cover == 0), ] # all 0's set.seed(100) # for repeatability of samples input_ones_training_rows
