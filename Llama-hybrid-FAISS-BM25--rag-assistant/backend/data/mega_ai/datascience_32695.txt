Interactive dashboard for time series data

I'm searching for some tools that allow me to build a dashboard in order to visualize information about time series. This dashboard needs to be interactive and allows to be integrated into a web site (like a web application). I made some projects with D3.js, but for this one I would prefer something faster in term of implementation (python+matplotlib like). What kind of options do I have?
