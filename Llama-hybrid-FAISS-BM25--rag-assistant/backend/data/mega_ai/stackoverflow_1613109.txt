The 303 status code is intended to be used in response of a POST request to redirect to a different resource: This method exists primarily to allow the output of a POST-activated script to redirect the user agent to a selected resource. In your case you should use the 301 status code for a permanent redirect: The requested resource has been assigned a new permanent URI and any future references to this resource SHOULD use one of the returned URIs. Or you use a temporary redirect ( 302 / 307 ) and tell the search engines not to index that documents.
