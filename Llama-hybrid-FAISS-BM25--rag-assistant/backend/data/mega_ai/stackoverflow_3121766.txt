Keep time in sync among servers without internet connection

I have 5 servers on a LAN without Internet connection. I need them to keep the clock in sync among them. I could configure them as NTP peers, and set a high stratum for the local clock of one of them. In this way, the other four would sync with that clock. What I actually want, is them to agree on a time using all of the 5 local clocks (i.e. doing some kind of average), for reasons of robustness and precision. Is it possible with NTP? PS: I do not want to use an external clock source. EDIT: and no scripting outside NTP features, that could only make precision worse :)
