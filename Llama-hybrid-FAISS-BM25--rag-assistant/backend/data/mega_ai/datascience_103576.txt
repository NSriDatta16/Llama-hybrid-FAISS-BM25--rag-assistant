Why SVM works well with high dimensional data?

I'm having troubles trying to understand why SVM works well with high dimensional data, the case when p >> n. I read the following: SVM is automatically regularized. You don't have to pick a regularization parameter because picking the widest separation margin is a way to automatically regularize. However I don't understand why this implies that a SVM works well on this type of data. Also I read about that the optimization problem to maximize the margin doesn't depend on the dimensions, so in what depend?
