Computing descriptives statistics for sites and locations based on literature search with sites having varying numbers of time points

I've collected a data set from the literature. These data are largely binomial: they are clutch sizes of a bird that lays only 1 or 2 eggs in most areas, and in some areas will lay 3. However the only information I have compiled are means, standard errors and sample sizes (# nests) from various sites. Some sites have multiple values reported from them (from different years), and I have split the sites into 3 categories based on location (A, B and C). I want to do 2 things that are essentially the same: Produce one value (± SE or SD) for each site (so a site mean) Produce a location mean ± SE or SD (so an average of all the sites within a given location category). Is it possible to do this relatively simply while keeping the information contained with the reported standard errors from each site? Currently, I've taken a mean of the means of each site within a location category, and just calculated the SE from the mean of means, but that's losing all the reported variation from each site.
