Follow these steps to automatically capture your orders after the authorization: Configure the payment method to Authorize (not Direct Sale) Create an observer that will handle event called sales_order_payment_place_end with method called automaticalyCaptureOrder Use the following observer method code: public function automaticalyCaptureOrder(Varien_Event_Observer $observer) { $payment = $observer->getEvent()->getPayment(); // Add additional check for payment method instance, // We need to be sure that only Authorize.Net payment will be captured if ($payment->getMethodInstance() instanceof Mage_Paygate_Model_Authorizenet) { $payment->capture(null); // null value tells Magento to create // an invoice automatically } } Sit back and relax :) Please let me know if you have any difficulties with this solution and I'll get back to you. UPDATE: To capture order payment after some period of time you should load order object by its unique id, and perform similar actions as before, but also you need to save order object after calling the capture method: $order->load($orderId); // Or $order->loadByIncrementId($incrementId); $order->getPayment()->capture(null); // Capturing the payment $order->save(); // Save updated information (transaction ids, order status)
