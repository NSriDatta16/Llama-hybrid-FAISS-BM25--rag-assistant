Training CNN: Why, sometimes, does my CNN training go horribly wrong?

I have a CNN implemented on TensorFlow. I am using it on the MNIST dataset. 9/10 times, when I start training it, it very quickly gets up past 90%. However, once in a while, it zeros in on 9% performance. Is this a bug in my code, or a CNN phenomenon? (I remember reading something about encountering singularities in poorly initialized neural nets--I am just doing a truncated normal matrix for my weights) Hopefully, it is a CNN thing associated with the gradient descent and not my code...because this intermittent success and failure is very difficult to debug...
