Assuming that you are using forms authentication, I think the problem is that the swfUpload utility, which uses flash, isn't dragging along the proper authentication cookies for the site back to the server with it's post. You would have to go find out how to get the flash to bring the auth cookies back to the server with it's requests. quick look: http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&safe=off&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&hs=pr3&q=swfupload+authentication+cookies&aq=f&oq=&aqi=
