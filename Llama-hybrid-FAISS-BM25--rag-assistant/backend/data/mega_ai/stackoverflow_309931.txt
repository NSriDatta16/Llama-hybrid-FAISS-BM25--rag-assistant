I think you are correct. Leaving it unforced allows users to group things as they see fit for better code readability. The compiler may organize things differently in memory. edit : as per the spec: ยง9.2 clause 12 (1998 and 2003 standards): Nonstatic data members of a (non-union) class declared without an intervening access-specifier are allocated so that later members have higher addresses within a class object. The order of allocation of nonstatic data members separated by an access-specifier is unspecified (11.1). Implementation alignment requirements might cause two adjacent members not to be allocated immediately after each other; so might requirements for space for managing virtual functions (10.3) and virtual base classes (10.1). I found this information in a related SO question
