Group_by field is not showing in the summarise output in R

In R,using dplyr package, I tried the function "summarise" and I expect the result to show along with the groupby field. However, all of a sudden I see summarized output but without the groupby filed which makes the results meaningless. Any one any idea? For example if data has ages and salaries for members belonging to a team and I try to view the Average Age and Salary by Team the code below returns just the averages without the team names Code: df_summ = df %>% group_by(Team)%>% summarise(AvgAge= mean(Age),AvgSalary= mean(Salary)) So without the groupby column "Team" the result is meaningless What Am I missing here?
