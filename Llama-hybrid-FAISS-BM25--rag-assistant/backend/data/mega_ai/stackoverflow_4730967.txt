How do you know a soap client is using https/ssl? Using php nusoap library

I'm using a PHP soap toolkit called nusoap (http://sourceforge.net/projects/nusoap), and I have a newbie question. I am calling a WSDL service, which is running over ssl (e.g. https://server.com/service/method.asmx?WSDL ). Using nusoap, I traced out the request. It looks like this: POST /service/method.asmx HTTP/1.0 Host: server.com User-Agent: NuSOAP/0.9.5 (1.123) Content-Type: text/xml; charset=ISO-8859-1 SOAPAction: "http://software.com/service/Method" Content-Length: 713 I'm wondering, though, is this being done over SSL, or no?
