I would use a solution similar to the properties files used for widgets in the Swing Application Framework . That would allow you to put all the relevant properties (button names, tooltips, etc.) into something akin to massiveProjectFrench.properties or massiveProjectGerman.properties. At that point, you could assign each language version to a native speaker / expert to ensure that your spelling, grammar (fragments), etc. are correct. As a separate effort, you'll want to run each version to ensure that button names and other properties that may be clipped actually fit within the appropriate bounds. If not, you'll need to either do some language-appropriate abbreviation or redesign to allow for larger / smaller scopes.
