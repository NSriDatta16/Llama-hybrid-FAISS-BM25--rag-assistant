How do I run a node.js app as a background service?

Since this post has gotten a lot of attention over the years, I've listed the top solutions per platform at the bottom of this post. Original post : I want my node.js server to run in the background, i.e.: when I close my terminal I want my server to keep running. I've googled this and came up with this tutorial , however it doesn't work as intended. So instead of using that daemon script, I thought I just used the output redirection (the 2>&1 >> file part), but this too does not exit - I get a blank line in my terminal, like it's waiting for output/errors. I've also tried to put the process in the background, but as soon as I close my terminal the process is killed as well. So how can I leave it running when I shut down my local computer? Top solutions : Systemd (Linux) Launchd (Mac) node-windows (Windows) PM2 (Node.js)
