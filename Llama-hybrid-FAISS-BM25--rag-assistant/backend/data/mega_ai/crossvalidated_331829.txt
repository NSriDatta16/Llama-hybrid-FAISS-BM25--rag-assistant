Since each case belongs to exactly one of group A, B, or C, if the case doesn't belong to either A or B then it must belong to group C. So there are only 2 independent predictors among the three of A, B, and C. Choose 2 for your dummy variables; then your intercept will represent the value for the third group. Similar considerations for the interaction terms. In response to comment: Note that if the values of $T$ start at 0 then all of the interaction terms have values of 0 at time $T = 0$, as they are products of group-membership dummies with time. Say that you choose to set A and B as your dummies. With the way you formulate the model, the intercept will be the value for Group C at time 0; it includes no interactions. Coefficients for A and B will represent differences from the value of Group C at time 0. The coefficient for $T$ will be the slope in time for Group C. The interaction terms with $T$ for Groups A and B will represent the differences in slope from that of Group C. As $T$ represents time, make sure that you are handling the time series and potential repeated measures on the same individuals appropriately. Those are not always trivial tasks.
