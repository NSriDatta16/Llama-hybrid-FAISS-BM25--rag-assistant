SVM and cross validation with a minimum finding algorithm

Just a simple question on parameter selection for SVMs. If I use a minimum finding algorithm to find the optimal parameters for a set of data, how do I "average" the parameters over a set of cross validation runs to come up with the best parameters for my test set run? When doing X-fold cross validation, I can see simply averaging the fit of the model for each parameters set, but not sure how to do it with a minimum finding algo. Thanks
