How valuable is a regression result with serially correlated residuals?

I performed a linear regression with two time series variables. First, I checked stationarity of both time series via ADF/PP/KPSS tests and all three indicated non-stationarity. However the test of Zivot/Andrews (specified in R as ur.za) indicated that both series are (trend)-stationary. I concluded that both variables are suitable for a regression. As a result I got significant results (also the direction i expected) but, however, also serial correlation for the residuals. After differencing both the dependent and independent variables, the correlation of the residuals was removed but the relationship also not significant anymore. Now my question is, how good the results of the first model are or if i need to perform at a transformation as I did in the second step?
