Why do we never learn cross validation in regular statistical textbooks?

I read various stats/biostats textbooks, including Casella and Lehmann's book chapter on regression. Most of time, the textbook will report a p -value for significance of the parameters after regressing against some model. Then there is a model selection procedure followed afterwards. However, those books will never touch upon cross validation (CV) or talk about using a test/training split. I learned CV and Monte Carlo cross-validation (MCCV) from machine learning books and rarely have I seen stat books covering CV. Why were we not taught cross validation in stats? Or is it not practiced by statisticians in general? Or somehow that model selection procedure becomes superior to using testing data for model selection? Does a biostatistician/practicing statistician use CV in model selection in general?
