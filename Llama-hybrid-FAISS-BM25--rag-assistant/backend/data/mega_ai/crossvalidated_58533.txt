Dimensionality reduction with locality-sensitive hashing

I have a conceptual understanding of locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) in relation to near-neighbour search. However, the articles that I have read so far seem to gloss over the details of how LSH can be used for probabilistic dimensionality reduction (e.g. Wikipedia ). Questions How does LSH reduce the dimensionality of data? Can I specify the dimensionality of the subspace or is this predetermined?
