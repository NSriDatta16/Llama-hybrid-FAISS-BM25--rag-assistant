How to Compare Two Algorithms with Multiple Datasets and Multiple Runs

I have two computational methods (A and B) that have a random behavior each, i.e., if you run the same methods 10 times, you get 10 different results (usually with a small variance). To compare both methods, we selected 5 different databases (its hard to get more) and ran method A and method B, 10 times each, on each of the five databases. This resulted in a 10x5 matrix of measurements (a row for each run and a column for each database) for each method. All measurements are paired between the two methods, because we can control the seed for each run and the database can be reused for both methods, i.e., $\text{run}_i$ of $\text{database}_j$ use the same $\text{seed}_i$ for both methods. Example (the values in the tables are the accuracies of the methods): Method A +-------------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+ | Run/Database| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | +-------------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+ | 1 | 88.92% | 44.60% | 69.49% | 73.37% | 85.63% | | 2 | 89.00% | 42.72% | 64.10% | 71.94% | 85.92% | | 3 | 88.35% | 45.07% | 65.13% | 72.14% | 85.78% | | 4 | 88.92% | 43.66% | 67.95% | 72.76% | 85.28% | | 5 | 87.94% | 50.23% | 67.18% | 71.94% | 85.92% | | 6 | 87.78% | 43.19% | 68.72% | 73.47% | 86.27% | | 7 | 89.08% | 45.54% | 66.41% | 71.33% | 85.56% | | 8 | 88.83% | 42.72% | 66.15% | 72.45% | 86.77% | | 9 | 88.43% | 45.07% | 68.97% | 72.45% | 86.49% | | 10 | 88.59% | 40.38% | 66.15% | 73.67% | 86.13% | +-------------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+ Method B +-------------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+ | Run/Database| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | +-------------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+ | 1 | 22.73% | 53.99% | 59.74% | 65.20% | 79.59% | | 2 | 75.97% | 46.95% | 58.46% | 71.63% | 84.42% | | 3 | 76.94% | 53.05% | 58.97% | 68.37% | 85.06% | | 4 | 76.54% | 42.25% | 46.67% | 68.67% | 85.92% | | 5 | 46.60% | 52.11% | 52.82% | 68.98% | 85.14% | | 6 | 76.78% | 48.83% | 55.90% | 68.27% | 78.38% | | 7 | 79.37% | 47.89% | 58.72% | 71.12% | 85.06% | | 8 | 77.83% | 54.93% | 50.77% | 72.14% | 87.06% | | 9 | 83.01% | 46.95% | 56.15% | 67.96% | 84.92% | | 10 | 78.24% | 49.30% | 58.21% | 67.96% | 81.29% | +-------------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+ Which statistical method shall I use to find out which method is the best in terms of overall performance? Or to find out if method A is statistically different, in terms of average accuracy, from method B? I investigated the use of Student T-Test and One and Two-Way ANOVA with Repeated Measurements, but they didn't seem appropriate for this analysis. Any suggestion of valid statistical analysis is appreciated.
