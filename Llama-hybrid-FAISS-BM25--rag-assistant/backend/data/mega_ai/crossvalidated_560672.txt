Do SVM's find the minimal number of support vectors in the case of redundancy?

Consider the case where more than the minimal number of vectors lie on the lines (or hyperplanes in higher dimensions) defined by the margin found by the SVM algorithm. For example, see the image below where a third redundant vector lies on the margin. Do we have any guarantees on the selection of support vectors in this case? For example, will all three points be stored as support vectors or just the minimal number necessary? If it's the former, is there any structure in their associated dual coefficients?
