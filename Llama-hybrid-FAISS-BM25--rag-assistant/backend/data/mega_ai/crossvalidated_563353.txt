Nikolay's answer is incorrect. For OP's tacotron2 paper, the outputs are aligned by teacher-forcing. This means the ground-truth output is fed as the pseudo input for the RNN. As the ground-truth itself is aligned, the model itself only has to predict the next time step while pretending all previous steps are perfectly aligned.
