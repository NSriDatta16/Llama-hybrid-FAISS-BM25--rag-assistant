Likelihood simplex distribution and model simulation

Let $y_i$ have simplex distribution with density $$f(y;\mu,\sigma^2)=[2\pi\sigma^2\{y(1-y)\}^3]^{-1/2}\exp\{-\frac{1}{2\sigma}2d(y,\mu)\}$$ where $\mu\in(0,1)$ , $\sigma^2>0$ is a unit deviance function and $d(y,\mu)=\frac{(y-\mu)^2}{y(1-y)\mu^2(1-\mu)^2}$. I need to find the likelihood of each observation, because I need to simulate data from this distribution (Bayesian simulation). Suppose I take the logarithm of the density function, as follows $$-\log(f(y,\mu,\sigma^2))\propto\frac{1}{2}\log[\sigma^2[\{y(1-y)\}^3]+\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}d(y,\mu)$$, is this the likelihood of each observation, or is there some other method of finding the maximum likelihood?
