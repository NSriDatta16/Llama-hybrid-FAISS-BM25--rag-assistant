Without seeing your data structure, it looks to me like you've over-specified your model. I think it should be something like Score ~ Target + Agent:Target or Score ~ Target + Agent*Target - 1 . One of Agent or Target should be the intercept, but you've specified both of them PLUS intercept in the model. Which in this case is forcing one of them ( Target ) to be close to zero, and thus the p-value to be close to one.
