File.Exists() returns false, but not in debug

I'm being completely confused here folks, My code throws an exception because File.Exists() returns false public override sealed TCargo ReadFile(string fileName) { if (!File.Exists(fileName)) { throw new ArgumentException("Provided file name does not exist", "fileName"); } Visual studio breaks at the throw statement, and I immediately check the value of File.Exists(fileName) in the immediate window. It returns true . When I drag the breakpoint back up to the if statement and execute it again, it throws again. fileName is an absolute path to a file. I'm not creating the file, nor writing to it (it's there all along). If I paste the path into the open dialog in Notepad, it reads the file without problems. The code is executing in a background worker. It's the only complicating factor I can think of. I am positive the file has not been opened already, either in the worker thread or elsewhere. What's going on here?
