Silverlight 3DRotate + Drag

I am trying to implement drag and rotate(Left to right or right to left) on a UIelement similar to this one: http://www.motorola.com/Consumers/US-EN/Consumer-Product-and-Services/Mobile-Phones/Motorola-Karma-QA1-US-EN So when the user holds down the left mouse button on the UIelement and starts to move the mouse to the left I want the UIelment to rotate to the left. Vice versa if moving to the right. I am not sure how to go about doing this. Any suggestions?
