Quote Bug #45987, ERROR 1075 (42000): Incorrect table definition : Actually, this is not a server bug, just a difference between MyISAM (assumed as default by that manual page) and InnoDB storage engine documented elsewhere: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/innodb-auto-increment-handling.html MyISAM is no longer the default engine; InnoDB is. Also: http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=60104 Conclusion InnoDB doesn't support AUTO_INCREMENT but no primary key being defined for the table, but MyISAM does. Choose which engine (MyISAM or InnoDB) you want to use, and deal with the CREATE TABLE statement accordingly.
