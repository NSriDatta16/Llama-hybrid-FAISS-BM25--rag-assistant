I think you need to read about Online learning , it refers to learning when new data is being constantly added. In these cases you need an algorithm that can update itself as new data arrives (i.e. it doesn't need to recalculate itself from scratch). In other words, incrementally . There are incremental versions for support vector machines (SVMs) and for neural networks. Also, bayesian networks can be made to work incrementally.
