There may be a more elegant solution, but you can just execute a query for each category. First get a list of categories: SELECT DISTINCT(category) FROM `games`; Then take each of the results and query for 12 rows: SELECT * FROM games WHERE status = 'game_published' AND `featured` = '1' AND `category` = $category LIMIT 12; Of course you need to add some kind of ranking row (and order by it) to get the top 12. Note : There may be a way to do this with a single query, but it escapes me at the moment.
