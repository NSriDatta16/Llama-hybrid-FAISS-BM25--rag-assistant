Matlab is an excellent tool for prototyping as already pointed out by carlosdc . Matlab offers limited options with regard to UI programming. GUIDE is ok for small projects, but hinders more than it helps on bigger ones. With MATLAB Builder JA you're able to compile your Matlab code into Java classes. With regard to plotting time series in real time, libraries like JFreeChart are way slower.
