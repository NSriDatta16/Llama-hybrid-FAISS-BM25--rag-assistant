I gave up on "logically" when I discovered that "logically" is a relative term; what is logical for one programmer is not always logical for a different programmer. If I have to learn what your "logically sorted" means, then it fails as a "logically sorted" technique. I prefer to alphabetize my methods and my data-members. I believe that alphabetical, psuedo-linear search the "natural" technique for people who think in English. For example, attempt to logically sort any of the following: an encyclopedia, a phone book, a contact email list. The classic argument against the alphabet is [spoken with soviet era Russian accent] "Ve haf IDE for alfabet searchz! Is nots needed in kode!" My reply to such arguments is a varient of "Yes, Mr. Stalin. But not everybody uses an IDE to view code. Some people still use (and like) vi. I may not be one of those people, but I know they exist. Other people have learned that the page-up and page-down keys work nicely when the code is organized alphabetically."
