PHP is just a tool which generates some markup language (or anything else, actually, which might not be markup-oriented at all) that is understood by the client -- the browser. Your PHP code will have to be able to generate two kind of different outputs : a "full ouput" (likely HTML), which you already have, for computer web browsers a "light ouput" (maye VML, maybe HTML too but without some heavy stuff), for mobile-based browsers. The task you'll have to deal with is to differenciate between mobile and non-mobile users ; this might be done by user-agent sniffing, for instance, or detecting what the client requested. A nice thing to do could be to use a special domain-name for users of mobile platforms ; something like mobile.example.com ; for instance, so they can bookmark it and directly access the "mobile-version" of your site -- can be useful if your detection doesn't work well ^^ If you are targetting advanced-mobile-machines (like iPhone) which have a not too bad browser, you might want to send them "rich" HTML pages ; just test your pages to verify they fit on the small screen of theses machines ; and, maybe you'll want to send less data (like not display some sidebars, or have a smaller menu, ... ) BTW, what kind of platform do you mean by "mobile" ? Those old phones with small screens, or more power-users-oriented phones, like iPhone / Android / stuff like that ? This could make quite a difference, actually, as the more recent ones have nice functionnalities that the oldest didn't have ^^ In any case, one important thing to remember : you will spend some time making the site work on these devices you will have to spend more time maintaining it ! Which means : do something simple, and, as much as possible, use the same PHP code for both mobile and non-mobile version of the site : the less code you duplicate, the less code you'll have to maintain ! Hope these few ideas (not really well sorted, I admit) will help... Have fun !
