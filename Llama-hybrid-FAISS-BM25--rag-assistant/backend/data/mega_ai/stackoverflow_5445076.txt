The browser uses "normal" GET, and should pay attention to the HTTP headers as it does for any other image fetch. To prevent caching send back the appropriate HTTP handlers ("no-cache", etc). It may also be possible to send back a "304 Not Modified" to avoid sending data if possible while still getting the client to "re-request" the image. However, the image request will only occur once unless the CSS property is changed (e.g. in JavaScript) -- even if caching is disabled. Also, CSS doesn't "execute" when a style is applied; the resources are merely what they are. This means that the browser can -- and likely does -- load all the url() resources in the CSS before the particular rule is ever applied. The actual load order/timing is unspecified AFAIK but eager loading is significantly easier and more consistent. As pointed above, using a dynamic property set in JS may be able to get the browser to re-fetch the resource per the GET rules, but at this point trying to use CSS at all for this purpose may be questionable. Happy coding.
