It depends on how much you have invested in your Javascript solution. Typically I would agree that it is much better to produce the report server-side since you'll have more options and probably a more maintainable result using Jasper or Docmosis or somesuch. You could send the html of the page back to the server and have a system there that can read it and render it into PDF, but you've done a round-trip more than you need to, and it sounds like a harder and more fragile way to produce a PDF.
