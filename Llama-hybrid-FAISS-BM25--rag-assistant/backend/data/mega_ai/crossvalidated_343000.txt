Comparing calculated associations vs. logistic regression

We are doing an analysis to find some sort of "recommended average training mileage based on race placements" to recommend training mileage to our members to achieve a certain race placement- not to forecast who wins and who does not. For our running club, I have about 20k data points for runners' race performance. Of note, we measure race-times in top-half of race finishers, did not finish (DNF), training mileage per week, training frequency (levels such as "runs once a week" to "runs twice a day"), and other features. We used logistic regression to model top-half placement. I find that there is an increasing positive association with placing in the top-half indicated by training frequency. However the predictive $c$-statistic or AUC indicates a value only slightly higher than 0.5 which is close to useless. I then created buckets of training mileage. I calculated the median of training per week and created a binary category based on upper/lower 50%. The modeled probability differed more significantly. Success probability is 40% for lower-training vs. 65% for the upper-training-amount bucket. Do the results of these models contradict each other? Are there other models I should consider?
