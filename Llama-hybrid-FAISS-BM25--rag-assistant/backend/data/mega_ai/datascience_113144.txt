Something that you can try: Create a df with every possible feature and predict them. You can use pandas.MultiIndex.from_product to create this grid and then put the result of this function into a DataFrame and them reset the index. To finish, just use this new df to predict based on your model. The other option is use an additive method, for example, Logistic Regression, LDA, or QDA, and analyze the coefficients.
