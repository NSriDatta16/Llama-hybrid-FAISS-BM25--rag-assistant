If you want to predict the points scored by a particular player, then you might either use a time series model or a linear regression or a combination of both, see https://otexts.com/fpp2/dynamic.html for and introduction to 'dynamic regression'. A time series model uses values of the dependent variable of the past to predict future values. This can work when there is a time dependent pattern. For example, if a player improves with time, then there might be a trend in the time series which you can capture with a moving average model. However, past values do not predict future values. They can only be used as a proxy for independent variables that cause or correlate with future values but which you do not have. Since you have data that can predict future scores, you should use. That is, apply a linear regression. It is a different question whether you should transform your independent variables. It seems to be a bad idea to apply a moving average to those, because you mix values of different observations in an arbitrary way that is given by the order of the games. Why should the score of a player given a particular opponent depent on the average strength of his recent oppenents? The score depends certainly on the strength of that oppenent. Whether it depends on the strength of past opponents is a different question and it depends on whether some sort of a training effect exists. If you think, that such a training effect exists, then you might use the moving averages of your independent variables as additional features for your model but you need to be careful because they can be highly correlated to the original features. If you still think, that there is some training or learning effect which your independent variables do not capture, then you might include different lags of a players scores, that is scores of past games, as features for your linear model and see if they have any significant effect.
