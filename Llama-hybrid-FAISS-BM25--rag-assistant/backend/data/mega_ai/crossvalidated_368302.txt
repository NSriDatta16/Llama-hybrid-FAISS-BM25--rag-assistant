Log-linear regression preferred over logistic regression for categorical vars?

I read here that, when all variables are categorical, log-linear is preferred over logistic regression "because log-linear is merely an extension of the chi-square test." I don't have a stats background and am having trouble deciphering this statement. Is log-linear is truly preferred when all vars are categorical? Also, why is being "merely an extension of the chi-square test" a good thing?
