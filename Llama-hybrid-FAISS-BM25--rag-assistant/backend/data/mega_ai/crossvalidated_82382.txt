Recovering true data from multiple noisy versions

I am trying to find if there is any way to get the true data from multiple noisy versions, but the true data has a peculiar property. Problem Statement Consider a matrix $F=[f_1, f_2, ... , f_n]$ where $f_i$ is 1984-dimensional . Now, each $f_i$ can be expressed as $f_i=H^i+n_i$. Here $H^i$ is the true (unknown) data and $n_i$ is the embedded noise. The peculiar property is that each $H^i$ has high correlation with each other (in other words, all $H^i$ are similar to each other). I want to build a filter or a vector which when multiplied with $f_i$, will give me $H^i$ or approximated $H^i$ i.e. noise should reduce. My thoughts I understand we should place some extra assumptions on the noise type, like Gaussian etc. In my case, I don't think my noise is Gaussian. Each feature vector $f_i$ basically represents an image patch. So, noise can be random, but I am open to modelling the noise as Gaussian and see what happens. I think a machine learning approach will work better. I had two thoughs: Learn a vector such that when multiplied with the data it should minimize $||w^Tf_i-w^Tf_{i+1}||$ should be minimized such that (say) $||w||\le1$. Add up a subset of $f_i$ so that by adding up different $n_i$, it will approach Gaussian (?) and I assume there are methods to recover data when noise is Gaussian. I am open to any other ideas as long as I get the desired result. You can edit tags if necessary.
