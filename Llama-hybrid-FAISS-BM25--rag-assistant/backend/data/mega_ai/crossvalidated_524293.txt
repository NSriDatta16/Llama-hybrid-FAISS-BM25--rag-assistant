What assumptions are required for structural breaks tests in time series?

Context I'm doing research related to structural change in stock price time series. In order to test whether some chosen event is a structural break or the series has a structural change, I conduct a few different tests which are Chow Test CUSUM Test SupF Test Bai Perron Test As the input model, the $AR(3)$ process is used (i.e. $price_{t} = \beta_1 \cdot price_{t-1} + \beta_2 \cdot price_{t-2} + \beta_3 \cdot price_{t-3} + \epsilon_t$ ). My concern is that the financial data is highly chaotic so the needed assumptions for the tests are violated. Question I wonder what the assumptions that make the structural breaks testing results valid are?
