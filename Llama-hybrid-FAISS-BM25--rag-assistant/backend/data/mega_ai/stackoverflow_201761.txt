Right now you'd have to add the separate automated tests download to do this, and only in the 3.1 branch, but it enables a "Show Translation" command through Ctrl+Shift+9. Beware that the translation generated isn't 100% the same as the server would create at runtime--it's not intended to be executed. Also, the most recent 3.0.3 builds contain fixes to the translator that should clear up these kinds of problems (NESTED variables + self-closing tags). 3.0.3 is due in November and should update cleanly into Ganymede SR1.
