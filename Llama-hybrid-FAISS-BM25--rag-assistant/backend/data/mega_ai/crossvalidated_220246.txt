Basic Hypothesis Testing

I'm having trouble with a basic hypothesis testing question that I just thought of. The question is the following: suppose you know that a certain lawnmower manufacturing company (called Company A) makes lawnmowers that run on average 300 minutes before running out of gas with a standard deviation of 30 minutes. Suppose you found a lawnmower and it only ran for 230 minutes before running out of gas. Did this lawnmower come from Company A? Would this be a valid way to approach this problem? First, construct the 95% confidence interval $(300 - 1.96 * 30, 300 + 1.96 * 30)$. Since 230 minutes lie outside this confidence interval, then we can say that at the 95% confidence level, we reject the null hypothesis that this lawnmower comes from Company A. Is that correct?
