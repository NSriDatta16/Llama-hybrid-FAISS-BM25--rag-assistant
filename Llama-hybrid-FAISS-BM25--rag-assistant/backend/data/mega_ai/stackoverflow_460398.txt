I had a friend who could do the Rubik's Cube in seconds. That made me think of this way of explaining to my manager why did our latest project FAIL! Olivier takes an average of 10 seconds to completely sort all colors of a 3x3 Rubik's Cube after looking at it for approximately 5 seconds. If you ask him to make an estimate of how long it will take to sort it, you give him the cube, start the clock and after 5 seconds he will say: "OK, as soon as I start I will be done in 10 seconds" you smile and say: "Start!" After 3 seconds you ask him to stop.. give him another Rubik's cube and say.. sort this one instead... 4 seconds after he starts the second Rubik's cube, how long do you think he will take to sort the first one again? If you answered 7 seconds approximately, congratulations: You're upper management material! (and Olivier would be rightly entitled to force you to eat the cubes)
