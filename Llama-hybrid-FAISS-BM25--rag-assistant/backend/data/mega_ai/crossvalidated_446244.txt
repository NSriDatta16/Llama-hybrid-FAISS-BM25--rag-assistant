Bayesian updating with correlated data

I’m looking for some readings on the topic of correlation between data used for Bayesian inversion. There are a lot of discussions about the correlations between the parameters being updated i.e. $\mathbf{x}$ , but I didn’t find much on the correlation between the data points, i.e. $\mathbf{y}$ . $$P(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{y}) \propto L(\mathbf{x})\times P(\mathbf{x})$$ The reason why I’m interested in that is because when working on health monitoring systems, multiple data sources are installed to establish the performance of a structural component. Now, this data is highly correlated. I think assuming the data points to be independent, we’re overestimating the information we gain from this data. I’d be glad if someone could point out some good readings on a similar topic.
