I found the problem I was having. I used fiddler to figure out the headers that were being sent via excel and compared those with the headers .net was sending http://www.fiddler2.com/Fiddler2/version.asp I had to add the following lines of code to add these two headers in order for it to work oHttpWebRequest.Headers.Add(HttpRequestHeader.Pragma, "no-cache") oHttpWebRequest.Headers.Add(HttpRequestHeader.AcceptLanguage, "en-us")
