First you have to define an XMLExportMap-Object for each Paragraph/Tag like this: .xmlExportMaps.add( , .name); (Rather consider that there is no whitespace in your Style-Names) When you defined all, then you call following method: .mapStylesToXMLTags(); As a result there should be a flat XML-structure in the Root-element then Then: There are some abilities to use Xpath with InDesign and Javascript, but in my opinion hard to use and very less implemented. So I appreciate to export the flat XML-Structure and apply an XSL-Stylesheet to get a deepened structure. Hope that helps
