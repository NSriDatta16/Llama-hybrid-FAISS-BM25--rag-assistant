Mounting afp as different user for php access

I've mounted an afp directory, afp://ServerName/Foo/, with "Finder->Go->Connect to Server" to /Volumes/Foo, now I'm trying to access it with: opendir("/Volumes/Foo/dirname/"); However, I get an Warning: opendir(/Volumes/Foo/dirname/) [function.opendir]: failed to open dir: Permission denied in... mount in terminal gives me: afp_1VqvPY000e413wKcJE13gANY-7.2d000004 on /Volumes/Foo (afpfs, nodev, nosuid, mounted by daniel) So I need to mount the folder as _www, or somehow allow _www to use my mount. How can I do either one of these? I'm guessing I want to possibly su to _www or something, but I don't know how to with terminal.
