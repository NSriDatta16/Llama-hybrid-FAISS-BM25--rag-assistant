Pay attention to specify an encoding everywhere and use UTF-8, then those "special" characters should survive just fine. But once they've gone through an encoding that can't represent them, the information which character it was originally is lost, so it can't be repaired (except for some specific though probably very common cases like switching between Cp1252 and ISO-8859-1).
