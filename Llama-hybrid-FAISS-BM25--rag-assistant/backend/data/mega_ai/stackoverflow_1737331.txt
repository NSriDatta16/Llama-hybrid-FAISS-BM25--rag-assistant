I assume you are confident in using linux and the language c (no hints for that, else don't start with developing a proxy) Read and understand the RFC 1945 HTTP/1.0 (pay attention to the specific mentioning of proxy) Determine what kind of proxy you want (web/caching/content-filter/anonymizer/transparent/non-transparent/reverse/gateway/tunnel/...) Start developing the server Basic steps Open port Listen on port Get all request sent from the client to that port (maybe make the whole thing multithreaded to be able to handle more than 1 request at a time) Determine if it is a valid HTTP 1.0 request Extract the request components Rebuild the request according to what type of proxy you are Send the new request Get the response Send response to client
