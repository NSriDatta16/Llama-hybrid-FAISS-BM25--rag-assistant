"To dynamically get the data I some times need to include a model twice, include an include in an include in an include, send information multiple times, connect with the database again, and all sort of things like that and I'm sure there is a better and prettier way to do this." I think you need a better 'design' for you MVC application. Multiple includes - i am guessing in the different layers of the MVC framework might be indicators that your design needs more attention. I'll try and be short: Other frameworks i.e. handle requests via XMLHTTPRequest by AMONG others, disabling or enabling the VIEW or LAYOUT explicitly - check Zend Framework - (e.g. you need to send a JSON encoded string as a response). These requests are handled just as any other request. I would suggest you have a look at other popular frameworks. Check the application design and layout, and pay attention on the Routing and Dispatching of Actions. I suggest you follow this path since as you say you lack experience. good luck with your project.
