In the 1968 games in Mexico City Bob Beamon shattered the world record in the long jump with a jump of 29 ft 2 inches topping a world record that was under 28 ft at the time. It took decades for any one to come close and finally break Beamon's record. What explains it? The high altitude meant thin air and less air resistence. Yet no one else went over 28 ft that day including Beamon on his other jumps. No one suggested that Beamon took performance enhancing drugs. It was a statistical outlier. Outliers happen. Statistical analysis won't explain it. But in your case it seems that you have taken a very sensible and pragmatic approach. You look at similar performers over the same time period for the same event and found many that improved their best times by more than what this chinese swimmer did. I think that supports the view that her accomplishment is not very unusual and should not be attributed to any external reason such as some form of doping which is what I imagine some people may have been intimidating.
