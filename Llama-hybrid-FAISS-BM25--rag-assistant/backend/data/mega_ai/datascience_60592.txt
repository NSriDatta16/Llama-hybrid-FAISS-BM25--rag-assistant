Choosing a set of CNNs for paper

There are so many CNNs out there and I am trying to do a comparison between some of them in my paper. Which networks should I include? Resnet, VGG, and Inception are obvious, but I would like three or four others. Which ones should I choose? There are so many variations out there like Xception, resnext, and ... that I am confused. Which of these networks are most used in the academic papers?
