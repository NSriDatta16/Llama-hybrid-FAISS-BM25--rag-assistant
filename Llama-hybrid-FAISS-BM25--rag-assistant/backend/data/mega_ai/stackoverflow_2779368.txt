Conditional rendering in ASP.NET

Having the following markup Is there an elegant way to render it conditionally without making li item a server element ( runat="server" ) ? Overriding Render() is not an option as well. p.s. This is a footer content to a list, but as far as i know there is no way to control FooterTemplate visibility neither in Repeater nor in ListView.
