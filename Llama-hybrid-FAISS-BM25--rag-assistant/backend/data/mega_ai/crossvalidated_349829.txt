From going through the slides you shared, it seems to me that the idea is to explain how MAP estimation can be used to estimate different properties of the posterior, such as mean, mode, and median. I will attempt to explain this in the context of General Bayesian Estimators as presented in Stephen M. Kay's book, Fundamentals of Statistical Signal Processing . Let's start by considering three types of Risk (i.e., cost functions) associated with estimating the parameter $\theta$ : $C(e) = e^2$ $C(e) = |e|$ $if -\delta ; else $C(e)=1$ where, $e = \theta - \hat{\theta}$ , in which $\hat{\theta}$ is the estimated value and $\theta$ is the true parameter. In Bayesian estimation, the objective is to minimize the expected risk, that is: $E[C(e)]= \int_X \int_{\theta} C(e)p(X,\theta)d\theta dX = \int_X \left[\int_\theta C(e)p(\theta|X)d\theta\right] p(X)dX$ since we only care about $\theta$ , we will focus on the inner integral $\min_{\theta}\int_\theta C(e)p(\theta|X)d\theta$ . Now, depending on which $C(e)$ we choose, the estimator will give us a different property of the posterior. For example, if we choose the first case, $C(e) = e^2$ , the minimizing $\theta$ for $\int_\theta C(e)p(\theta|X)d\theta$ , is the mean. Since you're question is with regards to the indicator function $I[\hat{\theta}\ne \theta]$ , I'll address the third risk mentioned above (which if you think about it for $\delta\rightarrow 0$ is equivalent to using the indicator). For Case 3 above: $\int_\theta C(e)p(\theta|X)d\theta = \int_{-\infty}^{\hat{\theta}-\delta}p(\theta|X)d\theta + \int_{\hat{\theta}+\delta}^{\infty}p(\theta|X)d\theta = 1 - \int_{\hat{\theta}+\delta}^{\hat{\theta}+\delta}p(\theta|X)d\theta$ which for $\delta \rightarrow 0$ is minimized when $\hat{\theta}$ corresponds to the mode of the posterior.
