I have a Galaxy Tab and have not experienced this behavior. Nor have I encountered this on any other Android device, and I have used quite a few for development purposes. From what I can tell, this state cannot be toggled via SDK applications, but only via the firmware. My guess is that there is something flaky in your setup that is triggering something in the Tab's firmware to do this. Sorry that I don't have a silver bullet for you. UPDATE Maybe it has to do with a USB Mass Storage message that pops up after 10 min or so? I just noticed a message "USB Connected: You have connected your phone to your computer via USB. Select Mount if you want to copy files between your computer and your phones SD card". That further suggests there is something strange going on between your development machine and the Tab. That should appear when you first plug in the cable, then remain there until you unplug the cable. I would not expect it to be toggling the USB debugging checkbox, but I am really starting to think you have one screwed-up Tab.
