There is no API call for this. The closest I could get was to run chrome.tabs.getAllInWindow in the beginning of a background page and then analyze returned tabs. chrome.tabs.getAllInWindow(null, function(tabs) { if(tabs.length == 1 && tabs[0].status == "loading") { console.log("possible home page:", tabs[0].url); } }); This would work most of the times, but if your extension will be enabled when current window happens to have 1 tab which is currently loading - it would return wrong url. So you need to implement check to at least not run this code during first extension installation (by using some localStorage flag).
