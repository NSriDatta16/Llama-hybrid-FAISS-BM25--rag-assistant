I have successfully used JavaScript InfoVis Toolkit to create a graph that looks very similar to that. As implied by the name, it is only Javascript and you can host it internally. Since it is very customizable, there is a bit of a learning curve to getting your data in the correct format and the interface the way you'd like. Look at this demo for a tree-like structure which could be used for an organization.
