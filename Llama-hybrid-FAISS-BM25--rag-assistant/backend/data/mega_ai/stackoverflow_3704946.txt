PHP - make a bunch of directories 0-z and sub directories 0-z from an array

$path-/home/acname/public_html/storage $array= (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,a,b, etc.. z);?? using mkdir(); ??? I want to make directories named 0-9 and a-z each with subdirectories in each one 0-z; eg: /home/acname/public_html/storage/0/0 all the way to /home/acname/public_html/storage/9/z and /home/acname/public_html/storage/a/0 all the way to /home/acname/public_html/storage/a/z continue until ~~~ /home/acname/public_html/storage/z/0 all the way to /home/acname/public_html/storage/z/z This will be a one timer I think but far faster than doing it via an ftp client. Figuring this out myself would take longer than the ftp client method! I will learn in the process too. Thanks in advance!
