In languages with garbage collection where variables are actual storage locations (as opposed to Python's labels), the NULL value is required to allow memory to be freed in a clean manner before the end of the variable's scope. Also, even many algorithms written in pseudo code make use of the special NULL value. It pops up literally everywhere. It is a central concept in computer science.
