How should I compare the original plot to the one against k-means (7 clusters) plot? What sort of information can I extract out of them? You can extract the information that the k-means results are garbage. If you look at your second figure, you will see that the clustering is based almost exclusively on the tsd variable: your 7 clusters are basically 7 ranges of tsd values. The reason this happens, is that tsd has largest numerical values. K-means operates on Euclidean distances and is highly sensitive to normalization. Having one variable that is on a much larger scale than all the others, can completely bias the clustering. I think we can safely conclude that this particular analysis is useless. Let me add that as you have the quality of each wine (your 7 "classes", which are in fact levels of an ordinal variable) explicitly available in your dataset, you should probably be doing some sort of regression (such as e.g. ordinal logistic regression ), and not clustering. I cannot see any possible value of trying to cluster this dataset.
