The "obj1" reference is not declared at all, as a result you get an error. Use the following syntax for such kind of check: var obj1 = obj1 || {}; By the way: if (typeof obj1==='undefined') obj1 = {}; does not help if obj1 == null. Don't declare global variables (without var). And I strongly recommend you to read the JavaScript: The Definitive Guide, 5th Edition. You may skip some chapters but pay your attention to Chapters 3, 7, 8, 9. They must be read and understood.
