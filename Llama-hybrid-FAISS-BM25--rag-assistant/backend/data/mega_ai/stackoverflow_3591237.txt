Typical rule of thumb for dividing pieces of code into seperate projects

I'm wondering when to divide code, and components of a project into a separate project. I'm creating a MVC .NET Web project, and there are many directories/sub-directories, and I haven't even started getting into some of the background processes that will take even more space. I'm just trying to work on organizing projects and the code-within. When should you start dividing your code into separate projects? Could you also provide an example? Thank You
