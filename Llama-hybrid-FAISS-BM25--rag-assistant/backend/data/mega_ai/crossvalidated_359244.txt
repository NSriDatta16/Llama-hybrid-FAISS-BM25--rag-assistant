The sum of squared loadings in PCA summing to 1

In PCA, we essentially create a new factor with the original variables in a linear combination manner such that: $Y_1 = a_{11} \times x_1 + a_{12} \times x_2 + a_{1p} \times x_p$. The sum of squared loadings of all variables (features) for each PC sum to 1. Therefore, is it safe to say that factor $i$ contributes the squared loading amount to the PC $j$?
