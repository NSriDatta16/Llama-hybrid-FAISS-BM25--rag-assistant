C++ boost date format

I have a vector string of dates in the from "dd-mmm-yyyy" so for example todays date would be: std::string today("07-Sep-2010"); I'd like to use the date class in boost but to create a date object the constructor for date needs to be called as follows: date test(2010,Sep,07); Is there any easy/elegant way of passing dates in the format "dd-mmm-yyyy"? My first thought was to use substr and then cast it? But I've read that there's also the possibility of using 'date facets'? Thanks!
