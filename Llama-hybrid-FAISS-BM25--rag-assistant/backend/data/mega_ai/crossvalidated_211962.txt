What's the relation between attractor network and long short term memory algorithm?

In this paper by Bengio on page 7 he used the attractor network to analyse recurrent network. And in this paper it says that attractor network dominates the field of memory control. What's more recurrent network features its memory ability compared to previous ones. so I'm wondering what kind of role does it play in the field of recurrent neural network or neural network nowadays? I raise this question because 1) I have asked some experts who told me they had never met this before and 2) in the popular deeplearning textbook by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio and etc, it is almost not mentioned (only a reference can be found).
