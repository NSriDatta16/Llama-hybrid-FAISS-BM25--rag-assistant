Well, I grossly overcomplicated the true issue by specifying the problem down to a specific element, when it turns out not even a simple test attribute on the ConfigurationSection would return an expected value. I also realized that I couldn't access AppSettings , which resulted in a raging clue. The ultimate cause? The project was compiled as a class library. Config files are only available at the application level . Since I was using NUnit to run the tests, the configuration file from the test project was overriding the development one for the class library. This is probably obvious to any developers who are not stuck in ASP.NET land. By adding the following configSection to the app.config within the test project: and filling in the corresponding section, the data could be accessed as expected. Hopefully, this will save someone hours of debugging.
