Questions about the application of PCA

I'm learning about PCA. In general, I understand the concept and the underlying math, but I'm confused about a few things that I'm hoping someone can explain. Lets say that after performing a PCA analysis on some high dimensional data I find that the first three components capture 99% of the variance in my data. Now what? Is it possible to find which features comprise the first, second, and third components? It seems that a common approach is to plot the principle components. For example, see this page under 2.3.1. Dimensionality Reduction and visualization for a PCA plot of the iris data. What is the interpretation of this plot? I see what I presume are two components: one component in red one component a mixture of green and blue? Is there a general "next step" to do after PCA. I understand the concept, but fail to see how it can be practically applied. Thanks for the help.
