what features can I get from the sample?

I have dataset of 100 000 words labeled by surname(is last name / not last name) Example: kitchen | 0 kennedy | 1 etc. I tried extract lenth of word, count of each letter and such simple features to build random forest classifier, but it didn't work. How to solve this task?
