Causality in times series is a very challenging topic and is not as simple as applying some filter or adding lags to justify causal statements. The most widely used and quite simple notation of causality in time series is Granger causality, see http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Granger_causality , which is close to what you wanted to do in the first place. There are some more sophisticated methods e.g. potential outcome approach extended to dependent data by [1], but if you are looking for something simple, I would rely on Granger. You could also test if $x$ forecasts $y$ out-of-sample, which could further improve your arguments. Refs [1] Bojinov, I., & Shephard, N. (2019).
