Changing a time's zone

I am using the gem metar-parser to parse a given weather report (a metar). The time is given in UTC, but once my object is returned from the gem it's time zone is +2 (for Denmark). I would like to change this to UTC but maintaining the hours. So I found this method module ActiveSupport class TimeWithZone def zone=(new_zone = ::Time.zone) # Reinitialize with the new zone and the local time initialize(nil, ::Time.__send__(:get_zone, new_zone), time) end end end It might not be the most elegant way of doing this. But the problem is, should I place this time_with_zone.rb file in /lib/ ? Anyway, I get a NoMethodError from zone= .
