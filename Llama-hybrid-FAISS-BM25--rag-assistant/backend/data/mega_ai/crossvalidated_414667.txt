FFBS algorithm for estimating mean log-return parameter in stochastic volatility jump model

I am currently attempting to replicate this model: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.01501.pdf in r. My (first) problem is regarding how to sample from conditional posterior for mu, $(μ_{(j)}|Y_n, J_{(j−1)}, λ_{(j−1)}, γ_{(j−1)})$ . I have come across this http://hedibert.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/stochasticvolatilitymodels-R.txt r-code, describing similar process. But i cannot understand how to modify this so that i can include jumps in returns as described in the above paper. The main problem is that i do not understand how to practically execute a FFBS algorithm properly with regards to what the variables in the algorithm do. Could someone atleast try to point me in the right direction? thanks
