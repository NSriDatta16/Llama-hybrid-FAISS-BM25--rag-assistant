R mtcars dataset - linear regression of MPG in Auto and Manual transmission mode

I was looking at the mtcars dataset and exploring the relationship between MPG and the transmission modes (auto/manual). I decided to use the following linear models with the regressors specified in the below R code: > data(mtcars) > fit round(summary(fit)$coeff, 4) Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 18.8979 0.7194 26.2707 0.0000 I(wt - mean(wt)) -3.9165 0.7112 -5.5069 0.0000 I(qsec - mean(qsec)) 1.2259 0.2887 4.2467 0.0002 factor(am)1 2.9358 1.4109 2.0808 0.0467 From the above, the P-value of the slope coefficient "factor(am)1" is lower than 0.05 and hence we'd reject the null hypothesis and infer that cars of manual transmission has higher MPG value than those of manual transmission. However, I also tried to explore the equivalent linear model without intercept terms, as per R code below: > fit2 round(summary(fit2)$coeff, 4) Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) I(wt - mean(wt)) -3.9165 0.7112 -5.5069 0e+00 I(qsec - mean(qsec)) 1.2259 0.2887 4.2467 2e-04 factor(am)0 18.8979 0.7194 26.2707 0e+00 factor(am)1 21.8338 0.9438 23.1344 0e+00 > confint(fit2) 2.5 % 97.5 % I(wt - mean(wt)) -5.3733342 -2.459673 I(qsec - mean(qsec)) 0.6345732 1.817199 factor(am)0 17.4244109 20.371471 factor(am)1 19.9005360 23.767021 From the 95% Confidence Interval constructed, a car (of auto transmission) with average wt and qsec has a MPG interval [17.4244, 20.3714], while a car (of manual transmission) with average wt and qsec has a MPG interval [19.9005. 23.7670]. The two Confidence Intervals overlap, and we failed to reject the null hypothesis where statistically there's no difference between the MPG performance of cars (with auto transmission) and MPG performance of cars (with manual transmission). I used two equivalent linear models and they gave me different conclusions. Could you enlighten me on what I may have missed here?
