What optimizations are OK to do right away?

One of the most common mantras in computer science and programming is to never optimize prematurely, meaning that you should not optimize anything until a problem has been identified, since code readability/maintainability is likely to suffer. However, sometimes you might know that a particular way of doing things will perform poorly. When is it OK to optimize before identifying a problem? What sorts of optimizations are allowable right from the beginning? For example, using as few DB connections as possible, and paying close attention to that while developing, rather than using a new connection as needed and worrying about the performance cost later
