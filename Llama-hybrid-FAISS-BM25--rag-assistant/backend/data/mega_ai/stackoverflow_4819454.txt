When $(id) returns an empty jQuery object, then ".offset()" will return null . You're calling that "highlightSelected" code with the "href" value from something, so perhaps what you think to be an "id" value that corresponds to something on the page, well it really doesn't. It's hard to know for sure, however, because you did not post any of the relevant HTML, nor did you even show where "showParagraphs()" is called!
