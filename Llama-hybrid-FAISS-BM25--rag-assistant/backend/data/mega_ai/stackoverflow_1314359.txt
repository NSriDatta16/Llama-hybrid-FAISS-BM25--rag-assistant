How to disable binding of the route values in ASP.NET MVC?

As I know ValueProviderDictionary takes values for binding from 3 places From Post form From Route values From Query string I want to be able to disable the second and the third options. The only solution I see here is to create my own custom ValueProvider (copy-paste ValueProviderDictionary source file and remove these two options from there). Is this solution correct? Are there any more elegant alternatives? (If the solution with a custom ValueProvider is correct where it should be initialized? In a Controller's action method or in a custom ModelBinder?) Thank you
