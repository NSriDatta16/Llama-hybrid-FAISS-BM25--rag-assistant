Radical idea - Don't put the image in the context-sensitive help at all - create an animation that draws a moving arrow from your context-sensitive help directly to the control in question. Make it generic so you can pass the two control IDs between which the arrow should move, and then have the animation repeat until the user clicks the button or otherwise clicks away from the help screen. Other options include making the button/UI element in question glow subtly to draw attention to it - slightly less direct but would also probably work. Implementation is left as an exercise for the poster.
