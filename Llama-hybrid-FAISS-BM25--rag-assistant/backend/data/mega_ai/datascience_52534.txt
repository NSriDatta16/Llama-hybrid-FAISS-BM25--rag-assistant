Blockquote 1) Why I am getting OOM error on the large batch size although my dataset and model are not that big? Yes, the batch size is probably the reason. Also, another the reason is that you don't use the second GPU at all (otherwise, both GPUs will split the batch - computation - and you could use larger batches). No, the size of the batch is not the reason of yout OOM error if you use image $64\times 64$ and batch of $32$ the memory cost on GPU is: $32\cdot 32\cdot 3$ (size of image if in color) $\cdot 32$ (size of batch) $\cdot 32$ (bits for a float32) bits $ \approx 3MB$ The problem is certainly due to the size of your neural network. A GAN need to load the discriminator and the generator on the gpu when he train the generator. You should calculate the size of both the discriminator and generator and add them to see if your GPU can load it
