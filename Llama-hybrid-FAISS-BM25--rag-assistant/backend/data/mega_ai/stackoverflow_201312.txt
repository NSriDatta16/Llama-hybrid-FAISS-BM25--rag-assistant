escaping formatting characters in java String.format

This question is pretty much the same as this .Net question exept for java. How do you escape the %1$ characters in a java String.format ? THe reason I need to do this is that I'm building up a string that will later have more info inserted into it. I've thought of having one of the args just be "%1$" but that doesn't seem to be very elegant? sorry if this is obvious my java is a tad rusty.
