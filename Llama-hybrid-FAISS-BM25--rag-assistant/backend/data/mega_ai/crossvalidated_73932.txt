If the form of the kernel is known (many real applications use an RBF kernel for example) , it is possible, given a set of observations $(x_t, y_t)$ to estimate its hyperparameters (the length-scale for RBF) via maximisation of the marginal likelihood . You should take a look on Chapter 5 of Gaussian Process for Machine Learning. You will find an example of MATLAB code in the gpml documentation , in the paragraph of section "Regression" starting by "Typically, we would not a priori know the values of the hyperparameters..."
