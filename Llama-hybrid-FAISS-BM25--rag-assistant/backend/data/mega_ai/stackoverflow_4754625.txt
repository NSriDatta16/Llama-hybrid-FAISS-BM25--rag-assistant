Hey - I'll answer the first question in your post regarding the error you are receiving. When you run a DTS package manually, it runs under your context using your permissions. When run as a scheduled job, the package runs under the context of the job agent, in this case SQL Server agent. It appears that the agent is lacking permissions that you have in attempting to complete the operation. Since the error is mentioning the DBF file, I'd start there. Check any permissions for the file itself or whether the context is being passed properly.
