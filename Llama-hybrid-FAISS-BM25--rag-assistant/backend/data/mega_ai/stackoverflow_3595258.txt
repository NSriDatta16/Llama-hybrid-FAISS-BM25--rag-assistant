I found a way to execute this - it wasn't elegant but it did work - and so far seems to be the only way to get this to work. Git uses the HOME path to determine where .gitconfig is. I was able to perform something like this: /home/marco/.silly/.gitconfig /home/marco/.stupid/.gitconfig /home/marco/.gitconfig And when executing Git Commit (which is the only command that requires the .gitconfig ) I override the home path. HOME=/home/marco/.silly/ git commit -m "silly configuration" You can then use alias to do this easily alias sillygit="HOME=/home/marco/.silly/ git" sillygit commit -m "silly stuff"
