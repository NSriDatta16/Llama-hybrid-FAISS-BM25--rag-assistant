After the first sample, half the population will be unsampled. Looking at that set of unsampled members, on average half of them will not be sampled in the second iteration, leaving one fourth of the total population unsampled (one half of the one half). After n samples, (1/2) n of the population will remain unsampled. There will be some random variation in this number, but it will be on the order of the square root of the population size, which is this case gives ~50,000. So if you're okay with 1/k of the population not being sampled, then once 2 n is significantly larger than k, you'll almost certainly have sampled your minimum. For instance, suppose you want 99% to be sampled. In other words, you're okay with 1 out of 100 being unsampled. Then since 2 7 = 128 > 100, taking 7 samples will be enough almost all of the time.
