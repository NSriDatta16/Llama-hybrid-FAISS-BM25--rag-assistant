Why are these styles not visible in IE6 To be short, because it's IE6! Can the box have a fixed height? If yes, a possible solution would be to set a fixed size to upSubPop element. For example, if you add: div#upSubPop{background:red;height:500px;} to your stylesheet, the blue borders are displayed correctly in IE6. Another workaround would be to set the height of to 1 pixel. In this case, IE6 displays the element with appropriate height based on contents (so you will see the whole "Me afecta que digan que soy incapaz." message. The problem is that the real browsers as FF will then display everything incorrectly (to be more precise, the message will overlap the bottom border). So in this case, you can use conditional CSS to ensure that your message block is displayed as required both in real browsers and in IE6.
