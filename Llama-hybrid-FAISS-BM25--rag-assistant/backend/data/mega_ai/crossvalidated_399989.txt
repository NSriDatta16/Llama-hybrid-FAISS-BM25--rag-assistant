I do not know whether I have to incorporate the random slope component in the conditional part only or also in the ziformula. This is also a "theoretical" question. If it makes more sense that Industry predicts whether your outcome is zero or not, maybe it's better to use a "parsimonious" zi-part, namely w/o random effects. But your model formula in general (cross-level interaction) looks correct. If I run this code, I get strange results - namely a negative effect of CSRCom in the conditional part indicating a lower NoL when posting about CSR (contrary to expectation). Have you just looked at the coefficient of the main effect? In presence of interaction, you can't interprete main effects w/o the effect of the interaction. An easy way to see the "real" effect are marginal effects plots. You can use the ggeffects-package , especially for glmmTMB- and GLMMadaptive-models with zero-inflation (because here the confidence intervals for marginal effects need some special attention, see this vignette ). In addition, when I add the random slope component, the standard errors explode. There is something problematic here. I'm not sure, but this might be because you have a factor (and with only two levels) as random slope. Maybe, but this is something I'm just guessing, not knowing, it's because in such cases more variance-covariance need to be estimated compared to scalar random effect vectors (see http://www.stat.wisc.edu/~bates/UseR2008/WorkshopD.pdf , slide 95).
