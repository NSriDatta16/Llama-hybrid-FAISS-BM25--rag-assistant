I suggest that you try the first principal component of the correlation matrix. In R that would be prcomp(data, scale. = TRUE)$x[,1] Because of the argument scale.=TRUE , R will use the correlation matrix. This is similar to normalizing each column (by subtracting its average and dividing by its standard deviation, see Standard Score ) and summing them, but principal components will make another linear combination of the columns such that it reflects the strongest correlation pattern. This method is often used for dimension reduction and if one feels that too much information is thrown away, one can consider also the second, third or next principal components. There is no guarantee that this score will be a meaningful indicator of cancer, so there has to be something extra that shows that this is a good gene score. If the first principal component turns out to not seem very useful, I suggest that you could try normalize every column with the Standard Score and sum them try other dimension reduction techniques If you had a target that you wanted this gene score to predict, you could obtain a gene score by using the predicted values of a regression. Perhaps the variable CancerAssociation could be general enough for this.
