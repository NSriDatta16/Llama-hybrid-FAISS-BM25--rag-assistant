Disregard the naysayers. If you want to have full control over your content, put the files in a blob field in the database. I generally also keep the filename in a separate field, so I can reconstruct the file as necessary (that way you keep the extension, which ties it to a file type in most operating systems). Be sure to store the actual blob data in a separate table, only connected to your filename / extra info table via an id ... that way you don't sacrifice any performance when dealing with any information related to the file other than the content itself. What the naysayers fail to realize, is that databases are simply an extremely optimized form of file system. Bytes are bytes and disc sectors are disc sectors. Databases are simply much better at organizing and searching those bytes than file systems are. Not to mention, databases implement much more stringent security than most file systems and are better maintained (with backups, support staff etc.).
