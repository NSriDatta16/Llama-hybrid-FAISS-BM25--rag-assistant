C# equivalent of std::sort and std::unique

I have a list of integers in C#. I wish to remove duplicates. In C++ I would run it through the std::sort and then std::unique algorithms for a very efficient way of obtaining the unique list. What's the best way to do the same thing in C#? In other words, I'm looking for a more elegant way to do the following code: private static int[] unique(int[] ids) { IDictionary d = new Dictionary (); foreach(int i in ids) d[i] = null; int[] results = new int[d.Count]; int j = 0; foreach(int id in d.Keys) results[j++] = id; return results; }
