Java Runtime Environment getting "fatal error SIGSEGV" for program using JOGL

I am trying to run a Java program through Eclipse. Whenever I try and run the thing, this is what I get: Info: XInitThreads() called for concurrent Thread support # # A fatal error has been detected by the Java Runtime Environment: # # SIGSEGV (0xb) at pc=0x000010f1, pid=2750, tid=1923033968 # # JRE version: 6.0_22-b04 # Java VM: Java HotSpot(TM) Server VM (17.1-b03 mixed mode linux-x86 ) # Problematic frame: # C 0x000010f1 # # An error report file with more information is saved as: # /home/anjruu/ragamuffin/trunk/pipeline/hs_err_pid2750.log # # If you would like to submit a bug report, please visit: # http://java.sun.com/webapps/bugreport/crash.jsp I am not getting any build errors, and have tried it using both the Java 6 OpenJDK, as well as Sun's jdk1.6.0_22, both behave the same. I am running an Ubuntu 10.10 system. The program uses JOGL (Java OpenGL), is that relevant? The log file is about 400 lines long, so I figure that maybe posting the entire thing isn't so useful, and I'm not sure what sections would be, but if someone can let me know what I should include, I can do so.
