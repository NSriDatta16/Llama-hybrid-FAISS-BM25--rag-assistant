Need some help with my XML Schema

I'm using Qt C++ and am reading in an XML file for data. I want to ensure the XML file contains valid elements, so I began to write an XML Schema to validate against (Qt doesn't support validating against a DTD). The problem is, I'm not sure if my Schema itself is valid, and I can't seem to find an actual XSD validator. I tried using the official w3c validator at http://www.w3.org/2001/03/webdata/xsv , but it's giving me blank output. Would anyone know of a decent XSD validator, or perhaps be willing to look over the following manually? Please let me know what you think, I appreciate it!
