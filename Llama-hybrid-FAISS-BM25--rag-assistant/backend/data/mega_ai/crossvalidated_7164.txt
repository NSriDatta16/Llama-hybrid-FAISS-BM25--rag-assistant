Change of variable with non bijective function

I have a logistic regression model: $softmax(WX)$ where $W$ is my parameter matrix and $X$ is my input. I want a density function over the outputs of that model. Say I know that my $X$ are distributed according to some density $p$. From the change of variables I know that the density of the outputs will be something like $p'(x) = p(x) det|J^{-1}|$ where $J = \frac{\partial{softmax(WX)}}{\partial{X}}$. However, this holds only for a bijective function $softmax(WX)$. What can I do if this is not the case - especially if $W$ is not square?
