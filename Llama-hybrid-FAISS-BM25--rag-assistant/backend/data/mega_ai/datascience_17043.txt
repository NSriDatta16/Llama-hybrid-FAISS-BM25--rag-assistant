XgBoost error: contrasts can be applied only to factors with 2 or more levels

Error in XGBoost: Error in contrasts No error occurs after changing to -1 but the dgcMatrix that is generated looks suspicious as it contains just one column and lot of rows. I was expecting the columns of the original matrix to be one-hot encoded rather than getting one columns as an output. If i proceed further ignoring the inspection of generated sparse matrix then I get an error after i run the xgboost below: Error in xgb.iter.update(bst$handle, dtrain, iteration - 1, obj) : [05:14:55] amalgamation/../src/objective/regression_obj.cc:108: label must be in [0,1] for logistic regression dtrain I tried to convert the target column to both factor and numeric (converted it to 0 & 1, since as.numeric converts it to 1 & 2). But it did not help :'( When I convert the target to numeric then after running the Xgboost, I get the following error : Error in xgb.iter.update(bst$handle, dtrain, iteration - 1, obj) : [05:20:12] amalgamation/../src/tree/updater_colmaker.cc:162: Check failed: (n) > (0) colsample_bytree=0.6 is too small that no feature can be included *t1 is a data.frame initially containing factor,numeric and integers which i am converting to sparse matrix Thanks for the help!
