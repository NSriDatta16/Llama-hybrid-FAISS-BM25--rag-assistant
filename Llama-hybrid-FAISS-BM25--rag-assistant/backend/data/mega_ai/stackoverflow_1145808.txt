Both SAX and StAX parsers are free to break up the strings in whatever way is convenient for them (although StAX has a COALESCE mode for forcing it to assemble the pieces for you). The reason is that it is often possible to write software in certain cases that streams and doesn't have to care about the overhead of reassembling the string fragments. Usually I accumulate text in a variable, and use the contents when I see the next StartElement or EndElement event. At that point, I also reset the accumulated-text variable to empty.
