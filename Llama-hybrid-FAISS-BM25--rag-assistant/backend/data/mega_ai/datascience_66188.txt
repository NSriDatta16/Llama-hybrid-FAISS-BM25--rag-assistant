How to plot number of Trees and OOBs score with Grid Search

I searched to find the answer but I don´t find something with Grid Search. I create a random forest and gradient boosting regressor with grid search. Now I want to make a visualization to see if the number of trees is alright. # Grid-Search erstellen auf der Basis eineer Random Search param_grid = { 'bootstrap': [True], 'max_depth': [50, None], 'max_features': ['auto', 50], 'min_samples_leaf': [5], 'min_samples_split': [2], 'n_estimators': [100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350] } # Base-Model zum Verbessern erstellen rf_v1 = RandomForestRegressor(random_state=42) # Grid-Search initisieren rf_grid_search_v1 = GridSearchCV(estimator = rf_v1, param_grid = param_grid, scoring = 'neg_mean_absolute_error', cv = 3, n_jobs = -1, verbose = 2) # Die Grid-Search für das Model durchführen rf_grid_search_v1.fit(X_train_v1, y_train_v1) But how to plot the splits of trees with gridsearch? Is there any way to make an RF/xgb trees split visualization? I am really grateful if anybody has a tip for me.
