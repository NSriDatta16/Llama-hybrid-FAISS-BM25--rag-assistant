How to progress with feature maps

The amount of half-baked material on cnn-topics is staggering. At the moment i struggle with how to progress with the extracted feature maps of an image. Lets say i have 3 of them, extracted from a 32x32 image. The next step is to apply kernels to them, too. Do i use the same kernels i used on the original image? If not, am i generating new kernels and apply them to every feature map? Or do i use completely different kernels for each individual feature map?
