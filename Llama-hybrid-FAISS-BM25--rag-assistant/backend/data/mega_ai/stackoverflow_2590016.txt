Configuring Displays for Different Mobile Devices

Does anyone know a way to have specific CSS style sheets based on the type of Mobile Device? I have been researching it a few days now and haven't found anything except this snippet of code for iPhones. This works great for iPhones, but on all other mobile devices (android, blackberry, Nokia), it's still displaying the same as my site. I tried: but that didn't seem to have any effect on the other mobile devices. So I'm not sure how to reach the blackberry's/androids/nokia's without effect the code of my actual site. I'm building my site using the PHP framework CodeIgniter and I looked into this code which is suppose to be able to tell if it is being looked at through a mobile device or browser. if ($this->agent->is_browser()) { $agent = $this->agent->browser().' '.$this->agent->version(); } elseif ($this->agent->is_mobile()) { $agent = $this->agent->mobile(); } else { $agent = 'Unidentified User Agent'; } The only problem is that the newer phones we are building on render the site as a browser and not as a mobile (I think, I've only tested the iphone because it's all I have at the moment). So does anyone have any work arounds for the other phone platforms?
