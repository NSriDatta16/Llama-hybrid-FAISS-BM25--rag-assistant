Finding the usage percent to perform predictive analysis for new users

Problem Statement- I have to find the average feature usage all the users and the usage of user X to suggest if he should use the feature. Example - On google home page out of all the user's avg 85% of times uses the search button. If a user X comes on the home page and based on his activity we calculate that if only 35% of the time he click on the search button. We want to notify him about the benefits of the search button. Data We have- User | Landed on home page | used search button 1 1000 100 2 100 10 3 1 1 4 10 10 5 10000 1 Issues- How to eliminate user 5 as this is exceptionally making the data skewed. Median might be a solution for the use case. Is there any better suggestion? How to find the Average usage, I mean 1/1 (User 3) and 10/10 (User 4) are not the same i.e. 10/10 (User 4) should have more value than 1/1 (User 3) If these users(USER 1-5) stopped coming on the home page from 1 month, still the usage average would be the same- which is wrong. Since it was getting used earlier but not recently so the usage average should get decayed. So my question in addition to above is that, am I approaching in the right direction? Is there any build-in algorithm or tool available for the problem statement? Any new approach is most welcome.
