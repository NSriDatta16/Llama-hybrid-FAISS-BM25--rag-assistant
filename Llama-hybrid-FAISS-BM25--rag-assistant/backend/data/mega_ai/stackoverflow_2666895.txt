Beginner's guide for rails

Hello friends i need a book/ tutorials for rails without using scoffold. All the books mentioned in the other questions are creating some depot application or etc using scaffold and then explaining things. I believe in the thing that creating big depot is worthless when you are not getting anything. All of my frnds are suggesting me to go for this pragmatic book . look i understand the book is good but i m not getting the proper things. I got the logic cause i m good in php doctrine. asp.net c c++ so i m getting the things but i m not feeling confident. I want to have a another book. Can anybody suggest me some other books. I m saying this cause it really feels good when u create a simple form and insert the values in db and u can retreive those values and MOST IMP you can explain the whole logic of the that small form application instaed of that colorfull Depot application in which things are done with scaffold and u r not getting the thing and u are confused abt the real picture.
