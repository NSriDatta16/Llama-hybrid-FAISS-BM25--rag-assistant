In 99% of the cases the answer is NOT to implement any timeout logic. Timeout logic is in nearly any situation a red warning sign that something else is wrong and should be fixed instead . Is your process hanging or breaking after n seconds sometimes? Then find out why and fix that instead. As an aside, to do strager's solution right, you need to use wait "$SPID" instead of fg 1, since in scripts you don't have job control (and trying to turn it on is stupid). Moreover, fg 1 relies on the fact that you didn't start any other jobs previously in the script which is a bad assumption to make.
