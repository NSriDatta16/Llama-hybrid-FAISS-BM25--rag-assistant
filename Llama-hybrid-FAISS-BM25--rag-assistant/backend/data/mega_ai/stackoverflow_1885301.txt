To really understand the performance of your system, you'll have to profile it. But Python is a language that encourages using exceptions like this, so they don't have an unusual overhead as they do in some other languages. For example, sometimes people debate this choice: if hasattr(obj, "attr"): use(obj.attr) else: some_other(obj) or: try: use(obj.attr) except AttributeError: some_other(obj) The people who say you should use the first to avoid the exception need to understand that internally, hasattr is implemented by accessing the attribute and returning False if an AttributeError is raised. So in fact, both code chunks use exceptions.
