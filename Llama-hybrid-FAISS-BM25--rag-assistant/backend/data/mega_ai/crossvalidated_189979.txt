Encoding assumptions about the data isn't quite the role of the prior distribution in a Bayesian model. The prior does not reflect any assumptions about the data: It mathematically captures any assumptions the analyst makes about model parameters before observing the data . The posterior distribution reflects both the prior and observed data. Take this quote from your question: This means $x^Tw$ has mean zero, so $f(x)$ is zero. Why would you want to have a model with mean zero? You want to predict $y$ ! Unless we are assuming the data $y$ has mean zero, otherwise, this doesn't make sense to me. That $f(x)=0$ is only true using the prior distribution for $w$ . It will not be true if one uses the posterior distribution for $w$ . Whether a zero-mean prior accurately encodes your assumptions is another story; but whatever assumptions it does capture do not apply to the data.
