Is 2-sigma limit applicable as a measure of variance to a distribution?

There is a paper that uses something like the 2-sigma limit to check if a quantity is more-or-less constant. More specifically in this paper on Text Detection (Sec. 3.2 3rd para last line) this limit is used to check for constant stroke width i.e. something like if mean > 2*sigma. This relation is not explicitly stated in the paper (it writes about a paragraph to the same effect), so I tested it on text and works reasonably well in discriminating between text/non-text on the basis of constant stroke-width. The question is - why is the 2*sigma limit applicable as a measure of a quantity's constant nature? And in case this limit is satisfied, what conclusions can be drawn? Also interested in mathematically proving what is obtained from experimental results. Basically I am searching for a proper background on the 2-sigma limit: this one isn't so helpful.
