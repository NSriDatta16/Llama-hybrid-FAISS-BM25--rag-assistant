Unfortunately, Apple has not given iPhone developers the capability to add the kind of label you're looking for in Settings.app. As a near approximation, I've used PSGroupSpecifier under another setting element (such as PSToggleSwitchSpecifier ). It's not as elegant as a true label, but it worked well enough in my situation (I only had one setting, so it didn't conflict with any other group headings). alt text http://pseudorandomengineer.com/images/6.png
