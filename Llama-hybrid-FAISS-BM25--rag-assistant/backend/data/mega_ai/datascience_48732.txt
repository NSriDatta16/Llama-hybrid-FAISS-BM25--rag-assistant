In my opinion, start with: Coursera's Andrew Ng's classes Machine Learning (very good for the maths) then go to his deep learning class (I haven't done it but I only hear good things from it) Udacity had a very good Data Science Specialisation divided in 4 classes. I don't know if it's still available (I did it two years ago) but it is probably either still there or an improved version has replaced it. The 4 courses where: Intro to Data science Visualisation Machine Learning Text Mining For the rest, I suggest you to do a quick google search...
