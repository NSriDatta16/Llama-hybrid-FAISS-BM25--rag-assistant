Question concerning Covid infection data reported by the media

I tried searching StackExchange for existing posts about this, but I could not find them. Please redirect me if appropriate. My question is very simple, and perhaps partly related to the observations made by several users in this post . Let me explain the origin of my doubt, in two points. I am assuming that the most important population parameter for public health measures related Covid is the prevalence, i.e. the percentage of infected people in a given place. The higher the number of infected people you are likely find in a group of $N$ interacting people, the higher the risk that the infection is transmitted. This would explain why people who are known to be infected are subjected to quarantine in many countries, and why meetings in large groups are discouraged or even forbidden. As far as I can tell - and it seems confirmed by the post I linked above - you cannot estimate with any accuracy the prevalence of infections in a population if you take a biased sample. So here is why I find media reports so far very puzzling: they always talk about absolute numbers of confirmed cases of infection, rather than prevalence, and always without any attempt to correct for bias, although the average number of tests per day has increased enormously since March, and the groups of people being tested are carefully selected by the authorities, thus highly biased. A friend of mine, who knows a doctor working in a Covid ward, told me that he had exactly the same reaction to these data continuously being propagated by the media. How can you possibly consider a sentence like 'an extra 100 cases of infection were recorded in the last 24 hours' to mean the same thing, regardless of whether it is based on 10000 tests run on a fairly random population, or instead on 100000 tests run on people coming back from high risk countries? To be even more explicit and concrete, if I wanted to know how 'risky' it is to be in an enclosed situation with 100 people (picked randomly) from the population of a city or town, I would have to estimate how many of these 100 people are likely to be infected - and for this I need the prevalence. How are the figures given by the media of any relevance to this, considering that they are based on absolute numbers obtained from a biased population? There are some websites (sometimes even official government ones) where the number of infections, e.g. per 100000 people, is reported, often subdivided by geographical or administrative criteria. Do you think this is the 'real' prevalence, or is it still based on the biased evidence we seem to have? Do you know of any source of more reliable figures that could be consulted? I can only hope that the public health protection measures being enforced by various governments are based on real science and on correct data analysis, because frankly the impression one gets from the media is one of confusion, misrepresentation of reality, miscommunication, quite suspiciously as if the actual goal was to create fear, panic and uncertainty and leave people bamboozled into submission to anything that the governments will decide next, regardless of the facts. I am following the news from a few different European countries, and I can tell you, one day infections were 'up', the next 'down', then 'up' again, for weeks and weeks... Of course! Oscillations are expected, given the way they do tests. Don't you think that continuously switching between 'good' and 'bad' news is like providing no information at all, but just stupid chaos, in the eyes of the non-expert? And in practice, given that the authorities test 'high risk' people and quarantine them if they are found to be positive, even if one had the 'real' prevalence, the number of infected people one is likely to meet in a given group is probably lower than the one that could be estimated from it. So I am even less confident that any of what we are being fed by the media has any link to what is really relevant for the control of this infection. Sorry, maybe I am not making sense, and in that case I would be glad if someone set the record straight and corrected me. Otherwise, it would be interesting to know where we are going with all this, and why science isn't more prominently contributing at least to the correct representation of the facts.
