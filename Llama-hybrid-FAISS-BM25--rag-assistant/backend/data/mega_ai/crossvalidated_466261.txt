perquisites of the Chi-square test of independence

I want to use the Chi-square test of independence to test the following two variables: Student knowledge v.s. course attendance The null hypothesis is: student knowledge and course attendance (X and Y) are independent Members in each student knowledge group: Low (12), average(29), high(9) The results show that there are two degrees of freedom, the chi-square statistic is 0.20, and the p-value is 0.90, and we cannot accept the null hypothesis. I have little doubts regarding the following two issues: the student knowledge groups have an unequal number of participants, the number of participated students in each course is fewer than 10. My question is: does this test fit for my data? In case, this test cannot be used for my data, what statistical test I should use instead?
