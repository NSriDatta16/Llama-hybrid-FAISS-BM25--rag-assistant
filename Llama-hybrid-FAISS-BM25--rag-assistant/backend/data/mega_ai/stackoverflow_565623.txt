Early on, the best practice to get Zend to respond to ajax requests without the full layout was to check a variable made available via request headers. According to the documentation many client side libraries including jQuery, Prototype, Yahoo UI, MockiKit all send the the right header for this to work. if($this->_request->isXmlHttpRequest()) { //The request was made with via ajax } However, modern practice, and what you're likely looking for, is now to use one of two new helpers: ContextSwitcher AjaxContent Which make the process considerably more elegant. class CommentController extends Zend_Controller_Action { public function init() { $ajaxContext = $this->_helper->getHelper('AjaxContext'); $ajaxContext->addActionContext('view', 'html') ->initContext(); } public function viewAction() { // Pull a single comment to view. // When AjaxContext detected, uses the comment/view.ajax.phtml // view script. } Please Note: This modern approach requires that you request a format in order for the context to be triggered. It's not made very obvious in the documentation and is somewhat confusing when you end up just getting strange results in the browser. /url/path?format=html Hopefully there's a workaround we can discover. Check out the full documentation for more details.
