I've used Hydra myself for a Delphi only solution (i.e., didn't interface to .NET) and it works great for that too. It's easier to use and adds some niceties, but I think that it's basically implemented the same way as the "roll-your-own" plugin framework that is well-described in this article: http://www.saxon.co.uk/SinglePkg/ I would look for a plugin framework that's interface-based (like Hydra and the "roll-your-own" system in above paragraph), rather than one that simply sends messages between apps. There is a Delphi plugin framework on sourceforge, don't know whether it's the same one as in JEDI project or not: http://sourceforge.net/projects/rd-dpf There are also a couple of other commercial solutions, one of which is Dragonsoft's: http://www.dragonsoft.us/products_dsps.php
