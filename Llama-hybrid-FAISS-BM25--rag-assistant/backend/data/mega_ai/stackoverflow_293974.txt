You usually do not want the constructor to do any computation. Someone else using the code will not expect that it does more than basic set-up. For a directory tree like you're talking about, the "elegant" solution is probably not to build a full tree when the object is constructed. Instead, build it on demand. Someone using your object may not really care what is in sub-directories, so start out by just having your constructor list the first level, and then if someone wants to descend into a specific directory, then build that portion of the tree when they request it.
