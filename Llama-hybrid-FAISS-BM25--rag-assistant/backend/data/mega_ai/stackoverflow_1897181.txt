Closing a secondary delphi form causes the main form to lose focus

When showing a secondary form from the main form and from the second form showing a third form and then closing both forms will cause the main form to lose focus. Using Delphi 2009 with XP SP3 Here are my steps for reproducing the problem: Create a new VCL forms applications Drag a button onto the created form In the click handler create a new TForm1 and show it Run the program. Click the button to show a second form. Click the button on the second form to create a third form. When closing both new forms the main form will lose its focus. This is my code in the button click event handler: // Using Self does not change the results with TForm1.Create(nil) do show; Is there any way to stop my main form from losing focus?
