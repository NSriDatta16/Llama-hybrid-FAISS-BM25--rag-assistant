Just to muddy the waters further, in climatology anomaly just implies the difference between value and mean, or a deviation: The term temperature anomaly means a departure from a reference value or long-term average. A positive anomaly indicates that the observed temperature was warmer than the reference value, while a negative anomaly indicates that the observed temperature was cooler than the reference value. see e.g. That may well be regarded as outside machine learning, but people interested in the question may be interested in this.
