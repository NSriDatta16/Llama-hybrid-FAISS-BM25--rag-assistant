I prefer fine-grained, very organized, self contained, structured repositories. There is a diagram illustrating general (ideal) approach of repository maintenance process. For example, my initial structure of repository (every project repository should have) is: /project /trunk /tags /builds /PA /A /B /releases /AR /BR /RC /ST /branches /experimental /maintenance /versions /platforms /releases
