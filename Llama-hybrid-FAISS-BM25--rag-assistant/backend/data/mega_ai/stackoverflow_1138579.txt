Binding of repeater not showing anything after getting 2nd set of products

My Page_Load calls the following: pnlProductWrapper.Visible = true; pnlList2Column.Visible = true; rptList2Column.StartIndex = startIndex - 1; rptList2Column.NumItems = productsPerPage; rptList2Column.DataSource = UseManualProductList() ? lPage.LPageProducts.Values.ToList() : products; rptList2Column.DataBind() on first page load, I see my repeater just fine and its products. But we have a paging control. When clicking next all it does is through a param up in the querystring and we grab it and requery to get more products. So 2nd time around it comes to here again and I debugged and definitely verified that products above is what's being picked and set to the DataSource and after DataBind, rptList2Column has 6 records. But when my page loads, the repeater is not showing up. Here's some of my mark-up: "> " border="0" /> "> this is a custom repeater and I have 3 on the page, each wrapped with a panel. The first repeater is setup just like this and has no problems. So I don't see why this would not work.
