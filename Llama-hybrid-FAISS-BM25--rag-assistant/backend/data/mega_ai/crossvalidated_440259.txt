It certainly is by the common defintion. E.g. wikipedia writes: In artificial neural networks, the activation function of a node defines the output of that node given an input or set of inputs. (Source.) Also, contrary to what you write, softmax is also used as an intermediary sometimes. E.g. for the last layer before a linear layer or in switching recurrent systems.
