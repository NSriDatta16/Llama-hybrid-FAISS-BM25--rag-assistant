How to check if two random Gaussian vectors are jointly Gaussian?

Given the following system of equations: $\textbf{y} = \textbf{x}_{1} + \sum_{l=2}^{L}\textbf{x}_{l} + \textbf{w}$ where $\textbf{y}$, $\textbf{x}_{l}, \; \forall l$ and $\textbf{w}$ are Gaussian random vectors with zero mean and variances $ \gt 0$. How can we check if $\textbf{y}$ and $\textbf{x}_{1}$ are jointly Gaussian? This question arises from the fact that the linear MMSE estimator of $\textbf{x}_{1}$ given $\textbf{y}$ becomes the Bayesian estimator when $\textbf{y}$ and $\textbf{x}_{1}$ are jointly Gaussian, however, I don't know if they are jointly Gaussian, and if so, how can I prove/check that?
