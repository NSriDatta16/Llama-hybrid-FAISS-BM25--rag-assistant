What is the hat matrix and why is it inappropriate for GLMM standardized residuals?

When I run this code to plot standardized residuals for a standard logistic regression: #### Standarized Residuals Fixed Model #### model.data % mutate(index = 1:n()) model.data %>% top_n(3,.cooksd) ggplot(model.data, aes(index, .std.resid)) + geom_point(aes(color = factor(Outcome)), alpha = .5) There is no issue and I can plot what I want. However, when I do the same thing for a random intercepts mixed model: model.data.ri % mutate(index = 1:n()) I get this warning: Warning messages: 1: In hatvalues.merMod(model) : the hat matrix may not make sense for GLMMs 2: In hatvalues.merMod(model) : the hat matrix may not make sense for GLMMs Now of course I could just run this as is, but I was curious what the hat matrix was and why one would need to be careful with a GLMM interpretation of it?
