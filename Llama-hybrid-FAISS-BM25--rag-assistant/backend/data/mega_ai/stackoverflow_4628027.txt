Make mouse pointer become hand to click button

" /> $('#btnIcOld').live('click', function () { window.location.href = 'https://extranetint.chathamfinancial.com/indications/swapcalculator'; }); So as you can see above, the image is my button, and that is the JQuery that handles the button click. Problem is, when you hover your mouse over the image, it stays as the basic arrow pointer. How do I make it change to a hand so the user knows they can click on it?
