No, you cannot do this in Interface Builder alone. Also, the screenshot you have provided is a Web App running in Safari, it's not been created in Interface Builder and is HTML, not objective C. If you want to do this in Objective C, you'd need to drag a UITableView into your window in Interface Builder and then write the appropriate code for it. For the example above I'd set the footerView property of the UITableView to be the button and create the cells in code. For the textfields just use the accessoryView property of the cell. If you want to go for HTML, check out iWebKit ( http://iwebkit.net/ )
