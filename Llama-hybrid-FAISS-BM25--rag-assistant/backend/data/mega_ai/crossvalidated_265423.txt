Explaining the distributions in Tensorflow's Tensorboard

I'm trying to train a cGAN network on Tensorflow and have all the summaries of the Discriminator, but I'm having difficulty understanding what they mean... There are currently 5 layers in the Discriminator and the distributions are like below: I'm using the LSGAN loss for training the network and the 5 Conv layers are activated by a LeakyReLU function, but I feel as if the gradients of Layer 5 aren't propagated back properly and it's as if the gradients are diminishing... Do the images show this or am I mistaking the distributions for something else?
