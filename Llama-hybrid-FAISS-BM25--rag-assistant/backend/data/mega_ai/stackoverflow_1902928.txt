I would vote for 2) Make it a DomainService . The code to implement it could be in either a DomainServices class, an AdjustmentServices class, or a ValidateAdjustmentService class, depending on what other services are in the domain model, and what makes the most sense from an organizational perspective. Another option, (if the rules implemented by this service are business rules) is to implement this as a SPECIFICATION. (Check out pages 224 - 240 in DDD)
