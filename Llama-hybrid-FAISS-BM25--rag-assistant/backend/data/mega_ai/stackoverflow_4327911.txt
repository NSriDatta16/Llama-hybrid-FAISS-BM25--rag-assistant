Setting REMOTE_USER in JSP

We're attempting to front Web software we've purchased from a vendor with our organization's single-signon authentication. Their software expects the CGI environment variable REMOTE_USER to be set in JSP to a user ID before we forward control to their welcome page. (Their technical manual describes it only in this way: "...the HTTP response object should populate the remote user attribute with the username of the authenticated user.") Getting this value is easy but we haven't found a straightforward method in Google searches of setting it. We're confident it's possible. Thanks for any suggestions.
