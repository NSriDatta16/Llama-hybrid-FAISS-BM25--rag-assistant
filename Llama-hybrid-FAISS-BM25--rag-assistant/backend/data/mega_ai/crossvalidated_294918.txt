LSTM with multidimensional input

It's hard to find literature where LTSM are used with multidimensional input. I know that LTSM admits various time series as input (multidimensional input) with the shape : (samples,look back, dimension ).Dimension could be, electricity demand, temperature, pressure, day of the week,... among others. The question is: If you want to forecast the next X samples of one of the features, is it forcing you to also forecast the other "drivers"? Thereby, has the target vector be of the same dimensionality as the input one? Then I understand that there is not any difference between the "main" magnitude to forecast and the "drivers" as you are forced to forecast all of them. Maybe LSTM is not designed for this use and I'm confused...
