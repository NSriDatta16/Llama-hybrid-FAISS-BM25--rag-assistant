This is a guess... But I think that perhaps the Azure IIS instance does not include PDF as a known MIME type. To adjust for this try adding the mime type to your app's web.config file: http://blogs.iis.net/bills/archive/2008/03/25/how-to-add-mime-types-with-iis7-web-config.aspx If this still doesn't work, then maybe consider: changing the file extension moving the PDF to Blob storage - in theory it should be more efficient to serve this static content direct from Blob storage adding a dynamic proxy to your app for this file (not ideal!)
