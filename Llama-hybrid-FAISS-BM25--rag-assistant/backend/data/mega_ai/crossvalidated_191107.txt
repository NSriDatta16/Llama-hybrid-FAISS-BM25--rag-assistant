No one has mentioned the following paper - http://papers.nips.cc/paper/3150-map-reduce-for-machine-learning-on-multicore.pdf (Andrew Ng is one of the authors) The paper itself is for multi-core machines, but it is essentially about recasting machine learning problems so that they fit the map-reduce pattern, and can be used for a cluster of computers. (for seeing why that is not a good idea in general, you may want to read this paper - http://arxiv.org/pdf/1006.4990v1.pdf . It has a good overview).
