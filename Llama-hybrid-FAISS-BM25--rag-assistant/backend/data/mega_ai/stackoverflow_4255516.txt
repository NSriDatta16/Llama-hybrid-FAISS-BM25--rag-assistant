I have just tried your code on my catalog and it worked with a little adjustement. You should pay attention to the loaded store; it is not allowed to update certain product fields if the ADMIN store is not the currently loaded ( Mage::app()->setCurrentStore(Mage_Core_Model_App::ADMIN_STORE_ID); ). setCurrentStore(Mage_Core_Model_App::ADMIN_STORE_ID); ... $product->save(); ?>
