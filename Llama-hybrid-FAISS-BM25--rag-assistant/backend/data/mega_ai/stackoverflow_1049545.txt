Can the reporting be redirected to a different database name? If yes you can create database snapshots of DB2 and have the reports run from these snapshots. After each log restore you create a new snapshot and mark it somewhere as 'the' current snapshot and all new reports start running against this snapshot. When a new log is shipped, a new snapshot is created and new reports go against the new snapshot, while old, running, reports remain in the previous snapshot. When the last report is done with the old snapshot and there are no longer users referencing it, it can be dropped. This way no report is ever interrupted, at the cost of extra storage: each new log will cause the old snapshot(s) to start do the 'copy-on-write' of affected pages.
