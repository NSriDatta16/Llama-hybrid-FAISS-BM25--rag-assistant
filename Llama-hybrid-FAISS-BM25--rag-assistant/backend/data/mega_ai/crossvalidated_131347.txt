Policy Gradient - Finite Difference Method: $\text{Calculating } \Delta \theta_i$

In Policy Gradient Methods for Robotics it says that for the policy parametrization $\theta_i$ the change $\Delta \theta_i$ " is varied by small increments ". My problem is that I don't understand what small increments is supposed to mean. The algorithm for the Finite Difference Gradient Estimator goes as follows: But how to generate $\Delta\theta_i$?
