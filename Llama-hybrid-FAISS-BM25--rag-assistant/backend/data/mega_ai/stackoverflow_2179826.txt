All modern browsers support 128 bit encryption out of the box. Do you have a need to support browsers older than IE 5.5? You could either check the User-Agent string of the browser and make assumptions, or you could direct them to a page that uses a 128 bit SSL certificate and if they continue through it.. well, they must support it.
