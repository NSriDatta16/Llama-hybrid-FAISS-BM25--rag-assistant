You could learn about word embeddings . These will provide you a natural path to topic models, and many other NLP tasks. Look up word2vec . I think it is better not to learn two new subjects (NLP and ML) at once. I would start with ML on its own; take this class perhaps. A good place to start is linear regression , or binary classification .
