JSF 2.0 request.getParameter return a string with wrong encoding

I'm writing an application in JSF 2.0 which supports many languages, among them ones with special characters. I use String value = request.getParameter("name") and POST method, the page encoding is set to UTF-8 and the app is deployed on apache tomcat 6 which has the connector set correctly to utf-8 in a server.xml file: Yes I get strange results like Ã¤ for example in place of expected special characters. What should I check next to get rid of the problem? Thanks for help and suggestions. --------------Edit------------------- This is the response header: Server Apache-Coyote/1.1 Content-Type text/html;charset=UTF-8 Content-Length 5160 Date Sun, 10 Oct 2010 15:32:24 GMT And the request header: Host localhost:8088 User-Agent Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.10) Gecko/20100914 Firefox/3.6.10 ( .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET4.0E) Accept text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language pl,en-us;q=0.7,en;q=0.3 Accept-Encoding gzip,deflate Accept-Charset ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7 Keep-Alive 115 Connection keep-alive Referer http://localhost:8088/Panel/addbuilding.jsp Cookie JSESSIONID=DD85C95BDFEA9E51B5E4146F2643295D Pragma no-cache Cache-Control no-cache Best Regards, sass.
