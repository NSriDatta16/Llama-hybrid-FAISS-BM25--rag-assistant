Standard correlation coefficient of various datasets

I understood the correlation coefficient of the first line. But the correlation coefficient of second and third line differ with the first line in figure 1 . Why is it so ?. Even the shapes differ for second and third line ?. Can someone help me to gain an understanding of below picture The second question is related to the correlation between attributes. The intention behind asking this question it to gain more understanding from StackOverflow data science users. The very one thing I learnt from the below picture is if you plot attribute against the same attribute, you will end up with lines, which is of no use. For instance, if you notice median_house_value in y-axis against median_house_value in the x-axis, they are basically histograms. Is there any valuable feedback that you can comment on the below picture ?. If so, please let me know.
