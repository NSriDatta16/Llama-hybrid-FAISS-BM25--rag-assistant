Instant Messaging With Priority For Developer Communication

My team communicates a lot with IM. We'll sometimes use IM to ask a question even to someone who's in the next cube over. The reason for this is that we all find that answering an IM is much less disrupting than talking. Still, I find that the blinking message window can be disrupting when I'm heads down coding. I can't help but look at what people have written and it often keeps me from finishing my thought. This type of multitasking is a productivity killer. I've therefore turned off the alert feature (I'm using Pidgin). My Windows task bar is hidden so I need to drag my cursor to the bottom of the screen, let the task bar pop up, and look if the pidgin tray icon is flashing orange to find out about new messages. This works well except that sometimes people have a quick question to ask for which they need a quick answer. It would be great to have the ability to send priorities on messages: Priority 3: Check this out when you can Priority 2: Normal chat Priority 1: Please reply quickly The priority level would then be used to determine the alert method. E.g. (1)Give focus to window, (2)blink in task bar, (3)blink in tray. Any ideas on an easy way of accomplishing this? Thanks
