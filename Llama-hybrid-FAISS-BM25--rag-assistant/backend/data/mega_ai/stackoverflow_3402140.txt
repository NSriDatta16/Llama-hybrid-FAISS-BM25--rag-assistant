If you use some kind of messaging server (JMS for Java, not sure for C#) then your messaging server is the only server that needs to open a port and you can have two way communication from your agent to the messaging server and from the server to the messaging server. This would allow you to accomplish the hybrid model without needing to open a port on the agent server.
