Time Series: relating duration of one time series to events

I have a stats question, and not enough experience to even begin to know how to find the answer. It's a time series question relating two time series: A = anomolous conditions (-,0,+) --- continuous variable B = # of events --- discrete variable If I wanted to find out, quantitatively, a threshold of duration under which + anomalous conditions must occur in order for there to be an event, how might one go about doing this? For example, I am more lucky than normal for X consecutive weeks duration before a great opportunity arises. How do I find out the distribution of durations (i.e., my distribution of X)? I've tried thinking about it and autoregressive analysis won't answer the question because it would simply tell me when the peaks align and the temporal persistence of the anomalous conditions. I'm looking for key words, methods, links, example problems - anything to point me in the right direction. Any advice is very welcome!
