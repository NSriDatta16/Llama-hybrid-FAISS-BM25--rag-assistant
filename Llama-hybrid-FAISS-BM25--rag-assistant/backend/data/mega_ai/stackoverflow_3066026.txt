The "correct" way to do what you're doing (I believe) would be SharedPreferences. The Android dev guide has a great page on the different methods of Data Storage in Android . Also, try not to use too many static values; perhaps what you're doing would be better accomplished with singleton classes, though, from the question, it's hard to tell what you're using them for.
