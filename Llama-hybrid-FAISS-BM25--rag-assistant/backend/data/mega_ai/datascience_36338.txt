Design a branching CNN

So I have a CNN task at hand. Let's say I have a dataset containing pictures of a number of classes, their attributes and sub attributes and so on. What is the state of art/How can we design a system which first predicts the class, then based on that class the attributes which are specific to that class e.g claws present in birds but not in humans and so on. How is such a system designed with minimum resource utilization? Note: My question is not about prediction of classes and attributes but it is the design of a system which will predict the class then go predict the specific attributes belonging to the class and so on.
