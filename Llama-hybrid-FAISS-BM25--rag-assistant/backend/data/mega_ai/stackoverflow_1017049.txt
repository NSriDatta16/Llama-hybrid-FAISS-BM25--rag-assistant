I work with access every day but it is limited. Unless you can guarantee your RAD style prototypes are just going to be that - prototypes. Stay well clear and use .NET with SQLServerExpress. Too often I've worked at origanisations where an access application that server 5 members is now creaking under the scale of a 100+ user base. Things are best done properly.
