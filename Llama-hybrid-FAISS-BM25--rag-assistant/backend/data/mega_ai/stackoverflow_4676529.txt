Getting every nth Element of a Sequence

I am looking for a way to create a sequence consisting of every nth element of another sequence, but don't seem to find a way to do that in an elegant way. I can of course hack something, but I wonder if there is a library function that I'm not seeing. The sequence functions whose names end in -i seem to be quite good for the purpose of figuring out when an element is the nth one or (multiple of n)th one, but I can only see iteri and mapi , none of which really lends itself to the task. Example: let someseq = [1;2;3;4;5;6] let partial = Seq.magicfunction 3 someseq Then partial should be [3;6] . Is there anything like it out there? Edit: If I am not quite as ambitious and allow for the n to be constant/known, then I've just found that the following should work: let rec thirds lst = match lst with | _::_::x::t -> x::thirds t // corrected after Tomas' comment | _ -> [] Would there be a way to write this shorter?
