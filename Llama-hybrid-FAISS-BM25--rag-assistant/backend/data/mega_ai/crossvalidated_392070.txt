Alternatively using simulations > x=runif(1e6) > y=runif(1e6) > mean(ifelse(x+y Edit: explanation of what is going on we simulate 1 million random numbers (1e6) from the (standard) uniform distribution (so range 0 to 1), for both $x$ and $y$ coordinates (paired points $x$ and $y$ ). Then we simply check how many of these coordinates satisfy your conditions, and we take the average. This is your result.
