XEP-0124 / BOSH: Omit ACK in response

I'm reading the XEP-0124 / BOSH specification and do not understand the following sentence in chapter 9.1 Request Acknowledgements: The only exception is that, after its session creation response, the connection manager SHOULD NOT include an 'ack' attribute in any response if the value would be the 'rid' of the request being responded to. In my words: I should not send an ACK if the respond is dedicated for the last and only request (in connection manager's queue). But: There is a client with it's own state machine. Maybe the client already send a second request -- where the first one is not replied -- and expect to get two answers. In this case the client except a ACK with RID of the "older" request and the connection manager have to set ACK. Conclusion: The connection mananager MUST set ACK as long multiple requests are allowed. I'm not sure, but is this text paragraph dedicated only for the use case where no further request is send by the client but the session creation phase is finished successfully and the connection manager have to send "ping" messages to the client due to "wait" timeouts ?
