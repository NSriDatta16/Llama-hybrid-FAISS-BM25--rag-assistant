I also could find any single CPAN module that does exactly want you want. I wonder if you could somehow combine Pod::Coverage and Pod::Select . Pod::Coverage lets you get at the symbols as below: snoopy@deb6:~$ perl -de0 DB use Pod::Coverage DB our $pc = Pod::Coverage->new(package => 'Mouse'); DB $pc->coverage; DB use Data::Dumper DB p Dumper $pc->{symbols} $VAR1 = { 'around' => 1, 'init_meta' => 0, 'super' => 0, 'has' => 1, 'after' => 1, 'augment' => 0, 'inner' => 0, 'override' => 0, 'with' => 0, 'extends' => 1, 'before' => 1 }; Maybe Pod::Select (or Similar) could then be used to extract the relevant sections? EDIT or maybe subclass/modify Pod::Coverage to gather body text along with the symbols.
