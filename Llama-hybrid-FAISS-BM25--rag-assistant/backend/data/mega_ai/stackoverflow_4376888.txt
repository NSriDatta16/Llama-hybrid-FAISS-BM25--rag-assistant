CRL and Windows certificate store

I need to get CRL from windows store (windows store for X509Certificate represent X509Store). I try such code: string storName = "CA";//such store is exist WinCertStorage = new X509Store(storName, storLoc); WinCertStorage.Open(OpenFlags.ReadOnly); foreach (X509Certificate2 cer in WinCertStorage.Certificates) { if (cer.Version == 2) //certificate with version 2 can be CRL } But there is no CRL in X509Store that i opened. Using mmc, I imported into "CA" store some CRL, but my code doesn't see it. Can I get CRL with standart System.Security.Cryptography namespace? What do i need to use if I can't? I need solution for .Net. Thank you.
