Unless you have a mail server set up on your local computer, setting SMTP = localhost won't have any effect. In days gone by (long ago), it was sufficient to set the value of SMTP to the address of your ISP's SMTP server. This now rarely works because most ISPs insist on authentication with a username and password. However, the PHP mail() function doesn't support SMTP authentication. It's designed to work directly with the mail transport agent of the local server. You either need to set up a local mail server or to use a PHP classs that supports SMTP authentication, such as Zend_Mail or PHPMailer. The simplest solution, however, is to upload your mail processing script to your remote server.
