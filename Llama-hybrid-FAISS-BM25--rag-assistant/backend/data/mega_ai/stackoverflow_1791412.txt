1) You have to know how to "log in". To do this login manually in the web application and trace the http traffic with http debugger like Fiddler. Pay attention what kind of http requests are sent, what names have the parameters, etc. Once you know what sequence of http requests has to be send to log in you has to do this with the browser. 2) Implement log in automatically 2.1) If by any chance log in happens via http GET - just append the right query string to the url and start the browser. This could happen only if you control the web application and build in this mechanism, other wise log in is almost always implemented as POST with https. 2.2) If you have to do POST request you have several options: 2.2.1) You could provide local html document, that contains javascript and make ajax call to the login form from the javascript. To pass the parameters you could use get parameters. 2.2.2) If nothing else works you will have to use the browser via COM (WebBrowser control)
