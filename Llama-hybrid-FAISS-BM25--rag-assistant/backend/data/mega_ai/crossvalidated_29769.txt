I like Duda, Hart and Stork "Pattern Classification". This is a recent revision of a classic text that explains everything very well. Not sure that it is updated to have much coverage of neural networks and SVMs. The book by Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman is about the best there is but may be a bit more technical than what you are looking for and is detailed rather than an overview of the subject.
