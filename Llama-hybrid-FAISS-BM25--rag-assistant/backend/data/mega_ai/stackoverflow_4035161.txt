Tabs losing focus in IE jquery ui tabs

I have a page with a 3 tab layout and each tab contains small forms. For accessibility reasons I am paying close attention to tabbing through the page. When I tab through and hit enter in FF & Chrome the focus stays on the tab. In IE 6,7,8 it jumps to the top of the page which causes a big problem for non or low vision users. This same thing occurs on the demo page: http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/ I have tried many ways of setting focus with onclick on the element and it just doesn't work. Any suggestions on how to fix? Thanks!
