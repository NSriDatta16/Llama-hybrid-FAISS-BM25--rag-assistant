vb.net if( x isNot Nothing AndAlso x.go()) then Evaluation is done left to right AndAlso operator makes sure that only if the left side was TRUE, the right side will be evaluated (very important, since ifx is nothing x.go will crash) You may use And instead ofAndAlso in vb. in which case the left side gets evaluated first as well, but the right side will get evaluated regardless of result. Best Practice: Always use AndAlso, unless you have a very good reason why not to. It was asked in a followup why or when would anyone use And instead of AndAlso (or & instead of &&): Here is an example: if ( x.init() And y.init()) then x.process(y) end y.doDance() In this case, I want to init both X and Y. Y must be initialized in order for y.DoDance to be able to execute. However, in the init() function I am doing also some extra thing like checking a socket is open, and only if that works out ok, for both , I should go ahead and do the x.process(y). Again, this is probably not needed and not elegant in 99% of the cases, that is why I said that the default should be to use AndAlso .
