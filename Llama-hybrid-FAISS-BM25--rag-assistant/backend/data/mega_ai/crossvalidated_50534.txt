I don't think caret supports multi-task learning in any of its functions. You could try the glmnet package , with distribution set to mgaussian . This will allow you to do feature selection via lasso regularization, ridge regularization, or elastic net regularization for a linear regression model. There may be other R machine learning libraries with built-in feature selection that support multi-task learning. Here's some sample code for multi-task learning, using the lasso for variable selection, adapted from ?glmnet : #Create a dataset set.seed(42) library(glmnet) x=matrix(rnorm(100*20),100,20) cf 0 &
