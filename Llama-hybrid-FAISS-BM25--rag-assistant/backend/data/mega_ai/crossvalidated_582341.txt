Alternatively you can use log returns (there are issues with division by 0, same as multiplication by 0 with a geometric mean). > df=structure(list(id = 1:3, until_2000 = c(1L, 1L, 2L), after_2000 = c(1L, 2L, 1L)), class = "data.frame", row.names = c("1", "2", "3")) > log(df $after_2000/df$ until_2000) [1] 0.0000000 0.6931472 -0.6931472 and you can use a regular average now (which is 0 in this case). Adding another row > df=rbind(df,c(4,3,5)) > log(df $after_2000/df$ until_2000) [1] 0.0000000 0.6931472 -0.6931472 0.5108256 the regular average of these 4 log values is $0.1277064$ , an overall $\approx 12.7 \%$ increase. Compare this to kqr's method: Edit after the correct formula for the geometric mean was written down > prod(df $after_2000/df$ until_2000)^(1/nrow(df)) [1] 1.136219 so an average $13.6 \%$ increase.
