I think the easiest way to figure out what's going on is to think about how you might approximate the integral. We have $p(\mathcal{D}) = \int p(\mathcal{D}|\theta) p(\theta) \rm d \theta$ . Note that this is just the average of the likelihood (first term in the integrand) over the prior distribution. One way to compute this integral approximately: sample from the prior, evaluate the likelihood, repeat this lots of times and average the results. Because the prior and the dataset are both fixed, the result of this procedure doesn't depend on the value of $\theta$ . $p(\mathcal{D})$ is just the expected likelihood under the prior.
