How can I Implement Dropout in SciKit-Learn?

I am working on an air-gapped PC and can only access the SciKit-Learn machine learning library. Unfortunately, its MLPClassifier doesn't include a Dropout hyperparameter, which severely limits the size of network I'm able to build. How can I extend the Class and add Dropout to the algorithm/ model?
