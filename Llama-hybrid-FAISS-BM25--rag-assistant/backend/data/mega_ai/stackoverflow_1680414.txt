Using the new ( since Linux Kernel 2.6.20 ) workqueue interface

I've been reading about Linux Kernel development / device drivers and all of the books I've looked at use the pre-2.6.20 workqueue interface . This includes the Linux Kernel Module Programming Guide , Robert Love's Linux Kernel Development , and Sreekrishnan Venkateswaran's Essential Linux Device Drivers which was published in April 2008! Does anyone have a guide to using the "new" 2.6.20+ workqueue interface ? Just for reference, Ubuntu 8.04 which I'm developing on at the moment, was released over a year and a half ago and includes kernel 2.6.24. Edit stsquad's answer led me to this guide to porting code to the new 2.6.20 workqueue's .
