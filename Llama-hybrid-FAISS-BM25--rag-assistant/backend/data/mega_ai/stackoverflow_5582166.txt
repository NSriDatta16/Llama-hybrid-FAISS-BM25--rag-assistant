Depending on the data and how much of it is allowed to be cached or synchronised you could look at the replication features in SQL Compact 3.5 (not 4.0) as this supports partial synchronisation with SQL server. Failing that you could store the data in your own database locally (for this I'd recommend SQL Compact 4.0 rather than SQL Express) and then you'd have to have your own updating logic. Alternatively if you don't need to cache the data for long you could use the Enterprise Library caching blocks and store the data in Application Storage. This method would be best suited if you wanted to cache queries and results rather than individual records.
