VB.NET List(Of T) - Can I use it to hold items of several types?

Assuming a base type of "Message"... Public Class Message Public ID As Int64 Public Text As String Public MessageType as String End Class ...and then two derived classes... Public Class PhoneMessage Inherits Message Public MessageLength As Int64 End Class Public Class MailMessage Inherits Message Public Postage As Int64 End Class I would like to have one collection of Message objects which can be either PhoneMessages or MailMessages, so that I can iterate through the list and deal with each message based on what type it happens to be. Attempting just to use .Add() fails, saying that I can't add an item of type PhoneMessage to a List(Of Message). Is there some elegant way to accomplish what I'm trying to do? I had thought I could accomplish this with generics, but I think there's a gap in my understanding. If it can be accomplished in .NET 2.0, that would be ideal. Thank you in advance.
