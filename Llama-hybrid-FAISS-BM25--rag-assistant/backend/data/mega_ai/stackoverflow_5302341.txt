'HTTP_USER_AGENT' Contents of the User-Agent: header from the current request, if there is one. This is a string denoting the user agent being which is accessing the page. A typical example is: Mozilla/4.5 [en] (X11; U; Linux 2.2.9 i586). Among other things, you can use this value with get_browser() to tailor your page's output to the capabilities of the user agent. So I assume you'll be able to get the browser name/id from the $_SERVER["HTTP_USER_AGENT"] variable.
