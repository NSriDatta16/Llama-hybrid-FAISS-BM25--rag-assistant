500 can be right. It does not imply 2^500 leafs, some leafs can stop earlier. How many observations do you have? In random forest you could use the out-of-bag predictions for tuning. That would make your tuning algorithm faster. Max_depth = 500 does not have to be too much. The default of random forest in R is to have the maximum depth of the trees, so that is ok. You should validate your final parameter settings via cross-validation (you then have a nested cross-validation), then you could see if there was some problem in the tuning process.
