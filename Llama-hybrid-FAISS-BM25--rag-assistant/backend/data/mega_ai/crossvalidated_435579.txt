Minimum number of trials per participant to assess within-group variability

I have a design in which participants can look at a correct or wrong picture (nominal dependent variable) as a function of between-subject age group (3 levels) and within-subject task type (2 levels). When plotting the data, I have calculated the proportion of looking at the correct picture (y axis) in each group (e.g., age_1 - task_1) ACROSS PARTICIPANTS. I did it across participants because each participant has only done 2-3 trials in each task condition. I would like to show mean proportion with standard errors but I don't know how meaningful these would be considering the I would have to calculate a proportion of correct responses per participant over 2-3 trials only, to then show the average across participants with a measure of deviation. Do you think proportion of correct look per participant can still be used with this small number of trials? My concern relates to the fact that with only 2 or 3 trials per participant, the proportion of correct look will be represented by a limited range of values (0 [0/2, 0/3]; 0.33 [1/3]; 0.5 [1/2]; 0.66 [2/3]; 1 [2/2, 3/3])
