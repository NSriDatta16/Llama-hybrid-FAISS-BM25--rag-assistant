Probability for class in xgboost

I'm using xgboost for a problem where the outcome is binary but I am only interested in the correct probability of a sample to be in class 1. My current approach is to use the XGBClassifier in Python with objective binary:logistic, use predict_proba method and take that output as a probability for class 1. I that methodology correct in the sense that I get actual probability values for a sample to be in class 1?
