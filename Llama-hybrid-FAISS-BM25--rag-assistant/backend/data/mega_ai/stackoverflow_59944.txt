I would suggest that you can get free components at sites like codeproject , but you are going to end up sinking a ton of time separating the wheat from the chaff and figuring out how to use them, and since they are not a unified library the APIs and integration will be a new learning curve for each different control. So I would recommend, unless you are a hobbyist with a lot of time on your hands, it is without a doubt worth the money for your company to buy something from Peter Blum, DevExpress, Infragistics, Telerik, or one of the other vendors who will provide support and documentation.
