C++ container question

I was looking for some suitable 2D element container. What I want is the ability to iterate through every element of the container using, for example BOOST_FOREACH and I also would like to have an ability to construct subview (slices / subranges) of my container and, probably iterate through them too. Right now I am using boost::numeric::ublas::matrix for these purposes, but, well, it doesn't look as a good solution for me, because, well, it's a BLAS matrix, although it behaves very well as a plain 2d element container (custom unbounded / bounded storages are also very sweet). Another boost alternative, boost::multi_array is bad, because you can't iterate through every element using one BOOST_FOREACH statement and because constructing views has extremely obfuscated syntax. Any alternatives? Thank you.
