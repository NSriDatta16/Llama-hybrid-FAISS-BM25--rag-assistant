If you wanna get the optimal parameters, you can try using grid search. A grid search or parameter sweep does an exhaustive searching through a specified subset (you have to define this subset) of the hyperparameter space of the learning algorithm which in your case is the Convolutional Neural Network. Although this may take a long time but this is one of the ways you'll know the good parameters for your model. Try searching for optimization algorithms or parameter tuning techniques.
