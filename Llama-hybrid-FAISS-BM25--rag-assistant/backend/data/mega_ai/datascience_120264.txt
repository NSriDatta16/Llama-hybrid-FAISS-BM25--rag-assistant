The authors mean that in each batch, there are 600 pairs, where each pair consists of one positive example (selected randomly from the set of positive examples) and 3000 negative examples (selected randomly from the set of negative examples for that particular positive example). In other words, they used a total of 600 pairs (300 positive and 3000 negative examples per positive item) for training the neural network model.
