UIScroll View Delegate not calling ScrollViewDidEndScrollingAnimation

I have implemented the UIScrollViewDelegate protocol in my .h file and i have implemented the - (void)scrollViewDidEndScrollingAnimation:(UIScrollView *)scrollView method in my .m class. when the scrolling is done in my table view other delegate method of scrollview are getting called, but when scrolling ends, -scrollViewDidEndScrollingAnimation: is not getting called. I am bit stuck in this. Thanks and regards
