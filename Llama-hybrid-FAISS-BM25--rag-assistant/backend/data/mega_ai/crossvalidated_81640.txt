A good place to start for implementations of online learning is vowpal wabbit . It implements linear regression, logistic regression, several extensions of logistic regression for multi-class problems, neural networks, and matrix factorization. It also has several other nifty features, such as on-the-fly ngram computation and spell-checking. I'm not aware of an online implementation of adaboost.
