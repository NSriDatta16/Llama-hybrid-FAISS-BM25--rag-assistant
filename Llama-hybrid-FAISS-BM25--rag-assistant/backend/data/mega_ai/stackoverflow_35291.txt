@levand: My actual preference, as a user, in these situations is to download a lightweight .exe file that downloads the file for you. That's a dealbreaker for many, many sites. Users either are or should be extremely reluctant to download .exe files from websites and run them willy-nilly. Even if they're not always that cautious, incautious behaviour is not something we should encourage as responsible developers. If you're working on something along the lines of a company intranet, a .exe is potentially an okay solution, but for the public web? No way. @TonyB: What is the best way to do this without using FTP. I'm sorry, but I have to ask why the requirement. Your question reads to me along the lines of "what's the best way to cook a steak without any meat or heat source?" FTP was designed for this sort of thing.
