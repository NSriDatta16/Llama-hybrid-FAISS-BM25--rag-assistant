To add a DeleteOnNull attribute, you'll have to edit your .dbml file directly . To do this, navigate to it with Windows Explorer and open it in Notepad (or whatever - just not Visual Studio). Then edit the association and add the DeleteOnNull attribute like below. Then, the next time you open the dbml designer in Visual Studio, it should respect your changes, and include your attribute in the .Designer.cs file. .dbml direct (Notepad) edit: Attribute generated in .Designer.cs file after you do a save on the dbml designer in Visual Studio (which forces the .Designer.cs file to be regenerated): [Association(Name="Employee_EmployeeAddress", Storage="_Employee", ThisKey="EmployeeID", IsForeignKey=true, DeleteOnNull=true)] Hope that helps! And here is a related discussion , FYI.
