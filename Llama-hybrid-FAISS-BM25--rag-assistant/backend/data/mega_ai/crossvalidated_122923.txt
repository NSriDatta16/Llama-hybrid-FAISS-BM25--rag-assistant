Rather than your observations being distributions, it sounds like you have some uncertainty or variability about your observations. This kind of observations can be modelled using hierarchical models. For example, you can say \begin{eqnarray} y_j &\sim& Normal(\mu,\sigma^2),\,\,\, j=1,...,n,\\ \mu &\sim& F,\\ \sigma^2 &\sim& G. \end{eqnarray} where $F$ is a distribution on ${\mathbb R}$ and $G$ is a distribution on ${\mathbb R}_+$. A discussion on the choice for $F$ and $G$ can be found in: Prior distributions for variance parameters in hierarchical models Update If you have the estimated variance, you can still use hierarchical models. Take a look at Chapter 5 of the book: Bayesian Data Analysis and the aforementioned paper. Consider also the case when the observations are measured with a certain error. This is, an observation $y_j$ means that you are actually observing $y_j\pm \epsilon$. In this case the treatment might be a little different. For a proper modelling of your data, you need to clearly understand the measurement mechanism.
