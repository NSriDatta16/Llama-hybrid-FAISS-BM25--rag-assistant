To combine these two FT's you must know the difference in their TOA (time of arrival) and account for it first. Look up beam forming . It would help if we had some idea of the application. As has been said in the other answers, sure you can average the two and get some idea of the frequency spectrum across an area, but to what end? More details please as to the purpose, then we can tell you whether or not what you're proposing is a decent fit.
