Send authenticated mail through sendmail

I'm using sendmail to send a bunch of e-mails (I really have to send this e-mails, unfortunately) through php. The e-mail began to get into gmail and yahoo's SPAM boxes as soon as I stopped using my domain SMTP server, and started using the server's sendmail facility (I separated my domain name provider from my host, which is now Amazon). After studying a little, I realized that I could solve this problem just by sending the e-mail authenticatedly (i.e. through my domain's SMTP server). Can I do that through configuration in sendmail? That way, I wouldn't need any changes on my application, only on my server infrastructure. The headers I'm receiving (from an email at gmail) Delivered-To: ***********@gmail.com Received: by 10.227.152.2 with SMTP id e2cs188839wbw; Fri, 29 Oct 2010 03:39:45 -0700 (PDT) Received: by 10.100.13.16 with SMTP id 16mr263366anm.209.1288348783979; Fri, 29 Oct 2010 03:39:43 -0700 (PDT) Return-Path: Received: from ip-10-194-150-64.ec2.internal (ec2-75-101-144-206.compute-1.amazonaws.com [75.101.144.206]) by mx.google.com with ESMTP id x32si2412082vcr.72.2010.10.29.03.39.43; Fri, 29 Oct 2010 03:39:43 -0700 (PDT) Received-SPF: neutral (google.com: 75.101.144.206 is neither permitted nor denied by best guess record for domain of apache@ip-10-194-150-64.ec2.internal) client-ip=75.101.144.206; Authentication-Results: mx.google.com; spf=neutral (google.com: 75.101.144.206 is neither permitted nor denied by best guess record for domain of apache@ip-10-194-150-64.ec2.internal) smtp.mail=apache@ip-10-194-150-64.ec2.internal Received: from ip-10-194-150-64.ec2.internal (localhost [127.0.0.1] (may be forged)) by ip-10-194-150-64.ec2.internal (8.13.8/8.13.8) with ESMTP id o9TAdhxQ017836 for ; Fri, 29 Oct 2010 06:39:43 -0400 Received: (from apache@localhost) by ip-10-194-150-64.ec2.internal (8.13.8/8.13.8/Submit) id o9TAdhHk017833; Fri, 29 Oct 2010 06:39:43 -0400 Date: Fri, 29 Oct 2010 06:39:43 -0400 Message-Id: To: ***********@gmail.com Subject: Esqueci minha senha From: Cidade dos Bicos X-Mailer: Cidade dos Bicos Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8 Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit Thanks
