The following email address is only 94 characters: i.have.a.really.long.name.like.seetharam.krishnapillai@AReallyLongCompanyNameOfSomeKind.com.au Would an organisation actually give you an email that long? If they were stupid enough to, would you actually use an email address like that? Would anyone? Of course not. Too long to type and too hard to remember. Even a 92-year-old technophobe would figure out how to sign up for a nice short gmail address, and just use that, rather than type this into your registration page. Disk space probably isn't an issue, but there are at least two problems with allowing user input fields to be many times longer than they need to be: Displaying them could mess up your UI (at best they will be cut off, at worst they push your containers and margins around) Malicious users can do things with them you can't anticipate (like those cases where hackers used a free online API to store a bunch of data) I like 50 chars: 123456789.123456789.123456789@1234567890123456.com If one user in a million has to use their other email address to use my app, so be it. (Statistics show that no-one actually enters more than about 40 chars for email address, see e.g.: ZZ Coder's answer https://stackoverflow.com/a/1297352/87861 )
