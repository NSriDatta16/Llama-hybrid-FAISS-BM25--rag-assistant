Intervals of minimal size One obvious choice of a loss function for interval selection (both Bayesian and frequentist) is to use the size of the intervals as measured in terms of the marginal distributions. Thus, start with the desired property or the loss function, and derive the intervals that are optimal. This tends not to be done, as is exemplified by the present question, even though it is possible. For Bayesian credible sets, this corresponds to minimize the prior probability of the interval, or to maximize the relative belief, e.g., as outlined in Evans (2016). The size may also be used to select frequentist confidence sets (Schafer 2009). The two approaches are related and can be implemented fairly easily via decision rules that preferentially included decisions with large pointwise mutual information (Bartels 2017). Bartels, C.,2017.
