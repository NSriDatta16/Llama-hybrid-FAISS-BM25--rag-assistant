You'll want to do this, measuring the runtimes using a Stopwatch . Also, here are a few very important things to keep in mind when profiling: Always run your test more than 1 time. The first time you run it, there will be overhead from the JIT, and the timings may be misleading. Running many times and taking the average is a good approach (I'll often run a test like this 100,000 times, for example.) Always run your test with a full Release build, outside of the Visual Studio hosting process. (By default, you can use Ctrl+F5 for this.) The Visual Studio host dramatically impacts timings.
