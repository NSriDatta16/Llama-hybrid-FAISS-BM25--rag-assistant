How to deal with few trends in my time series?

I would like to make this data stationary, but I do not know how to deal with this series. This is not stationary and has autocorrelation. It looks like it has 3 different trends. How should I treat this data? Should I consider 3 different trends and separetely with this data? Or this is not right method?
