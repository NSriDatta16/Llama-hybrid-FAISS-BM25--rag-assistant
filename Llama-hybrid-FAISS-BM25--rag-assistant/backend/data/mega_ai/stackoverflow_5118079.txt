Organizational tree drawing algorithm

I'm implementing an organizational tree graph - top to bottom or left to right - in C# and looking for a good algorithm to draw the tree. Any recommendations? Thanks Update I finally had some time to work on it so ended up writing my own library to store and draw the tree by creating a custom panel, not sure if I followed a particular algorithm, I just wrote my own - back to pen and paper + time :) I intend to make it open source on codeplex once I'm done adding all the features I wanted. Will post another update once it's up on codeplex. Thanks
