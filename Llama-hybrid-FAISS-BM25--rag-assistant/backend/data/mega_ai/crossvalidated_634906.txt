Multivariate Regression - Categorical and Continuous Outputs?

I am performing process characterization of a welder and want to put together a model of the inputs vs outputs of the system. Currently I am performing individual multiple regressions with 4 inputs (all continuous numerical values) and 1 output (2 pass/fail categorical and 1 continuous numerical). There are also a few interactions in between. Is there any way to combine this into one unified model? The outputs are correlated and I want to be able to approximate settings for a Pass/Pass/0.5 sec result. The diagram below explains the inputs vs outputs (with additional less controllable but still impactful predictors). Green are controllable inputs, Red are uncontrollable, Yellow are influenced by Green and/or Red, and Purple are outputs. Is there any software that has functionality like this built in or will I need to create something in python? Does trying to perform a multivariate regression make sense in this application or should I look into making a neural network (less experienced with this).
