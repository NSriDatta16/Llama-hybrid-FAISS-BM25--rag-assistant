Forecasting Methods for a Short Time Series with No Trend or Seasonality in Python

I am pretty new into data science and I had some issues with my project. I am trying to build a forecasting model for a time series data. It is about yearly CO2 emissions from agriculture. The issue is that there is a really limited dataset (30 values corresponding to 30 years, i.e. one value per year) and from this series I haven't found any trend and there is 0 seasonality. The df is from a csv file with the following format: "Year" column with values from 1990 - 2020 "CO2" column with values for each year (115-47) All values are integers, there are no missing values or extremes I am trying to work in Python, and so far I have tried ETS, Holt Winters, Prophet and ARIMA but they all output a straight line corresponding to the mean of the total values, as a forecast, with a really broad ci. My question is, what models could I use to try and build a somewhat-qualitative forecast for the upcoming 10-20 time steps (years)? Thank you in advance!
