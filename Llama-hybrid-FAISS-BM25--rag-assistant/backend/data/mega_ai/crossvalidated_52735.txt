One thing you can try out quickly is using SVMLight [1] in a transductive mode [2]. You can go through this lightning quick presentation slides on TSVM by Carlos Guestrin [3]. You can of course read up on TSVM from Joachim's paper linked in Joachim's website. [1] http://svmlight.joachims.org/ [2] The transductive mode allows you to specify the fraction of true positive examples in your test set. This is usually done by using the "-p" option. Note that you will be using both the train and test set (without labels of course) for learning a classifier here. [3] http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~guestrin/Class/10701-S06/Slides/tsvms-pca.pdf
