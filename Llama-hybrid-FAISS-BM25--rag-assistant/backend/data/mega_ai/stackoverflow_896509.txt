Rails - fragment cache not expiring

This one has me stumped. I have a view with a cached fragment: - cache :key=>"news" do %h2 News - etc I have a sweeper that uses: def expire_home_cache puts "expire_home_cache" expire_fragment(:key => "news") end The sweeper is called as I can see "expire_home_cache" in the console output. But the fragment is not updated ... Any ideas?
