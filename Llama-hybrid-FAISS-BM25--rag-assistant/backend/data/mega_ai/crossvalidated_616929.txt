Bounded uniform prior in R

I have been fitting a bayesian GLM using brms. The code works well but when I loop this over several data and make it a bit more complex, R encounters a fatal error and crashes. This seems to be happening to other people when using brms. I am now looking into other methods to code this in R (eg, stan_glm, bayesglm), but they don't seem to accept bounded uniform priors like brms does, which is what I need. Does anyone have suggestions? Thanks code N
