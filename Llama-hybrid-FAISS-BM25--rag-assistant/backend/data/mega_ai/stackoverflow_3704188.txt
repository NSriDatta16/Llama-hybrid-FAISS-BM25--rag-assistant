Here is a simple two category 3 vector custom kernel input file that works correctly. I will explain the parts (though you should also see StompChicken's answer): 1 0:1 1:10 2:12 3:21 2 0:2 1:12 2:19 3:30 1 0:3 1:21 2:30 3:130 The first number on each line is which category it belongs to. The next entry on each line is of the form 0:n and it must be sequential, i.e. 0:1 on first entry 0:2 on second entry 0:3 on thrid entry A possible reason for this is that libsvm returns values alpha_i that go with your vectors in the output file, but for precomputed kernels the vectors are not displayed (which could be truly huge) rather the index 0:n that went with that vector is shown to make your output easier to match up with your input. Especially since the output is not in the same order you put them in it is grouped by category . It is thus very useful for you when reading the input file to be able to match up libsvm's outputs with your own inputs to have those 0:n values. Here you can see the output svm_type c_svc kernel_type precomputed nr_class 2 total_sv 3 rho -1.53951 label 1 2 nr_sv 2 1 SV 0.4126650675419768 0:1 0.03174528241667363 0:3 -0.4444103499586504 0:2 It is important to note that with precomputed kernels you cannot omit the zero entries like you can with all other kernels. They must be explicitly included.
