Disabling and enabling warning in xcode

Is it possible to disable warnings for particular piecies of code in xcode? I'm using a library I didn't write myself, and it creates hundreds of warnings. This makes it very unclear to find warnings related to my code. Is it possible to disable when #import-ing the headers and re-enabling warnings immediately after? I remember this was possible in some other IDE, maybe Visual Studio, maybe with some #pragma. Anything similar in xcode? Thanks!
