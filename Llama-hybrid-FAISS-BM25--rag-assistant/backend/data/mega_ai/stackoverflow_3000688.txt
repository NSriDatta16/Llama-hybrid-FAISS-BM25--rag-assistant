Using Ant in Eclipse to copy files to Tomcat directory

I have checked out a java servlet project from subversion that has a strange organization. All the java is in one directory and the resources ( JSPs, properties files, etc are in another ). I want to use Ant to build the project, but then copy files to the appropriate Tomcat directory on my machine. For example I would like to copy the JSP's from the source directory: ${basedir}/resources/${ant.project.name}/*.jsp to the tomcat directory ${tomcat_home}/${ant.project.name}/ What would that look like in the build.xml file?
