I took the xml from that page you provided, used the entire thing as a string for the argument to XMLin, and had success with print $data->{DocSum}->{Item}->[5]->{content}; giving the output Bromoxynil degradation in a Mississippi silt loam soil. This is pretty much the same thing derobert was saying. Edit: Rather than assuming the 6th Item element is the one you are after, to print the content of the node where the Name attribute is 'Title' (and then break out of the loop since you've found what you want): foreach my $item_node (@{$data->{DocSum}->{Item}}) { if($item_node->{Name} eq 'Title') { print $item_node->{content}; last; } } Of course, this is still only looking at the Item nodes immediately under DocSum, so if you were looking for PubType instead of Title, it wouldn't be found due to that being a child of the PubTypeList Item node.
