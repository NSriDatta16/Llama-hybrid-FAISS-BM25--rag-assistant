EleutherAI () is a grass-roots non-profit artificial intelligence (AI) research group. The group, considered an open-source version of OpenAI, was formed in a Discord server in July 2020 by Connor Leahy, Sid Black, and Leo Gao to organize a replication of GPT-3. In early 2023, it formally incorporated as the EleutherAI Institute, a non-profit research institute. History EleutherAI began as a Discord server on July 7, 2020, under the tentative name "LibreAI" before rebranding to "EleutherAI" later that month, in reference to eleutheria, the Greek word for liberty. Its founding members are Connor Leahy, Len Gao, and Sid Black. They co-wrote the code for Eleuther to serve as a collection of open source AI research, creating a machine learning model similar to GPT-3. On December 31, 2020, EleutherAI released The Pile, a curated dataset of diverse text for training large language models. While the paper referenced the existence of the GPT-Neo models, the models themselves were not released until March 21, 2021. According to a retrospective written several months later, the authors did not anticipate that "people would care so much about our 'small models'". On June 9, 2021, EleutherAI followed this up with GPT-J-6B, a six billion parameter language model that was again the largest open-source GPT-3-like model in the world. These language models were released under the Apache 2.0 free software license and are considered to have "fueled an entirely new wave of startups". While EleutherAI initially turned down funding offers, preferring to use Google's TPU Research Cloud Program to source their compute, by early 2021 they had accepted funding from CoreWeave (a small cloud computing company) and SpellML (a cloud infrastructure company) in the form of access to powerful GPU clusters that are necessary for large scale machine learning research. On Feb 10, 2022, they released GPT-NeoX-20B, a model similar to their prior work but scaled up thanks to the resources CoreWeave provided. In 2022, many EleutherAI members participated in the BigScience Research Workshop, working on projects including multitask finetuning, training BLOOM, and designing evaluation libraries. Engineers at EleutherAI, Stability AI, and NVIDIA joined forces with biologists led by Columbia University and Harvard University to train OpenFold, an open-source replication of DeepMind's AlphaFold2. In early 2023, EleutherAI incorporated as a non-profit research institute run by Stella Biderman, Curtis Huebner, and Shivanshu Purohit. This announcement came with the statement that EleutherAI's shift of focus away from training larger language models was part of a deliberate push towards doing work in interpretability, alignment, and scientific research. While EleutherAI is still committed to promoting access to AI technologies, they feel that "there is substantially more interest in training and releasing LLMs than there once was", enabling them to focus on other projects. In July 2024, an investigation by Proof news found that EleutherAI's The Pile dataset includes subtitles from over 170,000 YouTube videos across more than 48,000 channels. The findings drew criticism and accusations of theft from YouTubers and others who had their work published on the platform. In 2025, Stella Biderman served as executive director. Aviya Skowron served as head of policy and ethics. Nora Belrose served as head of interpretability, and Quentin Anthony was head of HPC. Research According to their website, EleutherAI is a "decentralized grassroots collective of volunteer researchers, engineers, and developers focused on AI alignment, scaling, and open-source AI research". While they do not sell any of their technologies as products, they publish the results of their research in academic venues, write blog posts detailing their ideas and methodologies, and provide trained models for anyone to use for free.
