Azure can do the lot. You'll probably want to use Azure Blob Storage for the initial upload, then use queues and the worker role functionality to do the encoding and other processing. Then you can store the resulting file back in Blob storage, and have an index either in Azure Tables or SQL Azure, depending on the architecture of the rest of the application. And yes, an Azure Web role can quite happily host static content, standard dynamic ASPX pages, and a whole lot more (and can do it all on your own domain). I suggest you grab the Windows Azure SDK (from http://www.microsoft.com/windowsazure/ ) and take a look through the documentation. Your example scenario is pretty simple actually, and working through the samples should give you all the information you need. Good luck!
