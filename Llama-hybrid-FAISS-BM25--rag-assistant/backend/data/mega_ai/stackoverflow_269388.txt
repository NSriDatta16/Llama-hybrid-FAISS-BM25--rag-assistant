Seriously, especially for simple databases, your SQL Server has a great SQL parser built in. Create a schema and load it up. Compare the data, then drop the schema when you're done. If you're afraid of running the DDL, then perhaps using one of the several, lightweight, embedded servers will do the job for you (like Derby if you run Java). Then you get the parsed SQL and access to the tables just like you do now. You have the database, you may as well leverage it if you can.
