Function pointer in a struct with same argument type

I am trying to make a struct which has a function pointer for a function that takes the same struct as an argument. I have this at the moment. typedef struct sharedData { sem_t* forks; int id; void (*forkFunc)(sharedData*); }; I am getting errors like error: expected ‘)’ before ‘*’ token and warnings like warning: no semicolon at end of struct or union warning: useless storage class specifier in empty declaration What am I doing wrong here?
