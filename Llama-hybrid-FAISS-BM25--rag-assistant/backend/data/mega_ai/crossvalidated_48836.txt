Stationary matrix given a transition matrix

I am given the following transition matrix $$P= \pmatrix{ 1-\alpha & \alpha \\ \beta & 1-\beta}, \ \alpha,\beta \in (0,1)$$ with the states $S=\{1,2\}$. I want to determine the stationary distribution $\pi$ of the Markov chain determined by a starting distribution and the transition matrix $P$. We have the system: $\pi(1)=(1-\alpha)\cdot \pi(1) + \beta\cdot\pi(2)$ $\pi(2)=\alpha\cdot \pi(1) + (1-\beta)\cdot\pi(2)$ When I substitute for $\pi(2)$ from the first equation in the second, I get $0=0$. However, the answer should be: $$\pi(1)=\frac{\beta}{\alpha+\beta},\pi(2)=\frac{\alpha}{\alpha+\beta}$$. What am I doing wrong? Thank you for your time.
