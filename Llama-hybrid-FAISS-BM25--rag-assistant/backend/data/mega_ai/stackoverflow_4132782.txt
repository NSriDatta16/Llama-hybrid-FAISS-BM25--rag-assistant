If you absolutely want to do this, with global variables, I suspect that SET and SYMBOL-VALUE (and using symbols instead of strings) might do the trick. It definitely falls in the "hm, yes, you can do it that way, but I am not convinced it's the best way" territory, though. However, you are most probably better off either using a hash-table or (skipping storage completely, if there's no need to mutate what A1 means further down the line) a function that parses the letter and digit apart and calculates the relevant value.
