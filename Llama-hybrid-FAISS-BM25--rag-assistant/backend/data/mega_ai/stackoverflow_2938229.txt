You can use OAuth , AuthSub , or ClientLogin . ClientLogin is simplest (it just uses a username/password), but discouraged because it requires users to turn over their credentials to you. AuthSub and OAuth do not. Google's PHP library currently seems to only support AuthSub ( PHP example ) and ClientLogin.
