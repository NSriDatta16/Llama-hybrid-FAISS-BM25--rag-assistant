Running MSBuild script on development machine

I have an MSBuild script which performs a lot of tasks, as it is run on our build server. I want the script to be run each time a developer builds from Visual Studio on their local development machine, so that a) the build process they are runnning locally is the same as that run by the build server so any problems in the build can be identified immediately by the developer b) many of the operations of the build script are run on local builds, for example running of unit tests, generation of code coverage reports etc How is this possible in Visual Studio (2008)? Note I am running a single solution product with multiple projects.
