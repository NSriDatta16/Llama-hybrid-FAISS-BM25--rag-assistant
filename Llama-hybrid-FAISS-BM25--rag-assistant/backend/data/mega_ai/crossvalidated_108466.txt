Bayesian lasso vs ordinary lasso

Different implementation software are available for lasso . I know a lot discussed about bayesian approach vs frequentist approach in different forums. My question is very specific to lasso - What are differences or advantages of baysian lasso vs regular lasso ? Here are two example of implementation in the package: # just example data set.seed(1233) X So when should I go for one or other methods ? Or they are same ?
