NLP to detect duplicates for very technical language

I have the following scenario, to detect duplicate products based on the description fields. The Description Field contains product technical name, dimensions, characteristics. My model needs to consider that different annotation and abbreviations might have been used for technical names, text errors in data entries, similar/different dimensions or characteristics might still point to the same product. Therefore, I think that applying a normal fuzzy matching or other NLP text matching will not perform well in my case. I trying to approach this problem as a learning/supervised model, but still not sure how so any suggestion/idea is very appreciated.
