I suppose I can find the version of the trunk, just before I made the branch and use that as the starting point of the changeset. Seems awkward though. Is there a more elegant solution? Edit: yes there is a more elegant solution. I was wrong. A branch, even a branch created from the working directory retains all the history of the trunk prior to the split. I am using TortoisSVN, so all I had to do was uncheck "Stop on copy/rename" in the log window to see the versions prior to the split. Then I simply used the version immediately before the creation of the branch as the start of my change set. There was no problem after all.
