The component you're looking at comes as a precompiled silverlight application that you just include in an HTML page and configure to get it working the way you want. If you want to get it onto a canvas inside your own silverlight app, you will need to crack open the source code and pull out the libraries needed for the component. If you take a look at the Page.xaml file included in the source, you will see that the xmlns "v" is bound to Vertigo.SlideShow.Controls in the Vertigo.SlideShow assembly. The rest of the xaml in that file can then be used to create a canvas that hosts the slide show control: Once you have that sorted, turn your attention to the page's code-behind file which contains a ton of event wire-up code that is probably needed to get the control working.
