I work on similar project, few hints: -You talk about tracking -> you have a video -> how many FPS (frames per second) does it have? Each frame is 25MB? Thats huge, neural nets does not need such high quality video, is there a possibility to compress the images to speed things up? Most of the common neural nets are trained on relatively small images, like 256 x 256 pixel or so. -Yeah, you can do background substraction to detect object (check which pixels / areas differ from background by some threshold and cluster them by something like mean shift clustering). It will not have the highest accuracy, but may be good for your case. -You can use neural nets (or other techinques, e.g. HOG + SVM) for object detection. (YOLO is good and slow, variants of Single Shot Detector or tiny-YOLO are faster, you can find many pretrained model) . Hovewer, the problem of tracking is more complicated than classification, you need to pair the same object between consecutive frames, and / or decide that new object enters the scene. For simple problems, you can match the object by distance of their bounding boxes, maybe using Kalman filter. If you expect the object to move closely each other, the problem become harder. One way is to extract some descriptors of the object (e.g. average color) and match them also by this information. -you may be interested in this paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07402 which deals with tracking people on the video with descriptor obtained by another neural net.
