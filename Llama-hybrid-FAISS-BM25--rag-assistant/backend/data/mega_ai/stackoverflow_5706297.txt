My understanding is that 8-bits colour depth means there is 8-bits per pixel (i.e. one byte) and that Red, Gren and Blue are all this value. e.g. greyscale=192 means Red=192, Green=192, Blue=192. There is no 7 bits plus another 1 bit. AFAIK, you can just use a normal average. However I would use long for the sum and make sure each byte is unsigned i.e. `b & 0xff EDIT: If the grey scale is say 128 (or 0x80), I would expect the RGB to be 128,128,128 or 0x808080.
