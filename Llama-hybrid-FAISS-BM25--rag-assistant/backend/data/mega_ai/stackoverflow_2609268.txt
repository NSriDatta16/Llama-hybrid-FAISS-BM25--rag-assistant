Mysql Replication

My current database design uses MyIsam mainly as the storage engine, I wonder if its possible to split some of the tables into MyIsam and some into Innodb in the same database. Reason of switching some of the tables to Innodb is because i need row-based locking which Innodb offers. I am not too sure whether this would have any effect on replication?
