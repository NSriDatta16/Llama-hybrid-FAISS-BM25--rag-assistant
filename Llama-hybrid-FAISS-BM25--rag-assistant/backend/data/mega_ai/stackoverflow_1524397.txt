OpenMP in Visual Studio 2005

I am attempting to use OpenMP to create a parallel for loop in Visual Studio 2005 Professional. I have included omp.h and specified the /openmp compiler flag. However, I cannot get even the simplest parallel for loop to compile. #pragma omp parallel for for ( int i = 0; i The above produces Compiler Error C3005 at the #pragma line. Google hasn't been much help. I only found one obscure Japanese website with a user having similar issues. No mention of a resolution. A standard parallel block compiles fine. #prgram omp parallel { // Do some stuff } That is until you try to add a for loop. #pragma omp parallel { #pragma omp for for ( int i = 0; i The above causes Compiler Error C3001. It seems 'for' is confusing to the compiler, but it shouldn't be. Any ideas?
