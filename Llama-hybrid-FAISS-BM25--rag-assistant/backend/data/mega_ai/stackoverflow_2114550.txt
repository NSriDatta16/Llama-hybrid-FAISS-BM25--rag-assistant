These days, I always default to using InnoDB, especially on the write-intensive tables you mention where MyISAM suffers from full table locking. Here's a to-the-point comparison. Reasons to use MyISAM: Tables are really fast for select-heavy loads Table level locks limit their scalability for write intensive multi-user environments. Smallest disk space consumption Fulltext index Merged and compressed tables. Reasons to use InnoDB: ACID transactions Row level locking Consistent reads – allows you to reach excellent read write concurrency. Primary key clustering – gives excellent performance in some cases. Foreign key support. Both index and data pages can be cached. Automatic crash recovery – in case MySQL shutdown was unclean InnoDB tables will still - recover to the consistent state- No check / repair like MyISAM may require. All updates have to pass through transactional engine in InnoDB, which often decreases - performance compared to non-transactional storage engines. The above was taken from this site , which no longer seems to be working.
