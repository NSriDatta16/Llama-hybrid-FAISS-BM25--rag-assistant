Additional to the points mentioned before, using an RTOS may also be useful if you need support for standard storage devices (SD, Compact Flash, disk drives ...) standard communication hardware (Ethernet, USB, Firewire, RS232, I2C, SPI, ...) standard communication protocols (TCP-IP, ...) Most RTOSes provide these features or are expandable to support them
