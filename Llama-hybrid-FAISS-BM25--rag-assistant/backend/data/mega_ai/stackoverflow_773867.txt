[(MyGameAppDelegate*)[[UIApplication sharedApplication] delegate] HandleTouchEnded: firstTouch]; is the exact same as [(MyGameAppDelegate*)[[UIApplication sharedApplication] delegate] HandleTouchEnded: lastTouch]; You aren't getting bombarded by TouchsEnded. You are getting bombarded by the fact that your firstTouch and your lastTouch objects are the same object! You should put NSLog functions in you touchesBegan: and touchesEnded: next time to confirm the behaviour.
