Linear Regression vs Time Series

beginner to stats. So I have an open ended analysis regarding the happiness of certain countries. I am given the following data: 1) Country 2) Happiness Score (Dependent Variable) 3) GDP per Capita 4) Life Expectancy 5) 9 dummy variables indicating the region I have this data for 2015, 2016, 2017 and am trying to uncover some trends about how the independent variables affect happiness. I was going to do a basic multiple linear regression for each year to provide insight, but is there some way to tie these trends together over time? Or am I stuck with viewing this effect in "snapshots" for each year. Wondering if incorporating a time series somehow might be too difficult (again a beginner). Any help would be appreciated!
