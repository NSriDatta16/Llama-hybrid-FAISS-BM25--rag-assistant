LaunchAgents for GUI app

I would like to launch my app each time user logs-in. I added plist file to /Libray/LaunchAgents folder : KeepAlive LaunchOnlyOnce OnDemand RunAtLoad Label com.mycompany.myapp ProgramArguments /Applications/mayapp.app/Contents/MacOS/myapp All looks OK, application is being loaded , however when I quit my app it's launch back by launchd service. Which key shall I add/modify in my plist file to prevent constant relaunching of my application.
