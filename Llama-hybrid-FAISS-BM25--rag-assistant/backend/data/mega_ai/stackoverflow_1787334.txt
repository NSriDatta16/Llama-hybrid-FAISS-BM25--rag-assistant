Depending on size of your image, Apache should handle this with no problem at all. We have an Apache serving 2000 request/seconds, the average size of response is 12K. The machine has 32GB memory so all our content is cached. Here are some tuning tips, Use threaded MPM like worker, with lots of threads open (We have 256). Use mod_cache so all the images will be in memory Allocate as much memory as possible to the Apache process When you say memcache, do you mean the memcached server? Running memcached will be slower because the latency on TCP connection (even though it's loopback) is much larger than direct memory access. If you can fit all your images in memory, a RAM disk will also help a lot.
