magento template xml: add a static block to the product description of all products in specific category

Using Magento 1.4.1.1 or 1.5.0.0 and given products that are associated with a specific category, I need to append a static block to the product description in single view. I can create the static blocks (measurement images) and add simple append code in local.xml. However, I cannot figure out how to limit the application of the append to products of certain categories only . EG: All shoe product single view pages (in shoe category, of course) should display a shoe size measurement image, skirts a skirt size measurement image, etc. I don't really want to go so far as overriding the template... just want to append a block!
