Performing ADF Test on re-ordered time series

I have a weekly time series $T$ . I am interested in the stationarity of the monthly data instead. As the length of the time series data is limited, can I perform ADF test on the re-ordered time series $T^{'}$ : $$t_0,t_4,t_8,...,t_1,t_5,t_9,...,t_2,t_6,t_{10}...,t_3,t_7,t_{11}...$$ ? I have read some literature (cannot remember the source) saying this technique can be used to estimate financial time series volatility without losing data.
