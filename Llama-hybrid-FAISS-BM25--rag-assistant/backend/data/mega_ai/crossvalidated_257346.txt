How to Train when Y is not available

I am reading this paper where the training has no labelled outputs. Consider the figure: Now there are no labelled outputs z. But they are still training it somehow. I see that it is reinforcement learning, but then reinforcement learning works in a different scenario where there are actions. I guess here they are sampling from some distribution the z values for the purpose of training, but how can that work, you need to have the ground truth values to compute the error. I am really not able to understand this method in the context of training in a supervised way. Please explain how you could explain how reinforcement learning can be used as a substitute for missing labels in supervised setting.
