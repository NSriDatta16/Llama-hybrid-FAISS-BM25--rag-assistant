$.ajax never returns the response text, it always returns the XMLHTTPRequest object created to make the Ajax call. You'll still need to define a success callback I think, e.g. one setting a local variable which you can then return. Standard disclaimer: Synchronous requests are a usually discouraged practice because they can freeze the current page.
