How to maintain an emacs-based knowledge base?

I've been using org-mode for a little while, I've kept it really simple for now, with only two files : one to act as an inbox, with remember-mode another where I stick just about anything that's been processed from the inbox This is great for managing somewhat 'actionable' items, but I keep adding things of a more general nature, that I won't be needing on a day-to-day basis (how-tos, reading notes etc), so it's getting slow and hard to manage. The material I'm concerning myself with doesn't fit the /projects/tasks/sub-tasks paradigms, they are more like little knowledge nuggets on selected topics, which are inherently more complex to classify and manage. I've been wondering what kind of structure could be used to handle that kind of information (classification and retrieval), and if there are maybe other modes that could help with the job ? I guess there is no pre-made answer to this question, since everyone may have different needs. Noufal gave good conceptual tips that I'll keep in mind, but overall, the accepted answer provided more pragmatic views on this, the linked resource was a GREAT read.
