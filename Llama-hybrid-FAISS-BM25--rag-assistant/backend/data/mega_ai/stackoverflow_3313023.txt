Why do the characters ÌÌÌÌ get stuck onto the begining of my strings?

I have been developing some computer vision tools with openCV, but every time that I pass a string into an openCV function, the characters ÌÌÌÌ get tagged onto the beginning. At first this was just annoying, but now I am trying to use openCV's fileStorage tools and the ÌÌÌÌ characters are making my file names unreadable. Note: the characters only get added when I pass strings into the new c++ style openCV functions. If I use the old C style functions the strings come out fine. example: I enter this: namedWindow("CBImage", 1); . . . imshow("CBImage", Frame); But the window title reads ÌÌÌÌCBImage I don't think that the problem is necessarily specific to openCV; I think it has to do with string use in general. check this link out the coder seems to be experiencing a similar problem. http://www.sfml-dev.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1257&sid=5cfa50b780e47685d1c03296adffa8ed any thoughts? thanks Thank you all for your help. KennyTM's origional suggestion did fix the problem. I had to replace my cv cvaux cvcore and highgui libraries with the debug versions (they may have to be built depending on which version of openCV you are running check your lib folder in your openCV directory).
