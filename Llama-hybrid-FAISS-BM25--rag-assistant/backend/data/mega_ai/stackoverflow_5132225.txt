How to capture stdout/log output of an agent in SLIME?

I send a task to an agent, but can't see the output of any print statements I've put into the function. How do I trace code execution on agents? EDIT: Turns out I do get the output in the console, but not in SLIME. The question now is, how to see the output in SLIME?
