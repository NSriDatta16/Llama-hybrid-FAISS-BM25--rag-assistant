Edit: This method is no longer supported in newer versions of lme4. Use the lmerTest package as suggested in this answer by pbx101 . There is a post on the R list by lme4's author for why p-values are not displayed. He suggests using MCMC samples instead, which you do using the pvals.fnc from the languageR package: library("lme4") library("languageR") model=lmer(...) pvals.fnc(model) See http://www2.hawaii.edu/~kdrager/MixedEffectsModels.pdf for an example and details.
