For example I have sampled 50 trees in my study area and for each tree I have tree height and annual precipitation at that location. This is what I mean by they are organized by pair. So I plot $x$ vs $y$ and I would like to know if there is any correlation between the two; does annual precipitation predict tree height, or the other way around? I have used R to test if there is any linear correlation with the function lm(y~x) and have $p
