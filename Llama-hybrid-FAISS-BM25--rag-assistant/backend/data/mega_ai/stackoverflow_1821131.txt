Sure it can be done, but it won't be trivial If you want it to work exactly as in Excel (click & hold + drag & release) this will be a more complex job than thought at the first moment. You will most certainly display values in a certain column in your table, but when you select those values, browsers usually select text according to flow. Meaning you will get selected text like (v is the value column): v | | |x| |x|x|x| |x|x|x| and not v | | |x| | | |x| | | |x| as you would actually want. For the last one to make it work, you'll have to actually disable text selection (using onselectstart event), and then use drag & drop events to programatically select certain cells in your values column. You could also use a less intuitive way (that will work differently as in Excel) of using cell click events for this to make you code shorter and simpler.
