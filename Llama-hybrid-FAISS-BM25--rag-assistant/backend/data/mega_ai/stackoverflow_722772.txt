ASP.NET 2.0 Security Membership Provider Pattern

I am creating a website in ASP MVC. Can anyone give me some advice on using the built-in membership provider in the following way. I want my users to create an Administrative account for themselves and then create accounts for the people in their organization, or the people that they want to give access to. I guess in a Database it will look something like this: Companies have Administrators. Administrators can give users access. I am sure this pattern is used all over the place, I am just not sure how to implement it. Especially using the membership providers. Thanks, David
