Using Interface Builder for UITableViews

I'm very early in the iPhone development learning process. I'm trying to get my head around various pieces. Right now I've just taken the basic NavigationController template and I'm trying to create a simple grouped table view with a couple of text fields. What I can't seem to do is to get Interface Builder to allow me to drop a UITableViewCell into a UITableView so that I can then add a text field to the Cell. Is this even possible (it would seem that its supposed to be given the fact that UITableViewCell is a draggable control)? If not, does that mean all of that is code I will need to just write myself?
