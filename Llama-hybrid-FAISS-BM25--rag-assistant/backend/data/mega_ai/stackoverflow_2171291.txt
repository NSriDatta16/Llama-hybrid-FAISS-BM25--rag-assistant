iPhone .htaccess redirect loop

I've a webapp at www.mysite.com/myapp/ and I'd like to redirect users visiting my app from iPhone to www.mysite.com/myapp/i/ using an .htaccess file in /myapp folder. What I've tried so far is: RewriteEngine on RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} iPhone RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/myapp/ RewriteRule .* /myapp/i/ [R] It enters an infinite redirecting loop... I understand that the problem is that the condition is verified after the redirect too, but I can't solve the problem... Any help? Thanks guys...
