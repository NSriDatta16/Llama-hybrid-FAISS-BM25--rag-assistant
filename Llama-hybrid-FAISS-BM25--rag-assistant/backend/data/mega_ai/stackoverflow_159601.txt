I would prefer that if you choose the database route. One of the main reasons is that you can perform many different functions easily when using database. These functions include sorting, paging, grouping etc. You can also use the power of OR mappers to simply your coding and achieve the persistence, retrieval operations with very few lines of code. The bottom line is go with the database!
