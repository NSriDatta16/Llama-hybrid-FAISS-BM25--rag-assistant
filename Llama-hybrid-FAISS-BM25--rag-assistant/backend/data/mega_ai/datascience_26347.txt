Compound Annual Growth Rate Function in R Statistics

I need to calculate the compound annual growth rate for two periods of time: 2014 & 2009. I'm currently working with Excel, I have two columns with data for each year (One column with only data of 2009 and the other only with data of 2014), where each row contains info for 2009 & 2014 for certain category. I've been trying to calculate the CAGR between the data for each row, but I can't seem to find a function to do precisely that in "R". I found a package with a growth.rate function for time series, but it doesn't take my data in the order I need (it uses bayes method for velocity of growth, which I donÂ´t need). Is there any package in "R" where I can get especially that rate? Any tips in how I can accommodate the data so that R reads row per row and calculates like that?
