In terms of context, it is important that you first think about the distribution & type of your independent and dependent (or explanatory and response) variables before selecting a method. What is a Likert-type item ? There is disagreement on specifically what type of measurement a Likert answer is. Some schools believe that it should be classified as interval-level data, while others believe that it should be treated as ordered-categorical data. Regardless of which school you come from, it is important to realize that a Likert-type answer is not continuous. Regression, linear regression, is used when you have a continuous response variable. This is not the case here, since you cannot choose affinity or attachment level 1.36471284. Unfortunately, you can only choose level 1 or 2 as an example. Since you have a categorical response, immediately, you should be thinking about techniques that could handle categorical responses. Going down this path, the first place you might start is logistic regression . This assumes that we have a categorical response variable with really 2 outcomes. A great resources that you can consult if you want to put these into action in R can be found here . Now, this doesn't seem to fit our case, because, I would assume that you have many different levels of your response or dependent variable. Thus, we might look to extend the logit model, and use a multinomial logit model . Conveniently, UCLA also has an excellent set of resources that you can refer to if you were to use R to solve these problems, which I would recommend . Finally, these models, can be more broadly classified into a category of generalized linear models , or GLM's. I won't go into detail here. That said, Princeton has an excellent resource page here that can help provide you with more context on GLM's and how to use them in R .
