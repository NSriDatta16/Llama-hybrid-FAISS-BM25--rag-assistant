Difference-in-difference-in-differences estimator

Two towns, $X$ and $Y$. In each town: Pool cross-sections of male and female hourly wages, one from the year before a wage-discrimination policy took effect and one from the year after. Consider the following model: $wage_i=\beta_0+\beta_1after_i+\beta_2female_i+\beta_3X_i +\beta_4after_iX_i +\beta_5after_ifemale_i +\beta_6X_ifemale_i +\beta_7after_ifemale_iX_i+u_i$ where $after_i=1$ if date after gender-wage discrimination policy; $0$ if date before gender-wage discrimination policy. The gender wage discrimination policy only applies to females in town $X$. $female_i=1$ if female; $0$ if male. $X_i=1$ if town $X$; $0$ if town $Y$. The treatment group is females from town $X$. Does this model measure the effect of a gender-wage discrimination policy on the average wage of women relative to men in town $X$ compared to the average wage of women relative to men in town $Y$? In this model, the affect of the policy is captured by $\beta_7$:the 'difference-in-difference-in-differences' estimator. For $\hat{\beta_7}$ to be interpreted as the causal effect of the policy on wages in town $X$, $E(u_i|female_i, after_i, X_i)=0$ has to be assumed. Does this mean that once gender, date of policy, and town have been controlled for, there exist no unobserved factors which change over both town and time that affect wages?
