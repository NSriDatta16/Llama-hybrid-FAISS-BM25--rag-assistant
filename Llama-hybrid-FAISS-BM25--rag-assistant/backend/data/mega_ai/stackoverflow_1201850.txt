Entity Framework Associations

I've created a Model with Entity Framework from three database tables: Agents AgentsGroups Groups AgentsGroups is a simple table with three columns: 1 id and two foreign keys linking Agents and Groups (every Agent can have multiple Groups). Pretty basic stuff. Entity Framework correctly recognizes the relationships between the table. Now, with LINQPad I am able to get the names of all the groups associated with an agent starting from the agent ID: from a in Agents join ag in AgentsGroups on a.Code equals ag.AgentCode join g in Groups on ag.GroupCode equals g.Code where a.Code == 10199 select g.Name This, though, doesn't work on the very program as, in fact, AgentCode and GroupCode are mapped as Associations, not fields. I guess I have to use Include, but I've never used it, so the help requested is: how could I translate the given semi-working linq expression in a similar expression giving out the Group Names but using Associations? Thanks in advance
