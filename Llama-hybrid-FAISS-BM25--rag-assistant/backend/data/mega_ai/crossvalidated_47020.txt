Plotting logistic regression interaction (categorical) in R

Hello I have the following logistic model with a categorical variable interaction which I wish to plot in R but I am struggling to find any solutions - M The ethnic variable has three categories (White, Black & Other) The 'other' category interacts with the variable placement to produce a significant result. I've tried the following but it isn't displaying a line: disorder_1 How would I plot this on a graph? Thank you in advance! Sarah
