I don't know of a way to find all methods whose return type is any arbitrary implementation of java.util.Collection (including ones you may define yourself). If you can accept solutions that are a bit more limited, then a few possibilities come to mind: Go to any class that imports java.util.Collection, double-click on "Collection", right-click on "Collection", and select "References > Project". Likewise for any particular collection type of interest. Go to any method returning a collection type, double-click on its return type, and search for that type as above. Go to any class that imports any java.util. anything , drag across "java.util." omitting the class following that package prefix , and right-click-search for project references as above. For all of the above, the "Search" view will show you an expandable outline of the places in the project where the selected item occurs. You can traverse that outline (using either the keyboard -- with enter to select -- or the mouse -- clicking to select) to examine places those uses. I don't see a way to limit the viewed references to "method return type", but at least you'll be able to move quickly to relevant places in the code to eyeball for the specific usage type of interest. (With all these, you can click on the small downward-pointing triangle in the top of the "Search" tab and filter on the type of usage to be included in the display, such as excluding import statements.)
