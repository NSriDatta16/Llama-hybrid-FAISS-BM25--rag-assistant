neuralnet package fitted values issue

The problem I've encountered after trying to train neural networks isn't a new one : The fitted values I'm getting are all the same. Here's some oversimplified code as an example: a Previous answers I have stumbled upon suggest using nnet instead. I am getting the same results though, unless I set the decay argument to a value not equal to 0. Instead of blindly using the decay option, just because it seems to "work" though, I would appreciate understanding what goes wrong with my neuralnet model to begin with.
