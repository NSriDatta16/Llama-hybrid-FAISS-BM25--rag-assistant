There already is something similar to an 'embedded language preprocessor' for Java and .NET in the SQL domain: http://ibatis.apache.org/ Also, what people usually do is to use a full fledged ORM, like Hibernate , to abstract away SQL. Mind you, these tools do not allow to store the SQL strings in Java code itself, but serve a similar intent. I personally see no benefit in storing the SQL strings in the code itself, as that is usually messier. Having all the SQL neatly written in a specific file aids reusability and maintainability of your SQL. They do allow SQL as strings if the need should arise, but that is usually as a last resort measure (when the ORM tool doesn't have a good abstraction for your use case.) EDIT: I do think mixing SQL and code (be it OO or not) is fragile and not desirable. It's a lot better to have a centralized place to store your queries. This is the iBATIS approach.
