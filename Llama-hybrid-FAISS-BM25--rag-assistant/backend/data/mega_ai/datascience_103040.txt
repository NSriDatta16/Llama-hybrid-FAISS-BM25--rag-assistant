To provide an answer after a quick read of the sources. Selection of predictors for counter-factual outcomes (the outcome if the policy was not effective), is done automaticaly via Bayesian Spike and Slab method which is designed for automatic selection in mind. Both the original paper and Wikipedia article state so (emphasis mine): The model consists of three main components: Kalman filter. The technique for time series decomposition. In this step, a researcher can add different state variables: trend, seasonality, regression, and others. Spike-and-slab method. In this step, the most important regression predictors are selected . Bayesian model averaging. Combining the results and prediction calculation.
