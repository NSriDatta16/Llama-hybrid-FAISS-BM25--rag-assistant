This is better documented at ?car::influence.mixed.models groups: a character vector containing the name of a grouping factor or names of grouping factors; if more than one name is supplied, then groups are defined by all combinations of levels of the grouping factors that appear in the data. If omitted, then each individual row of the data matrix is treated as a "group" to be deleted in turn. Equivalently, specifying groups=".case" deletes one observation at a time. system.time(ii If you wanted to check the sensitivity with respect to a particular observation, you could always update(move, data = dist_moved[-11,]) and compare the coefficients. You could also use data = subset(dist_moved, local.density or something similar based on dplyr::filter ... It looks like HLMdiag::leverage() only works on linear mixed models. Faster influence measures would be possible if we could extract/efficiently compute the hat matrix for glmmTMB fits, which we can't (yet) .
