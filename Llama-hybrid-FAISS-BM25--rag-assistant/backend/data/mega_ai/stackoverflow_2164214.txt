Maybe you have deeper design issues if your class is implementing methods that you feel should be deleted. Anyways, Resharper can help you out here. http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/documentation/presentation/overview/code_generation/Generate_demo.htm Drag the slider to 10/69 to see the special "Implements interface" icon. Resharper tells you which interface requires the method. Edit: Also, if you mouse over the method name, it pops up text explaining where the method comes from. I'm not sure if this is part of Visual Studio or Resharper since I've used Resharper so long. Can anyone without Resharper installed confirm this?
