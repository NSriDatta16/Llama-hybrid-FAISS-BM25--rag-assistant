There's no way of doing exactly what you asked using the public SDK. The best answer I can think of is to track touch began and touch ended events for the UIWebView itself. Then, add a UIWebviewDelegate , and to this delegate's interface, add a boolean bLastTouchDidWander (name is purely for example) On a touch Down, you set bLastTouchDidWander to false. On a touch UP, you measure how far the touch moved. If it moved more than a set amount, consider this a "touch up outside", and set bLasTTouchDidWander to true. Then ,for the webView:shouldStartLoadWithRequest:navigationType: message of the UIWebViewDelegate , if bLastTouchDidWander is true, don't follow the link.
