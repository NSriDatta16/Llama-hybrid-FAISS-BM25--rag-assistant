How does one change the \paragraph formatting in LaTeX

This stems out of How can one number paragraphs in LaTeX? , which I asked earlier today: Running with Brent.Longborough 's suggestion for how to number paragraphs in a document: \setcounter{secnumdepth}{5} ... \paragraph{If we want to} \paragraph{do something} This results in LaTeX producing something likeso: 0.0.0.1 If we want to 0.0.0.2 do something How can one change the numbering scheme of \paragraph{} to produce something like: 1. If we want to 2. do something or alternatively A. If we want to B. do something Thank you.
