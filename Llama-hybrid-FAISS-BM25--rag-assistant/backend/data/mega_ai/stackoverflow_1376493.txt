You're absolutely right that the Alert will be popped up asynchronously with respect to the original DragEvent dispatch. Since you don't want the default datagrid behavior to kick in at that point, you need to call preventDefault() on receipt of the event, and then throw up your alert panel. Then, in the success branch of your alert handler, you could try to rethrow ( throw a new) DragEvent. Use a local variable to keep track of the original event details so that you can clone() or simply create a new event with the same properties. Basically, you're intercepting and interrupting the event flow and then attempting to resume it later. Haven't tried this myself, but that's what I'd explore first.
