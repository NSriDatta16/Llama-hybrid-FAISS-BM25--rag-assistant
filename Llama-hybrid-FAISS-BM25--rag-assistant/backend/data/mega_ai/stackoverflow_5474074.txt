Your question implies a textual storage of data in "flat files". MySQL is Relational Database which contains textual data, binary data, and data about the relationships between data. How the data is stored exactly is abstracted by the Storage Engine (InnoDB, MyISAM). For the average user and programmer it is not as important how the data is stored so much as how it is accessed, how the tables are structured, and how the tables relate to one another. With MySQL you either issue SQL commands from a command-line interface, use a GUI database interface, or use an API from within the programming language of your choice.
