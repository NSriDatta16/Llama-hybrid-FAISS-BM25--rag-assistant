SQL Server Management Studio, no New Project option

I used to organize my queries in a Projects/Solutions in Management Studio at work. But after I had installed SSMS at home I coulnd't find and option to create new project. In File-> New there is only New Query, and Policy but no Project/Solution. I do not also have SolutionExplorer View tab. I have the newest 64-bit version from here . Do I have install another version or change some settings?
