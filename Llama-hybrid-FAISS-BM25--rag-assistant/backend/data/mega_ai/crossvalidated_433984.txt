loss='mean_squared_error' We divide these terms into differentiable loss function that's used to train neural network weights, and quality metrics that are used to assess the quality of the training convergence. In your example, $$L = (Y - Y') ^ 2 / n$$ is the loss function which is minimzed along the training phase. The metrics will be shown in log and on plot to give you an indication of how good your model performs at this stage of the training phase. They are not used as optimization functions.
