GUI != Programming Asking which GUI will help you learn programming is like asking which grocery store will help you learn how to hunt for your own food. Using a GUI is not a way to learn programming . The power of R is that it's not GUI driven, it uses scripts which fundamentally allow for more more reproducible results. GUIs to demonstrate specific topics / Brief backpedaling That having been said, I do think it's useful to use a GUI to demonstrate a single specific topic . The latticist package is awesome for creating lattice graphs and learning lattice syntax. The PBSmodelling package has some wonderful examples of GUIs that allow you to run specific models, such as MCMV models. The TeachingDemos package is also seems to have some good demos of specific topics. Roll your own GUI The PBSmodelling package also has tools that allow you to make your own GUIs. This includes some amazing tools for project organization and documentation. Thank you Pacific Biological Station! Also, by using Rook and Apache you can also make powerful web-based GUI applications. Making your own GUI is not appropriate for beginners or the direct answer to your question. However, if you're an advanced user then you might want to consider making a GUI to demonstrate a particular topic. The installed "R" is a GUI (technically) It's worth noting that the installed version of R is a shortcut to Rgui.exe. I know that you're asking for a GUI that let's you access all of the base functionality of R by pointing and clicking, not a glorified wrapper for the command line. However, it's important to realize that a GUI wrapper for the command line is a GUI, and it's a valid answer to your question. The command line is the only way that you can get access to the rapidly evolving functionality of the power of R and the freshly packages authored daily. So... Again, the best GUI is R Studio The best interface for R is definitely R Studio . For some people the StatET / Eclipse interface is important for it's powerful features, but R Studio is rapidly overtaking those features and adding new ones. Revolution R (the commercial version) also has a GUI, but it's not so great unless you are deeply passionate about the design of MS Visual Studio. However, you can access Revolution's build of R though R Studio or Eclipse, so that's a pretty neat trick too.
