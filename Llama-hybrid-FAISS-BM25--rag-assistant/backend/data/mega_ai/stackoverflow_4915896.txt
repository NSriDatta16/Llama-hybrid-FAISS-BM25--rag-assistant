I can tell u can use SQLyog php-mysql tunnel, but even this is a fast tunnel script u have to think about some delay process, when u get big or huge results this has to be processed first by script before it send answer to your application, so if that software its not time critical one, will just work fine with this, otherwise, i encourage u to get a better hosting solution, even outside your country.
