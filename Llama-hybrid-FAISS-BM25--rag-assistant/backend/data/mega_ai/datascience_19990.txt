How can I deal with data that is on the format "Image + single number"?

Let say I have a data set where every sample is an image of a landscape and a temperature associated with the landscape. How do I incorporate the temperature into my convolutional neural network for classifying if the data is e.g a winter or summer landscape? Can I simply add the temperature as a feature after the feature learning part of the network? I can not find similar questions but maybe this has a name that I am not aware of?
