Converting file encoding after reading StreamReader in Compact Framework

I read the text file line by line, so far so good. I just use this: using (StreamReader sr = new StreamReader(this._inFilePath)) { string line; int index = 0; // Read and display lines from the file until the end of // the file is reached: while ((line = sr.ReadLine()) != null) { //skip empty lines if (line == "") { continue; } } } It has now come to my attention that I may need to convert the file to Unicode after reading it. How is it done? Does anyone use Convert class?
