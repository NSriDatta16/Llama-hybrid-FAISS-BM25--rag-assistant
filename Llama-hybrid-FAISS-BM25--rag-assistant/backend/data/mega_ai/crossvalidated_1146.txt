Control A major aspect of the dynamic modelling literature is associated with control. This kind of work spans a lot of disciplines from politics/economics (see, e.g. Stafford Beer), biology (see e.g. N Weiner's 1948 work on Cybernetics) through to contemporary state space control theory (see for an intro Ljung 1999). Control is kind of related to Epstein's 9 and 10, and Shane's answers about human judgement / regulation, but I thought it made sense to be explicit. Indeed, at the end of my engineering undergraduate career I would have given you a very concise response to the uses of modelling: control, inference and prediction. I guess inference, by which I mean filtering/smoothing/dimension-reduction etc, is maybe similar to Epstein's points 3 and 8. Of course in my later years I wouldn't be so bold as to limit the purposes of modelling to control, inference and prediction. Maybe a fourth, covering many of Epsteins's points, should be "coercion" - the only way you should "educate the public" is to encourage us to make our own models...
