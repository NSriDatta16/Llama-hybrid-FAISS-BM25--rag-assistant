Relationship between variance of population and variance of average of population

I'm curious if there's a fixed relationship between the variance of the average of a sample and the variance of the sample. Here, I'm taking the variance of the trailing two rows of Series A and Series B (Var of Sample) and comparing it to the variance of the trailing two a averages (Var of Average). If provided the variance of the sample, could we compute the variance of the average knowing only n ?
