Metropolis-Hastings is one of many mcmc algorithms. Those algorithms are designed for sampling from arbitrary probability distributions. If you just want to obtain frequentist point estimates for the parameters of logistic regression, then you don't need MCMC sampling. Moreover, you won't be able to use it for this purpose, since estimating the parameters is an optimization problem and MCMC aren't optimization algorithms. Metropolis-Hastings algorithm does not do the estimation. You would use MCMC when you treat logistic regression as a Bayesian model , i.e. assume priors for the parameters and are interested in learning the posterior distribution of the parameters. In such a case, MCMC is used to sample from the posterior distribution to obtain a numerical approximation of it.
