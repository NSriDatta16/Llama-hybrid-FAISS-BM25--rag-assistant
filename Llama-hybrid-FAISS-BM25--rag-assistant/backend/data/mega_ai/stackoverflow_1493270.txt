jQuery Plugin Authoring: Cannot get basic example to work?

I'm trying to write a few plugins for jQuery, so as a starting point I went for the basic example shown in the documentation ( here ). This is the code I have, in a js file called jquery.test.js: (function($) { $.fn.myPlugin = function(settings) { var config = {'foo': 'bar'}; if (settings) $.extend(config, settings); this.each(function() { // element-specific code here alert('found P tag'); }); return this; }); })(jQuery); And here's the HTML: Plugin Test $(document).ready(function(){ $('p').myPlugin(); }); asdgasdgasg I'd expect this to pop up an alert for every paragraph tag in the page. However, when I load the page, nothing happens. Firebug gives me two errors: missing ; before statement http://playground.darthvader.com/jquery.test.js Line 16 $("p").myPlugin is not a function http://playground.darthvader.com/ol.html Line 11 I'm puzzled. Can anyone see what I've done wrong here? EDIT: It turned out there was a typo in the jQuery docs (well caught Ghommey), from which I was copying and pasting the code. I contacted the admins at the docs site, and it's now fixed.
