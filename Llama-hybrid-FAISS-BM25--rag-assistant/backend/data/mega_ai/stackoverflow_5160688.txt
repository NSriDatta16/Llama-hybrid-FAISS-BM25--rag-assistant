Organizing Django unit tests

Right now I have my Django unit tests living at mcif/tests.py . I would prefer to have something more like mcif/tests/foo_test.py , mcif/tests/bar_test.py , etc., but if I organize my tests that way, Django flips out. Is there a way to do what I'm trying to do or do I have to have all my tests in one file?
