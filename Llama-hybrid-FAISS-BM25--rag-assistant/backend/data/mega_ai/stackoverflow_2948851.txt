I mean WndProc, but the same applies for WinMain. How can you unit-test that? I do testing but not unit-testing: I do system/integration testing. If you exercise your (whole) application while it's running under a debugger/profiler/code coverage analyser, then of course you will find (and the coverage analyser will show) that WinMain etc. are being run (are being covered). The question then might be, how do you automate the system/integration testing of the whole application? You might have a test framework with automates driving the GUI; I don't know of any myself, but for example there's a list here . Alternatively, it might be acceptable (to the client) if the acceptance test suite is a sequence of non-automated/manual tests. See also Should one test internal implementation, or only test public behaviour?
