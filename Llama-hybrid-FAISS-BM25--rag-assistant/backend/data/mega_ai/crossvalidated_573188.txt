Confusion Regarding Bayesian Mixture of Gaussians

Following is the screenshot from the paper "Variational Inference: A Review for Statisticians". I am having confusion understanding equations (7) and (8). Can anyone please let me know whether my understanding regarding equation (7) is correct and if not, provide me the correct insight? Regarding equation (7): Regarding equation (8): Why are we integrating only over latent variable μ and not c? What does the statement "The integrand in Equation (8) does not contain a separate factor for each μk. (Indeed, each μk appears in all n factors of the integrand.)" mean? Could anyone provide me helpful resources to understand these equations better?
