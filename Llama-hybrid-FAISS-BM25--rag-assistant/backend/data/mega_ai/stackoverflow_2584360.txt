Returning null from getdatabase means you could not access the database. If you're running this as a java agent then it will run under your privileges. A server can be configured to restrict who can access databases via agents on a server. Try opening another database on the server that you have the same level of access to or a database you have manager access to. Doing this, checks to see if you can open databases via agents on the server. If you can't open this database either, then it sounds like a permission problem with the server. It's not the database itself, because you can access it via the Notes client. One way around it, is that you can can also tell the agent to run under the server's ID. This usually gets around access issues. The agent's security options is the last tab, on the "agent properties" dialog box. Note that this option can also be controlled via server settings, and you'll get an error message if you're not allowed to do this either. Let me know how you go..
