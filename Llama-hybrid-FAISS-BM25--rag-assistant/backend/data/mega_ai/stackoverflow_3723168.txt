How to copy a (Active)record between tables, partially?

In two tables mapped to ActiveRecord with unknown number of identical columns, e.g.: Table A Table B --------- --------- id id name name age email email is_member How can I (elegantly) copy all identical attributes from a record of Table A to a record of Table B , except the id attribute? For the example tables above, name and email fields should be copied.
