If you have a large corpus of text mapped with their respective topics, you can train a Siamese neural network where you have two inputs (one sentence and one topic) and output a similarity score based on whether they are related or not. This would require a good dataset with a good variety of similar and not similar pairs of (sentence, topic) to be effective. Furthermore, if you incorporate semantic information in your inputs (such as word embeddings or more advanced representations such as encoder outputs) the network will generalize better and be able to work with text outside of your training corpus, since the semantic information will be similar for new unseen but related data.
