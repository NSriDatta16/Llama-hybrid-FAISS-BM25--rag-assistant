it's as simple as not using a table for markup, as stated by Harmen. You're not displaying data after all, you're collecting data. I'll take for example the question 23 here: http://accessible.netscouts-ggmbh.eu/en/developer.html#fb1_22_5 On paper, it's good as it is. If you had to display the results, it'd probably be OK. But you can replace it with ... 4 paragraphs with a label and a select (option's would be the headers of the first line). One paragraph per line, this is far more simple.
