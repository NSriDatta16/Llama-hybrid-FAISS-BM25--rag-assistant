Crystal reports - out of memory exception

We have developed a set of crystal reports (not my idea) that are to recreate some sample PDF forms that we have been sent. We've imported background images (taken from the original PDF) for each page in the report and then we have dragged our data fields on top of these. Now, despite the original images that we are using for backgrounds being relatively small, the rpt file is extremely large (approx. 50 MB). This is a bit of a nuisance, but now when we deploy to the server, we're finding that we're getting intermittent out of memory errors when trying to run the report. Has anybody any ideas about: A better way to do this. A reason why this report file is so large (and how to reduce it). An idea why we're getting the out of memory errors.
