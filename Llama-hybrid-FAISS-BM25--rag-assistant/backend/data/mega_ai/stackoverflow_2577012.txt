Following is the one which I am looking for: From official site : CouchDB is a peer-based distributed database system, it allows for users and servers to access and update the same shared data while disconnected and then bi-directionally replicate those changes later. The CouchDB document storage, view and security models are designed to work together to make true bi-directional replication efficient and reliable. Both documents and designs can replicate, allowing full database applications (including application design, logic and data) to be replicated to laptops for offline use, or replicated to servers in remote offices where slow or unreliable connections make sharing data difficult. Any idea how the couchDB data can be protected using user accounts? e.g. Mysql needs user to login to use the data. I am looking only for a simple authentication, not for something fool proof. I just do not want the data to be open for editing. Encrypting the file system seems to be an overkill.
