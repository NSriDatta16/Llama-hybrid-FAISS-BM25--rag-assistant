Split array into sub-arrays based on value

I was looking for an Array equivalent String#split in Ruby Core, and was surprised to find that it did not exist. Is there a more elegant way than the following to split an array into sub-arrays based on a value? class Array def split( split_on=nil ) inject([[]]) do |a,v| a.tap{ if block_given? ? yield(v) : v==split_on a [[1, 2], [4, 5], [7, 8]] #=> [[1, 2], [4, 5], [7, 8], [10]] Edit : For those interested, the "real-world" problem which sparked this request can be seen in this answer , where I've used @fd's answer below for the implementation.
