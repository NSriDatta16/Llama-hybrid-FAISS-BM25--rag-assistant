I suppose it depends on the logic the corresponding db function (sp/udf) has to execute. If for e.g. we are interested in the number of times the particular db function has executed we'd definitely need to do some data manipulation and updates on various tables. Hence we'd have to go for stored procs here. If its a simple retrieval a udf will do.
