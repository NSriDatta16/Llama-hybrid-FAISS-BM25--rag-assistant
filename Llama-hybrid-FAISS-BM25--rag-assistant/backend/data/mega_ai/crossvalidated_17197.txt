You will find everything non-Bayesian that you asked about it Frank Harrell's Regression Modeling Strategies . I would leave Bayesian recommendations to more knowledgeable folks (although I do have Gelman, Carlin, Stern and Rubin , as well as Gilks, Richardson and Speigelhalter , on my bookshelf). There should be a few Bayesian biostat books on the market. Update: McCullach and Nelder (1989) is a classic book on GLMs, of course. It was groundbreaking for its time, but I find it rather boring, frankly. Besides, it does not cover the later additions like residual diagnostics, zero-inflated models, or multilevel/hierarchical extensions. Hardin and Hilbe (2007) cover some of this newer stuff in good details with practical examples in Stata (where GLMs and extensions are very well implemented; Hardin used to work at Stata Corp. writing many of these commands, as well as contributing to the sandwich estimator).
