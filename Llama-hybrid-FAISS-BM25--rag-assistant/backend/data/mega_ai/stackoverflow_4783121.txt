iPhone Data Storage - understanding what is and what is not secure

I am developing my first iPhone application and currently considering whether to deploy the app packaged with data, instead of calling upon a web service for the info. The obvious benefits are for those situations where you have a poor/non-existent connection and i could easily write something that could update the client data periodically from within the app. What i am not sure about is how to store the data - sqlite, core data, plist or iphone file structure - Simply because i dont want someone unzipping the deployed application and getting their hands on the raw data. Is this actually feasable? or is pretty much everything accessible once its deployed as an app?
