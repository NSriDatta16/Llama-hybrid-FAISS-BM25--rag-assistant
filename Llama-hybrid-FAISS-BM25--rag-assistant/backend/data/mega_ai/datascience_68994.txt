I'll try to aswer your question one by one. Range of values is -7 to 7. Now, I am thinking about using a LSTM for text, but I am confused about the continuous output. RNNs, just like any other ANN, can output whatever you want. Just tweak its architecture and Loss in the way you need. Converting (normalizing the data between 0 and 1) and then after getting the output from network, denormalize the data, will this work? Yes, that would work and I suggest you this method. You implement an RNN with a single output node with Sigmoid function. Sigmoid is defined between 0 and 1, in this way it will fit your 0-1 perfectly. Usually MAE (Mean Absolute Error) works best to predict values in that range, but that's up to your preferences. Second approach, using a custom activation function? I prefer the first method you listed. However, you could theoretically define some form of "hard sigmoid" defined in the -7, 7 interval. This lets you avoid scaling your dependent variable, but it doesn't seem to me a superior method in any way.
