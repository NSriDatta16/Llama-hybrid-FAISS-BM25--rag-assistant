Multi- Class classification problem?

I have 5 classes with my data 0 - control 1 - case1 2 - case2 3 - case3 4 - case(other cases not yet discovered) should I consider case 4 as separate labeled data or is it logical to consider this as (0 - control) and combine the data with the control dataset and train the machine learning model? What happens if I want to combine 4 - case(other cases not yet discovered) and 0 - control and treat the whole as 0 - control ?
