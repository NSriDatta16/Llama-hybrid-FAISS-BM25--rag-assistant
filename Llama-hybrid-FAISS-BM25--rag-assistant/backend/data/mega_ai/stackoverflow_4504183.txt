Fetch a ContextMenu from a handle?

Is it possible to fetch a System.Windows.Forms.ContextMenu instance from a handle? By fetch I mean building it up from the handle, reading each item, etc. Attention, this is not a System.Windows.Forms.ContextMenuStrip . Been asked to give more info: I want to retrieve this menu because I have a natively borderless form on which I draw custom borders and I wish to keep the form's original system menu.
