Coding4fun Toolkit AboutPrompt declared in XAML?

I want to use the coding4fun AboutPrompt declared in XAMl instead of C#. I need something like this in my MainPage.XMAL: After that i want to show the AboutPrompt in the standard way: private void aboutPrompt1_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e) { prompt.Visibility = visibility.Visible; prompt.Show(); } The problem is that I get the Element is already the child of another element. exception. I know that I can use the VisualTreeHelper to workaround this but I need an elegant solution.
