You can start a virtual X-windows environment using xvfb . You can now start a regular browser to render the page and use a screencapture utility to capture the content of the window. It is not pretty, but straghtforward to do. WebKit is open-source and embeddable, maybe you can use this in a small native app to render on a canvas and save it to disk?
