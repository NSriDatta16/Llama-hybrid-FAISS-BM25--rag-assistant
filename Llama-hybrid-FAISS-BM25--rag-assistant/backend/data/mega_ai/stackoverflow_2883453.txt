Browser Client Side Storage aka a large Cookie

I need to store about 20-30k or data on the client side when using a website. I was using a cookie, but this is to small for my needs. Is there something else that I can use? I need to be able to do this via javascript. Server side storage is a last resort but not what I am looking for. I need it to work for Chrome, IE and firefox. Thanks Ian
