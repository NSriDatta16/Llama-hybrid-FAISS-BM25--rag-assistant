When modelling economic time series it is actually common to use the price index, such as the CPI, $p_{t}$. Then the first difference can be considered as inflation, $\Delta p_{t}$ so using the CPI is in fact more appropriate than using inflation. On another note then there is nothing wrong with modelling $I\left(0\right)$ and $I\left(1\right)$ variables jointly in a CVAR framework. It would just mean that the stationary $I\left(0\right)$ variables could be considered as an equilibrium relationship on their own. Another thing to note is that often prices are viewed as $I\left(2\right)$ and hence inflation will be $I\left(1\right)$. If this is the case then it is more apropriate to start out with a CVAR $I\left(2\right)$ model but this is not applicable to you since you state that inflation is $I\left(0\right)$.
