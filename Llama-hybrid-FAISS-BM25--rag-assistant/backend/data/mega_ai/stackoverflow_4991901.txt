If there are 25 records in TABLE1 that satisfy field8='value' and if it takes 20ms to select ... from table2 where field6=??? then 500ms is in the realm of expected time. So, it's quite meaningles to say each query takes 20ms, you'd also have to state how many records statisfy the field8 condition in TABLE1 and how many records on average satisfy a condition on TABLE2.FIELD6. But to eliminate all guessing you should have Oracle explain the query and display (or post) the explained plan here for further analysis. EDIT : Since there seems to be a 1:1 relationship between the criterias (and the query subsequently returns 1 record), 500ms is not expected. In this case I'd really stress the need for having the query explained. In case you're not familiar with it, you can do that like so: explain plan for select .... ; select * from table(dbms_xplan.display); And then post the result. This will allow us to help you better.
