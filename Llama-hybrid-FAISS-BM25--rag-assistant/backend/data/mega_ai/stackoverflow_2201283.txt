How do I export a DBML diagram from Visual Studio into an image?

I have a very pretty DBML diagram that I would like to preserve in our Design Documents. How do I get an image showing all of the tables in one go? I found How to export Visual Studio 2010 UML Modeling Diagrams but the slightly elegant solution of copying all the items and pasting them into an image editor doesn't work in this case. Am I stuck with Print Screen and manually stitching the images together?
