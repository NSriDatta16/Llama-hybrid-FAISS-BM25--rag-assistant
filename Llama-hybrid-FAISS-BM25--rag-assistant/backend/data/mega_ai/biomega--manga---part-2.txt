rganic materials, but to "download" such knowledge into herself as well as "hack" and manipulate the source of it (this ability manifesting in white luminescent "worms" that extend from her body and enter the target). As a child working for Microvolt, she used this to subdue Narain when the manifestation of his psychic abilities drove him insane; while her powers did help him regain control of his mind and powers, he has been terrified of her ever since, especially when her control over her own power (ironically) drove her mad. Because her powers work best upon organic material she is reflexively antagonized by anything non-organic, which develops into outright misanthropic technophobia. The Guardian of the Left (左断吏官, Sa-Danrikan) and the Guardian of the Right (右断吏官, U-Danrikan) Two superhuman swordsmen who serve Niardi exclusively. They are cyborgs encased in jet-black armor reminiscent of samurai, and carry no weapons other than high-tech katana slung over their shoulders (similar to the "Safeguard Swords" seen in Blame!). The Guardian of the Left is sent to kill Eon Green (but is killed by Zoichi) while the Guardian of the Right protects Niardi during her attack upon the PHS, where he kills Dr. Wildenstein and is later killed by Higuide. Public Health Department The Public Health Service (公衆衛生局, Kōshū-Eisei-Kyoku; "Public Sanitation Bureau"), also known as the "PHS", is a subsidiary of the DRF. Their headquarters is a monadnock. The PHS later turns against the DRF due to Niardi's outrageous intentions, but is quickly overrun by DRF forces. Narain Meghnad (ナレイン・メグナード, Narein Megunādo) The General (将軍, Shōgun) of the PHS, originally recruited by Niardi. Fearing Niardi and her powers as well as his own mortality, he changed himself repeatedly, hoping to immunize himself against her mind-reading; his current form is a huge, possibly mutated creature with several tentacles. He was the one who ordered the destruction of TOA Heavy Industries. Kahdal Spindal (カーダル・スピンダル, Kādaru Supindaru) A young woman that works for the PHS. She can cover herself in a semi-organic body suit that can be used for both offense and defense, and also possesses some form of psychokinesis. She is first seen taking Eon Green with her from the MSCF of 9JO. Zoichi later meets her in her human form and spends some time with her without knowing who she is. She appears to have some moral qualms regarding orders given her, but never questions her superiors. Higuide (ヒグイデ, Higaide) An extremely powerful Patrol Inspector working under Narain. He is highly proficient in the use of bladed weapons and combat techniques, as demonstrated when he is chosen by Narain to execute a fellow Patrol Inspector in a "duel" who was spying for Niardi, and has even succeeded in killing TOA Heavy Industries's agent Go Hinoto. He has also shown impressive agility, dodging a fully charged accelerated round from Nishu's weapon, and destroying multiple "War-Engines" (large battle mecha with enormous destructive capability) in a single battle. Dr. Wildenstein (ウィルデンシュタイン博士, Wirudenshutain-Hakase) A brilliant scientist working for the PHS who serves under General Narein. Although he steals the Gravitation Emission Weapon Data from Dr. Mamura Kurokawa of TOA Heavy Industries, he is proficient in other fields, as he manages to modify the N5S virus for the PHS's use. He also learns how to create synthetic humans, and when combining the data, he learns how to use the N5S virus for battle purposes among skilled soldiers or even how to reverse its effects. Immortals The immortals are humans who have adapted to the N5S virus on a genetic level (having 24 pairs of chromosomes after infection), integrating it into their cell structure and giving them inhuman abilities: advanced regeneration and longevity. Called accommodators in US version. Ion Green (イオン·グリーン, Ion Gurīn) Born Vief Chiena, is a 17-year-old seemingly immortal girl who has adapted herself to the N5S virus. She is parentless and li
