How to manage categorical variable with MANY categories

I have a dataset with some variables with MANY categories (one has about 20000, other about 2000, the third about 200). Need to make a multi-class prediction (not binary, but 3 values) How can I manage them? If I would like to try, for example, a Random Forest, I think max categories are about 50. I suppose creating 200 dummy variables is not an option (2000 or 20000 even worse). What would be a better idea, to try grouping them somehow, or try another algorithm? EDIT: May be I need to indicate the NUMBER of observations. My data has about 100000 observations, so, a category with 20000 levels, may be too much (only 5 observations per level). Even 2000 levels (50 observations per level), could be too much?
