Averages, standard deviations, and some other things can be calculated by taking one pass over the data and accumulating the count, the sum, the sum of the square of the data points. This was exploited in the days before computers by punching all the data on cards much as you illustrate, and running it through card machines (programmed by wires plugged into boards), and accumulating those totals, then doing the computations. Which is a boring history lesson except that it illustrates that you may be able to semi-summarize your data by group as you take it from the database. It will also pay off to be set up indexes on the descriptive (group) columns.
