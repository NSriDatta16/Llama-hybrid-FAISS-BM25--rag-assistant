No. Bayesian nonparametrics involves putting priors not on families of probability distributions indexed by (a) parameter[s], but on a (potentially infinite) space of densities themselves. A simple example of this might be plain old posterior mode estimation (the Bayesian equivalent of maximum likelihood). A normal density is one which is strongly unimodal. But so is a T-distribution, a double exponential, etc. Suppose further you don't feel comfortable saying anything more about the prior than the fact that it is strongly unimodal (convex density). You can actually sample from the posterior of such a distribution making a bare minimum of assumptions and obtain estimates and credible intervals. It is in my humble opinion super cool because it hybridizes Bayesian and likelihood based inference. Source .
