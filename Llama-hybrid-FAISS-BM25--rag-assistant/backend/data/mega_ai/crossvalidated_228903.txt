Is it problematic to include negatively correlated variables in a K-Means estimator?

I'm running a simple K-Means clustering algorithm on a dataset with ~15 features. Some of the features I'm currently including in my model represent different percentages of the same whole. I'd prefer to keep the exact variables to myself, so pretend I'm clustering restaurant guests, and the variables are "percentage of foods eaten containing milk", "percentage of food eaten containing broccoli", and "percentage of food eaten containing mustard." Because most foods contains either milk or mustard (hopefully), these variables might have distributions that look something like this: Would it problematic to include variables with this relationship in a K-Means estimator? Why/why not? If it is problematic, should I run a PCA analysis to decide which variables to drop? What other methods are used for this type of reduction? Thanks
