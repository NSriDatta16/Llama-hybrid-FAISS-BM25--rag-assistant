Define the trace in SQL Profiler, then script out the trace definition (File/Export/Script Trace Definition), see How to: Create a Transact-SQL Script for Running a Trace (SQL Server Profiler) . the server restart part is a bit trickier though. You can either modify the default trace (I would strongly recommend against it), you can create a SQL Agent job to create the script, or you could start the trace from a auto-start-up procedure, see Automatic Execution of Stored Procedures . I would use auto-start-up procedures
