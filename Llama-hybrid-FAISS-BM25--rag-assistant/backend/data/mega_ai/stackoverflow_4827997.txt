You should use __declspec for this purpose. Your code generated misaligned objects on my computer too (using VS2010) but when I changed to __declspec(align(8)) , the pointers were correctly aligned. I believe that pragma pack only changes the size of the struct and doesn't make any guarantees about it's location.
