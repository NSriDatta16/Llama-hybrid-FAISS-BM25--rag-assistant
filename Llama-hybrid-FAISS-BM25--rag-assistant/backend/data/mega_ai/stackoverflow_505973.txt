Custom .NET authentication, membership, profile provider for portlets?

I am wondering if it is possible to leverage the Authentication, Membership, and/or Profile provider features in .NET to help integrate .NET web apps into my company's enterprise portal. In a nutshell, the portal sends custom header values to any application that is 'behind' the portal for fields like the username, user profile data, and some access rights. One issue that we have with the portal is that we aren't able to leverage many of the .NET apps available on the web because they weren't designed to be "portal aware", primarily to trust that the user has already authenticated. Would it be possible to somehow write a custom authentication provider (or maybe leverage forms auth somehow) to just look at the header (plus the IP) and automatically "authenticate" as that user? My thinking is that by writing a profile provider, possibly a membership provider, and somehow adding authentication I would be able to download cool components like the Oxite blog (.net mvc demo that i found), switch providers to my custom one, and leverage it behind my company's portal with minimal code changes. Does this make any sense? I feel that I might not be understanding how these components fit into the puzzle.
