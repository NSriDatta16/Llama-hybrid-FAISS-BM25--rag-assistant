Which caching approach should I use?

Reading on http://guides.rubyonrails.org/caching_with_rails.html I've got a PagesController with a home action. The home view, displays a list of photos, videos and events. Which kind of caching is most suitable for this page? At first glance, I was thinking of using a fragment cache approach for each model, since the home page displays a list of 3 models (photos, videos and events). What are your thoughts?
