Marginal prior derivation in hierarchical Bayesian model

I am working on a model that is closely related to the normal gamma shrinkage prior setup discussed in Griffin & Brown (2010). Suppose we want to draw $P$ parameters $\beta_p$ with $p=1,...,P$ . The prior setup is given by \begin{equation} \beta_{p} \sim N(0, \frac{2}{\lambda}\tau^2_{p}) \end{equation} and \begin{equation} \begin{split} \tau^2_{p} &\sim G(\theta_1, \theta_2) \\ \lambda &\sim G(c_0,c_1) \end{split} \end{equation} where $G$ denotes the gamma distribution. This is usually refered to as global/local shrinkage prior setup where $\tau^2_{p}$ is the local shrinkage parameter and $\lambda$ is the global shrinkage parameter. I would like to derive the marginal prior for $\beta$ , but do not really know, how to proceed. Can anyone point me in the right direction? The conditional posterior distributions can be derived as \begin{equation} \begin{split} g_1 &= P * \theta + c_0\\ d &= c_1 + \frac{\theta}{2\sum_{p=1}^P \tau^2_p}\\ \ \\ \pi(\lambda) &\sim G(g_1,d)\\ \pi(\tau^2_{p}~|~\cdot) &\sim GIG(\theta-0.5,~ \beta_{p}^2,~ \lambda \theta)\\ \end{split} \end{equation} where $GIG$ denotes the Generalized Inverse Gaussian distribution. I know I'm supposed to integrate out $\lambda$ and $\tau_p^2$ , but I have no idea how to start. References Griffin, J. E., & Brown, P. J. (2010).
