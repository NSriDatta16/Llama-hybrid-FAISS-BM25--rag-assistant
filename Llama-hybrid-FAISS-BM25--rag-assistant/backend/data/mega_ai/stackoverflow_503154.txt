Since you are using .net > 2.0, you may want to look into the System.Net.Mail namespace for the creation of mail messages. I have found that its quite customizable and was very easy to use for a task similar to yours. The only problems that I had was making sure I was using the right encoding , and I had to use HTML tables for layouts (css would not work right). Here are some links to show you how this works... Basic With multiple views (Plain Text and HTML) If that's not an option, then I would recommend going the Content ID route and embedding the images as attachments. Your other option is to host the images publicly on a website, and change the image links in the html to the public images. Something that you should be cognizant about is that HTML emails can easily look like spam and can be treated as such by email servers and clients. Even ones that are just for in-house usage (its happened to me) can end up in Outlook's Junk Mail folder..
