Use the generalization of the Kruskal-Wallis test: the semiparametric proportional odds ordinal logistic regression model. This model allows for adjustment for covariates, interactions, etc., while only using the rank ordering within Y. Much more information may be found in the Nonparametrics chapter of BBR and in a case study on ordinal regression for continuous Y in a chapter in RMS .
