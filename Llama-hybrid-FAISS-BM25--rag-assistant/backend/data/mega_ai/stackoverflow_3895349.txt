The file upload field cannot be styled (very much) in CSS, and cannot be scripted from JS (enough to make a surrogate control actually work). There are somewhat-sensible security reasons why this is the case, though you might argue they have been taken a bit too far. More generally, it's difficult to style a file upload field anyway, because you don't know what a file upload field looks like. It's all up to the browser. Maybe you'll get a text field on the left and a ‘Browse’ button/popup on the right (in that case, which part does the border apply to? Or around both?); maybe you'll get just a popup on the left and a status icon/label on the right (like in Safari); maybe you'll just get a drag-and-drop field. Or something else. It's totally out of your control. Most ‘professional’ sites do one of two things: Don't care about it, just use a plain unstyled file upload field. Perhaps in a pop-up div when you request to upload (so at least it's not being inconsistent on-screen at all times). Use a progressive-enhancement technique to replace the HTML file upload with an alternative uploader based around Flash (or less commonly Java or Silverlight; in the future we'll have more browsers with support for HTML5 drag-and-drop). There is a hack detailed here that works by making the real file upload control invisible and positioning it over the top of a stylable display control. But it's really pretty unreliable, depending on a guess of what size the browser's file upload control will be and what bits will respond to a click. It's bad for accessibility (doesn't respond to keyboard correctly), bad for usability (it doesn't even line up on my perfectly normal Firefox) and I wouldn't recommend using it at all .
