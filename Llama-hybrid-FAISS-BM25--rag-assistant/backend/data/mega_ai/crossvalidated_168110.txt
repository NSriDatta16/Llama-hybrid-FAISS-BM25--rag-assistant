Identifying intervals in a time series

I know, I know, this must have been covered many times before, but my belief is that I don't need the usual robust solution... Here is a time series: I would like to automatically detect the intervals which are clearly obvious to the human eye. I highlighted the first one. The output should be a list of the form [x1, x2], [x3, x4], ...identifying the start and end of each interval on the x axis. The trick is probably making the tolerance at the edges of each interval a parameter of the solution. Also how to deal with the 1:15 to 1:23 period, so that it doesn't get identified as an interval, granted it is unlike the other ones. A trivial approach was to detect when the data crosses the median value, but that is too trivial in less obvious cases. OK, so, maybe the approach needs to be as robust as necessary, but as simple as possible. ;) Data for the sample time series: https://www.dropbox.com/s/4mqe5afffsx0vr5/series.csv?dl=0
