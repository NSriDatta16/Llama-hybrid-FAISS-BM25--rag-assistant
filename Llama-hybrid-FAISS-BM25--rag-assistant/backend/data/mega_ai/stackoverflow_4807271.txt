Stored Procedure in Access DB

I have an MS Access database (.mdb) with a front end of reports built onto it that generates a report to calculate the pay/profitability of an insurance agent. There is a column on the report (TASC bonus) that is not a column in the table. It is apparently calculated by a stored procedure (this is what I've been told). Is there a way to view the stored procedures in an Access database to detemine how this column is calculated? Unfortunately I cannot post the database due to security/privacy issues. I believe the data (and perhaps the stored procedure) in the Access database is extracted from a SQL database and then "massaged" for reports. I am thinking there must be some sort of db viewer that would allow you to see all the tables and procedures but my Google searching has turned up nothing (and usually I'm pretty good at finding just about anything). I always post here as a last resort when I'm truly stumped! Any and all help is greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!
