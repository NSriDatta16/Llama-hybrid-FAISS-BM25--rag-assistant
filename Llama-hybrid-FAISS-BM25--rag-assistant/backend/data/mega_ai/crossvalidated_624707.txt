Marginal Effect for Poisson Model

I am using package marginaleffects for calculating the AME of an exposure variable on a count dependent variable. I am hence using Poisson (and Negative Binomial as robustness). The dependent variable in this case maps the number of days that pass from the request for a license to the approval, while the exposure is "prior_conviction", measuring whether the person asking for the license was previously convicted for a felony. If I fit the model via glm using a matched dataset, I use: model_matched Let's assume these are all the confounders I need to control for. Then, to obtain the IRR, I use: summ(model_matched, exp = TRUE, robust=TRUE, digits=3) After this, I get that the coefficient is 1.059, meaning that having a prior conviction leads to an increase by 5.9% in the number of days needed to get the license. I would also like to compute the AME, and hence I use: ame_matched summary() Once I compute this; I get that the effect is 1.986. Is it correct then to conclude that for those having prior convictions, it takes on average 1.99 more days to receive the license, compared to those who do not have a prior conviction? Thanks in advance for your help!
