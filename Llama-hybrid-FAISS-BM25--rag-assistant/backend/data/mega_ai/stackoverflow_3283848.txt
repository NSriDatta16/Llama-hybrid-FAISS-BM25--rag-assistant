If the list is going to get that long, you may want to consider other reordering mechanisms. For example, my Netflix queue includes a number in each call specifying the order of the queue, 1 for the movie about to ship, 2 for the next and so on to 187 or so for the most recent additions to the queue. I can drag an entry to reorder like on the iPhone, but I can also change the order numbers in the cells to reorder the entries, which is much easer than having to drag #187 to the 10th spot in the queue. There is also a button in each entry to put that entry on the very top. In your app, you can add extra controls in edit view to assist in reordering such as the order number or "up/down 10" buttons. If there are common reasons your users would want to order entries, you can have a button that handles that, such as "move up to next nearest blue entry."
