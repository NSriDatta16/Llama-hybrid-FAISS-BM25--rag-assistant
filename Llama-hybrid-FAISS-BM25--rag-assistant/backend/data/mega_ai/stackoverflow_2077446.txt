C++ namespaces - "using" or explicitly stated?

Possible Duplicates: Why is ‘using namespace std;’ considered a bad practice in C++? Using std Namespace Is it just a matter of preference? Or is there a valid reason for preferring using namespace std; #include myString string; or #include myString std::string; I suppose that explicitly stating the namespace each time, while a drag to type, avoids any possibility of name clashes (or would the compiler warn of ambiguity?) Question: is there a convincing argument one way or another?
