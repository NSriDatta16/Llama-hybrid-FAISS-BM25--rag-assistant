Levene's Test and residuals vs. fitted plot lead to different interpretations about heteroscedasticity

I am performing a one-way ANOVA in R with the following data: Cu Day CC Cu1 49 30934500 Cu1 49 26860125 Cu1 49 46524750 Cu10 49 15272561 Cu10 49 31601659 Cu10 49 17627634 Cu100 49 3718127 Cu100 49 4941416 Cu100 49 6230801 The ANOVA aims to determine if CC changes (on average) depending on Cu (three levels: Cu1, Cu10, and Cu100) or, in other words, to check if Cu exerts an effect on CC. The code I used was: analisis_varianza And, to check the homoscedasticity assumption: leveneTest(CC~Cu, data=dia_49) The problem is that Levene's test suggests that variances are homogeneous (p=0.5424), while the residuals vs fitted plot for the ANOVA clearly indicates that the variance is not homogenous: On which should I rely on and why?
