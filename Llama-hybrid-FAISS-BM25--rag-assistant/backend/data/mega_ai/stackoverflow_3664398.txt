eclipse won't create adt project due to 'access denied'

I installed JavaEE, JDK, Eclipse 3.5.x (Galileo), the Android Starter SDK, and the current ADT all with no problems. However, when I try to walk through the 'Hello Android' tutorial, I bring up the New Android Project wizard, fill it in and hit 'Finish'. After a moment, it comes back with a message saying there was a problem at path X:\so and so\ (access denied). Things to note: -Running Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit -Quadcore Pentium with 8GB RAM, 8TB NAS -I am an Administrator -I have also tried this by activating the full (hidden) Administrator profile -I have reinstalled everything 8 or 9 times -I have changed ownership & permissions all over the place -I have launched eclipse in 'Run as Administrator' Mode -I have installed Everything as 32-bit, as others have done this successfully Eclipse creates the folder it's having a problem with, but then cannot work with the .project file it creates (access denied). It then can't save anything so there is nothing but an empty folder 'Hello_Android' on the left within Eclipse. Anybody have any clues about what is going on-- I'm frustrated. I want to get into this, and I've looked EVERYWHERE on the net trying to crack this nut.... but I need help. -J
