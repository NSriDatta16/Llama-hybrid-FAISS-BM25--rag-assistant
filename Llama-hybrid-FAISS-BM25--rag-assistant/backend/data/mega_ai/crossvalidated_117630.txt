I am not completely certain how this solution was derived, but I thought I would post it anyway so that other people could evaluate it. I also thought that this information was worth posting as a full answer rather than leaving it buried in the comments of the answer provided by @Wolfgang. According to a response that Ian White supplied in correspondence with me, given groups $g_1$, $g_2$, and $g_3$, and assuming that the standard deviation used to calculate one's effect sizes was pooled across $g_1$, $g_2$, and $g_3$, $$cov(d_{diff_{g_1 - g_2}}, d_{diff_{g_1 - g_3}}) = \frac{r}{n_1} + \frac{d_{diff_{g_1 - g_2}} * d_{diff_{g_1 - g_3}} * r^2}{(2 * (n_1 + n_2 + n_3))}$$ Again, I'm not entirely certain how this solution was derived, and I would be grateful for any insight that others could provide.
