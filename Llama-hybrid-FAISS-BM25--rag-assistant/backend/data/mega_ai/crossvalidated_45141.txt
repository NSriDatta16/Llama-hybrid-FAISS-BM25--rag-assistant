Weight Initialisation for NN

Can the weight initialization algorithm, known as the Nguyen-Widrow Algorithm, be used for a multi-layer perceptron neural network, which consists of more than one hidden layer? (like 6-4-4-3-2) The paper which introduces this algorithm, only does it for a NN with one hidden layer. How can it be used for multi-hidden layers please?
