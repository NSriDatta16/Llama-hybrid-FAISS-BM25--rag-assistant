Is this the standard way to interpret the data generation process for in the Bayesian framework? No, this is not the standard interpretation. In fact, you have already recognised in your question the "subjective" interpretation of probability , which is the standard basis of Bayesian statistics. Under the "subjectivist" interpretation (more properly called the "epistemic" interpretation), the prior and posterior probability distributions for the parameters are used to represent the user's uncertainty about the unknown parameters in the model. Under this account there is no assumption of any corresponding metaphysical process occurring in nature, or any randomness in nature. Indeed, under this view the Bayesian paradigm does not provide any theory at all on the "data generation process" of nature; it merely gives us a mathematical way to model our uncertainty about things in nature, and hence form an inferential and predictive theory . Your latter description is an example of the propensity theory of probability , which posits that there is a metaphysical process that occurs in nature that is analogous to the probability calculus. This interpretation of probability assumes that there is some inbuilt metaphysical "propensity" in nature for outcomes to occur at random according to the laws of probability. As with most Bayesians, I have always found the propensity accounts to be a bit silly. It is really an example of human beings' propensity to project our own modes of thinking onto nature, and assume that there are analogues in nature to our epistemological methods and constructs. (As such, the "propensity interpretation" is more properly a propensity theory of human beings than one of probability!) Now, you might decide to adopt the subjectivist interpretation of probability, or you might disagree with me and decide to adopt the propensity interpretation. Regardless, you are going to get yourself into an awful mess if you equivocate between these two different interpretations. That is probably what is giving you difficulties at the moment.
