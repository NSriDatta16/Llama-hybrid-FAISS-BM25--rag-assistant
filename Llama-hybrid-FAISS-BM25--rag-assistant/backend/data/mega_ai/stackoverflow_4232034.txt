I think what is meant is: struct foo { ... some data members, maybe the length of bar ... char bar[]; /* last member of foo, char is just an example */ }; It is used by allocating with malloc(sizeof(struct foo)+LEN) , where LEN is the desired length of bar . This way only one malloc is needed. The [] can only be used with the last struct member. And, as fas as I understand the GCC doc, struct foo can also only be (reasonably) used as last member of another struct, because the storage size is not fixed -- or as pointer.
