unimportant features impact on model's performance

Using XGBoost and RandomForests, do unimportant features (according to the feature_importances_ attribute) hurt the model's performance? Do I need to carefully select highly correlated and import features? Or do I throw everything in and hope that it can correctly add some information on the target variable?
