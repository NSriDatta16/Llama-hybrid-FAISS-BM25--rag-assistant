VS2008 Code Coverage - can't find "not covered blocks"

I'm running VS2008's Code Coverage against a unit-tested DLL that I'm developing. For some of the functions it claims that 2 blocks are not covered and 50 or so are. When I view the function with the VS2008 highlighting it can't find the uncovered blocks. The highlighting appears to work with some functions though as it correctly shows a different color for uncovered blocks. Seems to be inconsistent. Is this a bug or PIBKAC? If the latter, what am I doing wrong?
