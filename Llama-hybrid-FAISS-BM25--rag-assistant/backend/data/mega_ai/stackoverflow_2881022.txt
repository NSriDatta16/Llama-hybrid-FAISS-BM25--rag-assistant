Windows retaining drag-drop cursor

I've got a strange issue that I'm hoping someone might have experienced/have some suggestions on. I'm using a 3rd party library (GoDiagram), which having reflected it briefly I don't think is the cause of the problem. What happens is that I drag a file onto a background canvas which inherits from the Control class. At the point of dragging a file over the canvas the cursor changes to the 'drag-drop' cursor, which I'm fairly certain is just being handled by the base Control rather than the canvas itself. At this point the canvas triggers an event that I'm hooked up to. This event displays a modal dialog. At this point the cursor is a normal arrow. However if I return focus to the desktop, my cursor is still in the 'drag-drop' state, and I can't actually interact with any icons on the desktop. Does anyone know why something like this might happen? Or does anyone know how I can force the cursor to revert? The strange thing is it feels like its the Windows cursor that isn't working, and that the cursor in my app from that point is fine. If I close the dialog box then the cursor returns to the normal cursor wherever I am like you'd expect. Cheers
