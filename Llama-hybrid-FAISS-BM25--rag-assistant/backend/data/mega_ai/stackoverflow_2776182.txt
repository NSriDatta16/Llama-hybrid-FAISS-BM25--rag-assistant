To me, it sounds like problem with memory. Could happen that your page fills up whole heap space dedicated to Coldfusion and then "lives" in couple of megabytes which are cleaned with garbage collector until timeuot. I worked with 1GB+ XML files so I had real nightmare until I figured out everything. So what you can do? Make sure that debugging is turned of. Check the logs Open CF Admin's Monitor tool and see what happens when you run this. (If you can't see monitor, use task manager and see if jrun takes same amount of memory like set in cfadmin) You could also make rough estimation how big is your xml, e.g. number of rows by average number of characters in that XML node. And if it's too large this could help you figure out. Checkout Charlie Arehart's list of tools which could help you with this and other issues http://www.carehart.org/cf411/ There are other ways to build XML which could save memory and/or processing time. But let's first figure out where's the problem.
