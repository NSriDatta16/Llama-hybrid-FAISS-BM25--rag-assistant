How to model percentage dependent variable using logistic regression in spss

I have some aggregated data. Indep. Dep. N 1.3 78% 23 1.2 67% 20 Indep var the average score of people in a particular region. Dep. var is the percent says 'yes' in that region. N is the count of subject the dep. is based on. I have read people suggesting logistic regression to model dependent percent or proportion data, i.e., When Dependent Variables Are Not Fit for Linear Models, Now What? , I am confused as to how to do it in spss, and doesn't logistic reg requie the dep var to be binary?
