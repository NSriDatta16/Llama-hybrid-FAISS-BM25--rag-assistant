Bayesian approach enables you to bring out-of-data information into your model through choice of priors , while likelihood function tells us about information contained in data. Through Bayes theorem $$ \underbrace{p(\theta \mid X)}_\text{posterior} \propto \underbrace{p(X \mid \theta)}_\text{likelihood} \; \underbrace{p(\theta)}_\text{prior} $$ the two sources of information are combined together. If your data conveys strong information about possible parameter values it should overcome the priors , but still you are bringing out-of-data information into the model. Idea similar to yours was described by Spiegelhalter (2004) proposed using "community of priors" (see also Fayers et al, 1997; 2000; Kass and Greenhouse, 1989), i.e. using different priors for different prior hypotheses and looking on how did they influence the estimates. For example, priors can be "optimistic", or "skeptical". The more informative prior , the more heavily you insist on certain parameter values range. Some argue that such usage of priors is logically inconsistent (can you have multiple different beliefs about something?), but it is a rather philosophical problem. Also while such approach was described in several places, I had a hard time in finding examples of using it in practice. Kass, R.E. and Greenhouse, J.B. (1989). A Bayesian perspective.
