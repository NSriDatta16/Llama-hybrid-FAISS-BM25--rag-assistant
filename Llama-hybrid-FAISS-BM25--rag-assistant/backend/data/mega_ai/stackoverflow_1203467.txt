Reduce size of numeric array by averaging values in PHP: 20 values => X values

In PHP I have an array containing 20 elements or more. The keys have been assigned automatically. The values are random numbers from 1 to 50. Now I want to plot this array into a line chart. Unfortunately, I can only use 5 points for the graph. So I must reduce the number of elements in the array. But I don't want the look of the chart to be changed. So I need a function like this: To make it clearer: When I want to reduce the size of an array from 6 elements to 3 elements, I can just sum up pairs of two elements each and take the average: array(1, 8, 3, 6, 9, 5) => array(4.5, 6, 7) My function should do this with variable sizes (for input and output). I hope you can help me. Thanks in advance!
