You'd want to have a look at the type of user agent you've got and see if it's a mobile device. The following code would be an example of this: public static bool IsMobile(string userAgent) { userAgent = userAgent.ToLower(); return userAgent.Contains("iphone") | userAgent.Contains("ppc") | userAgent.Contains("windows ce") | userAgent.Contains("blackberry") | userAgent.Contains("opera mini") | userAgent.Contains("mobile") | userAgent.Contains("palm") | userAgent.Contains("portable"); } That should work in most cases! This link might help you get more specific too.
