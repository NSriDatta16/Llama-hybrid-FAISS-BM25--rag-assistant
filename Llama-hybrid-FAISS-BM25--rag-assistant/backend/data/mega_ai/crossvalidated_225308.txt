I don't think this is the case. Each $ATE_j$ is unbiased, so weighted average of them should be unbiased as well because the expectation is linear operator. Here's a 500 rep simulation in Stata where the treatment effect is set to 15 with 50 blocks of 100 observations (on average): capture program drop mybs program define mybs, rclass clear qui set obs 5 gen block = _n gen p_treat = uniform() gen n = rpoisson(100) qui expand n gen treated = uniform() There does not appear to be any bias here: . sum ate, detail r(ate) ------------------------------------------------------------- Percentiles Smallest 1% 9.240335 7.301056 5% 11.53554 7.853343 10% 12.34418 8.115672 Obs 500 25% 13.81046 8.936302 Sum of Wgt. 500 50% 15.07377 Mean 15.03785 Largest Std.
