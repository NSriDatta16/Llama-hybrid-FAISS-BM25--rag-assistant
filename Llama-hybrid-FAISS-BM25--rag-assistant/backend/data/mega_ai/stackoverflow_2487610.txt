Advantages When you first hear about hash tables they sound too good to be true. The reason is that is does not matter how many items there are searching, insertion (deletion sometimes) can take approximately 0(1) which is pretty much instantaneous from the user POV. Given its performance capabilities in terms of speed, hash tables are used mainly yet not limited to programs that need to look up thousands of items in less than a sec (for example spell-checkers / search engines). From my particular point of view I find H tables much easier to program than any sort of binary trees, and am not expert, so if you are a beginner that might too be an advantage. Disadvantages As hash tables are based on arrays they can be difficult to expand once created. Also I have read that for certain hash tables once full or getting full the speed when performing a task reduces notoriously. As a result of both when programming you will need to be fairly accurate of how many items you need to store. Additionally is not possible to search the items in the hash table in order for example from the smallest to the biggest, so if that is something you are looking for it might not be what you need. Extra Info Wikipedia article's - Hash Table - Big O Notation Tutorial on Hash Tables - Tutorial All how to's about Hash Tables - Java2S Book Advice I advice you to get a book called "Data Structures & Algorithms in Java - Second Edition - Robert Lafore" its a big book, but it has everything explained very subtle, for me is the only programming book so far i can read like is a novel. Additional info regarding Big O notation - O(1) O(1) doesn't mean "pretty much instantaneous" (an O(1) algorithm could take hours, weeks or years). It means (in this case) "is independent of the size of the collection" (assuming the hash code is good enough). â€“ Ben Lings Thanks to Ben for his clarification. P.S: You might want to be more descriptive in the future when you ask a question that way other users can pin-point what you are looking for.
