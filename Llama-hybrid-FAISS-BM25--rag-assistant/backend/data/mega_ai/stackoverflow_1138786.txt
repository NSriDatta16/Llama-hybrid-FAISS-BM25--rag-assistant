If you will be involved with this project in the future, OR if the product line will expand and you want to serve the company most effectively, then you should use the database approach. If you won't be involved in the future, AND you have no experience with PHP and a database, AND you are used to a template engine that makes all this a snap, then I agree that you have a difficult decision. I certainly would use the database approach; among other things, it would allow the language variation to be handled very elegantly. But that is a reflection of my experience.
