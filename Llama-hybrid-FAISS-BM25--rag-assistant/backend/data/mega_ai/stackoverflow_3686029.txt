Should I extend ASP.NET Security for a public site?

I have a ASP.NET MVC site with a private site administration application secured with ASP.NET sql-backed authorization. I need to add a login for the public site to allow visitors to sign up for an account. I am thinking I should create totally seperate storage for the public site, rather than extend the existing user db and rely on roles to keep public users out of the back office. Is there any reason not to do this?
