What to report in the build model, asses model and evaluate results steps of CRISP-DM?

I would greatly appreciate if you could let me know what to report in the following steps of CRISP-DM? Build Model : what should be reported for parameter settings, models and model description? I used grid search to tune hyperparameters. Assess Model : what should be reported for model assessment and revised parameter settings? Evaluate Results : what should be reported for assessment of data mining results? In fact, I used just Logistic regression to do a classification task using a procedure like what is depicted below: Could the final model evaluation on test data set be considered as a part of Evaluate Results or it should be done on new data?
