Using a simulation to show sceptics that t-test gives the right answer, and how to do the same for a bayesian inference case

I want to demonstrate to sceptical colleagues and friends that statistical analysis works. And there’s a follow-on question regarding doing the same with bayesian inference. Suppose that I want to demonstrate to someone that a two sample t-test at a given level of significance yields the correct results. That is, it correctly tells me that two populations which have no difference between them are shown to not be significantly different, and that two populations which do have a significant difference are successfully detected. To do this, I’m going to create a simulation containing three populations of people who all suffer from high blood pressure,and we want to use statistics to examine how effective different drugs are in treating it. Population A receives drug A, population B receives drug B, population C (for ‘control’) receives a placebo. We’re going to compare systolic blood pressures in every case. I set up the populations in my simulation so that A has a reduced systolic blood pressure (i.e. the drug is working), whereas B and C have the same elevated level. If the demonstration works successfully, we expect to find, as we take samples from the population and apply the two sample t-test to these sampled data, that there is no significant difference between B and C data, but there is a difference between A and C. And of course, because this is a statistical process, I need to repeat my test many times, ie. perform many iterations of the same test, to show that the statistical nature of the conclusion is correct. For the first iteration I select 40 people at random from each of populations A, B and C, compute the mean and standard deviation for each sample set and perform the t-test for the B and C comparison, and also the A and C comparison, i.e. does the value of t exhibit a significant difference or not? In hypothesis language, does the value of t support the null hypothesis or not? Now I do the same thing for another 99 iterations. What I expect to see in the one hundred A/C comparisons (where we know that there is a reduction in blood pressure in the people taking the drug) is that if I have tested against a t value corresponding to 5% significance, about 19 in every 20 iterations should show a significant difference, i.e. the t result is larger than the value in the table for alpha = 0.05, n = 40. Similarly, the one hundred results for the B/C comparisons should show fewer than 1 in 20 give a significant difference. So my first question is, is this a correct premise? Is my proposed method of obtaining the conclusion valid? Secondly, how would we do a similar thing for a ‘drug trial’ using bayesian inference to find whether drug A or B is better than nothing?
