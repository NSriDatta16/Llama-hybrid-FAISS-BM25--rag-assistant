A hypothesis test that conditional expectation (i.e. regression line) is above some number in a region of the factor space

In my work we want to know whether some variable of interest satisfies some threshold. Maybe imagine that we ask questions like whether a widget has at least a 60% probability of functioning. Realistically, whether the widget functions or not depends on certain factors, and if one wants to understand the widget's performance they should design an experiment in which those factors are varied and a model, such as a logistic regression model, is built. The usual tests that computer programs give you when making a regression model tell you which factors of the model are statistically significant or not. But we don't necessarily care whether a factor has an effect or not; if the widget meets the threshold, we're indifferent to whether a factor has an effect on conditional mean. Granted, if we have a continuous factor and a factor had a nonzero effect, there could be regions where the threshold is exceeded if only because a non-constant line spans all real numbers, so we should instead focus on some region of interest and not the entire plane, and ask whether the threshold is met in that region. So how would one test whether in some region a threshold is met? How could I test whether over an entire region of interest in the factor space, the widget functions with a probability of at least 60%?
