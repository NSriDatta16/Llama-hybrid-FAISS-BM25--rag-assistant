I'm unable to comment, so first I'll ask: what is y? Unless you can create examples of ugly bouquets, I do not think a supervised learning approach is best. Even if you created ugly bouquets, there would be a very wide space of ugliness to cover. If your goal is to recommend a bouquet, I would approach this problem by seeing what bouquets were made with the flowers a customer has. I'll assume that the examples of bouquets are beautiful bouquets. You can see which previously made bouquets you can make with a customer's flowers, allowing to recreate one of those bouquets. Another approach would be clustering to see which historical bouquet clusters your customer's flowers are most similar to. If you look at the average makeup of bouquets per cluster, you can determine which one your customer can fall into.
