Citing http://blogs.oracle.com/mr/entry/jigsaw : OSGi is not at all integrated with the Java language, however, having been built atop the Java SE Platform rather than from within it. This last problem can be ﬁxed. Sun plans now to work directly with the OSGi Alliance so that a future version of the OSGi Framework may fully leverage the features of JSR 294 and thereby achieve tighter integration with the language. (...) If and when a future version of the Java SE Platform includes a speciﬁc module system then Sun will provide a means to migrate Jigsaw modules up to that standard. In the meantime we’ll actively seek ways in which to interoperate with other module systems, and in particular with OSGi.
