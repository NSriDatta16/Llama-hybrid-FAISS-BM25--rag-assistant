MusicBrainz alternative for JavaEE

Is there any Java/J2EE website which opensource their software and data (like musicbrainz.org, where a developer can easily set up a personal/development MusicBrainz website by downloading the Perl/CGI webapp and the music data in PostgreSQL dump) ? It would be good for other developers to learn from this kind of website. Thanks
