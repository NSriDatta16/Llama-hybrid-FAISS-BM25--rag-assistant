Downsides (If any) With SQL Server 2005 XML Datatype

I have a need to record XML fragments in a SQL Server 2005 database for logging purposes (SOAP messages, in this case). Is there any reason to use the XML datatype over a simple varchar or nvarchar column? I can see instances already where being able to use XPath to get into the data in the XML would be rather nice, and I haven't been able to find any real downsides in some brief research. Are there any pitfalls that need to be watched out for or is there a better way to approach this?
