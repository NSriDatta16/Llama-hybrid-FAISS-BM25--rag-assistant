How do I cross validate daily time series data

I want to cross validate various models to understand which one performs best. I have been referring to Rob J Hyndman's post here https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/tscvexample/ But I am a little lost as to how to use it on daily data. my daily time series data starts at 2015-01-01 and ends at 2017-03-31. Specific questions include: What should k be in my case? In mae1 instead of 12 will I use 365? In for(i in 1:(n-k-12)) will I use 365? I have a very high level understanding of the code and I believe that is another reason why I cannot translate this to a daily usecase. Any help in clarifying the problem would be greatly appreciated!
