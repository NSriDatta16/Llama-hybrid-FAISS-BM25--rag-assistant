XML in C# - Read from Resources, Manipulate and Display

I'd like to do the following and can't find an elegant way: Read an XML template into a System.Xml.XmlDocument Populate it with data from my UI Transform it with an XSLT I've written Apply a CSS Stylesheet Render it to a WebBrowser control I'm currently reading it from a file on disk, populating it, then saving it back out to disk after populating it. I reference the XSLT in the template, and the CSS in the XSLT and then use the WebBrowser.Navigate([filename]) method to display the XML file. Obviously, when I come to deploy this app, it'll break horribly as the file won't exist on disk, and I won't be able to reference the XSLT and CSS files in the XML file as they'll be resources. I'm planning to include the template as a resource, but can't find a neat way to proceed from there. Any help much appreciated
