How to interpret coefficients in multi-way fixed effects model?

My goal is to run a panel-regression in order to asses the impact of county-level average household income on test-scores across a wide array of undergraduate-level university courses. Specifically, I have observations on test-scores in course $j$ for student $i$ in semester $t$ where $$j\in\{\text{calculus, linear-algebra, advanced-calculus, ... , comparative linguistics, linguistic typology, ... }\}$$ and I can partition the set of courses by subject, i.e. define a mapping $s$ such that e.g. $\,s(\text{calculus})=\text{math}$ . Currently, I'd go about this exercise by estimating $$grade_{j,i,t}=\gamma_{s(j)}+\gamma_i+\gamma_t+\beta \cdot income_{c(i),t}+\delta x_{i,t}+\epsilon_{j,i,t}$$ where $\gamma_{s(j)}$ is a subject fixed effect in order to take care of the fact that grading scales tend to vary by subject (but very little within subject) $\gamma_i$ is a student fixed effect meant to capture unobserved (overall) intellectual ability, propensity to study, etc. $\gamma_t$ is a time fixed effect. I also control for parental income as well as $x_{i,t}$ - a set of demographics including parental income, employment status of parents, household size, race, etc. As I am under the impression that the term fixed-effects has very different meanings in different disciplines, my usage of the term is meant to align with its usage in econometrics. The coefficient of interest is $\beta$ where $c(i)$ denotes the county where student $i$ resides (my question is conceptual, so it does not really matter that in terms of a narrative the income of the county where a student grew up would presumably be more relevant). It is my (perhaps erroneous) understanding that, in a simpler model $y_{it}=\alpha_i+\beta x_{it}+\epsilon_{it}$ , by including a unit-fixed-effect I am effectively using the time-variation in $x_{it}$ to estimate $\beta$ so that $\beta$ is the impact of $x_{it}$ on $y_{it}$ within an $i$ -cell (or rather the average of the impact within each $i$ -unit taken over $i$ -units?). If I were to estimate $y_{it}=\alpha_t+\beta x_{it}+\epsilon_{it}$ , I'd on the other hand use the cross-sectional variation so that $\beta$ is the impact of $x_{it}$ on $y_{it}$ at a given time. So in my setting, I am wondering how to interpret $\beta$ exactly. I would like $\beta$ to isolate the cross-sectional impact of county-income on test-scores. Questions: Does my inclusion of $\gamma_{s(j)}$ alter anything regarding the interpretation of $\beta$ ? I am not sure how to think about the variance reduction of the independent variable here, since it is not indexed at $j$ . I feel tempted to drop $\gamma_i$ , because I want the variation that drives the estimation of $\beta$ to be chiefly cross-sectional variation in county income. Including $\gamma_i$ means that the variation in county-income to be exploited is in the time-dimension, right? But I also cannot be ignorant of the fact that there is something like (subject- and time-invariant) student-specific ability that drives grades. Is there a solution to this trade-off? Finally, I include $\gamma_t$ in order to force the cross-sectional variation in county-income to be central to the estimate of $\beta$ . But, now, since I have both $i$ and $t$ fixed effects, what is the exact variation in independent variable indexed at $(i,t)$ that I am using? What is the exact interpretation of $\beta$ ? Thanks a lot!
