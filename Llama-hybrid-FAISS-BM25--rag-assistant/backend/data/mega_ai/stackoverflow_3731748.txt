There is a special way to use new to allocate memory in the stack or as static storage using what is called the placement new operator . With this version of new, you reserve a chunk of memory and the you explicitly tell new where you want to store a specific variable. It would work as follows: #include int main() { char buffer[500]; // chunk of memory int p*; p = new (buffer) int[10]; } Note that you need to include the new header in order to use this special new operator. In this case, as you are using automatic storage, the memory will be freed upon leaving the block in which it was declared (the main). References: C++ Primer plus. Chapter 9. Page 420
