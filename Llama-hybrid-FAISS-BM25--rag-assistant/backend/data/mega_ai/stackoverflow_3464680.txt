This is a pretty big bite. I would recommend looking at it a different way; Could you use git/svn/hg/etc as a content-neutral storage system, and have a complementary system you write that can query it for content and do content-aware operations against it? This way you don't have to re-solve all the problems and can stand on the work already done and vetted, and tools already written can be used to work with the 'raw' data.
