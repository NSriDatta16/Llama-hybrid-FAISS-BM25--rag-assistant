There is no trick to skip over certain fields during deserialization. In fact, (almost) any change you make to the source code of the class will make old serialized data impossible to deserialize. Serialization couples your source code very tightly to the serialized data. This is why serialization is not suited for long-term data storage. Serialization is only suited for things like RMI (transporting objects over the network) or temporary storage on disk. Use a well-documented (standard) file format instead of Java serialization for long-term data storage. What you can do is deserialize the data using the old code, then write it into another format, and from then on use only that format.
