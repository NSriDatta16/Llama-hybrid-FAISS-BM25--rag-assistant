Paperclip to upload images to S3 in Rails. The files upload at a very slow rate. A work-around?

I'm working on a rails app where the user will be uploading large quantities of images. My current setup: Using SWFUpload to upload multiple files at once using the Paperclip plugin with S3 storage. After the original image is uploaded to S3, Delayed_Job is used for the post processing (thumbnails, etc). The problem I have is that the images upload at a very slow rate. I'm assuming the default Paperclip setup is that the image will go from the user to -> my server to -> s3. I was thinking that I can have the images upload directly to s3 but I'm not sure how to implement that with Paperclip and post processing. I couldn't find any plugins or examples dealing with this. Does anyone have suggestions? If not, can you point me in the right direction? Thanks in advance! Tim
