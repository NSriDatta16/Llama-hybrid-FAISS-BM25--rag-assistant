I store my code within an online source repository - code.google.com, and use the web front-end to browse for the interesting bits. Since it's on google, it's easy to search too.. All you'd need to do is organise the code into folders for each language, area, etc, and have them all within the same repository. The only downside is that if you want to keep your snippets secret, then this won't work. Obviously, you'll need to be online to access this way, but you can easily do an SVN update intermittently to refresh any local offline copies you may need.
