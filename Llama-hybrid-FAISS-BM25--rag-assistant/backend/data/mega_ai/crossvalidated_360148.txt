Getting more time series data

I am trying to do time series forecasting following this [1] paper. My data is represented by the total CPU load of a computer as my time series (one data point per second). Secondary features are represented by the UNIX time collected at the same time and converted into hours, minutes and the day of the week. Obviously, collecting this data requires real time passage. I am doing this project as part of my internship and I am time restrained when it comes to collecting this data (at the moment I only have 9 days of continuous usage). I came up with the idea of using the generative part of a GAN or maybe a variational autoencoder on my time series in order to simulate more data for training purposes. My question is: would this approach yield any real, useful results? [1] https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050917326170?viewFullText=true
