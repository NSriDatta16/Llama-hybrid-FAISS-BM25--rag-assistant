I used very similar code and it is spinning. Difference that I assigned radians as float and you are missing assignment for view to display your layer. - (void)spinLayer:(CALayer*)layer { // Create a new spinning animation CAAnimation* spinningAnimation = [self animationForSpinning]; // Assign this animation to the provided layer's opacity attribute. // Any subsequent change to the layer's opacity will // trigger the animation. [layer addAnimation:spinningAnimation forKey:@"opacity"]; // So let's trigger it now layer.opacity = 0.99; [self.contentView.layer addSublayer:layer]; }
