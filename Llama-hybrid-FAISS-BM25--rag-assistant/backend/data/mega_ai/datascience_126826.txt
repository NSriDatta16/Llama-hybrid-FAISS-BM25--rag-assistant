Yes - if you are taking k-means with k=1, it's the same as calculating the mean of all pixels in the image. Attention to the channels though - you should be taking the means of all pixels per channel, to end up with three channels, so one mean for R, one for G, and one for B, assuming you're in RGB colorspace.
