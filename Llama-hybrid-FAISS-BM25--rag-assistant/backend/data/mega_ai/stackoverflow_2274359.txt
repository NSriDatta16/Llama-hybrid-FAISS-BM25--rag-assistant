You can try call WlxLoggedOnSAS function from GINA or WlxSasNotify from WinLogon. But, I afraid it won't work. But, maybe it will lead you to working method. And it definitely will not work in Vista/W7. In other side, it might be that Windows Security Dialog can be called only by secure attention sequence ( ctrl+alt+del) by securytt reasons.
