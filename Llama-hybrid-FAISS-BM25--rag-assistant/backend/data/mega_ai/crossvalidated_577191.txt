In a simpler terms, we can say the Unit Root tests (including KPSS test or Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF) test) are used to test if the the time series of interest is non-stationary or not. If it is, we keep differencing the time series until we have a stationary time-series (usually maximum number of differencing is 2). The main idea of differencing is to help stabilize the mean of a time series by removing changes in the level of a time series, and therefore eliminating (or reducing) trend and seasonality. In that case, the transformed time series is ready for the next step which is regression. On the other hand, Portmanteau tests (including Box-Pierce test or Ljung-Box test (more accurate)) are used to see if the model trained is ready for inferencing and forecasting meaning that the model has been able to capture all of the trend and seasonality within a reasonable threshold or not. In other words, they test if the residuals of the trained model is a white noise (i.e. normal distribution (0, 1)). It is interesting to note that if there are a few significant spikes in the ACF, and the model fails Portmanteau tests but it can still be used for forecasting, but the prediction intervals may not be accurate due to the correlated residuals.
