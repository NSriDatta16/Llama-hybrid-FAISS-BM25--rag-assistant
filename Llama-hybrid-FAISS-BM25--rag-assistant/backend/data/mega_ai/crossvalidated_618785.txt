Python Machine Learning Prediction Model - Predict String Variable based on multiple other string variables

I'm very new to Machine Learning, so please forgive the simplicity here. It's probably because I'm new to this, but I can't seem to find anything relevant enough online to help here. I have data on laptops, phones, and printers like this: Manufacturer, Model Name, Model Id, (and a few others). For Example: Dell, Latitude 3000, Latitude 3340 Lenovo, ThinkPad X1, X1 Carbon Dell, 1100, 1130 Laser Each item is assigned a category, like laptop, phone, or printer. I have thousands of items, most have categories, but a handful don't (Several of my categories are blank) and I'd like to be able to try to predict which category it's in based on the Manufacturer, Model Name, and Model Id provided. I understand this may not "fit" a model perfectly, but I was hoping someone here could help with with this. I'm really a beginner and don't even know what libraries I might need. Thanks in advance for the help.
