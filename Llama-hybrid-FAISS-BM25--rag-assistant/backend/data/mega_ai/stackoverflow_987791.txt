How do I get PassedArgs to work in Pagination in CakePHP?

I have a page which returns results that are filtered on an organization_id. The URL looks like this: nameofview/organization_id:1/page:2/ I'm using the built in Paginator controls and I pass $this->PassedArgs into it like this: prev(' $this->PassedArgs), null, array('class'=>'disabled'));?> | numbers(array('url' => $this->passedArgs));?> next(__('next', true).' >>', array('url' => $this->passedArgs), null, array('class'=>'disabled'));?> The links look good for the "numbers" but don't work for Next and Previous. The links for both are taking me back to the same page. I think it is because it is passing the "Page" param. Anyone have an idea how I can pass the correct args to $paginator->numbers? I tried $this->passedArgs['organization_id'] but that returns errors.
