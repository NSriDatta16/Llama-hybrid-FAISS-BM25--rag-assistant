"Back-casting" a Time Series

The problem I have is that i have a series of data (between 2000-2010) and i have another series (independant variable) which is available between 1980 and 2010. I need to backcast the value of the first series using the second series The existing approach thats been done is to build an OLS model between the two levels and score it historically. I don't think that is correct because both series are non stationary so I took the first difference of both to make them stationary. Then I tested for AR and MA terms and AR(2) is significant so I have a model with the difference of the second series and AR(2) How do I now use this to backcast the values from 1980-2000? I am using SAS for this and I tried reversing the series and using the forecast option in the ARIMA function and it worked however is this conceptually correct to do? Doesnt this mean that i am saying that the value of my dependant variable series is dependant on its future values because of applying AR(2) on a reverse series. That is obviously not possible. Or am i missing something Does anyone have any suggestions regarding this?
