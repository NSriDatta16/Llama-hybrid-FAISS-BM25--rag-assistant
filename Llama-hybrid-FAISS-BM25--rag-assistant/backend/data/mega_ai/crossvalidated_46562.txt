Measure of goodness-of-fit in Ordinal Logistic Regression with continuous independent variable

In case of the ordinal logistic regression, both of the goodness-of-fit statistics, Pearson and Deviance goodness-of-fit measures, should be used only for models that have reasonably large expected values in each cell. If you have a continuous independent variable or many categorical predictors or some predictors with many values, you may have many cells with small expected values. SPSS warns you about the number of empty cells in your design. In this situation, neither statistic provides a dependable goodness-of-fit test. So if I have some continuous independent variables then is there any measure of goodness-of-fit? How do I know if my model fitted well or not?
