W3C validating clickable content box

Is it possible to create a clickable box that validates (W3C)? In the clickable box I need list elements and paragraphs. This don't validate: My paragraph My content item This validates but don't solve the problem (very ugly): My paragraph My content item This validates but disables the middle mouse click to open page in a new tab. My paragraph My content item
