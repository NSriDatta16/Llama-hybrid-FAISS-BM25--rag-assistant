What are the possible tags inside the "global" tag in Magento "config.xml" file?

Can some professional experienced Magento developer tell me how to accomplish the following in Magento? I want to know what are the possible tags that can fit in the "global" tag of the "config.xml" page of every module's etc folder? I have tried searching for this answer at many places in Internet but in vain. Please provide the full details along with it for Magento version >= 1.4.0.0 , because I want at least the users accessing this website find it useful enough, instead of scratching their heads. I really want a detailed explanation, because every newbie like me gets totally confused at this point. From what I know till now, is that in this page, you can set routers, rewrites, cron jobs, admin html, front-end html and many more. But without any strong concepts, none can go ahead with the belief that his code is 100% correct w.r.t. the Magento MVC architecture. So please I want that strong fundamental concept, getting underlined here, with a detailed explanation about it, so that no one gets into this pitfall ever again. I can understand one thing - for many it looks that a complete reference of valid global tags of Magento would be a misnomer, but I would like to clarify that there must be a set of those valid limited number of tags that goes under the global tag. For example, I cannot just write a "stack" or "overflow" or "joseph" tag, which I'm quite sure that it will not be taken by Magento as a valid one. It is because the valid tags (like "models", "resources", "resource" & so on) are defined somewhere in Magento configuration, that they work. This is my point actually, which I want to emphasize. Many many thanks to those who can answer only upon knowing the total concept clearly.
