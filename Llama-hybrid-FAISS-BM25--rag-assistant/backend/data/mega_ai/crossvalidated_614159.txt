Do the # of weights (non-intercept coefficients) in logistic regression = # of features

A simple question that I just want to clarify for understanding: In logistic regression, if we have $n$ input features, will there therefore be $n$ weights used for classification, one for each feature? EDIT: I wanted to edit this so it will show up if others search. It seems that a more common terminology for what I called weights is "coefficients". What I call "bias" would also be a coefficient, just the intercept one.
