A question about classifiers in Machine Learning

I am taking classes on intro to AI,and the teacher mentioned some point that for the classifier ZeroR,the accuracy under ZeroR is a helpful baseline for interpreting other classifiers. I searched online about this but still couldn't get my head around it,could anyone give some idea on what that means please,thanks in advance.
