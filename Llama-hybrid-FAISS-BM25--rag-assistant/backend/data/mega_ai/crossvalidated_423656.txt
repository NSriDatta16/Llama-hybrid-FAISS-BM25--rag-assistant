A pdf is a pdf. Just as you could integrate the binomial pdf from 450 to 1000 based on 1000 coin flips, you can integrate the Beta(24,26) from p = 0.45 to p = 1, based on your posterior, to get the probability of 450 or more out of 1000. I don't know that there is any single "correct notation" for the probability that you seek. You specified quite nicely in your question what you did: specified an intelligently thought-out prior, updated based on the limited data available, and are estimating the probability of 450 or more heads out of 1000 based on that posterior. If that is clear to the reader I wouldn't worry too much about the notation. You have identified a major issue in Bayesian approaches: posterior distributions can depend heavily on prior distributions, particularly when data are limited. It would be a useful exercise to try several priors (e.g., uniform over [0,1], different Beta priors than what you used) and see how much the posteriors (and your associated willingness to bet) might change.
