Comparing the means of two time series

I have data sets of the returns of two indexes in the same market (two different sets of stocks constituting each index), with 496 observations for each. I want to compare if the means are statistically different. I believe the variances are different, so I think I have to check if the variances are statistically different first. How would I do these things?
