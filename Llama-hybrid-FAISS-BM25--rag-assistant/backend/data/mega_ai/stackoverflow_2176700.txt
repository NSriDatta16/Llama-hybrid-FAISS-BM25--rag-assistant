(I'm using 2007, but same applies) In the button's click event (use code builder, not macro), the code Shell "excel.exe " & Chr(34) & "C:\FullPathToYourFile\file.xls" & Chr(34), vbMaximizedFocus will do it, although inelegantly. Missing out the chr(34) breaks with paths or filenames with spaces in them, and although wrapping the path with ' should work in it's place, it isn't on my 2007 version. I am not familiar with how to do it in macros, or if it's possible.
