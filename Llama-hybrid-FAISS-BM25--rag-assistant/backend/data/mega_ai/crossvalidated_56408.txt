Obtaining base level with margeff & gologit2 in Stata

I would be extremely glad if someone could help me with this. I'm using the gologit2 generalized logistic regression/ partial proportional odds model for ordinal dependent variables. The dependent variable describes firm size and is a categorical variable with three groups, small, medium and large. I used margeff to get the average marginal effect coefficients (see below), but I'm having difficulties in understanding how I can get base level that the three dummies (firm types) below are compared to (e.g. -.1368403 + base = probability that a given firm type is of y size). Is the base simply the mean of that value when y = 0 (small)? What about if I use the at(means) option in margeff ? Cheers! . margeff, dummies(Iprsv* \ Ipscl* \ Icountry* \ Inace*) Average partial effects after gologit2 y = Pr(size04) -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- variable | Coef.
