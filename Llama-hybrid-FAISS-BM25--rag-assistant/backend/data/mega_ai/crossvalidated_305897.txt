Computing likelihood / AIC from correlations

I would like to compare prediction qualities of three different dynamical models (model A has three free parameters, model B has two free parameters and model C has zero free parameters). To achieve this I computed correlation coefficients between simulated and empirical time series for each model and tested parameter set. Now I would like to compute Akaike's information criterion for each model to formally compare the three models. How do I compute the (maximum of the) likelihood function for each of the three models using the obtained correlations coefficients between simulated and empirical time series?
