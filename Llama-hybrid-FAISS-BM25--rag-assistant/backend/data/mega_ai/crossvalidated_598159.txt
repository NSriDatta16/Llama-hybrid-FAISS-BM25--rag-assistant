Simple tests like those on the contingency tables shown in the question can be extended to regression models that take additional information into account. In this situation you are modeling odds and odds ratios, so the natural extension is to a logistic regression model . Logistic regression models the log-odds of a binary outcome (Success/Failure here) as a function of a set of predictors. Exponentiating a log-odds value gives the odds. Exponentiating a difference of log-odds between two conditions, say Drug versus Control , gives the odds ratio. Logistic regression software typically can accept a two-column matrix of successes and failures as the outcome for each data row. Each data row would also be annotated by the Treatment received, the Center , and the Group to which the Center is assigned. To allow for a different Treatment effect for each Group you would use Treatment , Group , and their interaction as predictors. The results can then be interpreted in terms of the odds ratio associated with Treatment for each Group , giving you the desired 3 odds ratios. Your model should take each individual Center into account, not just the Group assignments. That's often done by a mixed effects logistic regression model , although that might not work well with so few Centers in each Group . Alternatively, you could model by Center instead of by Group at first, then combine results by Group with post-modeling software tools like those provided by the R emmeans package . As noted in comments, this grouping only is valid if there was a reason known before you saw the results to combine the different centers into 3 groups, for example their geographic locations. If the proposed grouping in the question is based on the already known odds ratios (e.g., these seem to be intermediate, high, and low odds-ratio groups) the results would not be valid, as the assumptions of independence that underlie the statistical tests wouldn't hold.
