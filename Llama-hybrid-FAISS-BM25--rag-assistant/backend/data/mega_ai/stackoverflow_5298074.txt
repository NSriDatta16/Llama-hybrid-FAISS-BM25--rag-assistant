Creating reports: MongoDB + .Net Win Forms

As I am working on .Net windows form application, we're using MongoDB for back-end data storage. As the matter of business reports (Just like we're developing reports with Crystal report), I would like to know that can we create business reports with MongoDB ?? As the reports are the very critical part of our application, I must have to create reports using MongoDB . Could anybody please let me know that How would I create reports with the use of MongoDB ? OR please let me know the other ways to do this. Please let me know if this could be done via any service or component for .Net Win forms. Thanks in advance.
