How can I stop vim from loading a syntax file automatically for certain file types?

I am working on a project writing a GLSL fragment shader, and it just so happens it has the file extension .fs , thus vim automatically loads the forth syntax upon opening the file. This normally would be no problem, I could just change the syntax using au BufRead but for some reason the forth syntax is loaded first, which completely messes things up. It adds more characters to a "word" which causes syntax highlighting and motions to not work as expected. Is there a way to stop the forth syntax from loading, and only load my specified syntax?
