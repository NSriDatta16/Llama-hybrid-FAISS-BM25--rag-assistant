Calling Objective-C method from C++ member function?

I have a class ( EAGLView ) which calls a member function of a C++ class without problems. Now, the problem is that I need to call in that C++ class a objective-C function [context renderbufferStorage:GL_RENDERBUFFER fromDrawable:(CAEAGLLayer*)self.layer]; which I cannot do in C++ syntax. I could wrap this Objective-C call to the same Objective-C class which in the first place called the C++ class, but then I need to somehow call that method from C++ , and I cannot figure out how to do it. I tried to give a pointer to EAGLView object to the C++ member function and include the " EAGLView.h " in my C++ class header but I got 3999 errors.. So.. how should I do this? An example would be nice.. I only found pure C examples of doing this.
