If you are trying to detect (as soon as possible ) when it finished then I would use Intervention Detection procedures http://docplayer.net/12080848-Outliers-level-shifts-and-variance-changes-in-time-series.html to form a hybrid model of memory (arima) and latent deterministic structure (pulses/level-step shifts, seasonal pulses and local time trends). I would take the values up to 11:50 and incremenatlly add future values one at a a time AND then determine when the statistical model identification process suggested a permanent level shift based collectively on the new observatioms . This would require you to specify either implicitely or explicitely the minimum # of future values (L) before a statistically significcant level shift was declared/ proclaimed/found at a specific level of confidence (Z). I have recently incorporated a third "given" and that is the minimum magnitude of the level shift into my research and practice. In this way the user can minimize false level shift conclusions as not being "LARGE ENOUGH OR SUBSTANTIAL ENOUGH " to warrant attention. If you can share your data ( or some proxy ) in a csv file I will try and help further.
