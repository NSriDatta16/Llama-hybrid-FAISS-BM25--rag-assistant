How do I interpret negative SHAP values for a marketing model?

I am building a marketing model to evaluate marketing channel effectiveness. My inputs are the marketing spend for each channel, and my target variable is sales. I have 3 years of weekly data in this format. I used xgboost in the model so that I can use SHAP to get the relative impact of each channel on sales. I would like to go one step further and use the SHAP values to get a weekly attribution of the sales for each channel (i.e. channel 1 contributed x sales, channel 2 contributed y sales, etc.). However, I am running into a weird issue. I have a lot of weeks where one or more channels has a negative SHAP value, which I can only interpret to mean that the marketing spend in that channel that week somehow lowered the sales. This doesn't make sense to me, I would think that the worst a channel could do is have no impact on sales. In other types of models, I know that negative SHAP values mean that the channel had a negative impact on the target variable, I just don't understand the interpretation in the context of a marketing model. I further don't know how to get channel attribution with these negative SHAP values. Has anyone built a model where negative SHAP values aren't interpretable in your context? I have searched for a way to restrict the SHAP values to be positive (you can do this with the coefficients of traditional linear models), or for ways to deal with the negative values but I have come up empty.
