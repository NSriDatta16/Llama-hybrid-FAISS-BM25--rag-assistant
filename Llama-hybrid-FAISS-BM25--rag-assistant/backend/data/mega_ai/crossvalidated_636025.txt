Decomposition time series

I am studying a daily dataset from a game which contains informations about the peak of players from 2013-2023. This is my first try applying decomposition to see how time series components behaves. Later I would like to perform a forecasting using some models, I have applied the ADF test and it revealed the series as stationary. I'm having some questions to determine what value could fit better in the period parammeter with a daily data. This is the series over the whole time I've used the statsmodels seasonal_decompose() with a period value as 365 and this is the results obtained using additive and multiplicative model. Additive model: Multiplicative model: Based on different types of time series data such as annual, monthly and daily, how should the choice of period be made?
