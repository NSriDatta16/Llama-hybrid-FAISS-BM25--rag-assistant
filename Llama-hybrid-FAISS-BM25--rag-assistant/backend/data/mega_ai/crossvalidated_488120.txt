Any introductory paper, dealing with 'logistic regression on time series data'

Question Can you introduce me any academic paper dealing with "logistic regression on time series data"? The difficulty of the academic papers that I want is the introductory level for college sophomores studying statistics. (So not so difficult please) I guess the logistic regression on time-series data should be different from cross-sectional data.
