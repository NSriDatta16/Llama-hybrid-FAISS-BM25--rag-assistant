ARIMA vs SARIMA

I am a self learner, and I am studying time series analysis. I came through the fact that ARIMA can be used to model a time series which is not stationary (Integrated ARMA model). The non stationarity taken in to account in an ARIMA model is the nonstationarity that can be removed by differencing. I am wondering whether a seasonality is the type of nonstationarity that can be removed by differencing? If yes, so for a non seasonal data, we may use ARIMA modeling, so why we have SARIMA modeling ? If no, how seasonality can be removed in order to make data stationary?
