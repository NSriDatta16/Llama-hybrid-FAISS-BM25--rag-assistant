Confidence intervals: What does the histogram of sample means have to do with the true population mean?

I believe the interpretation of a 95% confidence interval is the following: in 95% of random samples, the true population mean is within 2 standard errors of the sample mean. The 95% number comes from the normal distribution: in a normal distribution, 95% of the data lies within 2 standard errors of the mean. I think the normal distribution in this context is referring to the histogram of sample averages, i.e. the histogram that forms when one repeatedly samples the population and plots the averages. The central limit theorem tells us that when a large number of samples are taken, this histogram approximates a normal curve. However, I donâ€™t understand how the histogram of sample averages is relevant here in the first place. Why does the histogram of sample averages come into play while we are making a statement about the population parameter? I am just not seeing the connection. Any help is appreciated. And please feel free to correct any other errors I may have in my understanding.
