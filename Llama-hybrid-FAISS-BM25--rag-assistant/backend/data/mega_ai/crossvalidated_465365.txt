I couldn't think of any "closed form" solutions, so I ended up using an iterative approach. The method is as follows: If the average pixel intensity is higher (brighter) than the desired mean, just iteratively multiply the image by a value less than $1$ , say $0.995$ , until the image drops below my desired value. The case is a little different for brightening an image, since if you multiply it by a value over $1$ , then pixel intensities will be above the max value ( $1$ ). Instead, you brighten the image like this: im = im*(1-x)+1*x where x is some constant between $0$ and $1$ , and the $1$ denotes the max brightness value. Using this method, I can get the mean of the image to my desired value $\pm eta$ within 50 iterations, which runs fast enough on the computer for my task. It doesn't quite adhere to my original requirement of maintaining the range of the image, but it works for my use case.
