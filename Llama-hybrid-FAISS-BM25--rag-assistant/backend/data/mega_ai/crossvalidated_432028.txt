Is signal detection theory a Bayesian approach?

Signal detection theory can be applied to modeling perception thresholds for defined stimuli, for example the detection of the presence of a specific signal. It is assumed both the stimulus intensity derived in absence and in presence of the signal are subject to random variations/noise. As I understand, gaussian noise is often assumed. For modelling detection itself, a binary criterion can be applied by using a threshold. Wikipedia has a section on the Bayesian criterion , which enables different importances to be applied to signal detection theory problems. I also found lecture slides that list signal detection theory in the context of Bayesian statistics, but there are no explicit mentions of whether the theory itself is a Bayesian approach. My question is Is signal detection theory a Bayesian approach? Why?
