Random Forest in R: Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object not found

I use the randomForest package in R but I'm getting the following error: Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos) : object 'a' not found The line that causes the problem is the following: model = randomForest(class ~ a + b + c, data=train, ntree=100 I looked up the error and apparently it has to do with the fact that train does not contain a , but I manually checked train and it does contain a . As a matter of fact, when I try to build a decision tree instead, it works just fine! (with the same formula and dataset) model = rpart(class ~ a + b + c, data=train, method="class") So I don't understand where this error is coming from. Any ideas? EDIT : There seems to be a problem with the fact that I use bigrams for my text. If I just use unigrams, it works fine. If I use this code for example: model = randomForest(class ~ `stack overflow`, data=train, ntree=100) It returns the error named above: object 'stack overflow' cannot be found.
