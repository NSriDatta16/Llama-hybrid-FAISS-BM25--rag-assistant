defer is a mechanism not only for handling errors but also for doing a comfortable and controlled cleanup. Now panic works like raise() in other languages. With the help of the function recover() you've got the chance to catch this panic while it goes up the call stack. This way it's almost similar to try/catch. But while the latter works on blocks panic/recover works on function level. Rob Pike about the reason for this solution: "We don't want to encourage the conflation of errors and exceptions that occur in languages such as Java.". Instead of having a large number of different exceptions with an even larger number of usages one should do everything to avoid runtime errors, deliver proper error return values after determination and use panic/recover only if there's no other way.
