There is nothing inherently wrong with any of these encodings. The best way to find out which works best is to use a validation set to verify your encoding methods. Label encoding is usually not preferred for sklearn tree based models because the model treats it as a numerical value and might form a decision tree such as if x>5 go to left tree else go to right tree which does not make any sense. One hot encoding solves this issue but uses alot of memory. One option is to use other models such as xgboost which allow you to pass in integers as categorical variables.
