You register no IE visits because your script with location.href = ... runs before the Google Analytics code gets a chance to run. You could have registered that IE6 visit if IE 6 failed to do the location.href assignment (I've seen problems reported with this) but did run the analytics js code. An IE 6 visitor had javascript turned off (in this case they wouldn't run the analytics code either, so wouldn't register a visit) Another browser is impersonating IE 6, e.g. in the User-Agent string, but doesn't process the conditional comments. You can move your conditional comment and the script within it to the end of the page, after the analytics js code if you want Google to count it but still send them off to getfirefox.com You can also just say don't test a specific version if you always want to send IE away.
