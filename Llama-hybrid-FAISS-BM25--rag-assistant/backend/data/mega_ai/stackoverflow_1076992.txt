Writing your own storage-system: where to start?

reading about NoSQL ( http://nosql.eventbrite.com/ ), a movement aimed at encouraging the dropping of traditional relational databases in favor of custom, application-suited storage systems. Intrigued by the idea of trying to write a small personal storage system (for the .net framework) as a learning pet project, what are you suggestions or useful links? Where to start? How to balance what's on the hard drive and what's in memory? I think this could be an interesting opportunity to learn the insides of database inner work, but I really lack the most basic theory of it. Thanks.
