Try adding helper: 'clone' to your .draggable options: $('#roleList > li').draggable({ helper: 'clone', connectToSortable: '#roleDrop', containment: '#container', revert: 'invalid' }); According to the jQuery documentation , you should set this option when connecting a draggable to a sortable. While this yields a different interface experience (dragged items are cloned instead of moved), it's at least a temporary workaround for what the documentation implies is a known problem. Additional event handling could clean the original item out of #roleList during the #roleDrop update callback.
