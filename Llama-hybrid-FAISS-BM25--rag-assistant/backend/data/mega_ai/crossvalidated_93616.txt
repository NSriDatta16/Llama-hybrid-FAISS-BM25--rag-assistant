Which steps have to be done before fitting logistic curve to time-series?

I want to cluster time-series concerning sales of products. In the database I have 26weeks after launching each products and units sold each week. One of the method of clustering is to cluster parameters of growth curve fitted to time-series. Can somebody tell me what should I do before fitting logistic curve to time-series? Should I use standardization, create model to each time series, use lsm to count parameters and then cluster them? I would be grateful for any explanation.
