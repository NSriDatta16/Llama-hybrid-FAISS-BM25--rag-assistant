You may show that: $$n\mathrm{Var}\left(n^{-1}\sum_{t = 1}^n \sum_{|j| > m}\psi_j\varepsilon_{t - j}\right) \to \left(\sum_{|j| > m}\psi_j\right)^2\sigma^2$$ as $n \to \infty$ by expanding the variane of sums. Then the result follows from the condition of the absolute convergence of $\psi$ series. I also want to point out that the wording "as $m, n \to \infty$ " is sloppy, the rigorous statement is: $$\lim_{m \to \infty}\limsup_{n \to \infty}n\mathrm{Var}\left(n^{-1}\sum_{t = 1}^n \sum_{|j| > m}\psi_j\varepsilon_{t - j}\right) = 0.$$ In other words, the order of $m$ and $n$ approach to $\infty$ matters. Also, to check variance converges to zero is a sufficient but not necessary condition, see, for example, Proposition 6.3.9 of Time Series: Theory and Methods (2nd edition) by P. J. Brockwell and R. A. Davis.
