Adding UISplitviewController to nib file of universal app, object not showing

So I've upgraded my iphone app to a universal app and am trying to add a uisplitviewcontroller. In MainWindow-ipad.xib, when I try to drag an object to the window, uisplitviewcontroller isn't an option. Furthermore, the screen size is the iphone's dimensions, not the ipad's. How do I get this to work with the universal app? Thanks. Valid XHTML http://img687.imageshack.us/img687/504/screenshot20100809at436.png
