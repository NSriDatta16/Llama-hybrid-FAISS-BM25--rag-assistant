Bayesian spam filtering library for Python

I am looking for a Python library which does Bayesian Spam Filtering. I looked at SpamBayes and OpenBayes, but both seem to be unmaintained (I might be wrong). Can anyone suggest a good Python (or Clojure, Common Lisp, even Ruby) library which implements Bayesian Spam Filtering? Thanks in advance. Clarification : I am actually looking for a Bayesian Spam Classifier and not necessarily a spam filter. I just want to train it using some data and later tell me whether some given data is spam. Sorry for any confusion.
