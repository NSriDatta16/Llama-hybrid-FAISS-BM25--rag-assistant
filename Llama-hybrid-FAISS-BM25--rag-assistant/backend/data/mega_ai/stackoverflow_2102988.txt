My guess is that it's because you're declaring the storage inside the "if" statement. I didn't even think that would compile. Try this. int alpha; if ((alpha=value1-value2) && alpha>0.001) But I don't think this is doing what you need. You have alpha as an int, and you're then comparing it to a floating point value. The first part of the && statement will retrun true as long as alpha is not zero and the second part will return true if alpha is greater than 0. So you should probably do this int alpha; if ((alpha=value1-value2)>0) or for much more readable code int alpha=value1-value2 if (alpha>0) But to answer your original question: && is executed left to right and short circuited when the answer is obvious. I.e., if the first part of the && is false, the second isn't even evaulated!
