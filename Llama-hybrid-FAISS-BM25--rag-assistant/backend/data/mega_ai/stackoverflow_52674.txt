Simplest way to reverse the order of strings in a make variable

Let's say you have a variable in a makefile fragment like the following: MY_LIST=a b c d How do I then reverse the order of that list? I need: $(warning MY_LIST=${MY_LIST}) to show MY_LIST=d c b a Edit: the real problem is that ld -r some_object.o ${MY_LIST} produces an a.out with undefined symbols because the items in MY_LIST are actually archives, but in the wrong order. If the order of MY_LIST is reversed, it will link correctly (I think). If you know a smarter way to get the link order right, clue me in.
