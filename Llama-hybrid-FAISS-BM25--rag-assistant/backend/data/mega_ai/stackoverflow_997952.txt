Is it fair to say that high code coverage and high performance not needed for a well designed unit test?

In designing unit tests, from what I've read you should try to stick to these principles: Isolate your tests from each other Test only a single behavior at a time Make sure the test is repeatable On the other hand, these features do not always seem to correlate with a good test: High code coverage High performance Is this a fair approach?
