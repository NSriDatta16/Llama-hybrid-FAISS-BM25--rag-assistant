If we think of designs made up of $n$ cases measured on $k$ occasions, then the following loose definition seems to me to be descriptive of the distinction: longitudinal designs: high $n$, low $k$ time series: low $n$, high $k$ Of course, this raises the question of what is high and what is low. Summarising my own rough sense of these fuzzy definitions, prototypical examples of: time series might have $n$ = 1, 2, or 5 and $k$ = 20, 50, 100, or 1000, and longitudinal designs might have $n$ = 10, 50, 100, 1000 and $k$ = 2, 3, 5, 10, 20 Update: Following up on Dr Who's question about what is the purpose of the distinction, I don't have an authoritative answer, but here are a few thoughts: terminology evolves in disciplines concerned with particular substantive problems time series often concerned with forecasting future time points often concerned with modelling various cyclical and trend processes often concerned with describing temporal dynamics in great detail often studies phenomena where the particular thing measured is of specific interest (e.g., unemployment rate, stock market indices, etc.) temporal indices are often pre-existing longitudinal designs: often use samples of cases as exemplars of a population in order to make inferences about the population (e.g., sample of children to study how children change in general) often concerned with fairly general temporal processes like growth, variability and relatively simple functional change models study is often specifically designed to have a given number of time points. often interested in variation in change processes Given the differences in the actual temporal dynamics, and the particular combination of $k$ and $n$ this creates different statistical modelling challenges. For example, with high $n$ and low $k$ multilevel models are often used that borrow strength from the typical change process to describe the individual change process. These different disciplines, modelling challenges, and literatures encourage the creation of distinct terminology. Anyway, that's my impression. Perhaps others have greater insight.
