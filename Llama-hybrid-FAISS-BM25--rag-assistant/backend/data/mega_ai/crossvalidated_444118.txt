Can you use multiple reference groups in a single logistic regression?

When performing logistic regression for a binary categorical variable (i.e. 'gender', being Male or Female in this simple example) and some outcome (say smoker vs nonsmoker ), you should dummy encode the categorical variable and then drop one column to avoid the dummy variable trap. As an example: dropping Male , this now becomes the reference group. The Male odds ratio is thus reported as 1, and the Female odds ratio is relative to the odds for the Male group. If you include a second categorical variable in the logistic regression and do the same thing, do you then have two reference groups? Does this extend to as many categorical variables as you want? Example: Male is dropped and is then a reference group (OR=1), and Caucasian is dropped, so becomes another reference group (OR also =1). Female OR is then relative to Male , and Non-Caucasian is then relative to Caucasian .
