Machine Learning is not an answer for the question of Life, the Universe, and Everything or silver bullet but a very powerful tool which you should apply to a problem (and corresponding data). So, the short answer to your question is 'depends on data you have and problems you see'. Generally, the best way would be taking any available introductory course into Data Science / Machine Learning, given you have at least some programming experience so that you could complete assignments: that would not address your question directly, but you will get your hands on some examples of data and will see how ML is used to tackle that data. After you will grow some understanding, you will see potential applications of ML when you see any particular blob of data.
