Reporting spam or abuse

How would you allow users in sites such as a forum/blog comments .etc mark content as spam or abusive? I know you can use services such as askimet and create Bayesian spam filter classes, but what would be the best way to implement a system that allows users to report content? Would you add an extra field to the item table called spam and/or flagged and how would you differentiate betweeen the two? Basically how would you set up such a system, what would be the database structure? Is there something that does this already in php?
