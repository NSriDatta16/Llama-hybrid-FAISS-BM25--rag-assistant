BIC model comparison

My go/nogo task was recorded in 4 blocks, each with a new set of cue images, with the learning and therefore the Q-values being reset at the beginning of each block. I have fitted different versions of a Q-learning-based Rescorla-Wagner model on my behavior dataset, once on the whole dataset irrespective of the blocks, and once separately on each block. This way, I'm using the exact same models, but once I am including block as a degree of freedom, and once not. I have a set of BIC scores for the models for when I fit completely, and 4 sets of BIC scores for when I fit on each block. To decide which approach is better, to fit completely or to fit block-wise, should I simply use BIC scores? How should I integrate the BIC scores of the block-wise fit into one, so that I can compare it with the one from the full fit?
