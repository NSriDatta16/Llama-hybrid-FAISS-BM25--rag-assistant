The only alternative to using IFRAMEs to load dynamic content (after the page has loaded) is using AJAX to update a container on your web page. It's pretty elegant and usually faster than loading a full page structure into an IFRAME. Ajax with JQuery (use this and you will be loved on SO; the AJAX functions are great and simple) Ajax with Prototype Ajax with MooTools Standalone Ajax with Matt Kruse's AJAX toolbox (Used to use this, using JQuery today because I needed a framework) AJAX with Dojo (Said to be fast, but AJAX is not as straightforward)
