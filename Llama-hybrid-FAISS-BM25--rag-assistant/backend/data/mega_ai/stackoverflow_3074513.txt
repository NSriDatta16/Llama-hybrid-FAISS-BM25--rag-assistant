I don't really use that but perhaps this may help: If OpenSSL is being compiled for a development system in which SSL will be debugged at the protocol level, omitting the command -DSSL_FORBID_ENULLis acceptable. -DSSL_FORBID_ENULL causes OpenSSL to omit null ciphers in the SSL cipher suite. Null ciphers permit cleartext (unencrypted information) to traverse the wire. Null ciphers provide no confidentiality and aren't encouraged for use on production systems.
