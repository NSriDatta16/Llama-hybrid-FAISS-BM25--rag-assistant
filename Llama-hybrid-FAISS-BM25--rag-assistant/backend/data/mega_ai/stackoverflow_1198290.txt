You can't embed an in-proc COM server (a DLL that is to be registered with regsvr32) into a class library assembly without the COM server becoming infunctional. Registering with regsvr32 exposes the COM classes implemented in the COM server to the registry. Later consumers of that server would look up the registry to find where the COM server resides and try to load it and call the DllGetClassObject() function. If they don't manage to do that they will be unable to use the COM server. I'm sure you can't do the embedding and preserve functioning of this mechanism.
