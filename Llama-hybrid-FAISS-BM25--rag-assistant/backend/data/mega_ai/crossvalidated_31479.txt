"I am also interested to hear about the bugs or flaws you have encountered with Google Docs." I will respond to that part of the original question only. My explorations with Google Docs Spreadsheets (GSheets) have been concerned with the mathematical and statistical functions. In the end my assessment is that Google Spreadsheets is in that respect much inferior in 2012 to the maligned Excel of 1997. Witness: Google Sheets apparently evaluates erfc(x) using erfc(x)=1-erf(x) for arguments for which erf(x) is close to 1. They evaluate a standard deviation or a variance via average of the squares minus square of the average; it is bad numerical practice. Combinatorial functions and discrete probabilities such as poisson(n,x) = pow(x,n)*exp(-x)/n! are evaluated factor-by-factor, causing needless overflow. The factorial is evaluated using Stirling's approximation factor-by-factor, causing further needless overflow. The cumulative Poisson distribution is evaluated by simply doing the finite sum, so the normalization property is lost in the round-off; the same is true for the cumulative binomial distribution. The cumulative normal distribution is completely messed up; it goes outside the [0,1] range. There is a general loss of accuracy relative to the implementations of the same functions in other packages. The descriptions of elementary functions such as rounding are often garbled and unintelligible; the interpretation is a guessing game. I have documented these issues in two sets of postings on the Google Docs product forums: (2011-11-13 and later) normdist throws negative value still https://productforums.google.com/d/topic/docs/XfBPtoKJ1Ws/ (2012-05-06 and later) Errors and other issues with statistical and mathematical functions in GSheets https://productforums.google.com/d/topic/docs/rxFCHYeMhrU/
