Best approach for rule-based system in multilabel classification-problem?

I’m new to the world of NLP and am looking for some guidance. I want to create a rule-based system that “grades” text in accordance to some set of criteria. For example, one criteria could be “The author mentions that he/she wants money”, another “The author mentions working toward promotion”. My initial idea was to use some available, open-source NLP-model, such as en_core_web_lg from the spaCy library. With such a model I could look at all verbs in a text, and classify texts as adhering to certain criteria when they have an appropriate verb with appropriate subject and object. I’ve read somewhere that exploiting the linguistic structure of sentences is a bad/unreliable way to go about things. The problem is that I don’t have any substantive data so as to allow supervised learning. How do one typically go about creating a rule-based system for such a task? Is there any name for the problem I want to solve, maybe “Multi-label classification”? Any resources you could point me to? Help a noob out! I greatly appreciate it.
