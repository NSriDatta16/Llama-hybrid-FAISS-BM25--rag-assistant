Difference vs log-difference: do they behave similarly?

Consider two positively-valued time series, $\{X(t),Y(t)>0|t\geq0\}$. Now consider two transformations: $$ U(t) = Y(t) - \beta X(t),\\ V(t) = \ln{[Y(t)]} - \ln{[\beta X(t)]}, $$ with $\beta>0$ such that $\mathbb{E}[U(t)] = 0$. My interest is in the behaviour of $U(t)$ and $V(t)$, and whether or not they move together. My intuition (and rough simulation) tells me that they do, more or less, provided that $\mathbb{E}[U(t)]=0$ holds. Is it possible to show that a given percentage change in $U(t)$ from $t$ to $t+1$ is accompanied by an approximately equal percentage change in $V(t)$ from $t$ to $t+1$? That is, $$ \frac{U(t+1)}{U(t)}-1 \approx \frac{V(t+1)}{V(t)}-1. $$
