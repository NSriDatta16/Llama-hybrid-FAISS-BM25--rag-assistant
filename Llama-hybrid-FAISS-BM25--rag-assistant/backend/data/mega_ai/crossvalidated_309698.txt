Meta-Analysis on Effect Sizes with 95% Bayesian CI from CausalImpact R package

I am using the CausalImpact package in R to calculate the impact of a marketing intervention using Bayesian Structural Time Series. This methodology and package is explained in Broderson et al. 2015 found at https://research.google.com/pubs/pub41854.html (direct PDF link here ). I calculated the impact of a marketing intervention in 18 clinics (the "test" subjects). Using the package, I calculated the causal impact of the intervention compared with the respective synthetic control in each of the 18 clinics. A replicable example of one sample intervention is available from Google's Github page on CausalImpact and the code is provided below: library(CausalImpact) #code from Google's Github page on CausalImpact package set.seed(1) x1 For this example, one can pull out the "Relative Effect" (effect size), along with the lower 95% CI, upper 95% CI, and SD values for this one example intervention. impact$summary$RelEffect[1] impact$summary$RelEffect.lower[1] impact$summary$RelEffect.upper[1] impact$summary$RelEffect.sd[1] I have done this for 18 different "test" clinics. For each one, I have the effect size along with the corresponding 95% CI and SD. My question is this: In what way can I summarize the intervention in one single, summary metric while taking into account variance for each result? I believe this involves a random effects Meta-Analysis approach by inverse weighing of the variance, but I am not certain. I tried looking into the Metafor package in R ( http://www.metafor-project.org/doku.php/analyses ), but I cannot seem to find an appropriate analysis or code. Most of the examples I have seen require a sample size for multiple studies. The best I can think of is that my results are analogous to 18 different studies with a sample size of n=1, though I do not think that is a valid interpretation. As the CausalImpact methodology is based on a Bayesian approach, the CI are also not necessarily symmetrical (as seen in the example above). I am also uncertain how to present these results in an appropriate forest plot. Any help on getting one summary metric is hugely appreciated. I apologize for any errors I may have made. Thank you.
