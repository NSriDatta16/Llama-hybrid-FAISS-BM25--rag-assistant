ASP.NET MVC 3 How to have multi-field create capability for Model with ICollection Property on Create view

Note: I'm using MVC3+Razor, EF4, CF-CTP5 How can you allow the view to have the ability to add multiple Address classes per Organization dynamically on the client, and bound strongly to the model on post? How can you have the view parse values in the model if the (ModelState.IsValid == false) such that if you enter 3 addresses and post an invalid model, it re-populates the number addresses and with their appropriate values? Here are my models: public class Organization { public int Id { get; set; } public string Name { get; set; } public virtual ICollection Addresses { get; set; } public virtual ICollection PhoneNumbers { get; set; } ... } public class Address { public int Id { get; set; } public string Line1 { get; set; } public string Line2 { get; set; } public string City { get; set; } public string State { get; set; } public string PostalCode { get; set; } public string Country { get; set; } public int Type { get; set; } } I'm trying to figure out how you can have the Create action for Organization (/Organization/Create) handle the create like thus (such that addresses and phone numbers are part of the submitted model): [HttpPost] public ActionResult Create(Organization organization) { if (ModelState.IsValid) { _db.Organizations.Add(organization); _db.SaveChanges(); return RedirectToAction("Details", organization.Id); } return View(organization); }
