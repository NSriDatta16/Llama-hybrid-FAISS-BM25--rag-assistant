The formula you provide is an estimator . There are many ways to get estimators: least squares, maximum likelihood, Bayesian, etc. The normal distribution has two parameters. Typically (but not always), the parameters are the mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$. These do NOT depend on any $x_i$, but instead they describe the distribution of those $x_i$. The maximum likelihood estimators for $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ are $$ \hat{\mu} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N x_i, \quad \hat{\sigma}^2 = \frac{1}{N} (x_i-\hat{\mu})^2. $$ Notice that these estimators have the caret symbol to emphasize that they are estimates of the parameters $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ (but not their actual values). So if $X\sim N(\mu,\sigma^2)$, i.e. the random variable $X$ has a normal distribution with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$, then the pdf is $$f_X(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} e^{-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2} (x-\mu)^2}.$$ The domain variables are variables representing the random variables. For this normal distribution $x$ is the domain variable. The kernel, dropping all terms from the pdf that do not include the domain variable x, is $$f_X(x) \propto e^{-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2} (x-\mu)^2}.$$
