Why we try to capture variability?

I am new to Statistics and I have a Mathematics background. In Statistics, particularly in Linear Regression and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) so far what I have understood is that the main idea is to try to capture as much as possible variability present in the data. In linear regression, while calculating $ R^{2} (R \ squared)$ measure we are checking the proportion of variability captured by our model and in PCA we are forming a new basis along which our data has the maximum possible variability. Is there any significant result behind this logic? I mean why we have to go after variability? Any help in this matter will be appreciated.
