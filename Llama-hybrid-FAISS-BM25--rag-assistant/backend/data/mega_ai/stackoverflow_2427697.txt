If the statements are very regular like this why not run your files through a little Perl script? The core logic to do the find-and-transform is simple for your example line. Here's a bare bones approach: use strict; while(<>) { my $line = $_; chomp($line); if ( $line =~ m/(\S+)\s*=\s*\((\s*\S+\s*)\)\s*\?\s*(\S+)\s*:\s*(\S+)\s*;/ ) { print "if(" . $2 . ")\n\t" . $1 . " = " . $3 . "\nelse\n\t" . $1 . " = " . $4 . "\n"; } else { print $line . "\n"; } } exit(0); You'd run it like so: perl transformer.pl foo.c.new Of course it gets harder and harder if the text pattern isn't as regular as the one you posted. But free, quick and easy to try.
