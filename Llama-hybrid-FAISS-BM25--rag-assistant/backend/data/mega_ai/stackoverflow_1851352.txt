C : Store and index a HUGH amount of info! School Project

i need to do a school project in C (I'm really don't know c++ as well). I need a data struct to index each word of about 34k documents, its a lot of words, and need to do some ranking about the words, i already did this project about 2 years ago (i'm pause in the school and back this year) and a i use a hash table of binary tree, but i got a small grade cause my project took about 2hours to index all words. I need something a little fast... any sugestions? Tkz Roberto
