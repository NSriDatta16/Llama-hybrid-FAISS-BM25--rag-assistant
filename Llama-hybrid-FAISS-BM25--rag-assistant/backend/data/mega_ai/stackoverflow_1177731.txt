I use GWT mainly for internal systems but find all I need is a well organised codebase, PAC pattern and Hibernate. Does what I need very nicely. I started out trying to use tools like dozer to serialise beans across client-server but quickly found it unnecessary. If you need a collection of bars on foo, then pull down list aka getBars(foo). You need to save foo - RPC it up to save(). Keep it simple, pull down what you need, post what you need, no more. Maintain state on the client and it all hangs together nicely. The big thing for me was to get my head around the fact that GWT isn't about building a web app. It's about building an app on the web. Very different thing. GurffT EDIT : Forgot to say, I do have a logic layer interacting with DAO objects server side - but they are pretty simple and just instantiated with new!
