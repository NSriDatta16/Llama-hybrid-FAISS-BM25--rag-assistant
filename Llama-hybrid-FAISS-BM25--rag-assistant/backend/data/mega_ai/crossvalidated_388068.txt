Moving Average Representation of a Stationary Time Series

I was wondering if this equation is considered a Moving Average process of order 13? If so, does that mean that the coefficients at times t-2 to t-11 are 0? As they are clearly not present in this equation. (B is the Back shift operator and at is a white noise random variable)
