I answered my own question after some research. Please comment if something is wrong. Frequentist confidence interval An exact confidence interval can be derived based on the probability mass function for a Poisson distribution, $$ P(X \le k) = \frac{\lambda^ke^{-\lambda}}{k!} $$ in which $k$ is some possible count and $\lambda$ is the mean and variance. In our case, with a count of zero, $k = 0$ , so $$ P(X = 0) = \frac{\lambda^0e^{-\lambda}}{0!}=e^{-\lambda} $$ For a given level of confidence, $1-\alpha$ , we can use this to solve for an upper bound on the estimate of $\lambda$ : $$ \alpha = e^{-\lambda}$$ $$ log(\alpha) = log(e^{-\lambda})$$ $$ log(\alpha) = -\lambda$$ $$ \hat{\lambda}_{upper} = -log(\alpha)$$ For a 95% confidence interval the upper confidence limit for a single observation of a Poisson random variable with a count of zero is $-log(.05)=2.995732$ , and for a 99% confidence interval the upper limit is $-log(.01)=4.60517$ . The sum of multiple Poisson random variables is also a Poisson random variable, with mean $n\lambda$ , so to convert these confidence limits for our case with 50 observations, we can simply divide by 50. $$UCL_{95}=2.995732/50=0.05991464$$ $$UCL_{99}=4.60517/50=0.0921034$$ Bayesian credible interval The likelihood is from a Poisson distribution: $$L(\lambda|x)=\prod_{i=1}^n\frac{e^{-\lambda}\lambda^{x_i}}{x_i!}=\frac{e^{-n\lambda}\lambda^{\sum x_i}}{\prod_{i=1}^n(x_i!)} $$ If you make the prior a $gamma(\alpha,\beta)$ : $$p(\lambda)=\frac{\beta^{\alpha}}{\Gamma(\alpha)}\lambda^{\alpha-1}e^{-\beta\lambda} $$ then the posterior is a $gamma(\sum x_i + \alpha, n+\beta) $ : $$p(\lambda|x)=\frac{p(x|\lambda)p(\lambda)}{p(x)}\propto p(x|\lambda)p(\lambda) $$ $$p(\lambda|x) \propto e^{-n\lambda}\lambda^{\sum x_i}\lambda^{\alpha-1}e^{-\beta\lambda} = \lambda^{\sum x_i + \alpha - 1} e^{-(n+\beta)\lambda} $$ If you use $\alpha = 1$ and $\beta = 0$ in the prior then the upper credible limits are the same as the upper confidence limits. For this particular case, we can use the 95th and 99th percentiles of a $gamma(1, 50)$ distribution to get the upper limits of 95% and 99% credible intervals (remember the $\sum x_i = 0$ for this particular case). In R you could use: > qgamma(.95, shape = 1, rate = 50) [1] 0.05991465 > qgamma(.99, shape = 1, rate = 50) [1] 0.0921034 Difference in approaches The two approaches result in the same interval bounds, but they have different estimates. For the frequentist approach, the point estimate for the Poisson mean is the maximum likelihood estimate, which for a Poisson distribution is just the average of the sample: $$\hat{\lambda}=\frac{0}{50}= 0$$ For the Bayesian approach, the point estimate for the Poisson mean is the mean of the posterior distribution, which is a $gamma(1, 50)$ : $$\hat{\lambda}=\frac{\alpha}{\beta}=\frac{1}{50}= 0.02$$
