IS VS and .NET Fragmented just like android?

I have been using ASP.NET to develop web apps for sometime now(around 4 years). But all of a sudden I feel .NET and VS is too fragmented. Say for example there are WinForms and WPF to develop windows apps and Web Forms and MVC to develop web apps. I know its a choice that devs have to make. But sometimes I feel there are too many technologies to master in .NET framework and the list seems to continue with time. Comments welcome..
