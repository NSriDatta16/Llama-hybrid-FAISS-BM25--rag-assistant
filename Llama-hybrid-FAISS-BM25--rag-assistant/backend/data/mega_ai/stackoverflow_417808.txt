You should be fine to learn C# while working on an ASP.NET project. I will advise that if you're already pretty familiar with the Web, you'll probably find working with the ASP.NET MVC framework more enjoyable. ASP.NET takes some liberties with the page lifecycle in an attempt to make web pages programmed more like desktop applications. Personally, I think this makes ASP.NET hard to use, but then my background is in Perl and PHP.
