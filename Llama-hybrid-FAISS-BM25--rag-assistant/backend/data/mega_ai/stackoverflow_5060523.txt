Embedding BandCamp player in UIWebView?

I'm trying to embed a bandcamp music player into my app. Although their players are generally Flash-based, they are HTML5 when loaded in iOS mobile Safari. Trouble is, it only seems to work in mobile Safari itself... when I try to embed a player in a UIWebView, it tells me my browser is unsupported. Is there any way around this or am I hosed? Example URL (obtained from the "Share" button on any bandcamp player): http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=355390343/size=grande3/bgcol=000000/linkcol=1275c4/
