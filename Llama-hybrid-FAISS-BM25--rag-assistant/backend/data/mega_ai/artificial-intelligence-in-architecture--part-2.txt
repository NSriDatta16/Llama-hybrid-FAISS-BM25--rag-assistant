enes not usually present in initial plans, which he believes can significantly alter client presentations. He told Dezeen he believes one should show clients renderings from the onset, with AI assisting in this work, arguing that changes in design should be a positive aspect of the client-designer relationship by actively involving clients in the process. Additionally, Kudless highlighted the AI's potential to facilitate labor in architectural firms, particularly in automating rendering tasks, thus reducing the workload on junior staff while maintaining control over the creative output. Emergent aesthetics In an interview for the AItopia series to Dezeen, designer Tim Fu discussed the transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in architecture, there he proposed a future where AI could herald a "neoclassical futurist" style, blending the grandeur of classical aesthetics with futuristic design. Through his collaborative project, The AI Stone Carver, Fu showcased how AI can innovate traditional practices by generating design concepts that are then realized through human craftsmanship, such as stone carving by mason Till Apfel. This approach he believed celebrated the fusion of diverse architectural styles and also emphasized the unique capabilities of AI in enhancing creative design processes. Fu told Dezeen he envisions the integration of AI in design as a means to revive the ornamentation and detailed aesthetics characteristic of classical architecture, moving away from the minimalism, which he said dominates contemporary architecture. He argued that AI's involvement in the ideation phase of design allows for a reversal in the roles of machine and human, enabling architects and designers to focus on creating more intricate and ornamental structures. Fu's optimistic outlook extended to the broader impact of AI on the architectural field, seeing it as an indispensable tool that will shift rather than replace human roles, enriching the field with innovative designs that pay homage to the beauty and qualities of classical architecture not present in contemporary architecture while embracing new technologies. This perspective resonates with designers like Manas Bhatia, whose explorations similarly embrace generative AI as a co-creator and a medium to express ideas, blend architectural traditions, and speculate spatial futures. Concerns As artificial intelligence continues to expand its presence across various industries, its impact on the architectural profession has become a topic of growing discussion. These discussions focus on how AI processes may influence traditional architectural practices, potentially altering job roles, and shaping the nature of creativity. While AI-driven processes may increase efficiency in some aspects of the profession, it also raises questions about the potential loss of unique design perspectives. These thoughts have been countered by many prominent creative figures in the realm of AI Architecture such as Stephen Coorlas, Tim Fu, Hassan Ragab, and Manas Bhatia who have showcased the amplification of creativity in design and potential benefits in terms of restoring creative power to the designer. A key concern is that AI-powered tools could diminish the need for human involvement in specific tasks traditionally performed by architects. This has led to speculation that the profession may increasingly shift toward roles focused on oversight, coordination, and strategic decision-making rather than hands-on design work. In some design scenarios, algorithmically generated solutions can be adjusted to prioritize efficiency and cost-effectiveness, which some argue may overshadow the creative and contextual nuances that define individual architectural styles. As with any discipline though, it has been determined that AI can be configured to provide beneficial results based on inputs and end goals the architect or designer assigns it. There are also concerns about the potential for AI to exacerbat
