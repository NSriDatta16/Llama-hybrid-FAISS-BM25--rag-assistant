As per the comments: actually i want to extract information such as product name,price etc of all products listed in an online shopping site such as amazon.com How should i go about it??? Step 1: read their robots file. It's usually found on the root of the site, for example http://amazon.com/robots.txt . If the URL you're trying to access is covered by a Disallow on an User-Agent of * , then stop here. Contact them, explain them in detail what you're trying to do and ask them for ways/alternatives/webservices which can provide you the information you need. Else you're violating the laws and you may risk to get blacklisted by the site and/or by your ISP or worse. If not, then proceed to step 2. Step 2: check if the site in question hasn't already a public webservice available which is much more easy to use than parsing a whole HTML page. Using a webservice, you'll get exactly the information you're looking for in a concise format (JSON or XML) based on a simple set of parameters. Look around or contact them for details about any webservices. If there's no way, proceed to step 3. Step 3: learn how HTML/CSS/JS work, learn how to work with webdeveloper tools like Firebug, learn how to interpret the HTML/CSS/JS source you see by rightclick > View Page Source . My bet that the site in question uses JS/Ajax to load/populate the information you'd like to gather. In that case, you'll need to use a HTML parser which is capable of parsing and executing JS as well (the one you're using namely doesn't do that). This isn't going to be an easy job, so I won't explain it in detail until it's entirely clear what you're trying to achieve and if that is allowed and if there aren't more-easy-to-use webservices available.
