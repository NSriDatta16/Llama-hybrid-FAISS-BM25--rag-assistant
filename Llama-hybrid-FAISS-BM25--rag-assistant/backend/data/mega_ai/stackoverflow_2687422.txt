This may not apply to your case, but I thought I would post my solution to a scolling problem with jQuery sortable that I was having. I'm not using a scrolling div. To get scrolling to work, I had to remove this line from my stylesheet: body { overflow-x: hidden; /* this line kept page scrolling from working */ } I also set the sortable 'containment' option to 'document' (which kept the item from being dragged left/right off the page, which is also what I needed).
