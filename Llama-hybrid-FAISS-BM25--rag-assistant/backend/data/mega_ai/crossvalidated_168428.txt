Since the same people are going to be answering about multiple animals, the errors are not likely to be independent. This violates one of the assumptions of ANOVA and regression. You need to account for that somehow. Two common ways are multilevel models and generalized estimating equations. However, if all you are interested in is demand for looking at cheetahs, then you may not need the data on the other animals. You could use the 1 to 10 scale for cheetahs as the dependent variable and whatever you like as independent variables. If you do this, you probably want ordinal logistic regression, although the usual regression may be OK (technically, OLS regression requires a continuous dependent variable, but 10 categories may be enough to be close).
