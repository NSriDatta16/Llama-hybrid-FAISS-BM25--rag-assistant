How to better rank based on ratings that takes the number of reviews into account?

Normally on most websites when items are being ranked based on reviews, theyâ€™re simply based on the average rating (out of 5 or 10); however, I believe an item that has an average rating of 4 based on 1200 reviews should be ranked higher than an item rated 4.1 based on 2 reviews. Is there any better way of ranking based on ratings that take into account the number of reviews accurately?
