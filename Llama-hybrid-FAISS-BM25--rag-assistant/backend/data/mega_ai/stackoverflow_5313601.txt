jQuery UI Draggable & Droppable breaks after AJAX Post to Controller Action MVC.NET

I'm having a problem getting this functionality to work. Situation is: User Drags an item to a div On the drop an AJAX Post is sent to a controller action with the item ID On success I replace the div the item was dropped onto with html markup retrieved from the database. .replaceWith(data) Note: This markup is a div with the same ID as that which the item was dropped onto with some additional elements contained within. This loads the updated div. All this works perfectly, well almost, the problem is that I cannot drag a different item onto the div. I'm sure it has something to do with the new div (with the same ID) being loaded in after the AJAX Post. Here's my jQuery code $(function () { $('.draggable').draggable({ revert: true }); $('#layoutHeader').droppable({ drop: function (event, ui) { $.ajax({ type: "POST", url: '/SiteSetup/GetMarkup/' + $(ui.draggable).attr("id"), success: function (data) { $('.draggable').draggable('destroy'); $('#layoutHeader').replaceWith(data); $('.draggable').draggable({ revert: true }); } }); } }); });
