Your data looks like a mixture to me: there seems to be one component with a mean fragment length of 100 nt, one around 200 nt and another with a mean fragment length around 300 nt (you can see 'bumps' in the histogram). Is there anything about how the library was prepared that would explain why there is more than one component in the mixture? I would fit a mixture of 3 Gaussians to the data. I use the R package mixtools . Edit: to check goodness of fit, you might try this function: https://rdrr.io/cran/AdaptGauss/man/Chi2testMixtures.html
