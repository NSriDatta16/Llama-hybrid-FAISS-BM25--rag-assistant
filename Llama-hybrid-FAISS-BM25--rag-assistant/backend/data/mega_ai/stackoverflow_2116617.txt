You could combine StudentID and SchoolID to one primary key. There are some general rules which describe when to use indexes. When dealing with relatively small tables, indexes do not improve performance. In general indexes improve performance when they are created on fields used in table joins. Use indexes when most of your database queries retrieve relatively small datasets, because if your queries retrieve most of the data most of the time, the indexes will actually slow the data retrieval. Use indexes for columns that have many different values (there are not many repeated values within the column). Although indexes improve search performance, they slow the updates, and this might be something worth considering. Source: SQL Indexes
