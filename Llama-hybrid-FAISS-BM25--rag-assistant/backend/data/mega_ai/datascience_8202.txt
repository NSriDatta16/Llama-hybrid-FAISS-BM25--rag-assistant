Averaging on skewed distribution

I have to compose a feature which summarizes the blocks area of different sections of cities. (A block is defined as the space contained by streets). I could compute the arithmetic average of areas, but the data is often very skewed in the sections. I could compute the arithmetic average of log(areas), which transform the data to a more normal distribution, but the problem is that the data is skewed differently section by section. How would you create this feature?
