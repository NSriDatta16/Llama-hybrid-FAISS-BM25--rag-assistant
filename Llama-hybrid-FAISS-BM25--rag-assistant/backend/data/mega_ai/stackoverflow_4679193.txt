I just hit the same issue and this is what I did to get it working. Follow your same steps to generate the keys (also further on it mentions removing the passphrase. I had to do this for things to work). Next, I did the following to enable SSL on Apache: In the "/private/etc/apache2/httpd.conf" file on my Snow Leopard there was a line: # Include /private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-manual.conf I just removed the # and saved the file. Next edit the file (/private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-manual.conf) and make sure SSLCertificateFile SSLCertificateKeyFile point to the correct key files that you created. Next there is an entry in the same file (/private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-manual.conf) that begins: I had to comment out that file and everything after it (or you could just delete it) up to the entry. That entry conflicted with my site. The Virtual host entry you had looks correct, but for completeness I will add mine here. I just modified the original Vhost file that was created by Passenger PrefsPane for my site: ServerName mysite.local DocumentRoot "/Users/username/mysite/public" RackEnv development Order allow,deny Allow from all SSLEngine on SSLCipherSuite ALL:!ADH:!EXPORT56:RC4+RSA:+HIGH:+MEDIUM:+LOW:+SSLv2:+EXP:+eNULL SSLOptions +FakeBasicAuth +ExportCertData +StdEnvVars +StrictRequire SSLCertificateFile /etc/apache2/sslkey/server.crt SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/apache2/sslkey/server.key SSLCertificateChainFile /etc/apache2/sslkey/ca.crt SetEnvIf User-Agent &quot;.*MSIE.*&quot; nokeepalive ssl-unclean-shutdown downgrade-1.0 force-response-1.0 Next restart Apache and you should be good to go. :-)
