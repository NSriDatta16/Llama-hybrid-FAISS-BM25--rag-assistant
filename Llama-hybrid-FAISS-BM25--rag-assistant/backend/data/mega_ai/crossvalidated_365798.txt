Can I recover the level of a dummy in the constant?

In the following country-level panel data equation $$ Y_{it} = c + \lambda_t + X_{it}\beta + e_{it} $$ I use time dummies to capture the year-fixed effects, $\lambda_t$. Obviously, one dummy must be left out, to avoid multicollinearity. Say I leave out $\lambda_1$. This means that when I estimate the model, the estimated constant will include $$ c + \lambda_1 $$ From my regressions, I can produce a plot of $\lambda_t$, showing the year fixed effects. However, the level of this series includes the constant $c$. Is there a way I can identify "$c$", in order to produce the true series of year effects, and not just a relative one? $c$ is supposed to be the (expected?) average value of $Y_{it}$ when $X_{it}$ is zero? Is this helpful in any way for my goal?
