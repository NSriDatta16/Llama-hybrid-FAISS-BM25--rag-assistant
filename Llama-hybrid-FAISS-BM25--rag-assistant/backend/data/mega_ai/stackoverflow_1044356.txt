If you only need the basic user support (roles, profiles, etc.) then the default providers will work great. If you need more customized support (data storage in a database not supported by the default providers [like Oracle], provider on a database that already exists, a heavily customized schema) then you should roll your own providers. As for me, my current site only needed basic Roles support (and minimal Profiles support), so I went with the default providers.
