Probability of a value given a dataset

I am trying to figure out a way to determine how extreme a particular value is from single variable, when the distribution of the variable is unknown. I have tried doing this with a kind of boot-strap approach using the observed data (which presumably has a proper name but I can't figure out what it is), which I coded in R and is below. But there feels something wrong with this approch and I am hoping someone here can point it out. I also think there is probably a good bayesian approach to this problem but I am not sure what it is. What I would like to know is whether this approach is on the right track, and what kind of terms I should be searching to learn more about this. I think my question is quite similar to this one but this seems to correcting to a normal distribution, which I think I want to avoid. Thanks, Sam d = rbeta(100, 1, 10) # pretend you don't know this. #plot(density(d)) x = 0.01 score = c() for(i in 1:1000){ value = sample(d, 1) score[i] = value >= x } mean(score)
