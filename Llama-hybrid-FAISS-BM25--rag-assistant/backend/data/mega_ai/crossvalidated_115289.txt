@EdM is right. The fact that the interaction's p-value is .06 (i.e., 'not-significant') is meaningless; you have an interaction. Let me add a few more details to supplement his (?) answer: A Mann-Whitney U-test of age~LENIpos isn't really the same as the univariate logistic regression of LENIpos~age (although the p-values will almost always be both significant or both not). You would do better to assess the univariate association by running the logistic regression. In R, a multiple linear regression comes with a global F-test of the model by default, but a multiple logistic regression does not (unfortunately). However, you can get a global test by assessing the difference between the null and residual deviances against a chi-squared distribution with the degrees of freedom equal to the difference between the null and residual dfs. Here is the test for your first model: > pchisq(q=145.23-135.48, df=151-149, lower.tail=FALSE) [1] 0.007635094 So it is clear that your first model is significant. This seeming paradox (both univariate analyses significant, and the two predictor model significant even though neither predictor itself is significant) has a hidden cause: Your two predictors are themselves correlated. (The general name for this is multicollinearity .) As a result, the model doesn't know which of the two to attribute the association and expands both standard errors to acknowledge this fact. (Note that the preceding discussion ignores the existence of the interaction.) As @EdM states, plotting these functions can help you understand the interaction. Here is a basic plot with your output: lo.to.p = function(lo){ odds = exp(lo) prob = odds / (odds+1) return(prob) } age = 0:80 lo.no = -5.89984 + 0.05851*age lo.fr = (-5.89984 + 5.04990) + (0.05851 + -0.06058)*age p.no = lo.to.p(lo.no) p.fr = lo.to.p(lo.fr) windows() plot( age, p.no, col="blue", type="l", ylim=c(0,1), ylab="probability of LENIpos") lines(age, p.fr, col="red") legend("topleft", legend=c("no fracture", "fracture"), lty=1, col=c("blue","red"))
