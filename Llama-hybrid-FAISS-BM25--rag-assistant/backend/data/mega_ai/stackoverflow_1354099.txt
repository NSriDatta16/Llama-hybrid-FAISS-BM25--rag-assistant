Your message headers are not valid according to RFC2822 Internet Message Format . From 2.1 General Description: Messages are divided into lines of characters. A line is a series of characters that is delimited with the two characters carriage-return and line-feed; that is, the carriage return (CR) character (ASCII value 13) followed immediately by the line feed (LF) character (ASCII value 10). (The carriage-return/line-feed pair is usually written in this document as "CRLF".) As I pointed out in my comments, the reason why your email may work with most mail servers anyway is that they may be liberal in what they accept. There may be some mail servers, however, that will discard your messages since they don't comply with RFC2822. EDIT: Although the use of "\r\n" is advocated in the PHP documentation for the mail() function, there is some debate about whether that's really the right thing to do . The mail() function will communicate with the local sendmail(8) command (or whatever is configured in sendmail_path), and the line endings may be processed differently depending on what mail transfer agent implementation is used. From what I understand, sendmail(8) should be OK with "\r\n", but qmail(7) for example will replace "\r\n" with "\r\r\n", which will probably break the message. This all happens before the email is delivered to its final destination, so it may be easily tested whether the line endings are processed properly by sending one's self an email message constructed with "\r\n" and by verifying that all headers are present.
