odds ratio from decision tree and random forest

I am using a decision tree and random forest for a classification problem. The output is binary {0,1} and some of the input variables are categorical while the others are continuous. I would like to know if it is possible to extract odds ratio from one of these models. Odds ratio similar to the ones that are commonly obtained using logistic regression. I am using R with the package rpart and randomforest so the best answer would be a theoretical explanation and an R code.
