Genetic algorithm maximization of 2 variables

I am trying to teach myself more machine learning concepts. I have found a textbook and am trying to work through the exercises in it. Could anyone help me with this example? Example: Use genetic algorithm to solve the following optimization problem, including the initialize population, fitness function and each iteration until you find the optimal solution. max f(x1, x2) = 2x(1)^2 + x(2)^2 + 3x(3)^2 s.t. x1 ∈{0,1,2,3,4,5,6} x2 ∈{0,1,2,3,4,5,6} x3 ∈{0,1,2,3,4,5,6} I've only seen examples that deal with a minimization and only deal with one variable. I believe I'm correct in saying that the maximization of a function is equal to the negation of the minimization of that function. So I understand that part. But I still haven't seen anyone using 2 variables. Any information that anyone could give me or even resources that work through examples like this would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.
