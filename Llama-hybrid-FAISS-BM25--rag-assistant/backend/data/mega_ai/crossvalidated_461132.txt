"based on another time series as an input" means to me to identify and estimate a useful model using a user-specified time series. Find a piece of software that allows you to specify a particular with specified coefficient values and use that model as the basis for a monte-carlo simulation. I only know one piece of software that allows this gambit , it is called AUTOBOX which I have helped to develop but there might be others . Perhaps other readers of this list can specify alternative softwares as I would be interested in evaluating/researching them.
