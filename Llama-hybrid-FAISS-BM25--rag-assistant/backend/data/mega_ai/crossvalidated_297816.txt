Usually, test and confidence interval will match so that $p\leq \alpha$ corresponds to $1-\alpha$ confidence intervals (CIs) contains null value of the parameter of interest. This is for example usually the case for a single comparison for continuous data. "Mismatches" between the two things can occur e.g. when you use variance estimates that are only valid under the null hypothesis for the test statistic, but to ensure CI coverage under alternatives you do use a different estimate for constructing the confidence interval (that e.g. occurs for some popular ways of comparing two binomial proportions). In most cases this kind of discrepancy is small. Similarly, things become more complicated when multiple comparison adjustments are in play. In these cases, the rejection of the null hypothesis should be based on the statistical test rather than the CI.
