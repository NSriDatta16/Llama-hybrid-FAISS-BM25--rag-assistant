NSString Copy Memory Leak

I have an app that leverages the TouchJSON objective-C library and I'm running the Instruments profiler for memory leaks and getting a leak in that source that I can't figure out how to fix. I should mention that I'm fairly new to Cocoa and objective-C. Instruments is showing that the leak occurs in a method with the following signature: - (BOOL)scanJSONStringConstant:(NSString **)outStringConstant error:(NSError **)outError ...and the leak is specifically occurring in this block of code: if (self.options & kJSONScannerOptions_MutableLeaves) { *outStringConstant = [theString autorelease]; } else { *outStringConstant = [[theString copy] autorelease]; //LEAK IS HAPPENING HERE [theString release]; } I've tried a variety of fixes to try and get rid of the leak but with no success. Can someone please educate me on: 1) Why this is a leak ...and... 2) How to fix it I'm familiar with the rudiments of objective-C memory management ("If you alloc, copy, or new...release is up to you") so I don't need a whole primer on the basics - just some insight as to why this is leaking. Thanks in advance for any help. EDIT: Attaching image of debug info.
