PHP MVC: How to exit from Actions/Controllers early?

In a PHP MVC framework, how can I cleanly and elegantly exit from the current controller/action, but continue normal script execution? For example, let's say my framework normally follows this outline: Map URL to Controller/Action Instantiate Controller, call Action (capturing output) Do stuff Render View At end of Action method, continue normal operation Process output if necessary Send output to browser Now, let's say I want to stop "normal" execution somewhere in the "Do Stuff" step to, say, render a different view, or do a header redirect, and I want to stop processing the rest of the body of the Action, but continue onto the "Process output" step How can I achieve this the best way? My only ideas are: //in controller protected function redirect($url) { header("Location: $url"); exit(); } but this entirely skips the rest of the framework's execution, and dumps whatever was in the output buffer straight to the user. An alternative: //in dispatcher call_user_func_array(array($controller,$action),$params); afterwards: ... //in controller protected function redirect($url) { header("Location: $url"); goto afterwards; } However, this makes me twitch and goes against everything I've learned, especially because the label it's referencing is in another file completely. So, is there any other way to achieve this? Note: The redirect example probably should use the exit() way, because we're just redirecting to another page anyway and don't care about output. I'm looking for a general-use solution.
