Which Theories of Causality Should I know?

Which theoretical approaches to causality should I know as an applied statistician/econometrician? I know the (a very little bit) Neymanâ€“Rubin causal model (and Roy , Haavelmo etc.) Pearl's Work on Causality Granger Causality (though less treatment-oriented) Which concepts do I miss or should I be aware of? Related: Which theories are foundations for causality in machine learning? I have read these interesting questions and the answers ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) but I think is a different question. And I was very surprised to see that "causality", for example, is not mentioned in Elements of Statistical Learning .
