Unless escaped at the regex level, $ means match the end of line. And to get the single \ needed to escape the $ it needs to be escaped in the String literal; i.e. two \ characters. So ... ... Pattern.compile("\"blue\">&nbsp;&nbsp;\\$&nbsp;(.*)&nbsp; "); But the folks who commented that you shouldn't use regexes to parse HTML are absolutely right !! Unless you want chronically fragile code, your code should use a strict or non-strict HTML parser.
