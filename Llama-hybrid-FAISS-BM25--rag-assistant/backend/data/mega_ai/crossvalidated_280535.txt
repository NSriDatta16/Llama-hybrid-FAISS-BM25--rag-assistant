Log odds ratio - what happens if linearity fails?

I haven't found much info on this by googling so i thought maybe someone where has some answers for me. When it comes to binary logistic regression the model assumes that the log odds ratio has a linear relationship with the independent variables. I'm wondering, what would happen to the model if this assumption was not fulfilled and furthermore, how would one tackle this problem to solve it?
