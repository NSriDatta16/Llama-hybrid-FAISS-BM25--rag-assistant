You can persist the session using something else than InProc (which is short for in process). If you persist the session using a SQL Server backend you'll be able to retrive the session cross domain/machine if they are setup to use the same SQL Server backend for session storage. This is configurable in ASP.NET and support out-of-the-box. I suggest you look it up.
