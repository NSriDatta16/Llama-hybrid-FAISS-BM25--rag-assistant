IIRC a common solution is a plain file that contains your declarations, that you include in every source file, something like ' constants.inc.php '. There you can define a bunch of application-wide variables that are then imported in every file. Still, you have to provide the include directive in every single source file you use. I even saw some projects using this technique to provide localizations for several languages. I'd prefer the gettext way, but maybe this variant is easier to work with for the average user. edit For your problem I recomment the use of $GLOBALS[] , see Example #2 for details. If that's still not applicable, I'd try to digg down PHP5 objects and create a static Singleton that provides needed static constants ( http://www.developer.com/lang/php/article.php/3345121 )
