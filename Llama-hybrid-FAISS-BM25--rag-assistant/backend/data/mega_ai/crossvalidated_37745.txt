The original data plot . The time series is rich with ARIMA structure and Gaussian Violations which fortunately can be rectified. The underlying model is a (1,0,0)(1,1,0) with a large number of Pulse/One time anomnalies and a significant change point in the error variance (increase) at period 335. THe basic methodology is outlined in http://www.unc.edu/~jbhill/tsay.pdf and implememted in AUTOBOX , a piece of software that I have helped develop. Detecting change points in error variance leads doirectly to GLM with empirically identified weights. Note that the error variance is not related to the level of the series thus no power transformation is needed. The final equation is presented here and an error process ACF of suggesting an adequate model. The forecast for the next 11 years is and the Actual-Fit-Forecast graph is . THe problem you are having trying to use minitab ( and other time series software ) is that the time series is more complicated than what their solution allows for. It would be interesting to compare the minitab model with the AUTOBOX model ( shown partially )
