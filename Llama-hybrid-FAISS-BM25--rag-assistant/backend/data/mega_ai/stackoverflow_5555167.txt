How secure is HTML5 local Storage for a Mobile Device

I'm looking to work around some performance issues on a mobile site by storing the data entered on multiple forms into the local Storage. I will be clearing the data on load and clearing the data on the last page, so no sensitive data will be left on the device after they visit the website on their mobile device. I do have a couple of concerns though: Can another program access the data I store in local storage? If the user doesn't complete the process can I place a expiration date on the data? Example: I want the data to expire in 30 minutes regardless if the user has finished the process, left the site, closed the browser
