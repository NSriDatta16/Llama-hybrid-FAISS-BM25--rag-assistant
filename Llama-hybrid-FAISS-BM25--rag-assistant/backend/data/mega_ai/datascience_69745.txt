Ideal strategy for multi variable regression attempting to maximize the target

I am trying to implement machine learning for the following data Data Input What I am trying to achieve is to keep the ad bid & cost per sale as low as possible while increasing sales. This is a multi variable, multi response regression and I am looking for ideas and machine learning models to implement this. I don't think reinforcement or multi-output regression will work because I want to reduce ad bid + cost per sale and at the same time increase sales (not target) Technology/SDK is not a problem. I am looking for architecture/model ideas.
