problem updating uiimageview from NSTimer method

I have problems updating the image of an UIImageView from within a method that is called from a NSTimer. It works within the viewDidLoad method where I do something like this [imageView setImage:[self getNextImage]]; later on I do NSTimer* readTimer = [NSTimer scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval:1 target:self selector:@selector(readSource:) userInfo:nil repeats:NO]; [readTimer fire]; that works and the readSource method gets called. There I put this code: UIImageView* tempImageView = (UIImageView*)[containerView viewWithTag:nextDefragSourcePosition ]; That returns exactly the imageView I want to have - but the following line does not change the image of the UIImageView [tempImageView setImage:dataBeingReadImage]; Any ideas ? Thanks in advance. Heiko
