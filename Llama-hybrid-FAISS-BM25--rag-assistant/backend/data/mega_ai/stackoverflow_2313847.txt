Test Driven.NET Includes a free version for personal development. A nice simple plugin, not expensive in terms of memory usage, or the time you need to dedicate to actually learning how to use it. For Test Driven Development, running the tests internally of the IDE is a must. You'd be surprised at how much time you save by not having to switch to an external runner for every test you want to run. I have heard something about automated tests that will cause you to fail a commit Check out build automation - MSBuild or NAnt to name a few. Essentially unless the build process is successful you don't commit your code to your repository. For example, if you had broken some code, the build process would fail. If it passed, you could commit your code safely. For .NET users, MSBuild (Visual Studio uses it internally) would be a nice start. Check out the official site on MSDN and do some searches for more articles on why build automation is a good idea. Other Tools Your question asks about the use of FxCop, StyleCop and so forth. Rather than running these externally you can link them in as part of the build process. This will take some effort setting up, but the time saved by using them and embedding them into the build process is massive. On a side note, your code will improve by using these regardless of when you use them. Free Resharper Resharper is expensive for personal development. If your company provides it, by all means use it. Could I justify buying it for personal development? No chance. Instead check out CodeRush Express . It's similiar, and less memory hungry than Resharper. I find it doesn't lock up Visual Studio constantly. Plus some of it's features are pretty nice.
