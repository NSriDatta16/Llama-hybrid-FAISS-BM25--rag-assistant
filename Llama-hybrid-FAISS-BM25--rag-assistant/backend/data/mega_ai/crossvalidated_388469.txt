Constraints across related dependent variables

I'm working on model that uses a set of features like track_type , driver_age and some lag variables to predict the number of laps_in_first_place for each car in a stock car race. laps_in_first_place ~ track_type + driver_age (...) I assembled my data and started with a few different regression models (linear, random forest, SVM) which produced a decent cross validation score, but there is a problem: For a race with 100 laps total , I would hope the sum of laps_in_first_place for all drivers in a single race would equal 100 , since there are 100 laps total and someone has to be in the lead for each of them. It turns out that the sums my models spit out are not exactly 100 . Are there models/modeling strategies to impose constraints on a group of dependent variables? (in my case, ensure the sum of all laps_in_first_place for drivers in a race equal the total number of laps)
