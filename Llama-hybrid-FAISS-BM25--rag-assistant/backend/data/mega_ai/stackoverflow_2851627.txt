Newbie Objective C developer question

I have been looking everywhere for an answer to this question - perhaps I'm looking in the wrong places. Also, I'm brand new to Objective C although I have around 10 years of experience as a developer. for this code: [receiver makeGroup:group, memberOne, memberTwo, memberThree]; what would the method definition look like? - (void)makeGroup:(Group *)g, (NSString *)memberOne, ...? Thanks for any help you can provide. I know this is probably very simple... Thanks, R
