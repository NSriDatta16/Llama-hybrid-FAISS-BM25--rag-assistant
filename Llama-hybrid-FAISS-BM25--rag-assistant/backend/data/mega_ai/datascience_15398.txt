How to get p-value and confident interval in LogisticRegression with sklearn?

I am building a multinomial logistic regression with sklearn (LogisticRegression). But after it finishes, how can I get a p-value and confident interval of my model? It only appears that sklearn only provides coefficient and intercept. Thank you a lot.
