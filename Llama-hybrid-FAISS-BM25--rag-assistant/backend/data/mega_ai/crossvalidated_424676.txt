Markov Chain: transitioning to multiple states at the same time

I'm trying to calculate Customer Lifetime Value using Markov Chains. I'm following the paper by Pfeirer and Carraway . The paper evaluates CLV over a finite time horizon T = 1 period. My scenario is slightly different. Looking at row = 1: A customer at a bank begins their journey by acquiring a product (p1,p2,p3) at T = 0 . After 1 year a customer has a 10% probability of acquiring p1 again, 15% p2, 30% p3 or 40% will buy no other product. These proportions sum up to 105% because a customer could acquire multiple products during the year. p1 p2 p3 none p1 .1 .15 .3 .5 p2 .5 .3 .2 .3 p3 .2 .12 .25 .1 none 0 0 0 1 My question is whether there is another way I could write up the transaction matrix so that the row is equal to 100%?
