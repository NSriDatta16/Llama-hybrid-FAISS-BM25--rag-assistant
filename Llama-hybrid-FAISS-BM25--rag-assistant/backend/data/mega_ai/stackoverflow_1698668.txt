http://www.codeproject.com/KB/dialog/FindWindow.aspx?msg=3262771 "FindWindow By JÃ¶rg Bausch" Will get you the external (not your app's) window ID (IntPtr) the mouse went up over from within your C# application. For the desktop, and everything else on the desktop, it will return the same pointer (you can't distinguish, using this code, between as mouse-up on a folder, the desktop, the Recycle Bin). http://www.codeproject.com/KB/cs/globalhook.aspx "Processing Global Mouse and Keyboard Hooks in C# By George Mamaladze" Will allow you to create GlobalHook for keyboard and mouse-events in C#. I've used it recently in VS 2010 beta 2 : it is NOT USABLE compiled against FrameWork 4.0, but does compile and work okay against FrameWork 3.5 and lower. If you download only George's demo app, be aware the download doesn't include the required dll, and will fail when you launch the .exe file (which I have brought to George's attention). I've never worked with a "desktop application toolbar;" I hope this is relevant. best,
