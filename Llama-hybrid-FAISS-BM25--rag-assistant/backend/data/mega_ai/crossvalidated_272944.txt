Don't think too much about multi-class vs extension to binary. It's really not that hard. Some statistical methods are binary classification, e.g. logistic regression. We can still extend it to multi-class by fitting several times and combine them like in your diagram. We also have some statistical algorithms that can handle multi-class by definition.
