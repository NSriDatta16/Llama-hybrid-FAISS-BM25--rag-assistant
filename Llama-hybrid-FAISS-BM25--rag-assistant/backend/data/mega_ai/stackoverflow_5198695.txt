It really depends on what your object mappings are. If there are no joins required in pulling a row then I think the difference between pulling the entire row vs individual columns would be negligible. On the other hand if your Object has several other relationships to other objects, then there could be a big performance difference in performing a Projection instead of an entire column retrieval.
