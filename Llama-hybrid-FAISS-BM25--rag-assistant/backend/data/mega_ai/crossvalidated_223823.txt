Ratio of Gamma distributed variables with different parameters

I encounter a problem which I thought I can handle, however, I struggle a lot with finding a solution: The following setting applies: I want to compute the posterior probability of an event, which is defined as the fraction of two distinct arrival rates of, lets say, some agents. So I define as priors for the arrival rates $\mu$ and $\varepsilon$ Gamma distributions with parameters $\mu\sim G(\alpha_\mu,\beta)$ and $\varepsilon\sim G(\alpha_\varepsilon,\beta)$. The event I am interested in depends on some constant $1>c>0$ and is characterized by $$P = \frac{c(\varepsilon+\mu)}{\varepsilon + c\mu}.$$ Well, the nominator takes the form $c(\varepsilon+\mu) \sim G(\alpha_\mu + \alpha_\varepsilon, \frac{\beta}{c})$, however, as the two parts in the denominator do not have the identical scale parameter I cannot simply identify the distribution of $P$ as a beta distribution as would be the case given I would simply compute $\frac{x}{y+x}$ with $x\sim G(\alpha_1,\theta), y\sim G(\alpha_2,\theta)$. Is there any way to overcome this problem and to find the probability distribution of $P$? Or, is there another distribution which would give me some closed form solutions for $P$?
