I doubt a plugin is necessary. You haven't described a drag/drop behaviour that is any different from what can already be handled using vanilla jQuery UI. From what I understand, you have a bunch of draggables that share a common purpose, but their droppables need to change depending on which one was dragged. All that's needed is to hook into the start event of the draggables and conditionally change the accept options of the droppables you want them to work with. Running a quick test myself, it does not appear that jQuery UI inserts any more CSS classes into the draggable-helper if it is over a droppable, so you cannot use pure CSS to change the colour of the helper when it is over a droppable. But instead of hooking into the drag method of the draggable to constantly monitor which element it is over, you can simply use the over and out methods of your droppables to add and remove a class to the draggable-helper. Since you would set the accept options on drag-start (as I described previously), the over method will only be called on elements that you want the colour of the helper to change. Sorry I've not posted any code examples, but hopefully the explanation is helpful.
