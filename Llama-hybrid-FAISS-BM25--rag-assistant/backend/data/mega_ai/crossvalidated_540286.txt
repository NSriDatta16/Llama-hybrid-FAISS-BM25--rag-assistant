Derivation of GDA being equivalent to logistic regression

Whilst looking at the answer to this question: Gaussian Discriminant Analysis and sigmoid function I was wondering how they got from $$log(\frac{\pi_1}{\pi_0}) -(x - \mu_1)^T\Sigma^{-1}(x - \mu_1)/2 + (x - \mu_0)^T\Sigma^{-1}(x - \mu_0)/2 $$ to $$ log(\frac{\pi_1}{\pi_0}) + (\mu_1 - \mu_0)^T\Sigma^{-1}x + \frac{1}{2}(\mu_0^T\Sigma^{-1}\mu_0 - \mu_1^T\Sigma^{-1}\mu_1) $$ More specifically - I don't understand how they got this term: $$(\mu_1 - \mu_0)^T\Sigma^{-1}x$$ Any help would be much appreciated!
