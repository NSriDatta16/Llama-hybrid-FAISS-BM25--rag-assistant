Why do we have to normalize the input for an artificial neural network?

Why do we have to normalize the input for a neural network? I understand that sometimes, when for example the input values are non-numerical a certain transformation must be performed, but when we have a numerical input? Why the numbers must be in a certain interval? What will happen if the data is not normalized?
