The proportional hazards (PH) assumption might be OK, but the plot suggests that you need to think carefully about your model. You will have to use your knowledge of the subject matter to make your decisions. First, do NOT depend on ggcoxzph() . Its plot has extremely wide y-axis limits and improperly drawn confidence limits for the smoothed curve. This probably is related to a long-standing (and evidently still uncorrected) coding error described here . Furthermore, it seems to have cut off values of time beyond about 79. The plot produced by the survival package tools shows that many of your data points are beyond there. Second, the time transformation used by cox.zph() (note the non-linear spacing of tick marks along the Time axis) has pushed together those late-time events so that most of the plot emphasizes the time range from 71 to about 80. The default Kaplan-Meier time transformation helps minimize contributions from outliers in the usual clinical setting, where there are usually very few and widely spaced event times at late times. In your case, a high proportion of events seems to be at late times. A different time transformation (e.g., identity ) might have given a "significant" departure from PH. There does seem to be a dip in the smoothed curve at the later times. Based on your understanding of the subject matter, you and your colleagues have to decide whether the default time transformation is appropriate for your data and whether that apparent dip at late times is big enough to matter. It also seems that there are many tied event times, so make sure that your choice of how to handle tied times was OK for such data. You also need to consider the magnitudes of the scaled Schoenfeld residuals. They are hard to interpret without further information about the model, as they start with the differences between the covariate values for an individual having an event and the risk-weighted average of the corresponding covariate values for those at risk at that time, then scale the differences by the coefficient covariance matrix and the number of events. See this page . Large-magnitude scaled residuals could be something as simple as a large number of events. See this page . It's best to focus on the shape of the smoothed residual plot instead of on the individual scaled residuals.
