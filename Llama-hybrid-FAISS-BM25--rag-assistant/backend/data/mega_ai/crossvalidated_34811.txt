Sounds like you want ordinal logistic regression. The hypothesis would be something like: Null: The IVS were not related to the severity of XXX Alt: The IVS were related to the severity of XXX You can do ordinal logistic regression in R, SAS or many other programs. I wrote a presentation on ordinal logistic using SAS , but some of it will apply more generally. But "unknown" as a category worries me. That's not ordinal, that's missing data. Or do you mean that those people didn't get cancer?
