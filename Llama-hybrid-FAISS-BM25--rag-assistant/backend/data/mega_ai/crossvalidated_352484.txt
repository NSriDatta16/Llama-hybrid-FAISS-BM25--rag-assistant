covariance matrix vs correlation matrix for multiple signal analysis

I'm dealing with a set of +100 input signals, and one output. I want to explore how each of the signals affects the output. Should I focus on covariance matrix, or correlation matrix, and why? I cant find a clear answer on the real interpretation of the elements of both matrices for time series analysis. Once I focus in one of two matrices, should I work with plain signals, or with differentiated columns? Actually, I am interested on how the variations on the input signals affect the output.
