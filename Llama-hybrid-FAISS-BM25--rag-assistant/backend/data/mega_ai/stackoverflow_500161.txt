For doing CRUD using php, without using any frameworks, cakePHP, Smarty, what's the best way to organize php code into files?

Let's say I have a database table "widgets" Should there be an index.php with a big switch statement for different actions, like "list_widgets", "edit_widget", "new_widget", "delete_widget"... and then each of those actions in a separate file? Or, should there be list_widgets.php, edit_widget.php, delete_widget.php.... Or some other way? EDIT (after reading the first answer). I'm really asking, what are the names of the files on my harddrive. If I were to create a website that just edited a single table of Widgets, what would be the names of the files on my harddrive for that project? (My motive for avoiding frameworks right now is that this project is a learning excercise for php and mysql, so I don't want anything happening automagically yet)
