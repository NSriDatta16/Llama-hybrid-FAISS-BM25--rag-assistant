How do we generate Precision Recall curves when we have two output neurons, each determining the probability of belonging to the same class?

For classification using neural networks, if we have only one output neuron, we can vary the threshold for class labeling and get a Precision Recall (PR) curve. I am using cross entropy loss, after applying softmax on the output layer, where the output layer has 2 neurons. For labeling, I am using argmax(y_1,y_2) . How can I get a PR curve in this setting?
