In Visual Studio 2010 you can make adding using s less tedious by typing the type, for example, IEnumerable and if a red box appears (this appears when the using statement is missing) in Visual Studio at the end of the word pressing Ctrl + . whilst the caret is over the type declaration. This should give you a quick menu with an automatic way of adding the missing using statement all from the keyboard. Alternatively you could define a snippet with your common using s in and remove the unused ones when you have finished with the class using the context menu > organise usings.
