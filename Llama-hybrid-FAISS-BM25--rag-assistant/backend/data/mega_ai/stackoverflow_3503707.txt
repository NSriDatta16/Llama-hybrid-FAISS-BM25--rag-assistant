Import statements are used to import types. There's no concept of importing a package the way you've written your code. You can import every type in a package using star-notation, e.g., import at.*; But you cannot just import the package "at." This is the source of all the compiler issues you're seeing. I'd further point out that completely undescriptive two-letter package names without any hierarchy whatsoever goes very much against well-established naming and organization conventions in Java. I refer you to a Wikipedia link on naming conventions found by simply Googling for "Java package names." I recommend you become more familiar with the language conventions. These conventions are used because they make things a lot easier on you as well as anybody else who wants to read your code.
