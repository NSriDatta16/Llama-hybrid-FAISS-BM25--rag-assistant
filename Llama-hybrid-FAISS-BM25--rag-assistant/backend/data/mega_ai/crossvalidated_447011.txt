Convergence Rate of Quantile from Convergence Rate of Distribution

Suppose we have a sequence of distribution functions $F_n$ such that $F_n \rightarrow F$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$ . Suppose that we know the convergence rate, given by $$ \sup_{x \in \mathbb{R}} | F(x) - F_n(x) | \le G(n) $$ where $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} G(n) = 0$ . I'd like to know if there is a method to derive the convergence rate of quantiles at a percentile $\alpha$ : $$q_\alpha = \inf_{x \in \mathbb{R}} \{x: F(x) \ge \alpha \} = F^{-1}(\alpha)$$ $$q_{n,\alpha} = \inf_{x \in \mathbb{R}} \{x: F_n(x) \ge \alpha \} = F_n^{-1}(\alpha)$$ It is in fact the case that $q_{n,\alpha} \rightarrow q_\alpha$ if $F_n \rightarrow F$ (proved in Proposition 5 (page 250) in A Modern Approach to Probability Theory by Bert Fristedt and Lawrence Gray, for example). However, I'm interested in the rate of convergence for the quantile, if we have a rate of convergence for the distribution function. Given the above, how can we find a function $H(n)$ such that $$ |q_\alpha - q_{n,\alpha}| \le H(n) ? $$
