It seems this paper compares the performance of different machine learning methods. The note says they conducted 100 simulations (bootstrap runs) for each row and calculated the mean and the standard deviation (in the parentheses) across the simulations. They add "*" to the methods whose performance (measured by the AUROC score) is significantly different from its Random forest counterpart. This is what they mean by "difference in the AUROC shifted from zero", i.e. the difference is away from zero, and the "0.05 level" indicates that they chose 95% as the significance level.
