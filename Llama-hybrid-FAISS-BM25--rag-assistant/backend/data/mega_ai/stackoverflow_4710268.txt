Should ViewModels ever be reused by different Views? If so, when?

From what I have read, it seems to be considered a best practice in MVVM for each View to have its own corresponding ViewModel, which makes sense, since the ViewModel is supposed to be the model of the View. Generally, reuse of ViewModels by different Views seems to be discouraged. Is this always the case? If not, what are the general guidelines for determining whether or not a ViewModel should be reused in this manner? One situation I can think of where it might be satisfactory to reuse a ViewModel with a different View is when two Views make use of the exact same data from the Model and the Views themselves just represent the data differently. If the Views can handle representing the same data in different ways themselves, one ViewModel might be able to serve each View effectively.
