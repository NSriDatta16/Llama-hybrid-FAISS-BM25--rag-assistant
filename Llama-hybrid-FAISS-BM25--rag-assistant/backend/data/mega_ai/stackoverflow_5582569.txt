The XML results look perfectly valid (and parse with other tools without issue) so this may be some issue with Jena though given the relative maturity of the Jena framework I'd be surprised if it would error on such a simple and obviously valid input. How exactly are you reading the XML from DBPedia? I'd suspect that the bug might have to do with the retrieval and format of the XML string in your Java code rather than with Jena's code. Also why do it this way, why not use ARQ's QueryExecutionFactory.sparqlService(String service, String query) method?
