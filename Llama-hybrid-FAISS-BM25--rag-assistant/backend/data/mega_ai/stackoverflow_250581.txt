I like using Spring dependency injection for many of the properties. You can treat your application like building blocks and inject the properties directly into the component that needs them. This preserves (encourages) encapsulation. Then, you assemble your components together and create the "main class". A nice side effect of the dependency injection is that your code should be more easily testable.
