Projecting data on a sphere

I am used to working with PCA, tSNE, LLEs... They all do a great job projecting the data on a plane (or on linear subspaces of $\mathbb{R}^n$). Is there any other embedding technique that projects the data on non-linear spaces ? Like a sphere, or any other manifold ? The aim would be to specify a space and a distance (the example will be a sphere and the geodesic distance) to project onto. I am looking for any reference or open source project! Per example, calling $x_i$ the elements of the data set and $d$ the initial distance, $d_g$ the geodesic distance on the sphere, an "MDS-like" formulation could be : $$ min_{y} \sum_{i,j}||d(x_i,x_j)-d_g(y_i,y_j)||^2 $$ Is there any other way than brute force to solve this problem ?
