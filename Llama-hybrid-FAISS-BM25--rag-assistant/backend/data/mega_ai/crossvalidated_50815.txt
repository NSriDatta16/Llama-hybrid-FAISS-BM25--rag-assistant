Depending on the length of your time series, the usual approach is to epoch the data into segments, e.g. 10 secs. However, often prior to breaking the time-series into segments it is necessary to perform some preprocessing such as filtering and artifact rejection. You can then compute a variety of features such as those based on frequency (i.e. take an FFT for each epoch), time (e.g. mean, variance etc of the time-series in that epoch) or morphology, (i.e. the shape of the signal/time-series in each epoch). Usually the features used to classify segments (epochs) of a time-series/signal are domain-specific but Wavelet/Fourier analysis are simply tools to allow you examine your signal in the frequency/time-frequency domains rather than being features in themselves. In a classification problem each epoch will have a class label e.g. 'happy' or 'sad', you would then train a classifier to distinguish between 'happy' and 'sad' epochs using the 6 features calculated for each epoch. In the event that each time series represents a single case for classification, you need to calculate each feature across all samples of the time series. The FFT is only relevant here if the signal is linear time invariant (LTI), i.e. if the signal can be considered to be stationary over the whole time series, if the signal is not stationary over the period of interest, a wavelet analysis may be more appropriate. This approach will mean that each time series will produce one feature vector and will constitute one case for classification.
