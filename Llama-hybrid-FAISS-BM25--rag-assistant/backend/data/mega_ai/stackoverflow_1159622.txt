How to get the name of the application that generated the drag and drop

How do I find out which application dropped some content on my C# form? Right now I'm doing some wild guesses, like if (e.Data.GetDataPresent("UniformResourceLocatorW", true)) { // URL dropped from IExplorer } But what I'm really looking for is something like: if (isDroppedFrom("iexplorer")) { // URL dropped from IExplorer } How can I do this?
