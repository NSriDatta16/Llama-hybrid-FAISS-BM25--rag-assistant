If every ExtendedService isn't valid as a response to a query for Service, sounds more like you have Templating through Inheritance, rather than Polymorphism. A simple fix is to make Service abstract, so you have AbstractService and an empty class Service that extends it and just defines the DiscriminatorValue . (Then ExtendedService extends AbstractService, etc.) Mapping the discriminator column to query it isn't exactly the end of the world, if everything else is working fine for you. Personally I'd file it more towards "Inelegant" than "Bad Design" but that's just opinion.
