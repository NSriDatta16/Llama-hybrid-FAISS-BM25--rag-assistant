Using machine learning in here sounds like an overkill. Doing this using ML would be quite complicated: you would need to clean up the source codes, prepare some features, then you'll end up with huge, sparse datasets (literally every word becomes a feature, so you end up with thousands of features) with lots of noise (parts of source code, stopwords, irrelevant comments in the code), next, you will need to apply some methods for text mining, then use ML with possibly lots of tuning since the complicated nature of the data. It sounds like a pretty complicated and time-consuming process. I bet it won't be much better given the workload. Moreover, using ML does not guarantee less false positives. Since licenses have pretty standard form and there is limited number of them, then, I guess, you can prepare by-hand some rules to classify them and this should not work worse then ML. Even more, you can use expert knowledge to create the rules while ML would create them "blindly" because ML algorithms do not know anything a priori about what licenses are. Hammers are designed to use with nails, you don't need anything more advanced to deal with them. If fossology does not work for you, then you can always use it with your data and then check the misclassifications to find when and why it fails, so to correct it's mistakes.
