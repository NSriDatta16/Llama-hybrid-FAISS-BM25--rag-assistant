Exploring Data Science for Enhanced Reporting

I'm a self thought data analyst who has been primarily focused on generating standard reports. However, this year, my role is evolving. My boss has challenged me to not just report data but to extract and present trends and actionable insights that could lead to cost-saving and revenue-generating decisions (especially in sales). While I'm comfortable with the basics of data analysis and reporting, I'm seeking advice on how to elevate my skills to this next level. I'm wondering if stepping into the realm of data science, especially machine learning, could be the key to unlocking these deeper insights. Machine Learning Models: Are there specific machine learning models or techniques that are particularly effective for sales data analysis and trend prediction? Data Science Tools: What are the must-have data science tools that could help in transitioning from standard reporting to more advanced analysis? I appreciate any insights, suggestions, or resources you can share. It's a big leap for me, and I'm keen to learn from those who have navigated this path.
