I don't have access to my Magento installs at the moment, but two things pop out First, your write rule [#^/catalog_product/massAttributeSet/] Is saying "match any URL that starts with /catalog_product" and your question indicates you want to match a URL that begins with /admin/catalog_product. Second, if you're using 1.3+ consider skipping the URL rewrite method and trying a "real" controller override instead.
