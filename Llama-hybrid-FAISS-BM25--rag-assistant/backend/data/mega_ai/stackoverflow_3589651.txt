I have tried a few ways of using jQuery in rails apps and I've encountered the easiest, clearer and most organized way of integrating JavaScript code is using *.js.erb view files. The idea is you write your UI behavior in this files (what makes sense, since they are part of the View in MVC structure) and then you call them when necessary with this: $.get(url_for_your_js_view, data, null, "script"); You can see this practice in action (and better explained) in this RailsCast . By the way, it also makes easy to gracefully fall down to a no-script scenario, so I really recommend you to take the time to learn this skill, even when it may be a little not-intuitive at beginning.
