Please help me understand a Figure in Bishop's "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning", Sec 1.5.1 Minimizing the misclassification rate

The figure is Figure 1.24 on page 40 of Bishop's "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning", Sec 1.5.1 Minimizing the misclassification rate: I don't understand this figure, starting from "Errors arise from the blue, green, and red regions, ..." For example, why does the red region represent points from $\mathcal{C}_2$ ? If this is because $p(x,\mathcal{C}_2)$ is greater than $p(x,\mathcal{C}_1)$ there, points $x are from $\mathcal{C}_1$ so the classification is correct. Why is it still green which means error?
