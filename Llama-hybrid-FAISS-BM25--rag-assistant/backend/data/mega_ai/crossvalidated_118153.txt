Unusual Terminology in Hartigan's DIP paper?

In Hartigan's DIP test paper , it says A distribution function $F$ is unimodal with mode $m$ if $F$ is convex in $(-\infty,m]$ and concave in $[m,\infty)$. Shouldn't that be a cumulative distribution function? Either I'm profoundly misunderstanding something, or, by that definition, a Gaussian PDF is not unimodal, because it is neither convex nor concave left or right of the mode: On the other hand, the CDF of a Gaussian does seem to fulfill that criterion. Not knowing which Hartigan and Hartigan are talking about makes the paper and the algorithm they explain hard to understand.
