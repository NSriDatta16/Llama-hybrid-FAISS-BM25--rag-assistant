I think this is what you're looking for: SELECT c.AgentId, COUNT(DISTINCT o.[Order Num]) AS [Orders per Agent] FROM OrdersToCall o JOIN PhoneNumCalled c ON c.[Dialed Number] = o.[Primary Ph] OR c.[Dialed Number] = o.[Secondary Ph] OR c.[Dialed Number] = o.[Alternate Ph] GROUP BY c.AgentId If you want to know how many calls were made on each date, you would have to join on the date also: SELECT c.AgentId, c.Date, COUNT(DISTINCT o.[Order Num]) AS [Orders per Agent] FROM OrdersToCall o JOIN PhoneNumCalled c ON (c.[Dialed Number] = o.[Primary Ph] OR c.[Dialed Number] = o.[Secondary Ph] OR c.[Dialed Number] = o.[Alternate Ph]) AND o.Date = c.Date GROUP BY c.AgentId, c.Date
