CGContext Draw Line slowly responding to fast finger movement

I am using CGContext to draw lines on finger touch. If the finger is moved slowly on the screen , it worked perfectly...but the problem is that if the finger is moved fastly , the line lags the finger. I mean the line draws at a point one second after the finger is touched at that point ( so annoying- it is not the problem on simulator but only on device). Secondly if i draw a curve with that, the curve comes very angular - i mean curve is not very smooth Please help ( I dont want to use OpenGL, is there any other solution) EDIT:- Sorry but I am a noobe...dont know too much about what hotpaw has said below...but this is my code -(void) draw rect{ CGContextBeginPath(ctx); CGContextMoveToPoint(ctx, beginpointX, beginpointY); CGContextSetStrokeColorWithColor(ctx, CGColor); CGContextAddLineToPoint(ctx,currentpointX,currentpointY); CGContextSetLineCap(ctx, kCGLineCapRound); CGContextStrokePath(ctx); CGContextSetLineJoin(ctx, kCGLineJoinRound); CGContextClosePath(ctx); and in my touchesBegan and touchesmoved method i am calling view's setNeedsDisplay method. dont know how many frames/second or touches event are there...please help its very urgent
