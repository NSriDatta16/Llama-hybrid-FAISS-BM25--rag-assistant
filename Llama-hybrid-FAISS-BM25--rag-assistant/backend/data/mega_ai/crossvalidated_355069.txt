Regarding your first question, Holt Winters is simply a smoothing calculation. It's analogous to taking the average of data except that you are weighting each data point differently in this case. You would want perform some type of holdout analysis to determine whether a Holt Winters model outperforms other models available to you; MAPE would be one metric you can compare models with. So in terms of tests that should be performed prior to its use, you should probably just confirm there is no seasonality in your data. Regarding your second question, Holt Winters will do a poor job extrapolating seasonal data. There are single season Holt Winters models and double season Holt Winters models already available in R. You can read more about those at the following links: Holt Winters Seasonal Model Holt Winters Double Seasonal Model
