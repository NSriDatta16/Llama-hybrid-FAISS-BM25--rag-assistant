How are the standard errors computed for the fitted values from a logistic regression with parameter 'response' in R?

I am looking for the equation for the se.fit values when using logistic regression in R. I have seen this answer - How are the standard errors computed for the fitted values from a logistic regression? but in my case, I'm calling "predict" function with 'type' parameter set to be "response". In this case, the equation given in the linked I attached doesn't hold. Here is an example of the predict function I'm calling: predicted.resutls
