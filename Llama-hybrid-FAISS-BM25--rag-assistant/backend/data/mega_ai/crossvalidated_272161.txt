Since the issue is " I understand it but need to explain this to marketing ", OP seems concerned with how a layman will interpret these facts - (not whether the facts are true, or how to show that they are). The question references 10 product categories, (A-J), so how about this example: [in meeting with marketing group] OP : So, as you can see here , customers who buy A, B, and C, are all more valuable than average. Layman : Wait?! How can everyone be higher than average? OP : Good question. This slide focuses on customers of A, B, and C, but there are other, low performing, groups not shown. For example, customers of categories D and G are each worth about half of average. This should quell everyone's internal bs-alarm about 'everything is above average'.
