I see no reason why this should be correct in general. The target distribution will then be a convex combination of $p$ and of the stationary distribution of $q(\cdot,\cdot)$ , if any. If $q(\cdot,\cdot)$ is a transient or null recurrent Markov kernel, the chain does not even converge to a distribution. For instance, take $p$ as a Uniform $(-1,1)$ density and $q(\cdot,\cdot)$ as the standardized Gaussian random walk kernel. The transition is then $$ x_{t+1}=\begin{cases} y_t\sim\mathcal N(x_t,1) &\text{if }|y_t|>1 \text{ or }u_t\le \frac{\mathbb{I}_{(-1,,1)}(y_t)q(y_t,x_t}{\mathbb{I}_{(-1,,1)}(x_t)q(x_t,y_t)}=1\\ x_t &\text{otherwise} \end{cases}$$ which means that $$x_{t+1}=y_t\sim\mathcal N(x_t,1)$$ with probability one and the Markov chain is the (null recurrent) Gaussian random walk. Obviously if one imposes $$p(y)=0\Rightarrow q(x,y)=0\;\;\;\text{for all }y.\tag1$$ then the probability that $Y\sim q(x,y)$ belongs to $$\{y;\,p(y)=0\}$$ is zero, hence this specification of $\alpha(x,y)$ when $p(y)=0$ is irrelevant.
