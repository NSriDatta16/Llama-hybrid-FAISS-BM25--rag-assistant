This actually is trickier than it first seems. Removing leading zero's is not something that is standard Javascript. I found this elegant solution online and edited it a bit. function removeLeadingZeros(strNumber) { while (strNumber.substr(0,1) == '0' && strNumber.length>1) { strNumber = strNumber.substr(1); } return strNumber; } userInput = "000.03"; alert(removeLeadingZeros(userInput));
