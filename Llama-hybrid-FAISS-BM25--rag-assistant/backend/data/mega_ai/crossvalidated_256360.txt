What is .hat in regression output

The augment() function in the broom package for R creates a dataframe of predicted values from a regression model. Columns created include the fitted values, the standard error of the fit and Cook's distance. They also include something with which I'm not familar and that is the column .hat . Can anyone explain what this value is, and is it different between linear regression and logistic regression? library(broom) data(mtcars) m1
