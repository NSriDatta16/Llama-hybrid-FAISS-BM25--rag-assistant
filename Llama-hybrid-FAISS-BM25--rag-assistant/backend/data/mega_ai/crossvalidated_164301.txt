I am afraid what you want is not going to happen via simple prediction models. But let me try to answer your question. In order for you to choose between prediction models, you must have a loss function, i.e. the "cost" of predicting something other than the true value for performance. A common loss function is squared difference, but other forms are possible. Let's say the loss function is $L(\hat\theta, \theta_0)$ which is the price you pay for predicting $\hat\theta$ when the true performance is $\theta_0$. Prediction models are typically built to minimize the average value of this loss. Now, given that there are latent variables, the best any prediction can hope to achieve is to predict so as to minimize the expected loss given the variables you know. Let those known variables be defined by the vector $x$. The best you can do is to choose $\hat\theta$ such that $$\hat\theta(x) = \arg \min_\theta E_{\theta_0|X=x} L(\theta, \theta_0)$$ In other words, you are minimizing the loss for the distribution of the true performance $\theta_0$ conditional on what you know, which is $X=x$. Assuming this is what you want, how would you carry out this procedure? Regression is a standard way to do this but there are others. Note that all of this is about conditional distributions and says nothing about cause. Causal Inference is its own rather involved field, going quite a bit beyond basic statistics (See "Causal Inference" by Imbens and Rubin ). Basic prediction as I have described earlier will not give you what you want. To see this, let's suppose you build a prediction system based on hour of week. And it turns out that Thursday 10pm is when the average performance of FB posts is greatest. But this just tells you the score of the average post at that hour. It doesn't say anything about the quality of the post. It seems you are assuming that post quality is uniformly distributed over the course of a week. This may not be the case. For instance, it might be that the best posts are from people who are too busy during the day to post on Facebook. I hope that helps.
