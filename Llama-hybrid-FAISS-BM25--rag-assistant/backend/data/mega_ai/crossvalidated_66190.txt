Methods to combine ( e1071 svm ) models in R to generate a more complete, accurate model

I am using the function svm from the package e1071 in R to generate a support vector machine model. I have a very large data set, and for the moment, while in an exploratory mode, want to simply read in small slices of the data that can be modeled on my single machine. After obtaining the model results, I would like to read in more data and generate another SVM model, etc. until all of the data is modeled, which will generate about 50 different models. I would then like to merge all of these models / results together in some fashion in order to get a grand model which would approximate what I would achieve if I could fit all the data in at once. I know there are multiple ways to do this, theoretically. But, sticking with SVM modeling, what are my options in R ? (I want to stick with the e1071 package because it has some things about it that are not in the others that I saw.) If it matters, my data is not genomic, and it is highly weighted (meaning that I am modeling T/F, and usually find an F, but the feature set data is not sparse). Below is a "pseudocode" snapshot of what I'm proposing / hoping, in case that helps clear things up: require(e1071) modelSet = NULL for (i in c(1:50) ) { ## imagine there are 50 files dF Thanks!
