I would say that if you are asking this type of question, you should probably go with Open Atrium. It is pretty much an intranet (and Organic Groups) right out of the box. I have 5 installations of it running publicly (in the www). @Shushu is right, any website can be an intranet or internet, it just depends on if you expose it to the world, or just to your local intranet. But if you are looking to dive into Drupal, use a drupal install with OG. But it really depends on how much time and effort you want/can put into it.
