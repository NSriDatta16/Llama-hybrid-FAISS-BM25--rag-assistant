Actually there are more than one question to answer here: How to work on schemaless/loose/missing data How to label a person (from what I understand unsupervised) and create an identifier How to train your system so that it can tell you which attributes you should use in order to identify the person As Rubens mentioned, you can use decision tree methods, specifically Random Forests for calculating the most important attributes based on information gain if you have already found a way to identify how to label a person. However, if you do not have any label information maybe you can use some expert view for preliminary attribute selection. After that you make unsupervised classification in order to retrieve your labels. Lastly, you can select the most important fields using Random Forest or other methods like Bayesian Belief Networks . In order to achieve all that, you also need complete data set. If your data set is loose you have to manually or heuristically find a way to couple attributes indicating same thing with different names. What is more, you can use imputation techniques such as Expectation Maximization method and complete your data set. Or you can also work with Bayesian Networks and can leave missing fields as they are.
