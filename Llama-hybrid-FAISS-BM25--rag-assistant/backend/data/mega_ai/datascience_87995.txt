What you are trying to do here is named-entity recognition . Namely, the task consists of classifying substrings into a set of named entities (i.e. person, location, etc.). From a more formal perspective, this is a sequence labeling task that classifies parts of a sequence. This task can be approached in different ways: gazetteers/string matching regular expressions machine learning I would highly recommend using SpaCy . They allow you to customize and retrain a model with your own data and labels, and typically, for such a use case, the model will perform well without requiring massive amounts of data.
