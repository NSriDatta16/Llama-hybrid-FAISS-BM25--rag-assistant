average column values across all rows of a data frame

I've got a data frame that I read from a file like this: name, points, wins, losses, margin joe, 1, 1, 0, 1 bill, 2, 3, 0, 4 joe, 5, 2, 5, -2 cindy, 10, 2, 3, -2.5 etc. I want to average out the column values across all rows of this data, is there an easy way to do this in R? For example, I want to get the average column values for all "Joe's", coming out with something like joe, 3, 1.5, 2.5, -.5
