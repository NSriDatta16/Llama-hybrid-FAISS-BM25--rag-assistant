There is not enough information for a comprehensive answer, but I will try to assist you. You can try to hard code it without using any machine learning algorithms. Try looking at specific parts, letters or numbers in the URL that provide information that can tell you what category it is. What about page titles? Do they provide any information? You can manually write a small "decision tree" if the URL and titles provide you with any information. If the URL-s and titles do not help you, you have to do a bit more work. You can use beautifulsoup to webscrape more data from the website. Maybe you will find something useful in the metadata. If the titles and URL-s do not determine the class, you will certainly find something you can scrape that will do the job.
