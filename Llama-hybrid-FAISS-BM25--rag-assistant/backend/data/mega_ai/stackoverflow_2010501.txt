I work on a small team of 1-5, depending on the project. What tools/plugins do you use for checking in/out code? We use Git with Github for new projects, and TFS for some legacy work. I see a lot of people recommending a certain provider without telling you why. I have used TFS, SourceGear, SVN (a little), and Git. I prefer Git because it stays out of my way. Git is command-line based. My typical source control workflow is a handful of simple commands, but learning those commands took a few tries. how to communicate changes made to the code, how to make request for new functionality? We use Pivotal Tracker for story writing and organizing priority.
