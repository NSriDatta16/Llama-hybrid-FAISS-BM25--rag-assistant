Bayesian autoregressive model with second peak at 1 in posterior distirbution of AR parameter

I am trying to run a Bayesian hierarchical AR1 model for a set of fairly short time series. In some of the series I get a second peak around 1 in the posterior distribution of the AR1 parameter. Here is an example of a non-hierarchical AR1 model on a single series from my data which replicates the behavior x with traceplots... ggs_density(D = theta) Is there anyway to tweak the model to get rid of this behavior? I have tried truncating the prior of mu , but this an impractical approach for the hierarchical model where there are many series with a wide range of means
