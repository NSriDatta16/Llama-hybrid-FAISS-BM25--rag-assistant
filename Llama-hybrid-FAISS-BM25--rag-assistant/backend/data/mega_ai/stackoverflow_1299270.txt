Is capitalising a word a good web design approch to emphasize interaction/draw attention?

I'm involved in a redesign at this point of a site that has capitalised its primary navigation and button text as part of the UI. I have looked around at the competitors in the market and found no one else does this. The business still likes the idea at the moment and I wanted to see what opinions are out there for and against this approach? Thanks Denis
