Suitabiility of the confidence score generated by SVM as a proxy for membership function

SVMs can generate a confidence score which is basically like a probability for a particular data item to belong to the particular class. I want to use this probability as a proxy for the 'distance' of the data-item from the cluster. The distance will be further used for estimating the class cohesiveness using the silhouette width. I wanted to take the view of other experienced members if the approach of taking the probability generated by SVM will be correct as a proxy for the distance measure. I have generally seen gaussian functions being used for this purpose.
