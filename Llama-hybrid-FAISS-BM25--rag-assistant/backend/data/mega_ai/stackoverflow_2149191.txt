I'm not aware of an edge detection algorithm that doesn't require iterating through the pixels, so your present approach may be optimal. Depending on other factors, you may be able to leverage ImageJ , which has an extensive collection of analytical plugins . Addendum: Given a preference for avoiding external dependencies, BufferedImage is a good choice. Once you identify the edges, the getSubimage() method is convenient. You may be able to use one of the Raster getPixels() methods effectively in the convolution. ImageIO can write the results.
