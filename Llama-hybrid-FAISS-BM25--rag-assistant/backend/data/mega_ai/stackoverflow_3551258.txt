Dynamic Remote Queries (e.g. serializable LINQ)

I'm looking for possible solutions for the following scenario: I have a service that holds a large amount of data in memory and also updates the data at very high frequency I want to make that data query-able for clients over the internet Ideally, I'd like the client to write a LINQ query on the client side against a proxy object model, serialize the expression tree, send the serialized query over the wire, make sure the client only executes "read" operations and then return a dynamic result set. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem that easy to serialize/deserialize the expression tree and also ensuring read-only operations (prohibiting malicious queries). One idea was to use the LINQ to SQL provider to serialize the query and then use Entity SQL on the server side to deserialize the query and run it againt my object model. Anyways, I was wondering, what other elegant options I have in building this service. Thanks, Tom
