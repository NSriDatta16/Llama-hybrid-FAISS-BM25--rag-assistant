The answer by user @krkeane is interesting. Following is a different kind of answer, which considers the "effective behavior" of the Markov chain transition matrices. For a given $n$ -by- $n$ Markov chain transition matrix, the most important things are: Does the Stochastic matrix converge? In other words, are the conditions of the Perron–Frobenius theorem satisfied? The original question mentioned the existence of many zeros, which is natural in practice; so to "encourage", but not guarantee, that a typical stochastic matrix with zeros complies with the Perron–Frobenius theorem, it is typical to replace zeros with very small positive values, and re-normalize row sums to 1, prior to the subsequent numerical processing (see next 2 items). What is the steady-state final probability of residing in each state, i.e., what is the distribution values of the leading eigenvector? (The leading eigenvector $\mathbf{v}_1$ should contain only real non-negative numbers which sum to 1, and whose associated eigenvalue should have a real value $\lambda_1 = 1$ .) Thus, the steady-state distribution of 2 stochastic matrices $M_1$ and $M_2$ can be compared simply by considering the leading eigenvector $\mathbf{v}_1(M_1)$ and $\mathbf{v}_1(M_2)$ from each of the pair of stochastic matrices, and the 2 vectors compared as any 2 discrete distributions of length $n$ , with for example the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, etc. (Note that this is a comparison of just a pair of length $n$ vectors, in contrast to @krkeane answer which requires $n$ times comparisons of length $n$ pairs of vectors, corresponding to the complete $n \times n$ matrices.) How fast does the convergence to the steady-state final probabilities occur? I.e., the approximate dynamic behavior. This is typically the ratio of the magnitude of the $2^{nd}$ -largest eigenvalue (which is typically complex valued) to the largest eigenvalue (the leading eigenvalue), which should have real value 1: $|\lambda_2|/|\lambda_1| = |\lambda_2|/1 = |\lambda_2|$ . The smaller this ratio (actually simply the value of $|\lambda_2|$ ), the faster the convergence to steady-state. Thus, the 2 stochastic matrices $M_1$ and $M_2$ can be compared by comparing $|\lambda_2(M_1)|$ to $|\lambda_2(M_2)|$ Items 2 and 3 above give 2 comparison conditions, both of which should be passed in order for a pair of stochastic matrices to be considered "effectively equivalent" in terms of their steady-state and approximate dynamic behavior. Item 1 (replacing zeros with very small positive values) is a practical pre-processing for being able to apply items 2 and 3. Note: Typical convention for a Stochastic matrix is that each of its rows sum to 1. Therefore, the leading eigenvector $\mathbf{v}_1$ mentioned in item 2 is the row eigenvector more commonly known as left eigenvector. However, typical numerical analysis libraries customarily compute the right eigenvector(s), i.e., column eigenvectors. Therefore, in order to use a library which computes the right eigenvector(s), it's simply required to input to it the transpose $M^T$ of the stochastic matrix $M$ . Of course, $M^T$ has columns which sum to 1, instead of rows.
