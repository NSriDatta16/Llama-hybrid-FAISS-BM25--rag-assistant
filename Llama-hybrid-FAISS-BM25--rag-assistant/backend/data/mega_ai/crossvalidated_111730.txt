In your 3-way ANOVA with one between-subjects factor (group) and two within-subject factors (condition and time), you have already shown that the interaction of group x condition is statistically significant. I don't understand why you would want to run a separate two-way ANOVA again because such an analysis would essentially give you exactly the same result. To confirm such an equivalence yourself, you may try the following two approaches: 1) Obtain for each subject the average value between the two time points for each condition, and then run 2 x 2 mixed ANOVA (one between- and one within-subject factor). 2) With a 2 x 2 mixed ANOVA, the group x condition interaction is basically a Student t -test. You can get the difference between the two average values above in 1) (one for each condition) for each subject, and then run a two-sample t -test on the condition difference. In other words, the group x condition interaction shows the group difference of the condition difference. Furthermore, to tease apart the specifics of the interaction, you can do the following: (a) Run 2 two-sample t -tests, one on the average value for each condition; Or perform 2 paired t -tests for each group on the average values for the two conditions. (b) Run 4 one-sample t -tests, one on the average value for each condition within each group. With these tests you can use plots as shown on this page to understand the interaction.
