There are any number of ways to validly code the "surface finish" variable. The most common way would be to code them as 0 and 1. That way the coefficient in a main effects model (strength ~ diameter + finish) would estimate the average difference in strength for the two finishes, given the same diameter. The one coded as 0 would be the "baseline" category. The coefficient for the 0-1 dummy in the regression would represent the shift from the baseline mean to get the other mean. If you code as (-1,1), then the coefficient represents an estimate of half the difference in population means (and the meaning of the intercept also changes). To use in predictions, it doesn't matter how you code; you just multiply the coefficient by the coding you used. I'll see if I can mock up an example. If you have a small sample data set (say a dozen observations) I could use that. Okay, here's a small example (not only the data but also the units are made up): strength diameter finish 32.13075 17 A 40.15048 16 S 20.10630 12 A 26.13942 15 A 59.98352 14 A 25.92413 13 A 79.81273 14 S 70.15717 24 A 56.01118 20 A 22.08519 7 S 93.19808 24 S 91.86548 24 A 34.09182 13 A 83.82144 18 S 40.19491 17 S 66.01798 22 S 46.06970 19 A 51.92729 20 A 19.97026 15 A 56.13245 18 A 54.15978 15 S 28.03752 12 A 75.99303 18 S 2.13246 4 A 25.98175 14 A Now if we code a dummy "finish.S" as A=0, S=1 then the model can be with IVs diameter and finish.S We can then fit a regression: Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) -19.2460 9.9774 -1.929 0.06674 diameter 3.7583 0.5885 6.387 2e-06 finish.S 17.9057 5.8642 3.053 0.00583 Residual standard error: 14.02 on 22 degrees of freedom Multiple R-squared: 0.7109, Adjusted R-squared: 0.6846 F-statistic: 27.04 on 2 and 22 DF, p-value: 1.181e-06 The fitted equation is strength = -19.25 + 3.7583 diameter + 17.91 finish.S where finish.S = 1 if finish="S" and is 0 otherwise. Here's a plot of the two fitted lines: on the other hand, if you coded as A=-1 and S=1: Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) -10.2932 10.0415 -1.025 0.31647 diameter 3.7583 0.5885 6.387 2e-06 finish.1 8.9528 2.9321 3.053 0.00583 Residual standard error: 14.02 on 22 degrees of freedom Multiple R-squared: 0.7109, Adjusted R-squared: 0.6846 F-statistic: 27.04 on 2 and 22 DF, p-value: 1.181e-06 The fitted equation is strength = -10.29 + 3.7583 diameter + 8.95 finish.1 where finish.1 either has the value 1 or -1. So the line for "A": strength = (-10.29 - 8.95) + 3.7583 diameter and the line for "S": strength = (-10.29 + 8.95) + 3.7583 diameter My rounding error aside, you end up with the same two fitted lines (the same predictions) with either coding.
