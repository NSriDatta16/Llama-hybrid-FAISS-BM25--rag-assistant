Data Conversion to Time Series in R

I have sales data for 2018 and 2019. I would like to convert it to time series. The data does not have daily sales: View(df) Sales Date 75606 11/01/18 95620 16/01/18 55666 21/01/18 56270 29/01/18 45600 11/02/18 65620 18/02/18 50660 26/02/18 76200 10/03/18 75606 20/03/18 95620 27/03/18 55666 28/03/18 56270 29/03/18 45600 17/04/18 65620 24/04/18 50660 02/05/18 76200 16/05/18 And so on until 2019 December. Here the problem is if I convert it to time series by using following code: tsn It is considering only $1^{st}$ 12 rows The output will be having $1^{st}$ 12 values So how do I convert the whole data into time series? Should I aggregate monthly wise and convert that into time series or is there any way to do?
