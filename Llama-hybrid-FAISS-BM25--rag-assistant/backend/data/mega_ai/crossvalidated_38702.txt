You'd want to set up your data something like this, with 1 indicating that the person was part of the team that did that row's work: work.done Alice Bob Carl Dave Eve Fred Greg Harry Isabel 1.6631071 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0.7951651 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0.2650049 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1.2733771 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0.8086390 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1.7323428 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 ... Then, you can just do linear regression (assuming everything is additive, etc., as you mentioned in comments). In R , the command would be lm(work.done ~ . + 0, data = my.data) The "formula" work.done ~ . + 0 says, in English, that the amount of work done depends on all the other columns (that's the ".") and that groups with no workers would do no work (that's the "+ 0"). This will give you the approximate contribution from each worker to the average group output. As discussed in the comments, if you have a pair of workers that are always together, the model won't be distinguish the contributions of the two workers from one another, and one of them will get an "NA".
