You could go nuts, and do the following: A table named 'Athletes' that has a record for each athlete. Here is where you could store the static properties of the athlete, like what sport they are in, their batting average, etc. A table named 'Owners' that has a record for each user. This might include their name, their password hash, join date, etc. A table for each athlete, containing a record for each owner. Here is where you'd store a reference to the Owners table, along with the percentage ownership. A table for each owner, containing the history of ownership.
