Querying azure table storage for null values

Does anyone know the proper way to query azure table storage for a null value. From what I've read, it's possible (although there is a bug which prevents it on development storage). However, I keep getting the following error when I do so on the live cloud storage: One of the request inputs is not valid. This is a dumbed down version of the LINQ query that I've put together. var query = from fooBar in fooBarSVC.CreateQuery ("FooBars") where fooBar.PartitionKey == kPartitionID && fooBar.Code == kfooBarCode && fooBar.Effective_Date kFooBarDate.ToUniversalTime() || fooBar.Termination_Date == null) select fooBar; If I run the query without checking for null, it works fine. I know a possible solution would be to run a second query on the collection that this query brings back. I don't mind doing that if I need to, but would like to know if I can get this approach to work first. Anyone see anything obvious I'm doing wrong?
