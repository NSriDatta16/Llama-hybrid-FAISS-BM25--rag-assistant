It's hard to say in general. P(A,B,C,D) has 4 variables so naturally its harder than learning P(A,B,C), but if you already have P(A,B,C), and need P(D|A,B,C), well running a linear regression to get P(D|A,B,C) is probably gonna be quicker than doing P(A,B,C,D) though a neural network, OTOH, if you did P(D|A,B,C), it might have a lot of singularities and other nasties that make it heard to learn the function. This is why in the EM algorithm they work with P(A,B) rather than P(A|B).
