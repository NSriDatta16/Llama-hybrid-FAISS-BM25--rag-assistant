index on a float field seems to be ignored

I have a titles table of about 14000 records, with a float field average_rating , which is indexed. But when I try to get the first 48 records with the highest average_rating , the index doesn't do any work. What am I doing wrong? mysql> explain SELECT * FROM `titles` WHERE (average_rating is not null) \ ORDER BY average_rating desc LIMIT 0, 48\G *************************** 1. row *************************** id: 1 select_type: SIMPLE table: titles type: range possible_keys: index_titles_on_average_rating key: index_titles_on_average_rating key_len: 5 ref: NULL rows: 14114 Extra: Using where 1 row in set (0.00 sec)
