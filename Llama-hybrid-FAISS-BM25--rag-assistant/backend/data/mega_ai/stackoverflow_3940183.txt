How can I stop this JSP if the browser has stopped?

I created a JSP which will create a potentially infinite amount of output. When I told the browser to stop, the browser stopped, but my console told me that the JSP's servlet kept going and going and going. I'm wondering whether and how I could modify this code so that it will stop if the browser stops receiving data: " + dumpHeader + " "; LoremIpsum loremIpsum = new LoremIpsum(); System.out.println(dumpHeader); for (int i=0; i " + loremIpsum.getParagraphs(1) + " "; } return dump; } %> Large Amount of Text Large Amount of Text
