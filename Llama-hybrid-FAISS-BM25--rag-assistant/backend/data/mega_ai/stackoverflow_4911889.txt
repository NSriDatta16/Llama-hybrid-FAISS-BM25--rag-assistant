How can i get reference to ItemTemplate's root container and then modify it's properties?

I have a slider on my page which when dragged also should increase the size of the listbox items. How can i achieve this? How can i get reference to the parent container in ItemTemplate and then modify it's height and width? Currently i have this code on my slider value changed event :- void slider_ValueChanged(object sender, RoutedPropertyChangedEventArgs e) { Border parentBorder = ((Border)lstAlbumPhotos.ItemTemplate.LoadContent()); double change = e.NewValue * 10; double percentage = 100 + change; double newWidth = percentage * _width / 100; double newHeight = percentage * _height / 100; parentBorder.Width = newWidth; parentBorder.Height = newHeight; } But it is not working. In the above code Border is my parent container. Thanks in advance :)
