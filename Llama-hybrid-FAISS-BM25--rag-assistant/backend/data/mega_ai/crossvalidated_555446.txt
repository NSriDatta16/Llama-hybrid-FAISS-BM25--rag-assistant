This is an excellent question for which I hope you receive a lot of answers. Restricting attention to only statistical philosophy and intuition, the best resources currently available in my opinion are those created by Richard McElreath - his book Statistical Rethinking and his many freely available YouTube videos. These represent the most intuitive introduction to statistics I've ever seen, and are able to accomplish that by not using any frequentist ideas. By using Bayesian thinking for a student's first exposure to statistics, McElreath is able to build a logical structure whose payoff is seen by his elegant handling of measurement error, missing data, and the probability that one model is better than another in a first statistics course . As a side note, I've come to believe that only by teaching Bayesian statistics first can students really understand frequentist p-values and confidence intervals. McElreath also embraces and develops free computational and graphics tools that will help students.
