Top five classifiers to try first

Besides obvious classifier characteristics like computational cost, expected data types of features/labels and suitability for certain sizes and dimensions of data sets, what are the top five (or 10, 20?) classifiers to try first on a new data set one does not know much about yet (e.g. semantics and correlation of individual features)? Usually I try Naive Bayes, Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree and SVM - though I have no good reason for this selection other than I know them and mostly understand how they work. I guess one should choose classifiers which cover the most important general classification approaches. Which selection would you recommend, according to that criterion or for any other reason? UPDATE: An alternative formulation for this question could be: "Which general approaches to classification exist and which specific methods cover the most important/popular/promising ones?"
