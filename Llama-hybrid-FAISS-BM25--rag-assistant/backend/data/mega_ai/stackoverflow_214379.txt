What is the best method for storing viewstate in an ASP.Net mobile web application?

I'm curious what techniques you find to be the best for storage and maintaining of viewstate with respect to an ASP.Net application running within a mobile web browser (i.e. Treo with Windows Mobile, or Blackberry Curve web browser).
