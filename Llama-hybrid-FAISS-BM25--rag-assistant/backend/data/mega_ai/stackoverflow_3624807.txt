C++ project crashed or worked depending on the order of include statements. Used the memory window to have a look at the structures accessed leading to the crash, saw that they were aligned in one version of the code, but not in the other. Solution: 3rd party library used #pragma pack in the header, sometimes undone later, sometimes not.
