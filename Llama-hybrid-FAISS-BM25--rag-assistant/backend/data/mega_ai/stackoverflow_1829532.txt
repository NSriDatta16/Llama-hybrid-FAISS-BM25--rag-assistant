I have the following use case: A table have a section, subsection or subsubsection heading like: \section*{Table name} \begin{tabular*} ... \end{tabular*} Because the table can appear in section, subsection etc. I thought I could define the table header and footer as macros and additionally pass the type of table heading (section, subsection, subsubsection, paragraph ...) So this requires me to have something like: \#1*{Table name} \begin{tabular*} ... \end{tabular*} where #1 is the macro parameter passed. Is there any chance to achieve smth. like this? Many thanks, Ovanes
