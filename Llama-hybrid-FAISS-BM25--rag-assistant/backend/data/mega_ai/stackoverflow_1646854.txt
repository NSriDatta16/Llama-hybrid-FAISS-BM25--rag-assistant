Within JUnit 4 you will want to look at the Parameterized runner . It was created for the purpose you describe (data driven tests). It won't organize them into suites however. In Junit 3 you can create TestSuites and Tests programatically. The answer is in Junit Recipes , which I can expand if you need it (remember that JUnit 4 can run Junit 3 tests).
