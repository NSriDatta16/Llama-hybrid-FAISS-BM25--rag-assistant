jQuery: Fade not working

For some reason, when I call jQuery's fade effect, it doesn't work. What am I doing wrong? This function does everything it is supposed to, aside from the fading. It gets called at the correct time. function move_to_term(original_course, helper, term) { var cloned_course = original_course.clone(true); original_course.addClass('already-scheduled').droppable("destroy"); helper.fadeOut(function() { cloned_course.appendTo(term).attr('style', '').fadeIn("slow"); }); cloned_course.draggable(); } UPDATE: It fails in both FF 3.5.9 and IE 8. UPDATE 2: This function is set to be a callback for a droppable's drop event: var new_term = $(sprintf(' %s ', term["fields"]["name"])); new_term.data('pk', term['pk']); new_term.droppable({ drop: function(event, ui) { move_to_term(ui.draggable, ui.helper, $(this)); }, accept: function(draggable) { return legal_for_term(draggable, $(this)) }, tolerance: 'pointer', activeClass: 'legal-drop-term-active', hoverClass: 'legal-drop-term-hover' }); UPDATE 3 : The text does take a little while to change places, as if the fade is happening but just not being animated? Or maybe I'm totally off on that. UPDATE 4: This works just fine, although it doesn't accomplish the effect I'd hoped for: function moveToTerm(original_course, helper, term) { original_course.fadeOut('slow'); } Here is the droppable HTML: Fall 2010 Computing Cultures Here is the draggable HTML: Introduction to Web Design Is fading not supported on ui.helper objects? UPDATE 5 : Ok, now all I want to do is to fade in the cloned object: function moveToTerm(original_course, helper, term) { var cloned_course = original_course.clone(true); original_course.addClass('already-scheduled'); original_course.draggable("disable"); cloned_course.draggable(); cloned_course.appendTo(term).fadeIn("slow"); } This doesn't work, but changing fadeIn() to fadeOut() makes it work. Why? FIXED: Change: cloned_course.appendTo(term).fadeIn("slow"); to: cloned_course.appendTo(term).hide().fadeIn("slow");
