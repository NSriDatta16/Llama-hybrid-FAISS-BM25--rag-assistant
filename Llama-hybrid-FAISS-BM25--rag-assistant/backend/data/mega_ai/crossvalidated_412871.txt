Binomial logistic regression is what you are looking for. There is no problem in having only one variable (indeed, it's great as you will be able to draw a beautiful curve representing probability of high performance versus CognitiveScore) I don't know about the specifics of your particular problem, but you may want to transform AgeCohort into a number and include it as a second regressor
