Arrange GUI elements in WPF in a similar way to the applications on the iPhone

I would like to arrange UIControls in WPF in a similar way to the applications on the iPhone. They should be positioned on a grid, but a user should be able to drag them somewhere else, after releasing the mouse button (or the finger in case of an iPhone) the selected UIControl should snap back to the next position in the grid. The other UIElements should be rearranged automatically. Further the user should also be connect two elements with a line or something. I'm not experienced with WPF. The first question is if there is a container which is suitable for something (System.Windows.Controls.Grid ?) or if I have to extend canvas or somethig else for this. I would like to know which elements from the WPF framework can be used and which elements I have to write myself. For people who do not own an iPhone: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3omhu2AUWC8 Update I've looked at AnimatedTilePanel in the BangOTricks examples (see below), this one explains how to create your own Panel and how to let it arrange things there.. However I still need an idea how to implement drag and drop correctly in this example..
