Magento: Getting Product Url's for Products within a Grouped Product

For a grouped product, I would like to display a link to the simple products it is composed of. For example, if I have a grouped product called Dining Set composed of plates, knives, forks, etc. I'd like each of the subproducts to have a link to that subproduct (click plates goes to the Simple Product for plates) htmlEscape($_item->getName()) ?> getPriceHtml($_item, true) ?> isSaleable()): ?> isSaleable()) : ?> getProductUrl() ?>">View __('Out of stock.') ?> This is a code snippet from the grouped.phtml file in app/design/frontend/blank/default/template/catalog/product/view/type/grouped.phtml In particular the line that has $_item->getProductUrl() , this does not work, and I don't know the code needed to get the url for this associated product item. If anyone could help here it would be much appreciated. Also, where on earth can I find the method's available (and how they're used) for Products or Categories or $_item and the like?
