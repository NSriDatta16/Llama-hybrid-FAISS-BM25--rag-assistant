Working with DIV's & CSS

OK, if anyone could help me with this I'd be much appreciative. If you copy and paste the following and open up in IE or Firefox Item 1 Item 2 Item 3 Item 4 Item 5 Some Text Another paragraph Why does the second div which has a blue background expand to be behind the first div that contains the list of items? How do I get it to really float next to the first div?
