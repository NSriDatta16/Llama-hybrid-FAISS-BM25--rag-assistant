The design patterns found in the Gang of Four book all came from examining real-world software applications and seeing what common solutions were used. I would guess that the patterns presented in the book were also generalized to be more useful to a general population. Given that fact, I would expect that any medium or large scale application would contain at least a few patterns or variations on patterns described by the Gang of Four.
