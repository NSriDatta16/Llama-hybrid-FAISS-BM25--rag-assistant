I am facing a similar situation in finance, one way to go about it is to add Country as a feature, which would be similar to a fixed effects model, and then do standard cross-validation with time series , and is similar to what the medium post refers as “regular” nested cross-validation. I think this is appropriate for your problem. The second approach, more appropriate with a wide panel data (data from every country for example), would be to use the cross-validation with time series, but within each period of the training set, withhold the information for say 1/3 of the countries and add it to the test set. In this case the model would have to learn to fit both cross-sectionally and across time. I am not enthusiastic about the Population-Informed data in your case, since the observations across individuals, within the same time period are probably not independent, for example macroeconomic shocks that affect USA could also affect Germany contemporaneously.
