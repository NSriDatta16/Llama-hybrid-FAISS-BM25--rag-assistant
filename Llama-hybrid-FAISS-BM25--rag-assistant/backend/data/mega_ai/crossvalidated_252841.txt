Why the probability greater than 100% when I use Naive Bayesian for classification

I use Naive Bayesian to train a dataSet: weather temperature humidity windspeed Y/N? rain cool normal strong N sunny hot high strong N sunny hot high weak N sunny mild high weak N sunny cool normal weak Y overcast hot normal weak Y rain mild normal weak Y rain cool normal weak Y overcast hot high weak Y sunny mild normal strong Y overcast mild high strong Y Table for count: count(Y) = 7,count(N) = 4 Table for probability: P(Y)=7/11, P(N)=4/11 Now, there is a new data: overcast hot normal weak I will predict the classification for this data, I compute the probability of P(Y|overcast, hot, normal, weak) first: P(Y|overcast, hot, normal, weak) = P(overcast, hot, normal, weak|Y)P(Y) / P(overcast, hot, normal, weak) = P(overcast|Y)P(hot|Y)P(normal|Y)P(weak|Y)P(Y) / P(overcast)P(hot)P(normal)P(weak) = (3/7 * 2/7 * 5/7 * 5/7 * 7/11) / (3/11 * 4/11 * 6/11 * 7/11) = (1050/26411) / (504/14641) = 0.039756 / 0.034423 = 1.154925 Why the probability(1.154925) greater than 1? How can I get right probability in this case by using Naive Bayesian?
