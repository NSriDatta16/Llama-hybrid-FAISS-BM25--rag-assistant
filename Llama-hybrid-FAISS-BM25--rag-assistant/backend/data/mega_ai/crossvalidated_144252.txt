Time Series Comparison - Correlation and Regression Model

I am trying to see if and how the news for affects the financial markets. I have a time-series for both of them. Should I standardise the series? I have a monthly return on prices from the Dow and a monthly score for the sentiment, is that enough? I already tried to get the Standard Deviation for each month by using Excel and highlighting the days of each month (2000 - 2014) but it's taking too long (=STDEV.S(B24:B42)) , so I'm wondering if its worth doing and if so, is there a faster way of doing this? Thanks.
