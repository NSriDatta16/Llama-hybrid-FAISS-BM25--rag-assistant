distance between two points (x,y) weighted by location (x)

a new on algebra. I am trying to create an indicator of the distance between two points (x,y) from a (0,1) scale, but I want to create a weight that reduces such distances as the point x is closer to 1 per individual. x contains individual values within a cluster and y is the cluster average. Negative values imply that someone is below the average, and positive values mean that someone is above the average. I tried something like this, but it is not correct because the value in x2 should be smaller than x1. Is there a better way to do it? $$ x_p = x_1\dfrac{1}{(x_1 - \overline{x})} $$ I have two clusters with two individuals. $$ x1 =(0.3,0.7), \overline{x1}= 0.5, x_p1 = (-0.15, 0.15) \\ x2 =(0.5,0.9), \overline{x2}= 0.7 , x_p2 = (-2.5, 2.5) $$
