On the OnClick event I have javascript that sets the ddl.value = true; On the OnChange event I check to see if ddl.Value = true if so I postback and set it to false. On the OnKeyDown I set ddl.Value = false so that when I click on the ddl it only posts back if I change the selection with the mouse, if I press a key to use the type-ahead-feature it will not postback. Not the most elegant solution but it works and you have to give me creadit for creativity. Note: This solution work in combination with a script that fires on OnKeyDown that runs the type-ahead-ddl(ie. moves you to the closest selection when you press a key) and postsback when you press enter.
