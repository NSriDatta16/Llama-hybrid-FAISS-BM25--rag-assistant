What does $conn->query() return, a MySQL resource object like mysql_query() does? If so then it'll always compare "true". mysql_query() only returns FALSE if the query completely fails, like it has a syntax error or a table doesn't exist. To check if you got any results you need to try to fetch a row from the result set and see if you get anything, via whatever your equivalent of mysql_fetch_row() is. Important: Your script is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks , or even just odd usernames like o'neil with an apostrophe. You should escape all variables in a query with mysql_real_escape_string() (or equivalent) to make sure your query doesn't get messed up by special characters. Or, even better, use prepared statements which look like select * from login where username=? and password=sha1(?) Re: UPDATE Variables from a form are available via either $_GET or $_POST , depending on which method was used to submit the form. Try if (isset($_POST['remember'])) to see if that check box was checked. Important: I see that you tried to use a bare $remember to see if the check box was checked. That suggests to me that you are trying to take advantage of the register_globals feature in PHP which makes your GET and POST variables accessible via regular variable names. If that is the case you should heed the warning in the PHP manual! WARNING [ register_globals ] has been DEPRECATED as of PHP 5.3.0 and REMOVED as of PHP 6.0.0. Relying on this feature is highly discouraged. Use $_GET and $_POST instead. I could tell you how to make if ($remember) work, actually, but given the inherent evil-ness of register_globals I'm not gonna! ;-)
