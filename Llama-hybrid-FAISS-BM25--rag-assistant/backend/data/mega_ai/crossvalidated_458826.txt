Breusch and Pagan Lagrangian multiplier test for random effects for Random effect heteroskedasticity

I'm really confused about Breusch and Pagan Lagrangian multiplier test for random effects. The command in stata is xttest0 . Some say it is a test to choose between random and fixed effects and simple OLS refer to slide NO 32 http://www.princeton.edu/~otorres/Panel101.pdf .... And some say it is a test for heteroskedasticity in random-effects model. look at figure 2 https://www.projectguru.in/panel-data-regression-random-effect-model-stata/ ... I have searched all the web to find how to do heteroskedasticity test for random effects model in Stata, but simply there is no clear answer that is agreed by all.
