Traditional Predictive Analytics vs Machine Learning Methods

What is the difference between traditional predictive analytics done using statistics and its tools and, one using machine learning and deep learning? How are we leveraging machine learning and deep learning to make predictive models better? How to decide the boundary for when to use traditional models and, when to use ML and DL? We have a lot of efficient statistical tools available Stata, SPSS. They are easier to use. Also, computationally efficient. Thanks I am unable to find some satisfactory and convincing answer with strong points on google.
