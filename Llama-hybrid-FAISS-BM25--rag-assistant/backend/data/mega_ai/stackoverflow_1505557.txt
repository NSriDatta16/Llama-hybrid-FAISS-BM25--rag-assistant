The answer somewhat depends on how important it is that the user pay attention and how important it is that they take some action? E.g. is the alert of the "your server just crashed" kind or "you have new e-mail from aunt Zelda" kind? For the first kind, something obtrusive is the best - either your option of floating a window, or may be change the page background to flashy color (and blink??? Don't hit me please!). One other nice way of grabbing attention I saw was to change the page (and thus a browser window) title to a flashing set of "* * * * * *" - that is un-usual enough to attract attention sometimes. For something less obtrusive for less critical-too-notice-quickly, SO's top notification bar is one of the very best solutions from usability standpoint (if not the best), going by the main metrics (how much work does the user need to do to deal with this and to look at it, and how intuitive its behavior is): The user's eyes travel to top of the screen more often and more likely than elsewhere It is very easy to get rid of once you notice it - the bar is wide (easy to hit with mouse, no horisontal adjustments needed) and at the very top (not too much fine mouse work to get the pointer there).
