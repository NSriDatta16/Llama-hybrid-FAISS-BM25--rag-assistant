Entity extraction web services

Are there any paid or free named entity recognition web services available. Basically I'm looking for something - where if I pass a text like: "John had french fries at Burger King" It should be identify - something along the lines: Person: John Organization: Burger King I've heard of Annie from GATE - but I don't think it has a web service available.
