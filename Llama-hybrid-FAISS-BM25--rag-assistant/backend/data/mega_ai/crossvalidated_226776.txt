Just change the variable you are trying to predict to the difference in the dependent variable. As the other posts point out, the random forest will not know how to treat time variables that occur after the training set. Let's say your training set has data from Minute 1 to Minute 60. The random forest might make a rule that after forty minutes the dependent variable is 100. Even if there is a trend, if you get out to Minute 10000 in the test data, the same rule will be applied. If you predict the difference though, this can have the same effect of including a trend. As to whether RF's are decent forecasters, I have had MUCH greater luck with RF's than other econometric models like VAR, VECM, etc. but especially for short-term forecasts. Some other models do seem to work better on most data, however, such as well-tuned GBM models.
