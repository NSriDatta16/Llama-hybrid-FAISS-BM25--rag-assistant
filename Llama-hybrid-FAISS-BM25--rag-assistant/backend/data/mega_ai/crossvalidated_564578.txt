It is determined by the estimation method you select. In OLS, the regression parameters $\hat\beta_{OLS}$ are determined by the following. $$ \hat\beta_{OLS}=(X^TX)^{-1}X^Ty $$ Whatever the result of that calculation turns out to be is the answer. Logistic regression does not have a closed-form equation for its parameter vector, but it can be calculated as the parameter vector that minimizes the crossentropy loss function (same as how OLS minimizes the square loss function, which turns out to be the same as the $\hat\beta_{OLS}$ above). Whatever the intercept value is in the parameter vector is the intercept in the logistic regression; any real number is possible.
