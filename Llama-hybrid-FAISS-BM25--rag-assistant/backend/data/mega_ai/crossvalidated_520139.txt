Are recurrent neural networks just vanilla neural networks with sequential data?

Suppose I have a sequence of observations $x_1, x_2,...,x_n$ . Is fitting a recurrent neural network to this data set the same as fitting a vanilla neural network with inputs $x_1, x_2, \dots,x_{n-1}$ and outputs $x_2, x_3, \dots , x_n$ ? If not, what's the difference?
