Think of machine learning as learning formula for a task (say making a prediction). Model is then the unique formula. Learning algorithm is the procedure by which you arrive at the right formula. If you are building a machine learning model of the form (linear regression), Y = a 0 * x 0 + a 1 * x 1 + ... + a n * x n Then the linear formula above has free parameters a 0 .. a n . For a fixed value of all parameters, you have a unique formula. This unique formula/equation is the model . Model is something that you can save and use to make predictions on new inputs.
