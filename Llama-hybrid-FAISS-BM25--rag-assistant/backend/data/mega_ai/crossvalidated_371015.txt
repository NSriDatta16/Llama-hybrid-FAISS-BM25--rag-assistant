I would suggest to plot a histogram. For a quick histogram you can do this: Load data into a pandas dataframe: df = pandas.Dataframe( data, optional parameters) df.hist() If most of your features are following a bernoulli distribution , you should be good to use Multinomial (Bernoulli) NB and if they are following a Gaussian (Normal) distribution, Gaussian Bayes should be good. In case your distributions of features seems to be complex (a mixture of different distributions), it would be good to consider dimensionality reduction to make sure you have most, though not all, features to have similar distribution.
