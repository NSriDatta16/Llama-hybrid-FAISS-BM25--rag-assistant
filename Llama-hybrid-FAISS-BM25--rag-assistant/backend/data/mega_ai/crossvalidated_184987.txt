Testing significance of RMSE of models

I repeatedly trained two neural network models and calculated the RMSE for each run (split validation). Which statistical test is most useful in this case for testing if the difference of the models mean RMSE is significant? I think it is save to assume that the RMSE of the models is normally distributed. Maybe welch test or two-sample t-test?
