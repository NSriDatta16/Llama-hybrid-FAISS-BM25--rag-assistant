You may find the .delegate or .live to be useful. They are able to bind events to current and future elements in the document, instead of only documents found at the time of the call. EDIT Here is a working example of what I mean: http://www.jsfiddle.net/bradchristie/39Gt5/ Note that I don't make any further calls to the delegate function, but it is adding new paragraphs and buttons as you click the button, and the click event is automatically bound. UPDATE For those of you finding this post and using jquery 1.8+, .delegate / .live have been deprecated and replaced by .on . The linked reference shows exmaple of how to convert your code to use the new .on() method as well.
