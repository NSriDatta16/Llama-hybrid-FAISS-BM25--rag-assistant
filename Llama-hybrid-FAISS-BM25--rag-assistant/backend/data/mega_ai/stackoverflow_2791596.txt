In the interest of helping you out, here are some modifications. Please hear this, though: a lot of this might not make sense without a good background in PHP or OOP in general. You should look at @webbiedave's link. class whatever { static function maths() { $tabs = array(); $results = $this->sql->query($requete); while($val = mysql_fetch_array($this)) { $tabs = $val; } return $tabs; } This fixes syntax errors and logic errors (for instance, the creation of the $results variable to hold the SQL query run). I made the maths method static, since there's really no need to instantiate a whatever() object with this current example. Here are some modifications to how this would be used: $results = whatever::maths(); foreacho ($results as $result) { echo $result['average']; echo $result['randomData']; } Since maths() returns something, you need to store that in a variable; simply calling it, as you did previously, doesn't do anything. That convoluted for loop can be replaced with a foreach loop.
