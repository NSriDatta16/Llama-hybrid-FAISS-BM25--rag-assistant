SharePoint stores the details of where a web part is on the page in it's database. When you move the web part around in edit mode you're changing it's Zone property value in the content database. So if you were able to drag and drop the HTML for the web part you'd also need a way to update the database to let SharePoint know its new position next time the page loads. I guess this is possible using AJAX to make a call to the server to update the web part's zone but I haven't seen this done anywhere.
