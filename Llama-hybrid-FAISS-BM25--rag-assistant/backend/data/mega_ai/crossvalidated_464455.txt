It is stated in the first sentence, but I agree that it is a bit confusing. As I remember it, $\pi_{i}$ is the proportion of time that the Markov chain is in state $i$ . For example, if $\pi_{i} = 0.5$ then the Markov chain is in state $i$ half of the time. In other words, if you look at the chain at random moments in time, you expect the chain to be in state $i$ in 50 percent of those instances. $P^{n}$ is the $n$ -th power of the transition matrix, which gives the probabilities after $n$ transitions. So $P_{i,j}^{n}$ is the probability that you start in state $i$ and after $n$ transitions are in state $j$ .
