You really need to prevent your customers from incorporating any php or javascript into their website. Any image uploads should be format converted to something else then back again on upload. Problem is that most editors will not allow you to build up fragments of a page. As Samuel suggests you could restrict them to only editing the CSS (and publishing their own graphic content) - but this can be rather restrictive. One approach to solving this problem is ESI - but that requires a high level of skill with the technology for anyone involved - and try to restrict peolpe from doing stuff they shouldn't is rather difficult. Another approach is for you to provide a set of html fragments (which should contain matched tags and no positional / font info other than classes) and have the customer provide an HTML page with a set of placeholders where you insert your content, e.g. customer provides: {%PAGE_TITLE%} .... Another approach would be to provide the customer with an online thru-the-web editor. You might want to have a look at some of the mash-up tools available, e.g. Radria . HTH C.
