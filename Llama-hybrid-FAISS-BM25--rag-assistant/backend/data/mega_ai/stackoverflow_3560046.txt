Changing params for search with rails and sunspot

This seems like a common task, I'm sure others have come across it. If my controller says this : def index s = Sunspot.search Organization do |query| query.keywords params[:q] unless params[:q].blank? query.with(:searchable).equal_to(params[:filter_by] == 'published' ? 'true' : false) if params[:filter_by] .. How do I: .. through a link, make it change its query.with(:searchable) statement to query.with(:has_no_deals) ? Here's my starter link that doesn't work, because the old query.with(:searchable) is not overwritten: = link_to 'Has No Deals', url_for(:overwrite_params => { :filter_by => 'dfgsdgsdf', :page => nil })
