The only way to know is to measure. Guesses about performance are almost always wrong :) Personally I'd probably just stick with your original log4j code - don't get too hung up about coverage. It's reasonable to guard against making too many log calls for code paths that are always followed - but I wouldn't bother for things like error conditions, where you're already in an odd and hopefully rare situation. Within that, write the most readable code, and then make sure your app performs as well as you need it to. If it doesn't, profile it to find out where the problem is. If it's in the logging code, optimise that.
