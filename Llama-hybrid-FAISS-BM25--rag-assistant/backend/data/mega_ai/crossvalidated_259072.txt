It depends on which is the outcome variable. If age is, maybe do a kruskal wallace test. You could do a t-test (not paired) but the discrete nature of age doesn't make the normal assumption very reasonable. If Yes/No is the outcome, then do logistic regression with age as the predictor Spoiler alert: I just checked, and you won't get a significant result either way you do it. The $p$-value for the logistic regression is about 0.16, for the kruskal-wallace test it's about 0.21, and for the two-sample t-test it's about 0.14
