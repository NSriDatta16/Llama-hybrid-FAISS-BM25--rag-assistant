Intraclass Correlation Coefficient with Bayesian ordered-logit GLMM (STAN)

I am fitting a Generalized Linear Mixed Model for an ordered outcome, in form of an ordered logit, with random intercept and slope. For this task, I am going Bayesian by handling STAN through the package 'brms' in R. The model works well and everything converges. However I tried to estimate Intraclass Correlation Coefficient with the command 'icc' from the packages 'sjstats'. The command provides me with the following estimates ## Respondent_ID ICC: 0.91 HDI 89%: [0.90 0.93] Between-group: 10.79 HDI 89%: [8.16 13.22] ## Residuals Within-group: 1.00 HDI 89%: [1.00 1.00] ## Random-slope-variance Respondent_ID: 2.03 HDI 89%: [1.31 2.64] How do I interpret them? Especially the between-group voice, which is greater than 1. Thanks, Jacopo
