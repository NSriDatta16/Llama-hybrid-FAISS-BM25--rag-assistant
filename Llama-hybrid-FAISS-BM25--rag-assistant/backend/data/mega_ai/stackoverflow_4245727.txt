When can CancellationToken.CanBeCanceled be false?

The documentation on CancellationToken.CanBeCanceled describes what it does, but doesn't mention when it can ever be false. Hence it's not entirely clear to me when I should pay attention to this property. In which circumstances can it be false and when should I look at it?
