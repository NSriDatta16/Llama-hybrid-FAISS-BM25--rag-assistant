There's a good survey paper on the relative merits of the embedding APIs of various scripting languages: H. Muhammad and R. Ierusalimschy. C APIs in extension and extensible languages. Journal of Universal Computer Science, 13(6):839â€“853, 2007. Looking at combining both excellent string manipulation and an excellent embed API, I would suggest, in order: Ruby: Excellent string support, including syntax support for regex. Well-designed embed API, very easy to use. Lua: I'm not sure how its string support is, but its supposed to be a great language for embedding. Python: Less easy to embed, slightly harder to use string features than Ruby. But it has Pyrex, so that might be an easier way to embed it. PHP: Nasty API, nasty language. The embed SAPI is really a second-class citizen, but it does work. There are a lot of string manipulation functions. Still, I wouldn't recommend it. Perl: Nasty to embed (so far as I've heard), string support could be better. I can't comment about TCL, but I hear its designed for embedding.
