How to combine 3 random variables?

I have a homework assignment that is giving me a hard time on the statistics. Lets say you have 3 stocks, all with n expected return (mean) $\mu = 8\%$, a risk (standard deviation) $\sigma = 16\%$ and a correlation coefficient $\rho = 0.3$ between every tow stocks. The homework questions is: If you build a portfolio from three stocks with an equal part form each stock. What is the expected return, and the risk? . The expected return is easy, its the average of 8%,8%,8% which is 8%. But how to I calculate the risk (standard deviation) of all three? There are plenty of examples how to do it with 2 random variables, its: $\sigma_1^2*w_1^2+\sigma_2^2*w2^2-\sigma_1*\sigma_2*w_1*w_2*\rho_{1,2}$ (Where $w_1, w_2$ are the relative weights of the rabdom variable). But what is it for three? My guess is$ \sigma_1^2*w_1^2+\sigma_2^2*w_2^2-\sigma_1*\sigma_2*w_1*w_2*\rho_{1,2} + \\ \sigma_2^2*w_2^2+\sigma_3^2*w_3^2-\sigma_2*\sigma_3*w_2*w_3*\rho_{2,3} + \\ \sigma_1^2*w_1^2+\sigma_3^2*w_3^2-\sigma_1*\sigma_3*w_1*w_3*\rho_{1,3} + \\ \sigma_1^2*w_1^2+\sigma_2^2*w_2^2+\sigma_3^2*w_3^2 + \sigma_1*\sigma_2*\sigma_3*w_1*w_2*w_3*\rho_{1,2,3}$ In my question where $\sigma_1=\sigma_2=\sigma_3=16\%$ and $w_1=w_2=w_3=8\%$ and $\rho_{1,2}=\rho_{2,3}=\rho_{1,3}=0.3$ I get a simplified formula: $(\sigma^2*w^2*2-\sigma^2*w^2*\rho_{1,2}) * 3 + \sigma^3*w^3*\rho_{1,2,3}$ I took this idea from the Inclusionâ€“exclusion principle . Now my questions: Is that even true for random variables? If so, how do I know $\rho_{1,2,3}$? (Please leave an explanation\reference on $\rho_{1,2,3}$ and not just a formula.) Vocabulary (in case it was not clear how the financial terms fit into statistics): random variable = stock mean = $\mu$ = expected return of a stock standard deviation = $\sigma$ = risk of a stock\portfolio
