To check the folder/directory has been created inside your application bundle (.app), right click on your .app file and select "Show Package Contents". Now check if folder/directory appears in your .app file. As a side note, an easier way to add a folder/directory to your .app bundle is to add "Folder" instead of "Group" in your Xcode project. For example, lets say you have a bunch of files inside /HTML directory. Drag and Drop this /HTML directory in your Xcode project. Xcode will present a dialog with options like, "Copy items into destination group's folder (if needed)", "Create groups for any added folders", and "Create folder references for any added folders". Choose "Create folder references for any added folders" in this dialog. As a result, you'll see a blue group folder, instead of the usual yellow group folder for your /HTML directory (in your Xcode project), and Building the .app will create /HTML folder inside your .app bundle. Hope this helps.
