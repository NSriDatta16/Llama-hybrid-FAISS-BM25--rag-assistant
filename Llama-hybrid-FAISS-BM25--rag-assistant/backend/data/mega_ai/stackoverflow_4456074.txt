How can an Outlook add-in detect if email was sent by the same add-in?

How can I add "XYZ 1.2.3" (add-in name/version/etc) to an Outlook email message so that if the recipient has the same add-in some additional behavior can be invoked when received? I'd prefer to accomplish this silently to the average user (not through an attachment). Can I do this by modifying the header? If so, would that cause a higher proportion of false spam flags? I'm using C# with Outlook/VS 2010.
