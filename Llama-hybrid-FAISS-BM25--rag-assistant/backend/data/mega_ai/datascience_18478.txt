Is it true that Machine Learning is basically the study of Pattern recognition along with Optimization?

I study Pattern Recognition (Classification, Clustering, NeuralNet, Decision tree, and so on. But, excluding textual analysis), and Optimization (study of computational complexity, and trade off of computation and complexity of the target hypotheses, genetic algorithm, and so on) in my university. If somewhere else somebody studies "Machine Learning", can I assume that they are actually studying Pattern Recognition + Optimization? That is, is machine learning the study of pattern recognition along with optimization?
