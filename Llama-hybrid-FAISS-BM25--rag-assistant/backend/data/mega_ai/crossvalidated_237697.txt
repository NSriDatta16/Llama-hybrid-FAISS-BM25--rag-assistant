A point of confusion may be what is meant by log returns or log interest rate. Let's say you have a return or interest rate $R$ like -.01 or .02. The log return is: $$ r = \log\left(1 + R \right) $$ If you're doing time series analysis, it's often nice to work with log returns because summing log returns (and taking the exp) is equivalent to multiplying simple returns. Also note that the log return is equivalent to the difference in log prices. $$r_{t+1} = \log\left( \frac{P_{t+1}}{P_t} \right) = \log P_{t+1} - \log P_t$$
