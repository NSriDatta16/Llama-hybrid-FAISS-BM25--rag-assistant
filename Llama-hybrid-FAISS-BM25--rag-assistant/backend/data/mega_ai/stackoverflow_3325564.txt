Groovy Base32 conversions

I am unable to use the fabulous tr() at the moment as I can only use Groovy 1.7.1 and wanted to know if there is an elegant way of going backwards and forwards between string and number encoded with Base32, but with the values A to Z then 2 to 7, rather than 0 to 9 then A to V. This is to remove customer error in typing in a human readable code by not using zero or one. I can think of 72 Regex expressions that would enable this, but that seems like overkill when tr( 'A-Z2-7', 0-9A-V') is SO much easier
