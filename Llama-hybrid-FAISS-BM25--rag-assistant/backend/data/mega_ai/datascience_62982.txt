How to optimize input parameters given target and scoring parameters

I'm new to machine learning/optimization, so I apologize in advance if this has been answered before. I don't know which search terms to use. I have a large dataset where I have a number of input parameters $I_1$ , ... $I_n$ ( $n$ up to 10), a target parameter $T$ and a scoring parameter $S$ . There are roughly a million rows of real-life data, where each row has the input parameters, the target parameter and the scoring parameter. The data is operational data from a piece of machinery where $T$ is output power, $S$ is fuel consumption and $I_1$ , ... $I_n$ are tuning parameters for the machinery. The relationships of the tuning parameters to $S$ and $T$ are unknown but likely nonlinear. So I basically want to understand how to tune the machinery to produce the desired output power as fuel-efficiently as possible given the parameters I can tune. What I need is some way of getting to a function where I input $T$ and get out the optimal combination of $I_1$ , ... $I_n$ that minimizes $S$ for that value of $T$ . I work in Python, and I assume that it's some combination of sklearn and scipy, but I haven't been able to figure out the steps to take for this type of problem. Thanks in advance.
