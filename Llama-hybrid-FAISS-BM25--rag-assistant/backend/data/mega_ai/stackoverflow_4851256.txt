Java lacks intrinsic event handling, but there are libraries to help you accomplish this. Check out javaEventing, http://code.google.com/p/javaeventing/ It works much as in C# where you first define your events, and then register event listeners. You trigger events using EventManager.triggerEvent(..someEvent). It allows you to provide custom conditions and payloads with your events as well. bob
