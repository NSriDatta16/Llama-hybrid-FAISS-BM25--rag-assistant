How logistic regression accounts non-linear relationship of independent variable with dependent class?

I have binary response variable and one independent variable.Wanted to fit logistic regression model. I have plotted response variable against independent variable which clearly shows non-linear relationship .Then how logistic regression account such non-linear relationship? What we need to do take this effect into account? I am not able to understand how such kind of non-relationship of independent variable with response variable will logistic regression handle?
