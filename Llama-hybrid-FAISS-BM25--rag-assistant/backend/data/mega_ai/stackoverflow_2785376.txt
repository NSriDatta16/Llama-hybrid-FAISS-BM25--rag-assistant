How to enable design support in a custom control?

I'll try to explain what I'm after. I don't know the technical term for it, so here goes: Example 1: If I place a ListView on a Form and add some columns I am able, in Design-Time, to click-and-drag the columns to resize them. Example 2: Now, I place a ListView in a UserControl and name it "MyCustomListView" (and perhaps add some method to enhance it somehow). If I now place the "MyCustomListView" on a Form I am unable to click-and-drag the column headers to resize them in Design-Time. Is there any way to easily make that happen? Some form of "pass the click-and-drag event to the underlying control and let that control do its magic" . Im not really looking to recode, just pass on the mouseclick (or whatever it is) and let the, in this case, ListView react as it did in the first example above.
