Short answer : You can't. Long answer : There are no javascript events for copy/paste that works for all browsers. There are a limited support, you can find a table here: http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/events/cutcopypaste.html As for specifying what to receive in an input element, you can really specify that either. As I see it you got three options: a) Do as the others say and handle the change event on the input element. Modify the value on change to strip and unwanted characters. ( ) b) Hook the lost focus event strip any unwanted characters exist in the input. ( ) c) Filter on form submit ( ).
