The three principal criteria for key design are Familiarity, Simplicity and Stability. If you use keys that are familiar and simple then users will find them easier to recognise, remember and use. They will be less likely to make mistakes when entering and using key values and data quality and usability will usually be improved. I suggest you resolve this question by asking your users which type of identifier they find easier to use, or even testing out different schemes with them if it's very important to you. In any case, developers alone shouldn't make that decision. Some organisations have departments or individuals responsible for defining the standard coding schemes to be used.
