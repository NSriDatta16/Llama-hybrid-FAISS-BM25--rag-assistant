According to this information on this page : IBM and RSA have FIPS 140-2 validated JCE providers. BouncyCastle have FIPS 140-2 validated JCE providers for Java 7 & 8. (See The Legion of the Bouncy Castle - FIPS Resources Page . Donations are encouraged!) Sun's JCE providers are not on the list of FIPS 140-2 validated modules. However, Oracle do have a validated module called "Oracle Cryptographic Libraries for SSL". The description does not say this is a JCE provider ... but it might be. Also, Oracle don't appear to have any "modules in progress" for FIPS 140-2 validation.
