Semi-supervised refers to using a combination of a labeled dataset (usually quite small) and a (usually much larger) unlabeled dataset. When the labels are automatically derived from the data itself, this is these days called self-supervised learning or self-supervision. Examples in time series include predicting the next time step, or filling in a gap in the sequence. This website by Lillian Weng is a good reference for some of the many possible strategies. https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/2019/11/10/self-supervised-learning.html
