Reach can be used. Many variables that might be interesting to include in a model cannot meaningfully be added together. For example, average staff tenure, interest rates, total customers, etc. Also, categorical variables such as what month the sales are occurring in or what advertising agency you used can't really be added together but are valuable in models.
