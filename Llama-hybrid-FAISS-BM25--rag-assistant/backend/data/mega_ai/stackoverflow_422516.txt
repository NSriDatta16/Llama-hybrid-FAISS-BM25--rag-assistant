In fact, the recommendation of Jonathan Lewis, Author of Cost-Based Oracle Fundamentals is that if the CBO fails at finding the correct plan, you need to take over the job of the CBO and "layer-in" the hints - an average of two hints per table in the query. The reason is that one hint could lead to yet another bad and possibly even worse plan than the CBO would get unaided. If the CBO is wrong, you need to give it the whole plan, not just a nudge in the right direction.
