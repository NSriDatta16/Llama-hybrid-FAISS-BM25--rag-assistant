It means 2^(n/2) iterations through the loop. But note that L would not be a normal list here, but a hash table mapping h(m) to m . So each iteration would only need a constant number (O(1)) of comparisons in average, and there would be O(2^(n/2)) comparisons in total. If L had been a normal array or a linked list, then the number of comparisons would be much larger since you would need to search through the whole list each iteration. This would be a bad way to implement this algorithm though.
