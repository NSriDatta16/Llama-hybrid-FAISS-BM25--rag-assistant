Both models are identical and will lead to identical predicted probabilities. The apparent discrepancies between SPSS and R are due to different reference levels of the categorical predictors. As I explain here in detail, when using dummy contrasts, the coefficients for categorical predicators are differences between that level of the predictor and the chosen reference level. In logistic regression, the coefficients denote differences in log-odds. What level of the categorical predictor serves as reference level is arbitrary and different choices will lead to identical models, albeit with different coefficients. In R , the first level of the categorical predictor is taken as the reference level. In your case, this is n for predictor and A for var_to_control_for . Hence, the coefficients that R produces are the differences in log-odds between p and the reference level n and between B and A for predictor and var_to_control_for , respectively. In R, you can change the reference level with relevel (see my other answer for an example). In SPSS, you can chose the first level as reference level by adding a (1) to Indicator in the syntax. If you omit this, the last level is taken as reference. In summary, to get identical outputs, you need to chose the same reference levels for both predictors in both R and SPSS. Hence, the following syntax for SPSS will do just that: LOGISTIC REGRESSION VARIABLES outcome /METHOD=ENTER var_to_control_for predictor /CONTRAST (var_to_control_for)=Indicator(1) /CONTRAST (predictor)=Indicator(1) /CRITERIA=PIN(.05) POUT(.10) ITERATE(20) CUT(.5). Here is the corresponding output: As you can see, the coefficients and odds ratios are now identical to R's output. Edit In order to replicate the predicted probabilities of ggemmeans , use the GENLIN procedure and the EMMEANS option (note that these probabilities are averaged over the levels of var_to_control_for ): GENLIN outcome (REFERENCE=FIRST) BY var_to_control_for predictor (ORDER=DESCENDING) /MODEL var_to_control_for predictor INTERCEPT=YES DISTRIBUTION=BINOMIAL LINK=LOGIT /CRITERIA METHOD=FISHER(1) SCALE=1 COVB=MODEL MAXITERATIONS=100 MAXSTEPHALVING=5 PCONVERGE=1E-006(ABSOLUTE) SINGULAR=1E-012 ANALYSISTYPE=3(WALD) CILEVEL=95 CITYPE=WALD LIKELIHOOD=FULL /MISSING CLASSMISSING=EXCLUDE /EMMEANS SCALE = ORIGINAL /EMMEANS TABLES = predictor /PRINT CPS DESCRIPTIVES MODELINFO FIT SUMMARY SOLUTION.
