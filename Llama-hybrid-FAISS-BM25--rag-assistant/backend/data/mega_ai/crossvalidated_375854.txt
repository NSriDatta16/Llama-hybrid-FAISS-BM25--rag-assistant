Class of Interest in supervised learning

The positive class in a binary classification problem, is usually the class of interest (e.g: fraud , spam , cancer ). Machine learning algorithms try to construct a classifier that can separate these two classes. Here, it does not matter what you call " positive " or " 1 " or " true "... Are there examples for problems/algorithms where it is important to define something like a class of interest in supervised learning?
