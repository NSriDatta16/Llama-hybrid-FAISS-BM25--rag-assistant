A credible interval is an interval that includes the true value of a parameter of interest with $100(1-\alpha)\%$ posterior probability. Credible intervals treat the interval as fixed and the parameter as random. They are a Bayesian concept. The frequentist analog of a credible interval is a confidence interval . Although they may seem superficially similar, they are quite distinct.
