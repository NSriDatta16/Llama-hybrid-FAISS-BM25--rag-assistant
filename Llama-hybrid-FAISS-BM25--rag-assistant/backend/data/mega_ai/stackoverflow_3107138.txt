Without seeing the actual code of the original or the new code I can't tell you if the new organization is properly designed code just by knowing the line count, method count, and file size. In C# I usually : Separate each class and interface into its own files. Static helper methods are grouped by function I usually separate files into folders by layers. Ex. GUI layer, Business Logic Layer, etc... Extension methods are separated by the class or interface they relate to or sometimes by function. Now, the new code could be broken up to follow a more object oriented design, but I can't tell without seeing the code.
