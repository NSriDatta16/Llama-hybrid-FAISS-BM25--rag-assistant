Does ROC assessment of a binomial classifier serve as a good performance measure given equal weights between positives and negatives?

My problem is that i have created four candidate models that I am comparing mainly via the following performance measures: F-measure , recall , precision , accuracy and visual ROC assessment . The problem is that as you see from the table, the SVM_linear_test performs the best given F-measure. This model corresponds to the blue line in the ROC chart. The red line in the ROC charts corresponds to the SVM_RBF_test as given the ROC chart this model performs the best. Having read a lot recently about performance measures on binomial classifiers I have not come across what is obvious in my example here. ROC does not take into account false positives and therefore in my case, a ROC assessment is not worth much. One can of course always debate if we would want to assign more weight to the positive class but in this case we leave this discussion out.
