Classification of Imbalanced and Streaming Time Series Data

I have a question about classification of time series . Data has two features and I want to classify it into 5 classes. We have a stream of data and new data is generated every 5 seconds. Moreover in some classes we have inadequate data for training so we have classification problem with imbalanced data. I want to classify new data using machine learning methods according to the pattern shown in the figures . What methods do you suggest?
