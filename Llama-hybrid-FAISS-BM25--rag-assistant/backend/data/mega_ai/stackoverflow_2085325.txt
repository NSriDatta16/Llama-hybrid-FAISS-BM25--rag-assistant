No, it doesn't. But It can cache when you call, and will show in dir after that. You could take a look this SO Thread , even in Win32, seems like need to parse PE Header. I think python need to do similar way. UPDATE : I found pefile read/write module written in python, there you can find exported entries. for entry in pe.DIRECTORY_ENTRY_IMPORT: print entry.dll for imp in entry.imports: print '\t', hex(imp.address), imp.name Output comdlg32.dll 0x10012A0L PageSetupDlgW 0x10012A4L FindTextW 0x10012A8L PrintDlgExW [snip] SHELL32.dll 0x1001154L DragFinish 0x1001158L DragQueryFileW imp.name will be the one you are looking for. You could use that name in ctypes like >>> ctypes.windll.comdlg32.PageSetupDlgW >>> ctypes.windll.comdlg32.FindTextW ...
