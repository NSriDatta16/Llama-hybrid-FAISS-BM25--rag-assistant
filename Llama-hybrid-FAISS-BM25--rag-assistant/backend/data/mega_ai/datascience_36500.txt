Representing similar states in reinforcement learning?

Let's say I'd like to design a Q learning algorithm that learns to play poker. The number of different possible States is very large, but a lot are very similar: for example, if the initial state having 10 spades, 4 hearts, 6 clubs on the table and holding King and Queen of hearts had already been visited, I would like it to affect the weights of similar states, like the same cards with different suits. How do I accomplish this?
