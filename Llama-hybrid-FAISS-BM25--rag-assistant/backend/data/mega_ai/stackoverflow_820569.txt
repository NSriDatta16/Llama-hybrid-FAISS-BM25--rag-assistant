Is there a Perl script to implement C++ Class get/set member functions?

I was reading this morning the book The Pragmatic Programmer Chapter 3 on Basic Tools every programmer should have and they mentioned Code Generation Tools. They mentioned one Perl script for C++ programs which helped automate the process of implementing the get/set() member functions for private data members. Does anyone know about such a script and where to find it? I've been unable to come up with the right google keywords to find it.
