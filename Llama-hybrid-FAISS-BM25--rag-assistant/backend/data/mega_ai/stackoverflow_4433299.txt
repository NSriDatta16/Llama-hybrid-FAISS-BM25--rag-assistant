I am working on something alot like this, but I am instead going to implement text encryption. I see you are suing lists for the client list... but I would say there is a better way of doing that. I am using a dictionary. if you are familiar with dictionaries, skip the next paragraph. Dicionaries can handle basicly 2 variables, and are defined using the {}. >>> stuff = {'a':'hello','b':'world'} >>> print stuff['a'] hello >>> print stuff['a'],stuff['b'] hello world so using this, you can can make a dictionary like {'username':'ipaddr'} this way you can make it so that both usernames and ips are all in one variable. If you want the end product like me, you will be making it so all the server does is repeat the message, and send it to everyone who is connected. then the server can just cycle through the usernames. as another note, I think the tcpsoc.listen(5) is how many people can beconnected at once... I think thats what i read somewhere. I have no idea why you would be having that error, but if you want to look at my halfway constucted code, you are more than welcome too. (ignore the import random, this is not yet used, but will be part of the encryption system) http://piratepad.net/PwQzdU0bkk
