Yes, you can use user stories for your functional requires. I do it all the time, and have been for years. In my opinion, it works really well, and better than other systems I have used. Would this approach work for larger clients? To make a gross generalization, no. They are going to have some system that use to define requirements, and likely its not user stories. If you come in with user stories, there is going to be a disconnect with the current practices, which you will have to work through. I have been successful using user stories with larger organizations, but it take a concerted effort, which both parties need to be committed to.
