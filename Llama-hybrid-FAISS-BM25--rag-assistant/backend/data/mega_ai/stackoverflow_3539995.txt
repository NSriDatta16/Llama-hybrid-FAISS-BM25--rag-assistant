Quartz.Net embedded into Asp.NET MVC2, not firing off jobs

I'm trying to get Quartz.net working by embedding into my .Net MVC2 application. I know this is not ideal, but I'm just trying to get it up and running before moving it over to a service. I can't get my jobs to fire off, but I think I'm configured correctly. In my Global.asax.cs: protected void Application_Start() { Quartz.IScheduler scheduler = BuildQuartzScheduler(); ... } And the method, taken straight from the tutorial: private IScheduler BuildQuartzScheduler() { // construct a scheduler factory ISchedulerFactory schedFact = new StdSchedulerFactory(); // get a scheduler IScheduler sched = schedFact.GetScheduler(); sched.Start(); // construct job info JobDetail jobDetail = new JobDetail("myJob", null, typeof(QuartzController)); // fire every hour Trigger trigger = TriggerUtils.MakeMinutelyTrigger(); // start on the next even hour trigger.StartTimeUtc = TriggerUtils.GetEvenMinuteDate(DateTime.UtcNow); trigger.Name = "myTrigger"; sched.ScheduleJob(jobDetail, trigger); return sched; } And the "controller:" public class QuartzController : IJob { public QuartzController() { } public void Execute(JobExecutionContext context) { throw new NotImplementedException(); } } Nothing ever gets fired. What's going on? I'm sure there must be a simple syntax mistake, but it is driving me crazy!
