If you are inserting the data in to SQL Server then you clearly have a dependency on that anyway. I would investigate scheduling using the SQL Agent. Depending on your processing requirements you may find you can do the whole lot using SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) which is well documented on how to schedule withing SQL Server. I know you mention you've already written this. But with SSIS / SQL Agent you get a level of monitoring 'for free' and you may find that it is little effort to replicate you current code. Also ongoing a DBA can maintain your code very easily without needing access to source code etc.
