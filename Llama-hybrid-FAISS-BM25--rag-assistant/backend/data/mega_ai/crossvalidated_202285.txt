How do 'money back if your horse places' bets not lose the bookies' money?

I'm one of those annual gamblers who bets only on Australia's biggest race, the Melbourne cup, so I know very little about gambling odds. Last year though several agencies had a deal in which you got your money back if you bet on a horse to win but it instead came second, third, or fourth. To the uninformed this seems like it'd high positive expected value: Imagine betting on a horse to win with odds of 3/1, for example, and odds to place (1-3) of 0.7/1 [so probability of placing 1-4 would be at least 65%] If you bet a dollar 1. 0.25 prob you win 3 2. 0.4 prob you get money back 3. 0.35 prob lose the dollar Average expected value = 40%. This seems wrong. How do they maintain their margin?
