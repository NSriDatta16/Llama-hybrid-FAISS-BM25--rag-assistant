Your problem is one of probabilistic multiclass classification. A classical statistical approach is multinomial logistic regression . There are also many machine learning approaches, like CARTs or Random Forests . (Multinomial) logistic regression automatically outputs conditional probabilities. For tree-based methods, you may need to specifically set a parameter. For instance, if you use the randomForest package in R, you need to apply predict.randomForest(...,type=prob) . Or use a dedicated implementation .
