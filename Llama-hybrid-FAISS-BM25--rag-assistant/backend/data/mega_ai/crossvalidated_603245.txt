Linear regression gives slightly better RMSE than the random forest regression's RMSE

RMSE of Random forest regression : 85.66 RMSE of linear regression : 85.62 I only have five features and around 3800 observations. I read that most of cases random forest gives better result than linear regression. But I got similar results for these two cases. When does linear regression give slightly better result? What can I exmaine more to find out the reason why linear regression gives slightly better RMSE?
