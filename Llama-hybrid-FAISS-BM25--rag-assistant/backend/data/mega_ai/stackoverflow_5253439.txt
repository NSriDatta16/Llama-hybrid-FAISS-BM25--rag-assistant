How to split string into only two parts with a given character in Ruby?

Our application is mining names from people using Twitter to login. Twitter is providing full names in a single string. Examples 1. "Froederick Frankenstien" 2. "Ludwig Van Beethoven" 3. "Anne Frank" I'd like to split the string into only two vars ( first and last ) based on the first " " (space) found. Example First Name Last Name 1 Froederick Frankenstein 2 Ludwig Van Beethoven 3 Anne Frank I'm familiar with String#split but I'm not sure how to only split once. The most Ruby-Wayâ„¢ (elegant) answer will be accepted.
