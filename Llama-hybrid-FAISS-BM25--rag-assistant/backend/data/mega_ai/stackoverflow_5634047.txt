It's really impossible to comment (cough) meaningfully on performance without testing. You're the only one in a reasonable position to do that. At the logical level, a comment about the data in a row should be stored with the row. Some dbms will move wide columns internally to a secondary storage area. This speeds up access to rows when you don't select the comment column (fewer physical reads), but it slows down access when you do select the comment column (reads from a different part of the internal data structures). You might not notice the difference unless you're selecting many thousands of rows out of millions of rows. (But, again, testing . . .)
