Usage of neural networks for predicting football matches

I've just started to examine the subject. Excuse me, if my questions sound stupid. I have some statistics of football matches (injuries, corner kicks, yellow cards) with time references (a certain minute of the match). I want to make the model of neural network, which would bind football match to one of the patterns, depending on the data provided. I have a few questions: How to create a data set with a time reference? How to normalize the data, should i use "Min-max normalization" or something else? What type of neural network architecture is optimal to solve this task?
