Why do we model noise in linear regression but not logistic regression?

The canonical probabilistic interpretation of linear regression is that $y$ is equal to $\theta^Tx$ , plus a Gaussian noise random variable $\epsilon$ . However, in standard logistic regression, we don't consider noise (e.g. random bit flips with probability $p$ ) of the label $y$ . Why is that?
