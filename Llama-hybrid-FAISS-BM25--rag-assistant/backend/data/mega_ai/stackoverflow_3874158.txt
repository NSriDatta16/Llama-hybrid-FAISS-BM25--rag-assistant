Detecting dead accounts and cleaning them from a SharePoint site

I've been asked to create a solution which detects the dead accounts and cleans it up from a SharePoint site. I found a code snippet here (in the comments) which checks each user against the AD and cleans up the account. But the LDAP details are hardcoded in the code. What happens if i want to detect it dynamically and check the dead accounts? Is there a more elegant solution to do this? Any ideas?
