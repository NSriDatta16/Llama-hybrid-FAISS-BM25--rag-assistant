How to predict future of time series 1 with time series 2 with AR(I)MA?

Hey guys i am new in this forum. I am also new into programming with R or Stata(and programming in total, but i really would like to learn it). Currently I am writing a thesis about whether its possible to predict the future of an index with the use of the google trend datas. My professor suggested me to learn R and built an AR(I)MA model in there. I watched some tutorials about using an ARIMA model in R but they were just for one time series. I couldnt find one with two time series. I am not sure if its allowed to post the youtube video in here(but if you want to see that tutorial let me know :D). So my question is if anybody has a good source where I can learn how to build up a good model for my thesis. I am thankful for everykind of help. best regards sense
