There are two possibilities: Take the usual $\hat\beta=(X^TX)^{-1}X^Ty$ as your coefficient estimates. Minimize $\sum (y_i-\hat p_i)^2$ square loss instead of $-\sum \bigg[y_i\log(\hat p_i)+(1-y_i)\log(1-\hat p_i) \bigg]$ negative log likelihood loss. ( $y_i$ is the $i$ -th observed binary $0/1$ outcome; $\hat p_i$ is the $i$ -th estimated probability of category $1$ .) That these are not equivalent might not be obvious, but they’re not. For the former, logistic regression also involves the nonlinear link function, so there is no reason to believe that the resulting coefficients are close to the right ones on the nonlinear logistic regression. I would encourage you to simulate some data; calculate coefficient estimates this way and using traditional logistic regression (maximum likelihood); and compare estimates. Contrary to what the book says, however, nothing will stop you from calculating such a $\hat\beta$ and asserting it as your estimate of the regression coefficients. (At the same time, a vector of all $1$ s is an estimate, even if a silly estimate.) For the latter, that involves the minimization of one of the good scoring-rules for a logistic regression, known as Brier score in this setting. That this is not the preferred method (due to the efficiency of the likelihood-based method) has not stopped people from using square loss. On Yann LeCun’s MNIST page , there is an example that uses square loss. 2-layer NN, 300 hidden units, mean square error EDIT I will do an R example demonstrating what happens when you estimate the logistic regression $\beta$ via $\hat\beta=(X^TX)^{-1}X^Ty$ . This simulation is based on another Cross Validated answer for how to simulate a logistic regression. set.seed(2022) N When you plot this, you see that the standard logistic regression gives close estimates of the true probability values, while the OLS-style estimates give awful estimates of the true probability values. Consequently, it isn't so much that you can't use the OLS-style $\hat\beta=(X^TX)^{-1}X^Ty$ , but that it is a terrible estimation method. If you prefer ggplot2 , you can use this code. d1
