Yes - the residuals overall in your Poisson distribution, are not Poisson distributed. They are only Poisson distributed conditional on the linear predictor. The DHARMa package implements something akin to your closing paragraphs. https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DHARMa/vignettes/DHARMa.html . It is very useful for assessing fit of GLMs with non-Gaussian errors. Given some fitted model, DHARMa simulates from the model for each $x_i$ . This gives the Poisson/whatever distribution conditional upon the linear predictor. Then, the conditional distribution for observation $i$ is compared to the actual observed data point $y_i$ . Specifically, this comparison the empirical cumulative distribution function evaluated at $y_i$ . For example, if $y_i = 5$ and 20% of the simulated conditional distribution is less than 5, the comparison value is 0.2 (this is the "DHARMa simulated residual"). The key theoretical result underpinning DHARMa, is that if your model is correct, then the simulated residuals will have a $\text{Uniform}(0,1)$ distribution. This gets around pesky issues like the variance increasing with the mean, which is the case for models like Poisson, Negative Binomial etc. Usually with OLS, you would use a normal quantile-quantile plot to assess the residuals. With DHARMa, you use a uniform quantile plot to assess the residuals. But the philosophy behind it is the same. The vignette, which I linked above, has a number of worked examples, links, and more theory which I strongly suggest reading - it's very good.
