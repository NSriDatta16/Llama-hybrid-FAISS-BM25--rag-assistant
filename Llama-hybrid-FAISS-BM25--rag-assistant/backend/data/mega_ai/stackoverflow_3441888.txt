i was occasionally able to break the resize functionality, where i would get the "not allowed" cursor and the box would not dynamically resize, although when i let go of the mouse it would resize appropriately and stay that way. adding return false; to the end of the resize function seems to stop the browser from trying to select/drag the resize bar. i'm working in a limited environment so i can only test with ie8 (and ie8 in ie7 mode). i had to replace your calls to $() with $(document) to get this working. i would also recommend moving the mousemove binding out of the mousedown handler, and removing the unbinding call.
