How do I detect state change in multivariate time series?

I have a multivariate time series . For each row in the data we have the values of inputs and a label for stability (0 or 1 ) . What are the algorithms that can detect the stability for an unlabelled time series, using this historical data. The sample data looks like this Is this a machine learning problem or a time series classification problem.What are the methods that can be used and how?
