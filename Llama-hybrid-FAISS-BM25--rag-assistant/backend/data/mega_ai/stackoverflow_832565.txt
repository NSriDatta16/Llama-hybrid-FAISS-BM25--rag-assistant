Vertex and Pixel shaders provide different functions within the graphics pipeline. Vertex shaders take and process vertex-related data (positions, normals, texcoords). Pixel (or more accurately, Fragment) shaders take values interpolated from those processed in the Vertex shader and generate pixel fragments. Most of the "cool" stuff is done in pixel shaders. This is where things like texture lookup and lighting take place.
