Very simply, table based layouts were the old way of organising the position of content and divs are the newer way. Think of them as being invisible rectangles (unless you choose to make them visible) that hold content and both have their pros and cons in how you are able to position them. You can position divs into nearly every situation a table can be positioned into, whereas there's a lot of positioning you can do with divs that you can't do with tables. This is one reasons why using tables to layout your page is discouraged. Tables haven't completely disappeared. They're still very good at (funnily enough) table-based display of information or statistics. Think excel-type layouts.
