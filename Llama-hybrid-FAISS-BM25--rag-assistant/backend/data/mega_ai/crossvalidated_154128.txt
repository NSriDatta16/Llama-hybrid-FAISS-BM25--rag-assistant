Compare two t-statistics

In a nutshell: I have performed two t-tests (A und B, each two-samples/paired). Both found significant differences. Can I tell, whether the difference observed in comparison A is significantly larger then the difference observed in comparison B? Background I'd like to test a hypothesis รก la "Measure D is more similar to measure E than to measure F". Previously, hypotheses were tested, whether the three measures yield different results. Therefore, t-tests D/E and D/F have already been presented. Now, to test the hypothesis stated above, I'd like to run a test on the t-statistics derived from the previous t-tests. I know that there is a test to compare correlation coefficients (e.g., http://vassarstats.net/rdiff.html ), but I do not understand the idea behind sufficiently to make a transfer to t-statistics... And... If there is a more elegant way thana t-test to test measures for differences - or to test if one difference is larger than another - please let me know, as well. Thanks!
