The segment blocks are better, just make sure you give the user an easy way to set them. Click and drag is good. Any other system (like ranges) is going to be really annoying when you cross the midnight boundary. As for how you store them, in C++ bitfields would probably be best. In most other languages, and array might be better (lots of wasted space, but would run faster and be easier to comprehend).
