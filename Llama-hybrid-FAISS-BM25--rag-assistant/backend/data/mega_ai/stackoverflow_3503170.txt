Writing proper validation errors?

Update : Gutted entire question with more thorough description Ok same question with different names. In my model, I do validate the presence of. class QuickFact But if either is blank, it errors out with : Missing template organizations/_quick_fact_fields.erb Here's the catch. I have a nested form model with dynamically addable parts to it. As followed from here : http://railscasts.com/episodes/197-nested-model-form-part-2 That is what generates and calls the _quick_fact_fields.erb . But that works perfectly and is located within quick_facts/_quick_fact_fields.html.haml Update: My Controller Code organizations_controller.rb def update if @organization.update_attributes(params[:organization]) .. elsif params[:organization][:quick_facts_attributes] flash[:notice] = 'QuickFacts successfully updated.' redirect_to organization_quick_facts_url(@organization) else flash[:notice] = 'Organization was successfully updated.' redirect_to :action => 'edit' end else # re-render last form .. elsif params[:organization][:quick_facts_attributes] render :template => "quick_facts/index" else render :action => 'edit' end end end
