Visual C# WPF, customizing the uniform grid component

I'm trying to use the Uniform grid control to organize several buttons (to be specific it is a calculator, and I'm trying to create the buttons from my numberpad) I think the uniform grid is what I want to use to organize my buttons, but I can't seem to figure out how to make a button "span" multiple rows. For example the + button on most numberpads span across 2 rows. How would I do this with the uniform grid? or should I be using something else? I'm using visual studio 2008, a visual c# WPF project.
