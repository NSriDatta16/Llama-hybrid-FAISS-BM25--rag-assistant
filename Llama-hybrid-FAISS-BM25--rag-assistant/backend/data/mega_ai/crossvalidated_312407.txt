I agree with the answers by Stephan and the comment by Rob (humbly). My own experience with (S)AR/I/MA(x) is not great, probably due to a lack of understanding. Perhaps an interesting avenue of exploration for you, as it is for me, is looking into Bayesian (structural) methods, in particular it may be worth experimenting with https://facebook.github.io/prophet/ . Allthough Prophet reportedly works well for specific usecases (internet traffic), there are some interesting ideas, and the library might be an effective low-barrier entry into Bayesian (structural) methods for you.
