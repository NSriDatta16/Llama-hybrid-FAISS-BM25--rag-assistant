Simply by using Q-Learning. You store the last N input- and output-vectors and on reward/punishment just just train the network by BP on the stored input- and output-vectors. The sign of the learning rate is adjusted to the type of reward/punishment (+ or -) and the amplitude is dependent on the strength of reward/punishment and how far the input/output-vectors lie in the past (see Q-Learning).
