So the question asks what model can you use to put texts into topic categories in a unsupervised way. The main model that we use for this sort of task is Latent Dirichelt Allocation (LDA) ( https://programmerbackpack.com/latent-dirichlet-allocation-for-topic-modelling-explained-algorithm-and-python-scikit-learn-implementation/ ) Also, there is another method you could try, which is to convert texts into document embedding using a Doc2Vec ( https://medium.com/wisio/a-gentle-introduction-to-doc2vec-db3e8c0cce5e ) model, which will convert the text into an n dimensional vector. From these document embedding you could use any form of clustering (KNN or Agglomerative Clustering) to cluster the texts into topics.
