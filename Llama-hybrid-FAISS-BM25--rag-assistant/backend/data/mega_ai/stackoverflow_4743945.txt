Code coverage tool visual studio 2010 c++

does any know how to do some unit testing in c++ with the code coverage results working in visual studio 2010, I have looked for some answers everywhere. I want to keep the project I am testing and the testing project separate. Using a project the outputs a static lib is not a solution as the code coverage tool in VS 2010 can't put instrumentation code inside of the lib. Ive tried dll as the project to be tested, but then that cant link properly with test created due to the CLR:safe parameter being turned on for tests. Any ideas people? Or are MS just incapable of making a c++ code coverage tool.
