UltraGrid uses the concept of "Bands" to store hierarchical data. Your Level 1 is one band, your Level 2 is another. Here's where it gets tricky: your Level 3 is actually multiple bands depending on how many dynamic types you have of Level 2 items. If you're using a DataSet/DataTable as the data source, each DataTable corresponds to a Band, this is simply: 1 DataTable for Level 1 1 DataTable for Level 2 (with a DataRelation back to DataTable 1) N DataTables for Level 3, each with it's own columns, and each having a DataRelation back to DataTable 2 HTH.
