Log-Normalization of skewed data before feeding to neural network models ( autoencoders)

If your input data has few columns that are extremely skewed, It is well known that one would log normalize ( take log and then normalize or standardize) the data before passing to regression techniques. Would the same be advisable while using deep learning networks (more specifically auto-encoders for outlier detection) Another variation being - does it make sense to give both the original variable and the log normalized variable to multivariate autoencoders?
