$r^2$ using Robust Regression

I am interested in measure of quality of robust regression. How should I calculate it? It is clear that $r^2$ of robust regression should be smaller than $r^2$ OLS regression. Even if OLS is totally wrong and robust is right. The question is: which feature from the set is the best predictor for the response, using robust regression as a predictive model? I know that there are several clear outliers (leverage and "out-of-prediction-interval" points). The types of regression that I'm interested in: 1) regression that uses loss function (such as MM or M), 2) median regression (Theil-Sen).
