what is the influence of the specific statistical model selection in a practical project

I hope this is the right place to ask this question. But if it is not, please feel free to migrate. There is a famous quote, which is like "all models are wrong, but a few are useful". So, I was just wondering, what is the influence of the model selection in a practical project? For instance, suppose we have two models, one is statistically more precise than the other one. So, the more preciser one should be used instead of the not so precise one? Is this true? Many thanks for your time and attention.
