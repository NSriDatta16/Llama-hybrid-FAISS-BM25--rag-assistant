That´s a big task for one person. I can suggest you only some books related to 1) and 3). If you want to analyse your data in R a good reference is Applied Spatial Data Analysis with R and the sp package . On the book´s webpage you can find sample data and the code used thorughout the book. Another books are: Spatial Data Analysis in Ecology and Agriculture using R , a free book A Practical Guide to Geostatistical Mapping , or Displaying time series, spatial and space-time data with R . If you will work with rasters in R, than there is a raster package . Or you can do it in GIS software, for example ArcGIS or SAGA GIS, and check the GIS Stackexchange My answer did not cover the time series analysis though...try the Quick R page.
