Confusion around logistic regression and the logistic distribution

I feel like this is may be obvious, given similar questions and the responses given on this site. I'm still unclear as to the underlying latent variable specification with logistic regression though. When estimating parameters in a logistic regression, I assumed that we define a model in terms of independent variables and coefficients. This model is transformed with the logit link function and entered as p in the joint product of Bernoulli pdfs, from which MLE is applied to estimate parameters. I have been reading that there is an underlying latent variable that is defined as $$y_i=x_i*beta+epsilon_i$$ Where epsilon has a logistic distribution and individual dependent variable Y is Y=1 when y>0 and Y=0 when y Why do we need this? Why does epsilon have a logistic distribution Why Y=1 when y>0 and vice versa
