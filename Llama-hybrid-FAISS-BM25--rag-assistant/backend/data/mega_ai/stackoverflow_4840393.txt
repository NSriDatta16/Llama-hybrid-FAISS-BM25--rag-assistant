Since I recently gave the relevant RFC a closer look: HTTP 1.1 saw the inclusion of an additional request header for that kind of scenario Expect: 100-Continue This tells the Server to check the request headers and come back with either a "OK, you can now start sending me the actual content" or a "Sorry, whatever you intend to POST to me, I won't be able to deal with it" - response (for the more precise technicalities, see the HTTP 1.1 RFC ) However, this does not solve my scenario, since typical user agents (Firefox 3.6, IE 8) do not make use of this feature when POSTing multipart/form-data. A hand-grown helper applicaiton, however, might want to make use of this feature.
