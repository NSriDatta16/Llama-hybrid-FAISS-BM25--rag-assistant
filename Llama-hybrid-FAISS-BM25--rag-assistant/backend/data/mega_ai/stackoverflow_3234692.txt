Show item of the day

I am looking to create a function that gets me a random item from a mySQL table, but let's me keep the returned as the "item of the day". In other words, the item that was "the item of the day" yesterday should not be shown again until all other items have been shown as item of the day. Any suggestions on how to do this in an elegant way? Thanks
