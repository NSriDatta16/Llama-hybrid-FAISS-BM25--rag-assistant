Yes, that is the standard approach to convert categorical variables for fitting a model. In this case it would be used to train a neural network. So each category of a categorical variable is represented as a separate vector. Note that you do not need to do this for binary variables such as Male/Female as the presence of one category implies absence of the other category, so instead of using a variable such as Gender = Male/Female ; you could convert it into a variable called is_female = 0/1 . If this dataset is used to fit a regression model, the proper nomenclature should be multiple linear regression.
