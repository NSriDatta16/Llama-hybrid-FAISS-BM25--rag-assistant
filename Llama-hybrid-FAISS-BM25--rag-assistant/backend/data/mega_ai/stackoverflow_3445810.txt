First, it's a string: var arbitrary = ' \nSomething This ... '; Now jQuery turns it into an unattached DOM fragment, applying its internal .clean() method to strip away things like the extra , , etc. var $frag = $( arbitrary ); You can manipulate this with jQuery functions, even if it's still a fragment: alert( $frag.filter('p').get() ); // says " This " Or of course just get the text content as in your question: alert( $frag.text() ); // includes "This" in my contrived example // along with line breaks and other text, etc You can also later attach the fragment to the DOM: $('div#something_real').append( $frag ); Where possible, it's often a good strategy to do complicated manipulation on fragments while they're unattached, and then slip them into the "real" page when you're done.
