I have written a proof that for the general case involving exponential growth, the CLT cannot hold and in most cases, no admissible non-Bayesian estimator exists. This includes stocks, cancer growth and a number of applications in physics. I have also derived the general rules for use in those cases. The historic use of Gaussian models, in particular, came out of punch card and slide rule computing. I would not agree with you that we should assume the CLT does not hold, but rather more time should be spent investigating what does hold and why. For exponential growth, excluding some interesting special cases, all distributions are some transformation of the Cauchy distribution. It will require some retraining because not all axiomatic systems of probability will support the mathematics required. It is one of the unusual cases where your axioms determine your outcome. Where the axioms do not support it, you can prove no solution can exist. One of the peculiar results of this is that fundamental concepts like the capital asset pricing model lead to a mathematical contradiction under certain axiom systems and can be proven to be without a solution in others. In those systems, it is a valid model that cannot be solved. You can view the relevant papers at https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=1541471 Any claim that is important has been tested empirically against the population of data available. I am hoping to add a conjecture by the end of summer that there is a branch of stochastic calculus that has not been noticed to exist by anyone. I can solve the simple cases but mathematicians and statisticians will need to go do a serious look at the boundaries. The paper on distributions is under revisions and I hope to have a new, complete version in a week or two.
