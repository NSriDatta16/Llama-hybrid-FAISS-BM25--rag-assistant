How can dragonfiresdk be so sure to be appstore compliant?

How dragonfiresdk works internally as It allows to develop on Windows ? As Apple rules seem harsh about porting code how can dragonforesdk be so sure to be compliant ? Why aren't there any other solutions for developping iphone on Windows then or are there ? Seems like a mystery to everybody ... Update: as Brad Larson asked, I'm curious to know the answer too: If the application is compiled on a Mac, how does this help you develop using only Windows? A Mac is still required for compilation / codesigning ?
