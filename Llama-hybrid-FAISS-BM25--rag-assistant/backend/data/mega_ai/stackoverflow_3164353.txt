image uploading from android application to server using c# web service

I want to upload image to IIS server using c# web service. I have written the web method for this as follows: [WebMethod] public string UploadFile(byte[] f, string fileName) { try { MemoryStream ms = new MemoryStream(f); FileStream fs = new FileStream(System.Web.Hosting.HostingEnvironment.MapPath ("~/TransientStorage/") +fileName, FileMode.Create); ms.WriteTo(fs); ms.Close(); fs.Close(); fs.Dispose(); return "OK"; } catch (Exception ex) { // return the error message if the operation fails return ex.Message.ToString(); } } Here the web method is taking argument as byte[] .I have convert the sdcard image to byte[] but when i am passing it as an URL paramete it is not working .I have also tried by converting the byte[] array to base64 strig still it is not working. Can any one tell me how to upload image to IIS server using c# web service.
