BEGIN red faced answer to my own question Ok, I originally dragged the files into my project root, then went out to the file system and deleted those files and dragged the files into my project in the Model folder. for some reason the project was still looking for the files that were in my project root. Because I deleted them on the file system I assume that Studio didn't get the memo and was still trying to compile them. So happy that my first post on StackOverflow was a complete fustercluck. END red faced answer to my own question
