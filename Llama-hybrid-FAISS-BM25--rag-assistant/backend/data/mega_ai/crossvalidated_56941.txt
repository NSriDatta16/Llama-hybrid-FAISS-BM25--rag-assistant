To answer the question: Can the correlation of returns be negative, if both had positive returns? Yes. The correlation coefficient can be understood as a normalized covariance, right? So the covariance is a measure of how both values move in relation to their expected value (here - the mean). So it depends on this if the covariance is positive or negative. To put it differently with $X$ as market return and $Y$ as portfolio return. $$V(X,Y) = E[ (X-E[X]) (Y-E[Y] ]$$ In your case you probably used this estimator $$ \hat{V}(X,Y)=\frac{1}{N-1}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\left( x_{i}-\bar{x} \right) \left( y_{i}-\bar{y} \right)$$ Where $\bar{x}$ and $\bar{y}$ are the respective arithmetic means. Now obviously if both have positive returns, yet one portfolio deviates away below from its mean while the other deviates away above its mean, you get a negative number in that sum. So even though both might be positive in absolute values, it depends on where they are moving. Finally, if your covariance is negative, well what is your correlation coeefficient? As for your second question: Please detail exactly how you calculated the time series and normalization because I can't tell you if what you did in either case was correct. Best post the formulas to be sure.
