The chilling reality is, statisticians are not recognized as data scientists . So while getting a degree in statistics will definitely equip you well for data science, you may not get as many opportunities as you'd think the name of the major would imply. I don't have the canned answers for you (and nobody does... except Hal Varian, and you may want to talk to him directly -- if you can't Google his contact info, you should not be considering a career in data science :) ). My two cents for you to consider would be: A program in computer science, with a minor in statistics. A computing degree per se will not equip you well in data science, in my opinion, as what statisticians see in the "data-science-without-statistics" is that data scientists end up reinventing statistics. Hence you will be better off learning it properly to begin with. A Professional Science Master program in analytics ( Rutgers , NC State -- not that I endorse these, just give you examples). The Professional Science Master's programs combine about 60% of the credit hours from science curriculum with about 40% from the business curriculum. I wish I had an option of taking this degree when I was in grad school. Of course this assumes that you can afford it -- you can go to most Ph.D. programs and get full financial support, but you will have to pay for a Master's degree yourself. Browse Academia.SE for more pointers as to how you can structure your post-graduate training, and what kind of degree you might or might not want. Interestingly, Data Science.SE is currently (Nov 2014) in a beta status, and it is hardly a happy healthy beta .
