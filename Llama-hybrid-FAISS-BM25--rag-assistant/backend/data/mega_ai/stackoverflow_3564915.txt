The ArrayList is an abstraction for an automatically growable List of elements. You rarely need to know its capacity. Consider Effective Java 2nd Edition, Item 52: Refer to objects by their interfaces . As much as practical, you should not even care if it's an ArrayList or a LinkedList ; it's just a List . That said, these methods may be of interest to you: ArrayList(int initialCapacity) Constructs an empty list with the specified initial capacity. void ensureCapacity(int minCapacity) Increases the capacity of this ArrayList instance, if necessary, to ensure that it can hold at least the number of elements specified by the minimum capacity argument. void trimToSize() Trims the capacity of this ArrayList instance to be the list's current size. An application can use this operation to minimize the storage of an ArrayList instance.
