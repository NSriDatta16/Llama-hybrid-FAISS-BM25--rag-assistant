Goodness of forecast in R (Time Series)

I used two different methods to forecast a time series data. The first one used is HoltWinters with Beta and Gamma as FALSE, since I don't see any trend or seasonality in the plot. Below is the result from Box.test Box.test(fore.holt.stat$residuals, type="Ljung-Box", lag=10) Box-Ljung test data: fore.holt.stat$residuals X-squared = 10.691, df = 10, p-value = 0.3821 The p-value is 0.3821 I used auto.arima on the data and below is the result Box.test(fore.arima$residuals, type="Ljung-Box", lag=10) Box-Ljung test data: fore.arima$residuals X-squared = 14.724, df = 10, p-value = 0.1425 The p-value is 0.14 Question 1 : Can I say that the first model is better since I have a higher p-vale? Below are few other observations : Model 1: accuracy(fore.holt.stat) ME RMSE MAE MPE MAPE MASE ACF1 Training set 424.9864 10275.55 7930.602 0.8782302 9.251837 0.766108 0.02142331 Model 2: accuracy(fore.arima) ME RMSE MAE MPE MAPE MASE ACF1 Training set 284.5242 7243.413 5371.42 -0.1874984 6.036736 0.5183941 0.0100049 Question 2 : Which of the model is correct based on the accuracy function output? In both the models, the p-value is high, but the mean of errors is not close to zero.
