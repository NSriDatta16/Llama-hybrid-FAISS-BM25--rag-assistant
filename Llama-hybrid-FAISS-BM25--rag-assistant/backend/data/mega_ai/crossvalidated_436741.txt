What does residual mean in the context of minimizing a function?

equation 1.2 in PRML: pattern recognition and machine learning denotes the sum of the squares of the errors between the predictions $y(x_n,w)$ and the corresponding target values $t_n$ . $w^*$ denotes a unique solution for the error function above. page 6 of that book says For each choice of M, we can then evaluate the residual value of E( $w^*$ ) given by (1.2) for the training data is residual a math term or machine learning term? what does residual here mean? I've searched differentiate residual , the result is more confusing. could someone please give some explanation about residual in this case (equation 1.2) please provide a solid reference, such as a textbook, for the definition of residual.
