Thank you very much for this question. Now I have updated the get_pc_space() function based on this question. Now it has the ability to produce a two dimensional PC space even for a small collection of time series (less than 14 time series). The main objective of the oddstream framework (as explained here https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10618600.2019.1617160?journalCode=ucgs20 ) is to detect anomalous time series within a “large” collection of streaming time series. In our previous implementation of oddstream package there was an additional assumption that the number of time series in the large collection of time series is greater than the number of features ( 14 in the current oddstream package implementation). get_pc_space() function was developed as a part of this framework. Therefore in the previous implementation, there should be at least 14 number of time series in order to be able to apply the get_pc_space() to the features matrix. Now I have updated the get_pc_space() function (in the GitHub version of this package) ( https://github.com/pridiltal/oddstream/blob/master/R/get_pc_space.R ) such that it can deal with small collection of time series (less than 14 time series)).
