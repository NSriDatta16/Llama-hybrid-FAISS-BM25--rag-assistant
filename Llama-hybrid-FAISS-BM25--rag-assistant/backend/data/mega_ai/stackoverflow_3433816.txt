By the way...if anyone is interested...I found a nice elegant solution that is a jQuery plugin that is SOOO nice. It literally is one line of jQuery, a minified js plugin, along with a simple class name on the input. http://labs.thesedays.com/projects/jquery/clearfield/ It's the most beautiful thing I have discovered, next to 'Placeholder' in html.
