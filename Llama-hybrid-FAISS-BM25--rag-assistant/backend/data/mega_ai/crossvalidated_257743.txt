The FFT is used to analyse periodic data. You use the Short Time Fourier Transform ( basically the FT over small segments of the time series) to analyse how the frequencies change over time ( eg in music). your plots are too low detail to zoom in, but I cannot imagine that a keystroke has any particular repetitive signal (eg that your fingers vibrate differently based on the key pressed) [ I have little imagination:) ]. I could imagine you look at frequency information to remove periodic noise (?you are on a train). another possible use would be to identify typing frequency and maybe stretch your signal accordingly ( ie to standardise your signal across typing speeds)
