Image Classification task with unevenly sized images

Generally speaking, what's the best way to approach an image classification task with unevenly sized images (e.g. example 1 has size 300x240, example 2 has size 240x224 etc.)? Ideally I would like the dimensions to be consistent across all images before commencing CNN training. I'm quite new to deep learning and would really appreciate any help. Thanks
