No it's not stupid to look at such analyses. Ecological comparisons are very important, but very limited in their implications. I would interpret findings very cautiously, especially the role of unmeasured confounding variables. Absolutely. If you are able to prespecify comparisons of key importance, this increases the power and credibility of any possible conclusions. Common sense. By leagues more than other approaches. The latter concern prediction but you are interested in inference. The choice of including other regions should be determined by the hypotheses you're trying to address. It depends if you're breaking existing regions down to granular levels or incorporating other regions not previously accounted for. Weighting may also be used to standardize some regions to an appropriate demographic composition like GDP (for economic) or population size. Simple regression models are identical approaches to t-tests and ANOVAs for continuous outcomes or contingency table test for logistic regression. In journal articles, I always say, "regression was performed" but in my thesis, I go into great depth about the type of regression, what was controlled for, and how the variables were coded. A thesis should be far more on the verbose side with how the model was fit. But yet, you should use regression... everything is regression! Way too complicated.
