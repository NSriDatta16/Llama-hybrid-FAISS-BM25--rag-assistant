Print NotesEmbeddedObject contents to browser

I have notes document with rich text field. In this RTF there is attachment placed. I would like to redirect (print) this attachment contents in Domino Agent accessed from web browser. I know I can save NotesEmbeddedObject on disk and then read it and post... but this does not satisfy myself. I am looking for in-memory solution.
