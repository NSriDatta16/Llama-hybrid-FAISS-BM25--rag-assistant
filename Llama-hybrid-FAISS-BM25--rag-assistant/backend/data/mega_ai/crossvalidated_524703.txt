I think this textbook is a good place to start: https://www.amazon.com/High-Dimensional-Statistics-Non-Asymptotic-Statistical-Probabilistic-ebook/dp/B07N46XF8B This is a fairly sophisticated text, I consider it a research-level introduction to many nonparametric methods and you can think of this as a more mathematically intense Elements of Statistical Learning . I'd also encourage you to take a look at sieve estimators which are quite a popular method in the econometrics literature but I think unfortunately overlooked in some other fields. These estimators are very useful as they nest many types of nonparametric estimation procedures from series estimators to neural networks and even plain old linear regression. There is actually a nice and easy youtube video explaining them: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqecz-DL-jI For a more sophisticated approach including inference, results see: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S157344120706076X
