How to induce blinks on JTextField labels continously?

Little background: I have a JTextField called reading. It is located on a JFrame panel. reading = new JTextField("waiting for entry"); What I am trying to do is amend the JTextField to where it creates a blinking effect. Appears, and then disappears. I want that to alert the user that it needs attention. So is there a way where I at a blink of an eye, its sometimes a blank string, sometimes showing 'waiting for entry': reading.setText(" "); reading.setText("Waiting for entry"); Any suggestions? In the same class I have : public void test(){ int delay = 300; //milliseconds ActionListener taskPerformer = new ActionListener() { public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent evt) { reading.setVisible(!reading.isVisible()); } }; Timer ok = new Timer(delay, taskPerformer); ok.start(); and let me show you my actionListener when reading gets the value: public class MyChangeAction implements ChangeListener{ public void stateChanged(ChangeEvent ce){ int value_MAP = slider.getValue(); String str = Integer.toString(value_MAP); reading.setVisible(true); // I just added this reading.setText(" MAP "+ str+" mm Hg "); }} So where do I type ok.stop(); or ok.cancel();
