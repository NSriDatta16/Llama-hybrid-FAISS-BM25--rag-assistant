Is there a standard syntax for encoding structure objects as HTTP GET request parameters?

Imagine we need to pass a a number structured objects to the web application - for instance, locale, layout settings and a definition of some query. This can be easily done with JSON or XML similar to the following fragment: en hide hide minimize water 2010-01-01 However, passing such structures with HTTP implies (roughly speaking) HTTP POST. Now assume we're limited to HTTP GET. Is there some kind of a standard solution for encoding structured data in HTTP GET request parameters? I can easily imagine something like: Locale=en& Layout.Block.header=hide& Layout.Block.footer=hide& Layout.Block.navigation=minimize& Query.What=water& Query.When.Start=2010-01-01 But what I'm looking for is a "standard" syntax, if there's any. ps. I'm surely aware of the problem with URL length. Please assume that it's not a problem in this case. pps. I'd be also greatful for links to key-value pair URL APIs (like Paypal NVP ) which you think to be worth taking a look at. ppps. We're certainly forseeing the callback URLs but we need HTTP GET key-value pairs as well. The question focuses on the latter.
