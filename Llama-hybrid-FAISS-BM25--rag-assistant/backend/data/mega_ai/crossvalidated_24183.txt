I recommend you to see the answer that JCWong gave in this question about a method called 'sparse clustering' developed by Robert Tibshirani & Daniela Witten. This method is able to select the only features that are really determining the differences between groups in the data. It is available as an R library called ' sparcl ' The article is: Witten DM and R Tibshirani (2010) A framework for feature selection in clustering. Journal of the American Statistical Association 105(490): 713-726.
