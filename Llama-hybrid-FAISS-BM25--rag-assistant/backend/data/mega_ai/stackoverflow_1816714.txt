Why would you want to train it online? Adding trainings instances would usually require to re-solve the quadratic programming problem associated with the SVM. A way to handle this is to train a SVM in batch mode, and when new data is available, check if these data points are in the [-1, +1] margin of the hyperplane. If so, retrain the SVM using all the old support vectors, and the new training data that falls in the margin. Of course, the results can be slightly different compared to batch training on all your data, as some points can be discarded that would be support vectors later on. So again, why do you want to perform online training of you SVM?
