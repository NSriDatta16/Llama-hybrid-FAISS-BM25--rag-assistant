Combining two time-series by averaging the data points

I would like to combine the forecasted and backcasted (viz. the predicted past values) of a time-series data set into one time-series by minimizing the Mean Squared Prediction Error. Say I have time series from 2001-2010 with a gap for the year 2007. I have been able to forecast 2007 using the 2001-2007 data (red line - called it $Y_f$) and to backcast using the 2008-2009 data (light blue line - call it $Y_b$). I would like to combine the data points of $Y_f$ and $Y_b$ into a imputed data point Y_i for each month. Ideally I would like to obtain the weight $w$ such that it minimizes the Mean Squared Prediction Error (MSPE) of $Y_i$. If this is not possible, how would I just find the average between the two time-series' data points? $$Y_i = w\cdot Y_f + (1-w)\cdot Y_b$$ As a quick example: tt_f I would like to get (just showing the averaging... Ideally minimizing the MSPE) tt_i Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec 2007 5.5 6.5 7.5 8.5 9.5 10.5 11.5 12.5 13.5 14.5 15.5 16.5
