Is that possible that I use an arbitrary prior distribution that is not conjugate to the likelihood and do mcmc sampling?

In Bayesian Statistics, we can use conjugate priors to the likelihood functions, then we can get the posterior distributions which are the same distributions as the prior distributions. I wonder that if we can use some arbitrary priors that are not conjugate to likelihood functions and run mcmc sampling methods to get the sample from the posterior distributions. Is it allowed to do? Or I can do it but nothing is interpretable? I am not sure if mcmc sampling methods are only allowed for the posterior distribution that are the same type of distribution as the prior distritbuion.
