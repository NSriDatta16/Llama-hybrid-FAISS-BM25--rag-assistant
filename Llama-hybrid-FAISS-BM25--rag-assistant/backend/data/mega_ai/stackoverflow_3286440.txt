You might consider writing a custom storage backend. This should be pluggable into django-storages, but I've never used the app and can't say for sure. You can find some guidance on writing custom storage backends here: http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/howto/custom-file-storage/ In your backend, you can use Python's subprocess command to run ffmgpeg to handle the mp3 conversion: http://docs.python.org/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.call
