Reparameterization trick for exponential distribution

Is there way to generate Exponential(lambda) distributed samples via a reparameterization trick? As in: Reparameterization trick for gamma distribution And also: How does the reparameterization trick for VAEs work and why is it important? My motivation is to compare Exponential priors with Normal priors, in a neural network, having the latter solved as per the second link. Though I have no experience in this field (and a general understanding), I am coding a project in MXNet where I compare different architectures in terms of predictive accuracy on IHDP data.
