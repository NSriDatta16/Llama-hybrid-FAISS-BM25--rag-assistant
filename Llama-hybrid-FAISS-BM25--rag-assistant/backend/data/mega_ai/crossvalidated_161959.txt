Weighting features prior to SVM

I'm building an object detector using HOG features and linear SVM. Some of the regions of the object are more "distinctive" so I would like to give more weight to the features extracted from those regions. (e.g. imagine we want to detect between mugs and glasses, then the most "distinctive" part is the mug's handle) How could I do this? For sure there should be a more intelligent way than just replicating the features of those "distinctive" regions.
