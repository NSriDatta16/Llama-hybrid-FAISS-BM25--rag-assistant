Why am I getting this error: No mapping specified for the following EntitySet/AssociationSet - Entity1?

I'm using Entity Framework 4 with the Model First approach. I started the project, designed the entities and generated the database. Everything worked fine. Then I needed to go back and add another entity to my model. However, as I drag an entity to the EDMX I get this error: Alright! I just need to map Entity1 to a table.. But hey! I'm using Model First approach, I expect it to create the table for me when I generate the DDL. How do I work around this error?
