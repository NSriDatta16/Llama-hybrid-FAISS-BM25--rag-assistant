ksvm uses the SMO algorithm , which solves a sequence of subproblems. Each involves a pair of variables, so there are $n(n-1)/2$ possible subproblems if $n$ is the number of samples. Usually, you won't have to solve every pair to reach the optimum. Each subproblem is selected because some of the involved variables violate the constraints. So, when you make the margin harder, you probably activate constraints on more points and end up solving more subproblems.
