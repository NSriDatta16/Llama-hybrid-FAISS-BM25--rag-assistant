I'd recommend you take a look at C5 . It is a wonderful generic collection library that offers observable collections as standard for all of its collections, including Added , Inserted , Removed , RemovedAt , Cleared , and Changed . Additionally, the C5 collections all espouse the "programming to interface" ideal. All of the interfaces provides expose the full functionality of the underlying implementationsâ€”which is lacking in the System.Collections.Generic namespace. Additionally, there is thorough documentation . I highly encourage you to check it out.
