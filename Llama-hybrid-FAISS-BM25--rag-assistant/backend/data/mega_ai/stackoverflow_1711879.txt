You can accomplish this within a DataTemplate if your Ellipse objects are represented by a class, and perhaps displayed in an ItemsControl . You would choose between LayoutTransform and RenderTransform based on the panel which held your Ellipse objects. I also recommend reviewing an article by Bea Stollnitz (ne√© Costa) which shows how to leverage a ListBox backed by a Canvas with DataBinding to produce offset objects . Very cool.
