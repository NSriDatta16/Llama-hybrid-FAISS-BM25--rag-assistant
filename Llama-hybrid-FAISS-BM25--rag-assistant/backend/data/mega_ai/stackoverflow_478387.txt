Change User Agent in UIWebView

I have a business need to be able to customize the UserAgent for an embedded UIWebView. (For instance, I'd like the server to respond differently if, say, a user is using one version of the app versus another.) Is it possible to customize the UserAgent in the existing UIWebView control the way it is, say, for an embedded IE browser in a Windows app?
