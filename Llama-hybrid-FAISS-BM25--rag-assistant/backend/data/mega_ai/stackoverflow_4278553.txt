Unable to add events after AJAX load using jQuery

I have a web page on which I use jQuery's AJAX to load new elements into a div. This part of my page works fine. I now want to add a similar event to these newly-added elements. To do this I planned to use jQuery's .live() method but nothing appears to happen. So I initially start with this Into .middle I asynchronously load markup that looks like this: Agent 1 Agent 2 Agent 3 When the page initially loads I use this script - my intention is to add a click handler for each of the .agent-name elements that are asynchronously added later. $j(document).ready(function () { $j(".agent-name").live("click", function() { var agentDetails = $j(".agent-details"); var loadingContent = ' '; agentDetails.show(); agentDetails.empty().html(loadingContent); var modalURL = $j(".agent-name").attr("href"); agentDetails.load(modalURL);*/ return false; }); }); The problem is that no events are being bound to the .agent-name elements. I've tried replacing all the inner script with a simple alert() so that I can see if any events are being bound to the .agent-name elements, and I can't get this alert() to display. So in other words, no events are being bound to my .agent-name elements. Even if I move the agent-name class to the list elements and change the jQuery to simply $j(".agent-name").live("click", function() { alert('1'); }); I still get nothing when I click on the elements. Can anyone explain why, or how I fix this so that I can late-bind events to elements created in an AJAX callback?
