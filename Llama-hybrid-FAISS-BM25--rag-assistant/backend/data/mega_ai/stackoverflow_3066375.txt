HTTPS is not another protocol, it is merely HTTP over an SSL/TLS- encrypted connection. Since that encryption works transparent to the user agent, to perform a HTTPS AJAX call on your own domain name, your site must be using HTTPS, otherwise you are not able to selectively choose HTTPS on a page you want to perform an AJAX call on that isn't already using HTTPS. So basically you can't call ' https://yourdomain.com/fetch ' if the page you're calling the AJAX request from isn't using HTTPS. If you want to perform an AJAX call to a HTTPS domain hosted somewhere else other than your domain, it is somewhat possible to do so (but only in Firefox 3.5+, Safari, Chrome and I think Opera), there is some interesting information about how to make cross-domain AJAX requests possible here: http://metajack.im/2010/01/19/crossdomain-ajax-for-xmpp-http-binding-made-easy/ - this method is not supported in IE (no surprise there).
