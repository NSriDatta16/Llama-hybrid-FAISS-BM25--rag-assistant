How is Y Normally Distributed in Linear Regression

I understand that $y_{i}$s are normally distributed because we assume that the residual is normally distributed which seems a decent assumption. Question : Does that mean $Y$ is also normally distributed? In other words, if I plot a histogram of $Y$ values will they have a unimodal Gaussian shape? Confusion : We generally apply linear regression on problems that involve predicting a continuous variable. Given the wide applicability of linear regression, I am finding it little difficult to believe that $Y$ tend to be normally distributed for all of them. I believe that in case of Logistic Regression, I can say that $Y$ will be Bernoulli distributed, and $y_{i}$s will have the same distribution. In other words, I can say that $Y$ has a Bernoulli distribution with $P(y_{i}=1) = \theta$
