jQuery Sparkle provides a clean elegant solution for this, by implementing a singleclick custom event. By doing this, you can use it just like any other event, so: $('#el').singleclick(function(){}); // or event $('#el').bind('singleclick', function(){}); It also provides custom events for the last and first clicks of a series of clicks. And the lastclick custom event actually passes the amount of clicks back! So you could do this! $('#el').lastclick(function(event,clicks){ if ( clicks === 3 ) alert('Tripple Click!'); }); You can find the appropriate demo showcasing what I've just said right here and the source code for defining the custom event right here . It's open source under the AGPL licence, so you can feel free to grab what you need out of it worry free! :-) It's also actively developed on a day to day basis so you will never be short on support. But most importantly it is a DRY Plugin/Effect Framework to allow you to develop plugins and extensions much more easily. So I hope this helps to achieve that goal!
