Selecting records in groups by date - possible?

I don't think there is an elegant way to do this, but here goes. Database contains 5000 records with timestamps of 2 years. I need to pull the records under each day of the year. So it looks like.. 09/09/2009 - record938, record2, record493 09/10/2009 - record260, record485, record610 ...etc I cannot use GROUP BY. There are duplicates and that's OK. I need to show them. Is this possible? PHP/MySQL? One way of doing it is looping through every day of the year and doing a query with "WHERE DAY(created_at)..." but obviously this isn't elegant. HOW can I do this? I posted this question before without a satisfactory answer (answer was what I just stated above)
