Pseudo-dice probability distribution

Given the following data, is there an algorithmic way to generate a probability distribution? Data: min, max, and average results of "die". Known Trend: results will always be weighted towards lower values, as the gulf between the average and max is greater than the gulf between the average and min (e.g. min=10, avg=19.4 max=42) Constraints: Results are restricted to integer values The probabilities of any two results should be as close to equal as possible. Allowances: Rough approximations (+/-0.5) of a given average are acceptable.
