Memory management practices and tools for Symbian C++

I have pretty much finished my first working Symbian application, but in my hastened learning have paid little attention to memory management and pushing to and cleaning up the stack? Could somebody please point me in the direction of some of the best practises to use here, and maybe some of the best leak detection/memory profiling tools. For example, if I grab a TDesC or a TPtrC16 inside a function, how do I then clean them up the best way, is it simply TPtrC16 temp = ... temp.CleanupClosePushL(); CleanupStack::PopAndDestroy() ..for everything? Thanks and please forgive me, I am a self confessed Symbian n00b.
