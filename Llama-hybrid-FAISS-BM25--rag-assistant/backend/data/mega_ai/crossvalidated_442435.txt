Simulate probit model using values of the latent variable

I am trying to simulate a probit model using a latent variable Z of the following form: \begin{aligned} y_{i} & = \begin{cases} 1 & \; \text{if } z_{i} > 0\\ 0 & \; \text{if } z_{i} \leq 0\\ \end{cases} \nonumber \\ z_{i} & = \boldsymbol{x}_{i} \boldsymbol{\beta} + \epsilon_{i} \\ \epsilon_{i} & \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1) \nonumber \\ \end{aligned} And given that \begin{aligned} \beta_1 =0.7; \\ \beta_2 =-0.4;\\ x_{1} & \sim \mathcal{N}(0,2);\\ x_{2} & \sim \mathcal{N}(0,3);\\ \end{aligned} The model I am using is based of on a modified version of the standard probit model (and is used in problems related to matching markets). However, Could someone explain the process for a standard probit model? I have referred the following links but did not understand the concept completely: a) https://rpubs.com/cakapourani/bayesian-binary-probit-model b) How to do simulation of Probit link? From link b for example, I understand the logic for y If I have to simulate the latent variable 'Z', how would this change (if at all. Are the two cases exactly the same?). I am not looking for a code as a solution, just the logic of starting from the latent values will do.
