Well, I started studying in Datacamp and I really recommend this Machine learning course it's very complete for new learners. Udacity has this Deep-learning course and it's a complement for the Coursera Machine learning course. It's very important to research a lot in other sources but there you can paint a path for your Data Science skills through these ones. I'm working and studying in Machine learning and I store the test projects in this repository , but is very important to have a little bit of knowledge of python and octave Already exist other languages and tools like R for test your data sets
