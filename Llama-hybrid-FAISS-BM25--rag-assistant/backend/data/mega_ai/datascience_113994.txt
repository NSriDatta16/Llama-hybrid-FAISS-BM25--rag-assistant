There are a couple of ways to solve this problem. You can stick with traditional algorithms like k-NN and play around with the distance metric. If you encode all your data with one-hot encoding you can use manhattan distance with k-NN and see if it solves your problem. Second, you could try playing around with the encoding scheme, there are better ways to encode categorical data https://contrib.scikit-learn.org/category_encoders/ is one of my favorite library for this task, it has many methods implemented. You could still use Random forest and end up building a decent model.
