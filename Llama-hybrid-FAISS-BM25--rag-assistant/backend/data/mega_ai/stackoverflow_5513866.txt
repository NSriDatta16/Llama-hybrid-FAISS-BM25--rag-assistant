This would be a perfect use for a functional index, but as I don't think MySQL has one of those, may I suggest the Full Text Searching in MySQL? http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/fulltext-search.html Specifically the boolean search: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/fulltext-boolean.html Also, if you're not familiar with stemming of words, that's powerful concept that would also help you increase the retrieval of your search. Hope that helps.
