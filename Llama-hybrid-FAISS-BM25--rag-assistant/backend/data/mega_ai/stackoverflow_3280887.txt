Since a ToolBar is an ItemsControl, you can try to use drag and drop frameworks to achieve what you want. http://bea.stollnitz.com/blog/?p=53 This is a great solution for handling data-bound items. You'll need to customize the code a bit if you're not using data binding to show your ToolBar items (although I suggest you do use data binding' it will make saving the customizations much simpler). When you hit "customize" in your app you can open a ListBox with available items (it must be in the same window for the above solution to work) and enable drag-and-drop from/to the ToolBars and ListBox using the attached property.
