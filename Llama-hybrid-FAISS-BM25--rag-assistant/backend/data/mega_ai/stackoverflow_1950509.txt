deploy multiple appengine apps to one appspot subdomain

I don't want to waste any more of my 10 appspot.com subdomains for test projects. Is there an elegant way to have multiple appengine apps, each to its own folder, e.g. xx.appspot.com/myapp1, xx.appspot.com/myapp2? I want the configuration to be identical or very close to the actual deployment configuration at a subdomain's root.
