It's for methodological purists who cannot bear to use boring 'ol frequentist stats with all their "horrible" inconsistencies (forget the fact that uninformative priors are often improper!). Seriously, though: An uninformed Bayesian posterior distribution will look an awful lot like a normalized likelihood function, whereas a frequentist would report the usual confidence interval. Since frequentist inference does not obey the likelihood "principle", the two answers may be quite different.
