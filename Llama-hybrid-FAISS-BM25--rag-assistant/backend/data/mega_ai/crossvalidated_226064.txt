There are two approaches - Treat it as a normal multivariate model (which I thought would reliably work with some feature engineering) Multilevel modelling - This method is specifically for nested variables. The data in this case has a hierarchical/nested relationship which in away violates the assumption of independence of multivariate approach. Please refer to this ppt for more detailed explanation & it's comparison with multivariate approach - http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~fdominic/teaching/bio656/lectures/1.intro.pdf Please refer to following paper for more mathematical details- http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/multi2.pdf Lastly the R implementation which also compares the results between multivariate & multilevel approach for nested variables- http://jaredknowles.com/journal/2013/11/25/getting-started-with-mixed-effect-models-in-r Please take this as just a 'reference for googling further :)' as I have not implemented this (and so have have not tried to summarize any link). I realized that one of my survey model can use this approach so Thank you for the question!
