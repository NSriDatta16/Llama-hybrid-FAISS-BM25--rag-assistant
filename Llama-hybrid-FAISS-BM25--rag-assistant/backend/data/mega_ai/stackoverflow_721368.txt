At first, Lucene isn't your friend here. (read only) Terracotta is to scale around at the Logical layer! Your problem seems not to be related to the processing logic. It's more around the Storage/Communication point. Identify your bottleneck! Benchmark the Storage/Logic/JMS processing time and overhead! Kill JMS issues with a good JMS framework (eg. ActiveMQ) and a good/tuned configuration. Maybe a distributed key=>value store is your friend. Try Project Voldemort ! If you like to stay at Hibernate and HSQL, check out the Hibernate 2nd level cache and connection pooling (c3po, container driven...)!
