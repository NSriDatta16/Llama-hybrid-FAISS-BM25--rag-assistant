How to read a space delimited file in C using fscanf with restrictions?

I have a file that has float numbers separated by spaces and I want to open the file and use the numbers inside this file for mathematical operations (e.g. average), how would I do this using only the following: fopen, fscanf, fclose, printf/scanf, pointers, if/else/switch/loops? (No arrays). The number of values in the space delimited file can be any amount.
