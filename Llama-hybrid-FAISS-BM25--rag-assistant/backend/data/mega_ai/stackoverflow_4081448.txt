If you're a beginner this will not be super easy as someone might think... I think you should do the following steps: build a query based on what user searched (beware of sql injections) fetch the results and organize them (an array should be fine) build the html code from the previous array In the third step you can use some regular expression to replace the user searched keywords with a bolded equivalent. str_replace could work too... I hope this helps... If you could provide your database structure maybe I can give you some more precise hints...
