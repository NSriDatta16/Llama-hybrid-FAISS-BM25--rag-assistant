Can't add files to my repository with Eclipse EGit

I use Eclipse (Helios) with PDT and EGit. I have a project without versioning, so I created a git repository for it by doing: Team -> Share Project When I try to add the files of my project to the repository: Team -> Add I get an exception: Failed to add resource to index Failed to add resource to index Exception caught during execution of add command When I add the files manually on the command line, everything is working fine. Any ideas? EDIT: The error eclipse gives is: Caused by: org.eclipse.jgit.errors.ObjectWritingException: Unable to create new object: Z:\eage_layout\.git\objects\60\f30dd232bd6ddaeb198fb11400c2613a072189 at org.eclipse.jgit.storage.file.ObjectDirectoryInserter.insert(ObjectDirectoryInserter.java:100) at org.eclipse.jgit.api.AddCommand.call(AddCommand.java:177) The code I'm running is located on a virtual machine running on CentOs. I'm working on a windows machine and using a samba share to get access to the code on the virtual machine. I've put the filesystem permissions on my .git directory to 777, but still it does not work.
