How does random forest determine the possible split values to assess?

I understand the basics of how decision trees / random forests are built, but one thing I still don't have a good answer for is how the putative split values are identified. So suppose we have mtry = 5, and at a given split we randomly select 5 variables to try. Does the algorithm try every possible split for each of these variables? I.e., if there are 100 unique split values for each variable, it assesses 5*100 = 500 different split values, calculating node impurity or variance for each one? And does this vary between CART and random forest?
