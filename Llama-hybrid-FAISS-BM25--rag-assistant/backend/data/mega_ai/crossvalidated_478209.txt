Quasi Poisson vs Negative Binomial

I read in several sources that the Quasi Poisson model and the Negative Binomial, should produce (on average) the same results. I tried a simple example and, although very close to each other, the numbers are not quite the same. Does this depends on the numerical algorithm or is there something else I am not considering? Thank you phi = 3 a = 1/50 b = 3 x = 1:100 mu = exp(a*x+b) y = rnbinom(n = length(mu), mu = mu, size = mu/(phi-1)) #random negbin generator glmQP = glm(y~x, family=quasipoisson) glmNB = glm.nb(y~x) glmQP glmNB glmQP $fitted.values glmNB$ fitted.values plot(x, y) lines(x, glmQP $fitted.values, col = "red") lines(x, glmNB$ fitted.values, col = "blue")
