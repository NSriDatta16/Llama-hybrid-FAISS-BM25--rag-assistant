Detecting household showing abnormal behavior

I am trying to figure out those household which have abnormal pattern in viewing one particular youtube channels. The data is of 12 weeks The households may fall into one of this category and many more other watched that channel for all 12 weeks for few minutes. watched few weeks initially for couple of minutes and now stopped watching watched rarely but when they watch they spend hours (may be abnormal behavior) didn't watch in the initial weeks but suddenly started watching spending long duration (abnormal behaviour) earlier watched for few minutes but now suddenly spend long hours (abnormal behavior) There are many more such cases and amongst them I need to identify who is showing abnormal behavior I have 1000 of such households spread across a particular region somewhat in the following format. The data is of 12 weeks starting from mid January to first week of April 2021. Each records shows how much time a household spends watching that particular channel. year household week Duration_in_minutes 2021 111 w1 20 2021 111 w2 5 2021 111 w3 60 2021 222 w2 2 2021 222 w3 1 2021 222 w4 60 2021 333 w9 1 2021 333 w10 2 2021 333 w11 10 2021 333 w12 5 Below household may be showing abnormal behavior as they started spending lot of time in the latter part. year household week Duration_in_minutes 2021 111 w1 5 2021 111 w2 5 2021 111 w3 8 2021 111 w4 2 2021 111 w5 1 2021 111 w6 6 2021 111 w7 12 2021 111 w8 4 2021 111 w9 250 2021 111 w110 300 What I did was understanding each household behavior with in and storing that information in a matric. For .e.g. checking the distribution of time spent variable in the form of boxplot to see if there is any outlier or not in his own behavior. what's the average time they spent each week and if the variance is very high or not? Are they watching the channel every week or not? With this approach in the end I am coming up with a metric having each household information and then visually inspecting is anyone showing abnormal behavior or not which I feel may not be the right way of doing it? Is there any way to figure out may be statistically or may be using some logic to come up with households which are showing abnormal behavior. Eagerly looking forward to some suggestion
