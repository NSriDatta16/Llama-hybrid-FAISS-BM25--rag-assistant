Don't mis-type your variable names. Seriously. Use short, easy, descriptive ones, use them locally, and don't rely on the global scope. If you're doing a larger project that isn't served well by this, use pylint, unit tests and coverage.py to make SURE your code does what you expect. Copied from a comment in one of the other threads : "‘strict vars’ is primarily intended to stop typoed references and missed-out ‘my’s from creating accidental globals (well, package variables in Perl terms). This can't happen in Python as bare assignments default to local declaration, and bare unassigned symbols result in an exception."
