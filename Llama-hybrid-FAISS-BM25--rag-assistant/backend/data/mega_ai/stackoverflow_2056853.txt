UISegmentedControl delegate/Touch Events

I have a UISegmentedControl that has six segments, I want them to call a method when the value changes, but also when each segment gets a UIControlEventTouchDragIn because I want a UILabel to show up with it's name when the person is trying to select something on it and drags their finger across the control, but the segmented control does not sen this call even when I drag into the thing. Please help. Maybe I need to create UIButtons over the control that call methods upon a drag in, but call the value changed method when they recieve a tap.
