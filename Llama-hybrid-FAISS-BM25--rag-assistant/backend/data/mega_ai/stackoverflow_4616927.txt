If you are using a VARCHAR field in MySQL, it will use either one or two bytes of overhead for a column, depending on whether the size of the field is less than or greater than 255. So, whether you use 30 or 50 or 255 characters, there is the same 1 byte overhead, and additional storage is only allocated for the characters you actually use. Given that, I would suggest using 255 unless you have some reason to limit it to fewer characters (e.g. your UI won't handle names that long correctly).
