You're right about the average. Using the expectation operator $E$, this is a consequence of the linearity of expectation. If we write $X$ for a random integer between one and ten drawn inclusively and uniformly (this is what the function call random.randint is modeling), then $$ E(X) = 1 \times 0.1 + 2 \times 0.1 + \cdots + 10 * 0.1 = 5.5 $$ You're asking about the sum of ten draws from $X$, so using the linearity of expectation $$ E \left( \sum_{i = 1}^{10} X \right) = \sum_{i = 1}^{10} E(X) = 10 E(X) = 5.5 $$ The variance calculation is a little more tricky, but goes through with a standard trick. For clarity, let's assign each of your ten draws to a different symbol, $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_{10}$ are the ten draws from $X$. Now recall that for any two random variables $A$ and $B$ $$ Var(A + B) = Var(A) + Var(B) + 2Cov(A, B) $$ The variance is not linear, its failure to be linear is summarized in the $Cov(A, B)$ term that appears. In your case, you need to know that when you call random.randint multiple times, the draws you get are independent . This is really important, the random number generator would be useless if this was not true. For $A$ and $B$ independent random variables $$ Cov(A, B) = 0 $$ Again, super important, must be independent or this step probably fails. Given all this, you can break down the variance $$ Var \left( \sum_{i = 1}^{10} X_i \right) = \sum_{i=1}^n Var(X_i) + 2 \sum_{i = 1}^n \sum_{j = 1}^n Cov(X_i, X_j) $$ You should play around with that until you convince yourself it's true. The index manipulation is a little weird until you get used to it. Anyway, in our situation, the covariance terms are zero, so this reduces to $$ Var \left( \sum_{i = 1}^{10} X_i \right) = \sum_{i=1}^{10} Var(X_i) $$ But each $X_i$ has the same distribution, so this is really just $$ Var \left( \sum_{i = 1}^{10} X_i \right) = \sum_{i=1}^n Var(X) = 10 Var(X) $$ And my guess is you can finish it off from here.
