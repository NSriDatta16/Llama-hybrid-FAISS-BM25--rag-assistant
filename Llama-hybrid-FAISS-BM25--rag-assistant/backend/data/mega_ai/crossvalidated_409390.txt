Enforcing Dirac delta-like Activations on a Neural Network

I am working on a custom neural network model including convolutional and dense layers. I intend to enforce outputs a certain dense layer to approximate a Dirac delta function (or any localized pulse). The position of the peak of this pulse will be informative about properties of a sample. This enforcement will be based on an extra term on the loss function. My question is whether there is a nice way for adding this constraint. My initial idea was to apply a strong L1 penalty but this resulted a sparse but distributed (not localized) layer output which does not answer the purpose.
