After using cross-validation with PCA regression, what weights are then used for the external test set?

Based on this answer , and following the Applied Predictive Modeling text, I am running the following 10-fold cross-validated PCR analysis: library(AppliedPredictiveModeling) # data library(caret) # train, cv library(pls) # pcr function data(solubility) # cross-validation setup set.seed(1) cv_index I have created 10 folds of my data, calculated 89 unsupervised components (independently for each fold), and then performed a regression. I know I can apply this to my test set to get predicted values using the following code: predict(PCR_Train, solTestXtrans) which I would then compare to solTestY . This is a bit "black-box-y" for me. Specifically, I am wondering what PCA coefficients should be used for my test set. Since I ran PCA for each of the 10 folds, the weights of the 10 sets should be different. I know it is not based on the test data, otherwise something like predict(PCR_Train, solTestXtrans[1, ]) would not return the same value? Do we just randomly take one of the folds, or does it combine the results somehow?
