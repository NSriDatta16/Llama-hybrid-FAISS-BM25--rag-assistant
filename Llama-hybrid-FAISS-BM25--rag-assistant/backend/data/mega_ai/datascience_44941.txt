What is the difference between PySpark's featuresCol, labelCol, predictionCol, and probabilityCol?

I am attempting to train a random forest classifier ( pyspark.ml.classification.RandomForestClassifier ) on a large dataset (~70gb). However, I am not sure what to send to each of featuresCol, labelCol, predictionCol, and probabilityCol. From the docs I gather that: featuresCol is a list of features from your dataframe labelCol is the target feature predictionCol is also the target feature, but generated by the model (not sure). Do I need to set this prior to training? probabilityCol is the probability of each class as a vector. Is this similar to sklearn's class_weight ? ie does the model account for a low diversity? If so how? Additionally, can I set an option for OOB_score? clf = RandomForestClassifier(featuresCol=feature_cols, labelCol=target_col, numTrees=300, MaxDepth=15, Impurity='gini', maxMemoryInMB=2**10) clf_t = clf.fit(train) y_train_pred = clf_t.transform(test) y_test_pred = clf_t.transform(test) Here's a link to the docs: https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.2.0/api/python/pyspark.ml.html#module-pyspark.ml.classification
