r to DALL-E 3. The model was later named as GPT Image 1 (gpt-image-1) and introduced to the API on April 23. It was made available to paid users, with the rollout to free users being delayed. The use of the feature was subsequently limited, with Sam Altman noting in a Tweet that "[their] GPUs were melting" from its unprecedented popularity. OpenAI later revealed that over 130 million users around the world created more than 700 million images with GPT Image 1 in just the first week⁠. Controversies Scarlett Johansson controversy As released, GPT-4o offered five voices: Breeze, Cove, Ember, Juniper, and Sky. A similarity between the voice of American actress Scarlett Johansson and Sky was quickly noticed. On May 14, Entertainment Weekly asked themselves whether this likeness was on purpose. On May 18, Johansson's husband, Colin Jost, joked about the similarity in a segment on Saturday Night Live. On May 20, 2024, OpenAI disabled the Sky voice, issuing a statement saying "We've heard questions about how we chose the voices in ChatGPT, especially Sky. We are working to pause the use of Sky while we address them." Scarlett Johansson starred in the 2013 sci-fi movie Her, playing Samantha, an artificially intelligent virtual assistant personified by a female voice. As part of the promotion leading up to the release of GPT-4o, Sam Altman on May 13 tweeted a single word: "her". OpenAI stated that each voice was based on the voice work of a hired actor. According to OpenAI, "Sky's voice is not an imitation of Scarlett Johansson but belongs to a different professional actress using her own natural speaking voice." CTO Mira Murati stated "I don't know about the voice. I actually had to go and listen to Scarlett Johansson's voice." OpenAI further stated the voice talent was recruited before reaching out to Johansson. On May 21, Johansson issued a statement explaining that OpenAI had repeatedly offered to make her a deal to gain permission to use her voice as early as nine months prior to release, a deal she rejected. She said she was "shocked, angered, and in disbelief that Mr. Altman would pursue a voice that sounded so eerily similar to mine that my closest friends and news outlets could not tell the difference." In the statement, Johansson also used the incident to draw attention to the lack of legal safeguards around the use of creative work to power leading AI tools, as her legal counsel demanded OpenAI detail the specifics of how the Sky voice was created. Observers noted similarities to how Johansson had previously sued and settled with The Walt Disney Company for breach of contract over the direct-to-streaming rollout of her Marvel film Black Widow, a settlement widely speculated to have netted her around $40M. Also on May 21, Shira Ovide at The Washington Post shared her list of "most bone-headed self-owns" by technology companies, with the decision to go ahead with a Johansson sound-alike voice despite her opposition and then denying the similarities ranking 6th. On May 24, Derek Robertson at Politico wrote about the "massive backlash", concluding that "appropriating the voice of one of the world's most famous movie stars — in reference [...] to a film that serves as a cautionary tale about over-reliance on AI — is unlikely to help shift the public back into [Sam Altman's] corner anytime soon." Studio Ghibli filter Upon the launch of GPT-4o's image generation (later named as GPT Image 1) in March 2025, photographs recreated in the style of Studio Ghibli films went viral. Sam Altman acknowledged the trend by changing his Twitter profile picture into a Studio Ghibli-inspired one. The White House's official Twitter account posted a Ghibli-style image mocking the arrest by immigration authorities of Virginia Basora-Gonzalez, a migrant previously deported after being convicted of fentanyl trafficking, which shows her crying as an immigration officer places her in handcuffs. North American distributor GKids responded to the trend in a
