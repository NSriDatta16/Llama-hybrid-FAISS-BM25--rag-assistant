There are no 'fragments' in TCP. It is a byte stream. If you want to read messages of a specific length, use DataInputStream.readFully(). If you want to read messages the same way you sent them you have to prefix a length word to each, or use a type-length-value protocol, or a self-describing protocol such as XML.
