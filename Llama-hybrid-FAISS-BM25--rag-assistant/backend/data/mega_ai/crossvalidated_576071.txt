Bayesian Model(Write out likelihood and prior)

I am working with a dataset regarding transmission rate for a disease spreading among cattle at different farms during a 5-month period. The goal is to estimate the transmission parameter $\alpha$ using a Bayesian model. I have a dataset with 12 entries(different farms), with the format $N$ $Z_1$ $Z_2$ Type 32 17 23 0 10 5 8 1 where $N$ is the amount of cows tested, $Z_1$ is the amount of infected cows before the period, $Z_2$ is the amount infected after, and the binary variable Type is determines if it is a dairy farm(0) or meat farm(1). I have assumed that the number of newly infected animals during the period follows a Poisson distribution with mean $$\alpha \frac{SI}{N},$$ where $N$ is the number of tested animals, $S$ is the amount of negative at first testing and $I$ is the number of positive at first testing. I also model $\alpha$ as $$\log(\alpha) = \beta_0 +\beta_1x_i$$ where $x_i \in \{0,1\}$ is the type of farm. I now want to write out a Bayesian model for this(likelihood and prior), with diffuse priors on the parameters. My first idea was to write out the likelihood as $$\prod_{i=1}^{12} \frac{1}{(Z_{2_i}-Z_{1_i})!}\left(\frac{S_i I_i}{N_i}\exp\{\beta_0 + \beta_1\text{type}_i\} \right)^{Z_{2_i}-Z_{1_i}} \exp\left\{-\frac{S_i I_i}{N_i}\exp\{\beta_0 + \beta_1\text{type}_i\} \right\}$$ but I am quite unsure. Espescially as how I should write out the prior, but I would also appreciate some help on the likelihood.
