I have no idea if this would work, however reporting services also depends on the SQL Server Agent service (for subscriptions) as well as the relational databases, so both would need to be compatible. If you have Reporting Services 2008 then you (or your organisation) must own a SQL Server 2008 license of some sort, therefore I cannot see why you would ever want to do this since you can install the SQL 2008 database engine to support your report server (on the same server, otherwise you would need an additional license). Bear in mind that as of April 2008 SQL Server 2000 is no longer in mainstream support from Microsoft, so you should avoid implementing new infrastructure or functionality using this version wherever possible. The configuration you describe above, even if you got it to work, would be unsupported by Microsoft and probably all ISVs and partners.
