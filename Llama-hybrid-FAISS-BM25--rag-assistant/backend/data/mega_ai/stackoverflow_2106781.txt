Detecting unset variables in Django templates

As a long time PHP developer, I'm used to the idea of setting the error level for my application to warn me when I am using an uninitialized variable. I was wondering if a similar feature exists in Django, where I can detect at run-time that I am using a variable in my template that was not explicitly passed to the template via the view? For example, I misspelled a variable name in the template {{ mysearch }} When it should've been {{ my_search }} Common mistake, not paying attention while typing, etc. In PHP I would've seen a warning about using an uninitiailzed variable but Django doesn't seem to care and just keeps on going like nothing happened. From a debugging perspective, it would be awesome to detect when I've made a mistake like that. Any thoughts?
