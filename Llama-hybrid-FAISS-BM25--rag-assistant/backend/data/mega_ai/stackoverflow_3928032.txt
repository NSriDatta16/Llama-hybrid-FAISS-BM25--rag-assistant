First of all the error which I see if I open your schema in Visual Studio 2010 is: The derived type and the based type must have the same content type. In you current schema the type itemTypeBase is defined with respect of the and derived type itemType with the respect of which is not allowed. Either you allow no sub-elements and use or you do use child elements and use . I personally don't like and don't use mixed types. If I understand you correct you want to make some restrictions in the text from the content. You want to have the content length between 1 and 64 characters. But 2 , 2 and all whitespace, inclusive the new line characters, are also a part of the content. If you want that has simple content, then you can not insert child elements inside. So the pragmatical solution would be go away from the mixed model and use the XML document in the form Description here... 2 2 where Content.xsd is All will be very simple and clear.
