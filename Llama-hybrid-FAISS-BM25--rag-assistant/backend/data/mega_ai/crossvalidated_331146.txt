One way to look at this is to perform a $\chi^2$ test on the table you presented: dat Which returns: Pearson's Chi-squared test with Yates' continuity correction data: dat X-squared = 0.34761, df = 1, p-value = 0.5555 This indicates that there is no significant difference between the two types of shooting. Since you have a theoretical independent variable and dependent variable, however, you could also re-create a full data set and perform a logistic regression. I think this is a little bit more intuitive: format Which returns pretty much the same p-value for significance: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -0.612 0.054 -11.267 0.00 formatcompetitive_yes 0.091 0.139 0.659 0.51 Logistic regression makes things linear by forcing things into log-odds units (or logits), so you can use the exponential function to get the odds ratio, which in this case is exp(.091) or $1.10$. So competitive format shots are 1.1 times as likely to be made as non-competitive shots, but this is not statistically significant, $p = .510$. That is to say, if there was no difference between the two conditions, we would expect to get an odds ratio of 1.10 or higher 51% of the time. In fact, if we ran this study an arbitrarily large number of times, we would expect to see the odds ratio be between 0.83 and 1.44 95% of the time (which I calculated using the Std. Error ).
