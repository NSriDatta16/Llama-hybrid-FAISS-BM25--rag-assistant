To me I would want to see Run(args) replaced with the instantiation of a class. Something like: Main Try: try { // Process args to get parameters for AClass AClass program = new AClass(a, b); return program.Run(); } AClass: public class AClass { AClass(string a, string b) { ... } public int Run() { ... return Environment.ExitCode; } } Something like this is going to discourage procedural code and encourage creating an object oriented approach. In regards to the AClass() constructor, I think the arguments should be processed prior to being passed into AClass() instead of AClass() having to know that it's created via a Console app.
