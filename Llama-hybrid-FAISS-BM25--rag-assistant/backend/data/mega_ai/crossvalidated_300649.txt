Theta weight parameter zero initialization

For a machine learning classifier, an initial theta of zeros is valid for logistic regression (but not neural networks). I don't understand why matrix multiplying an array of zeros with a non zero feature matrix is valid. Wouldn't the zeros cancel out whatever the feature values are and turn the sum to zero?
