web-based project management and time keeping software?

I work in a web shop where most of us aren't programmers. (I am.) Structure is almost non-existent. The biggest beauracratic construct is logging our time since that is essential for business. A few of us are project managers but everyone has their own system. Now lately customers want estimates for all of our work and reconciling the bill with jobs done is a nightmare. We need a better way to get organized. I would prefer a web-based, open source tool that we can use to manage clients, projects, list time, and allow project managers to assign tasks to us developers. Would also be nice if we had some kind of tracking or hooks into source control, but we still don't run any in our office, I'm pushing for SVN. It just would be nice to have one place where everyone logs in and all the notes and info for the work and client are right there, along with emails exchanged. It would help us in having clearer specs and estimates. I'm looking for something simple with the smallest learning curve since we aren't programmers, and we're short on time for training. Elegance is key, and if I had the time I'd build a minimalist thing that we need in house, but instead I'm being smart and asking what's out there. It would be great if it could be PHP since that's what we run.
