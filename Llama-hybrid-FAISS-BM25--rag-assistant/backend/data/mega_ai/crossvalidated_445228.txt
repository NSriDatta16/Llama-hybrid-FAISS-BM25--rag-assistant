Comparing log likelihood & AIC for two spatial error regression models with the same dependent but different independent variables

I have two spatial lag models using the same dependent variable (average income) and different independent variables (1- living environment deprivation; 2- education deprivation) for towns in the UK. I would like to see which model accounts for greatest variation, hence should I compare r squared or log likelihood and AIC values to determine this? I have read on forums that the log likelihood can only be compared for models with the same data, so does this mean I cannot compare them if the independent variables are different? Thank you.
