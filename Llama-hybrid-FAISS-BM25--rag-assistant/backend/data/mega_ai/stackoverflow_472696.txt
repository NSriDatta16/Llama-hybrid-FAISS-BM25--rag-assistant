It's not true . In the other question the problem is to select 30 random numbers in [1..9] with a sum of 200. After choosing about on average 20 of them randomly, you reach a point where you can't select nines anymore because this would make the total sum go over 200. Of the remaining 10 numbers, most will be ones and twos. So in the end, ones and twos are very overrepresented in the selected numbers. Shuffling doesn't change that. But it's not clear how the random distribution really should look like, so one could say this is as good a solution as any. In general , if your "random" numbers will be biased to, say, low numbers, they will be biased that way no matter the ordering.
