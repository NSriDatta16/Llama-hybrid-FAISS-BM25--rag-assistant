list comprehension and filter(...), apply(...) and eval(...), etc. while these idioms aren't completely substitutable, but i find that their primary purposes overlap to a great extent The pythonic way would be: use simple for-loops or list comprehensions. filter and map are remnants of older versions of the language. Guido wanted them removed at one point but it turned out there are some valid use cases and enough people who would like them to stay (also see this thread ). Don't use eval . Don't worry about performance unless it becomes a problem (and in that case the easiest way - trying make to use of the highly optimized functions in the standard library - is the best way most of the time). I think in general Python is really straightforward in trying to provide one (obvious) way to do things, although valid (bigger or smaller) variations do occur and opinions on some topics do differ, of course. Picking up the Python idioms can be as easy as browsing this site and paying special attention to highly upvoted answers on Python questions (most of the time there's some kind of consensus on the best way to do things).
