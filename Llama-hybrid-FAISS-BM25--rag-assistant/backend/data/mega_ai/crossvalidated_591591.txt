What are some good books for Computational Bayesian Statistics?

There is already a community wiki on introductory textbooks for Bayesian statistics. However, I am looking for a book(s) on Computational Bayesian Statistics for intermediate learner who already has a good knowledge of Monte Carlo method and its applications (e.g. sampling method, MCMC, etc.). It should be up-to-date as the field is changing quickly.
