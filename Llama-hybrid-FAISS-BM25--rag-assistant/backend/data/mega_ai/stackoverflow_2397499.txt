There are different strategies. If you've a lot of views that renders to template files for the web version, and don't want to rewrite all views checking if the request is coming from a mobile user-agent, you'd be better writing a Middleware. A workflow could be like this: def process request: if from_mobile: settings.TEMPLATE_DIRS=settings.TEMPLATE_MOBILE_DIRS else: settings.TEMPLATE_DIRS=settings.TEMPLATE_WEB_DIRS There is only a little problem here: As Django Documentation reports, it's not correct to change settings at runtime: http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/settings/#altering-settings-at-runtime So you may want to call django.conf.settings.configure(default_settings, **settings)
