Web usability: alert/notification - how to attract attention?

I'm building a web application where one of the features causes users to be notified in real-time when an alert pertaining to them occurs, similar to the big orange bar in Stack Overflow. I have a few options, and I was wondering if there was a usability guideline on the best way to go about this. One option is to have a small notifications box on the screen that flashes colors when an alert appears, but I'm worried that a simple, repeated change in color won't be sufficient to attract the user's attention. Another option is to have a window come floating across the screen, demanding the user's attention, but I've always found those to be obtrusive. Maybe another form of animation could be less annoying yet equally likely to attract the user's attention? I'm not really looking for an opinion as much as I'm looking for a usability discussion/resource that might cover this kind of decision.
