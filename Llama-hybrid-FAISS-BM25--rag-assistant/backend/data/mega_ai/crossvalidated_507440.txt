In the absence of covariates, f2b and f1 are effectively equivalent as single models because robust=TRUE only affects the standard errors for the regression coefficients and there aren't any. They aren't exactly interchangeable if you consider them as base models that some other model is nested in (because that model will have regression coefficients). f2a seems to have a bug that might not be worth fixing, because (a) the use of cluster in that way is discouraged and (b) there isn't any real point to asking for robust standard errors for coefficients when you aren't estimating any coefficients. The predict.coxph function will give you predicted hazards (it says how to convert these into survival) for all the coxph objects.
