There is a lot of stuff in Machine Learning, outside just the math.. You can build the most amazing probabilistic model using a ton of math, but fail because you aren't extracting the right features from the data (which might often require domain insight) or are having trouble figuring out what your model is failing on a particular dataset (which requires you to have a high-level understanding of what the data is giving, and what the model needs). Without the math, you cannot build new complicated ML models by yourself, but you sure can play with existing tried-and-tested ones to analyze information and do cool things. You still need some math knowledge to interpret the results the model gives you, but this is usually a lot easier than having to build these models on your own. Try playing with http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/ and http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/ .. The former comes with all the standard ML algorithms along with a lot of amazing features that enable you to visualize your data and pre/post-process it to get good results.
