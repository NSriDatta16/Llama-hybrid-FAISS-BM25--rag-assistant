tf.keras.layers.Embedding(..., embeddings_initializer="uniform" *,..., * kwargs) All the weights are initialized with the init strategy All learn the optimum values with the backprop Weights for which there is no input will have zero output every time, hence no learning. Hence these extra weights will remain at their initialization value You may check these extra weights before and after. weight = model.layers[0].get_weights() # Save before training history = model.fit(x, y) # These two should be same weight[0][-1] # Last weight - Before model.layers[0].get_weights()[0][-1] # Last weight - After
