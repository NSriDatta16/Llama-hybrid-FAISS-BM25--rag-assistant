Unbalanced distribution of multi-classes, how can I divide training/testing set

experts of the statistics, I am a newbie student in the machine learning field. I just started a job to classify set of scientific abstracts into five classes. The text distribution is as below: Class1: 200 Class2: 950 Class3: 150 Class4: 100 class5: 350 I am planning to make a multi-class classifier, however, I worry about the balance of the number of texts for each class. For example, if I use 100 documents for training each class, the class 2 has relevantly too many testing data. I wanted to get some insightful idea to construct my training/testing set and the reason. Sincerely yours,
