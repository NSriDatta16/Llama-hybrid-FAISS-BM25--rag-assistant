Regarding your question #2 - you can most certainly return a DataSet from a web service. http://tinyurl.com/ah58xc However, perhaps a better option would be to simply refactor your application instead of making it into a multi-tier. For example, separate the "data access" into a separate Class Library project that you reference from your ASP.NET project. This could make things more organized and might possibly accomplish some of what you're wanting to do with the multiple tier architecture. By the way, the biggest danger in creating multiple tiers when you might not necessarily need them is that you end up creating "proxy" code, for lack of a better term. That is, methods that serve no purpose other than to call the "real" back-end methods with the same parameters. This feels better at first because you have a clean layer separation but leads to maintenance problems down the road, because, for example, to add a parameter to a method, you have to add it 3 times (back-end, proxy layer, and presentation layer).
