A friend (Law and CS graduate) recently wrote his PhD dissertation about the use of AI and ML approaches in law. His conclusion is as you suggested (dimensionality), semantics, cultural concepts of justice, as well as non-binary data types (e.g. confessed but with what constraints and conditions?) will not lead to satisfying mathematical results, when it comes to the actual range of sentences. However, NLP can help preprocessing cases to better distribute them to the person in charge of. In categorical cases (e.g. traffic delinquency) one can use NLP approaches to make the whole process more efficient.
