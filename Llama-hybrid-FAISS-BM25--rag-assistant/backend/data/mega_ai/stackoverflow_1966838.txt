You need to copy the string into the array: void pass_char_ref(unsigned char *foo) { strcpy( foo, "hello" ); } Then when you call the function, simply use the array's name: pass_char_ref( bar ); Also, the array is not in "static storage"; it is an automatic object, created on the stack, with a lifetime of the containing function's call.
