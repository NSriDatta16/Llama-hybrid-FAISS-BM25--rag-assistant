Of the top of my head, some dimensionality reduction methods to consider are: Non-negative matrix factorisation (NNMF). We approximate a non-negative matrix as the product of two other (hopefully simpler) non-negative matrices. Effectively each component is guaranteed to be positive and therefore have an clear additive representation. Independent component analysis (ICA). We solve the blind source signal separation problem; effectively each component is a statistically independent source of variation. CUR decomposition (CUR). We try to approximate our matrix with rows and columns come from the original matrix; effectively each component is a pre-existing row. As such all our components have a natural interpretation as they exactly represent single units from our existing sample.
