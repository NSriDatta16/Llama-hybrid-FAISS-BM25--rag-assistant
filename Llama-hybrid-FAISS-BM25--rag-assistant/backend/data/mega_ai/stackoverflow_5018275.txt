If you setup your HTML as: Filter Item 1 Filter Item 2 Filter Item 3 Filter Item 4 Filter Item 5 Item 1 Item 1 Item 2 Item 3 Item 1 Item 4 Item 4 Item 1 Item 5 Then your jQuery code can be as simple as: $(function(){ $("#controls a").click(function() { $("#items").find("." + this.id).toggle(); }); }); Of course, you will want to add a visual indication that a filter is toggled on and off. You may not want to associate the items with each link through id/classes, but instead use jQuery's data storage, depending on your needs. A working example, tested in firefox, here: http://jsfiddle.net/mwolfetech/GetRV/ Edit: This solution is similar to Anto Binish Kaspar's , mainly differing only in how the html is modified. I think that the divs given are likely to be a good structure for your document anyway, and eliminates the need for extra classes for control. This is always a design decision--balancing div (for structural division) vs class (for, categories). Additionally, theres no need to extract the id from the event object as jQuery provides the this reference.
