2 questions about the functions in the `deepnet` Deep Neural Network package in R

I'm using R to perform the Deep Neural Network. But there are so many packages and functions related to neural networks that I am confused. I am wondering about the following two things. What are the differences between dbn.dnn.train and sae.dnn.train in the deepnet package? What DNN function can control L1 (Lasso penalty) and L2 (Ridge penalty)?
