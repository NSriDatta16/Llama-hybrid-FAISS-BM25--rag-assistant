JSON doesn't require you to do that, it allows you to do that. It also allows you to use "\u0061" for "A", but it's not required, like Harold L points out: The JSON spec says you CAN escape forward slash, but you don't have to. Harold L answered Oct 16 '09 at 21:59 Allowing \/ helps when embedding JSON in a tag, which doesn't allow inside strings, like Seb points out: This is because HTML does not allow a string inside a tag to contain , so in case that substring's there, you should escape every forward slash. Seb answered Oct 16 '09 at 22:00 Some of Microsoft's ASP.NET Ajax/JSON API's use this loophole to add extra information, e.g., a datetime will be sent as "\/Date(milliseconds)\/" . (Yuck)
