What version of Eclipse? Europa? Ganymede? What do you mean by workspace? An Eclipse workspace is not something you deploy, it holds your projects. You will need to generate a WAR file (or the folder of files that would comprise the WAR file), a project would typically include an ANT or Maven build script to do this, or if the project used Eclipse's Dynamic Web Project type there might be a 'generate WAR' option somewhere. Without further details I can't help any more.
