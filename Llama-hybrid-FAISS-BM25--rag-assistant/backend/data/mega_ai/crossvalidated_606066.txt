This is no different from any other Bayesian model. While $\mu$ is a fixed quantity, your state of knowledge about $\mu$ is limited (unless you have observed all $x_1,x_2,\dots,x_N$ ) and you represent your limited knowledge about $\mu$ (perhaps indirectly) by a probability model. For example, you could represent your prior state of knowledge by saying that the $x_i$ 's are independent $N(\eta,\tau^2)$ conditional on $\eta$ and $\tau^2$ . Specifying your prior also on $\eta$ and $\tau^2$ this would translate to a prior (or a posterior) also on the finite population mean $\mu=\frac1n\sum_{i=1}^N x_i$ if you have observed none of (or only some of) the $x_i$ 's.
