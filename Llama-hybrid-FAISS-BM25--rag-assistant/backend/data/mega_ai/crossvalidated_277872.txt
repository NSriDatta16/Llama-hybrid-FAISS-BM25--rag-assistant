"Averaging" variances

I need to obtain some sort of "average" among a list of variances, but have trouble coming up with a reasonable solution. There is an interesting discussion about the differences among the three Pythagorean means (arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic) in this thread ; however, I still don't feel any of them would be a good candidate. Any suggestions? P.S. Some context - These variances are sample variances from $n$ subjects, each of whom went through the same experiment design with roughly the same sample size $k$. In other words, there are $n$ sampling variances $\sigma_1^2$, $\sigma_2^2$, ..., $\sigma_n^2$, corresponding to those $n$ subjects. A meta analysis has been already performed at the population level. The reason I need to obtain some kind of "average" or "summarized" sample variance is that I want to use it to calculate an index such as ICC after the meta analysis. P.P.S. To keep the discussion more concrete, let me explain the issue with the following example in R: library(metafor) dat In the dataset there is a variance associated with each school's performance score: str(dat) Classes ‘escalc’ and 'data.frame': 56 obs. of 6 variables: $ district: Factor w/ 11 levels "11","12","18",..: 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 3 3 ... $ school : Factor w/ 11 levels "1","2","3","4",..: 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 ... $ year : int 1976 1976 1976 1976 1989 1989 1989 1989 1994 1994 ... $ yi : atomic -0.18 -0.22 0.23 -0.3 0.13 -0.26 0.19 0.32 0.45 0.38 ... $ vi : num 0.118 0.118 0.144 0.144 0.014 0.014 0.015 0.024 0.023 0.043 ... Suppose that we perform a meta analysis with a hierarchical or mixed-effects model: $y_{ij} = a + \alpha_i + \beta_j + \epsilon_{ij}$ where $\alpha_i$ and $\beta_j$ are the random effects for the $i$th school and $j$th district, respectively, and $\epsilon_{ij}$ is the measurement error with a known Gaussian distribution $N(0,v_{ij})$. This model can be analyzed as below: (fm rendering the following variance estimates for the two variance components: Multivariate Meta-Analysis Model (k = 56; method: REML) Variance Components: estim sqrt nlvls fixed factor sigma^2.1 0.0814 0.2853 11 no district sigma^2.2 0.0010 0.0308 11 no school The two variances in the result, sigma^2.1 and sigma^2.2, correspond to the two random-effects variables (district and school). I would like to compute the ICC for district, and that is why I wanted to obtain a summarized variance in the first place for those individual variances, $v_{ij}$, of the measurement term $\epsilon_{ij}$. Since the total variance is $Var(y_{ij})= Var(\alpha_i + \beta_j + \epsilon_{ij}) = \sigma_1^2 + \sigma_2^2+v_{ij}$ my original (and simple) approach was to use just the arithmetic mean: $\frac{\sigma_1^2}{\sigma_1^2 + \sigma_2^2+mean(v_{ij})}$ but I am not sure if the arithmetic mean, $mean(v_{ij})$, is appropriate in this context.
