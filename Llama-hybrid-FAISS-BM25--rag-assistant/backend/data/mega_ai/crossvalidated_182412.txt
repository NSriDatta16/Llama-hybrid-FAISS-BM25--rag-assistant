It seems ( /METHOD=CORRELATION ) that you are asking SPSS to perform FA on the correlation matrix (actually by typing /EXTRACTION PC you seem to be performing PCA and not FA, but it does not matter for this question). Correlation matrix does not change if you scale individual variables, so any amount of normalizing or standardizing would not change it. You can think of it as if all the variables are automatically standardized to have zero mean and unit variance prior to the PCA/FA analysis. No wonder you always get the same result. Varimax rotation has nothing to do with it.
