Using a pre trained CNN classifier and apply it on a different image dataset

How would you optimize a pre-trained neural network to apply it to a separate problem? Would you just add more layers to the pre-trained model and test it on your data set? For example, if the task was to use a CNN to classify wallpaper groups , I'm sure that it wouldn't work to directly classify off a pre-trained network trained on images cats and dogs, even though both are image classifiers.
