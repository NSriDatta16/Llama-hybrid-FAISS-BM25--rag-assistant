Programmers seem to think that their work is quite mathematical. Really? All of them? I've seen lots of programmers hating math and saying they got nothing to do with it. It seems that programmers are doing precisely the sort of mechanized base mental activity the grand old man is contemptuous about. It seems like you could have confused programmers and computers. A lot of programming involves higher level math and computers. And the mental process by which you construct the program isn't that simple at all. IMHO the fact is that math and programming are similar as they both deal with solving problems (well posed ones, generally). Sometimes mathematicians think that their problems are harder (or more pure, or more elegant, or whatever). But when it comes to solutions it turns out that programmers care more about better ones. Let me show you an example: say your problem is to prove the Fermat's Last Theorem, now say that you are Andrew Wiles and come out with 100+ pages long article on Annals of Mathematics filled with beautiful diagrams, lemmas, theorems and propositions about semistable elliptic curves. Basically material that only a handful o persons can understand and it will take them weeks to do that. Not mentioning that it had taken you 7 years to figure out the solution. So from a programmers point of view your solution is bad as it is difficult to understand, difficult to debug, difficult to maintain and is not scalable. And that is where programming and math are different. So I'd say that programming is about solving the problem and doing it the best way possible. Now if you are wondering if programming is part of math then I think the answer is yes iff you also consider physics to be part of the math.
