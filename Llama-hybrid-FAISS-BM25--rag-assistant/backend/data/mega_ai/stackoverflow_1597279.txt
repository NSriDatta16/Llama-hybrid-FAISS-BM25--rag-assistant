terry, jason and the other answers & comments are correct. what you're attempting would be like trying to cast an apple into an orange. conveniently, NSNumber does have a stringValue method. so try this: NSString *post = [[[temp objectAtIndex:i] valueForKey:@"POSTDESCRIPTION"] stringValue]; only do this if you know for sure it'll always be an NSNumber. otherwise, you can try the rather hacky and inelligant: NSString *post = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%@",[[[temp objectAtIndex:i] valueForKey:@"POSTDESCRIPTION"] description];
