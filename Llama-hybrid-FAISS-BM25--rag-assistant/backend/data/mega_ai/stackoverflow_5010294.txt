Apparently that is caused by a bug in PHP and lack of support for stored procedures on Windows machines. Please try the following: http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=39858 Looking at the very last comment: 1221253320 it seems to have been fixed, you can try update your PHP To the latest version. 5.3 my advice: If your using a pre packaged "server" kit such as xampp then you should scrap that all together, partition 2GB of your hard drive using the Storage Extender in Storage Management, Install MySql,PHP,Apache seperatly and then configure them. use that latest snapshot of PHP and the latest MySql Distro, Migrate your application and database to the new install, kick your computer and it should run fine. I would bet that it could be down to the MySql Client Libs as well, Upgrade them Some related links im coming across: I get 2014 Cannot execute queries while other unbuffered queries are active when doing exec with PDO http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.pdo-mysql.php#84688
