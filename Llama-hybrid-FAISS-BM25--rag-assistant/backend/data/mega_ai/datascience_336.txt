There isn't a silver bullet language that can be used to solve each and every data related problem. The language choice depends on the context of the problem, size of data and if you are working at a workplace you have to stick to what they use. Personally I use R more often than Python due to its visualization libraries and interactive style. But if I need more performance or structured code I definitely use Python since it has some of the best libraries as SciKit-Learn, numpy, scipy etc. I use both R and Python in my projects interchangeably. So if you are starting on data science work I suggest you to learn both and it's not difficult since Python also provides a similar interface to R with Pandas . If you have to deal with much larger datasets, you can't escape eco-systems built with Java(Hadoop, Pig, Hbase etc).
