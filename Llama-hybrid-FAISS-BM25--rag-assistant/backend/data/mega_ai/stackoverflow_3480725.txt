Okay, based on what I think you're saying, you're trying to add a button to mark some objects in an array as favorites? You could create a model class that represents each object and give it a boolean property favorite or something, then simply do something like ([[rootArray objectAtIndex:someIndex] set] setFavorite:YES]; in your makeFavorite method. Alternatively, you could just use an NSDictionary with keys for the text and whether or not it's marked as favorite. As for storing the favorites, NSUserDefaults is not appropriate for that. ( NSUserDefaults should be used for anything related to user settings; basically, anything that you would expose in the Settings app). Instead, you would want to write your array to a file in one of the writeable folders when the application is suspended, and restore the array from the file when the application becomes active. (You could also use sqlite or some other form of storage if you wanted, but it sounds like you're storing relatively simple data so this isn't necessary).
