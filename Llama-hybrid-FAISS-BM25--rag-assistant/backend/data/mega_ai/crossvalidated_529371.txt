Is it possible to specify a model without fixed effects - like a one sample ttest equivalent with random effects?

Basically, I want to know how accurate my participants are, but it would be good to take participants and items into consideration as random effects rather than having to average them out or risk pseudo replication. I don’t have a fixed effect so I can’t use a LMM – but is there something else I can use? Or, alternatively, would it be best to just use average participant accuracy score and conduct a one-sample t-test?
