Reading the Exchange server time via MAPI

I'd like to calculate the age of the messages in an Exchange mailbox to make sure they sit there for at least a minute before our program (C++, MAPI) processes them. This way the spam filter we use should have enough time to do its job. Because the time on the PC where our program runs might be different from the time used by the Exchange server, our program has to read the server time via MAPI. Is there an elegant solution to it? One way I can think of is to modify some Item and immediately read its PR_LAST_MODIFICATION_TIME , but I'd like to avoid that. Edit: Our program is a batch job that runs every 10 minutes and reads the journal mailbox.
