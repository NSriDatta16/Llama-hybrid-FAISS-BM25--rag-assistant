Does it have to be? No. Should it be? That's the convention. When jarring for production, Ant tasks with the proper attributes can remove all the test classes no matter how you organize your project. So the physical location doesn't much matter in this regard. For normal 'source' jarring, it's nicer to have the test cases in close proximity to the related source code so you can more easily make source releases. Java has package-level access (similar to private and public access) but I don't think this is used too often. The big thing is that you have unit tests. The rest isn't so important IMO.
