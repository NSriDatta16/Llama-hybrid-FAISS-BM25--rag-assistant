Disclaimer: I have a Ph.D. and work in machine learning. Having said that, I think other than becoming an academic, you don't need a Ph.D. to work in any field. Getting a Ph.D. helps you develop certain research skills, but You don't need those research skills for most jobs. You can acquire those skills without getting a Ph.D. degree. Martin Wolf , the chief economic correspondent for the Financial Times , doesn't have a Ph.D. (he has a Master's degree), but his word carries a lot more weight than most Ph.D. graduates. I think to succeed in any field (including machine learning), you have to know how to learn and think thorough stuff on your own. A Ph.D. will help you practice those skills, but it's not an end to itself. Anyone who isn't willing to interview you just because you don't have a Ph.D., is probably not worth working for anyway.
