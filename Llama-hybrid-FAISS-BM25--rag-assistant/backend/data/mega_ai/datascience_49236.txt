How to feed a table per timestamp to LSTM neural network?

I have a time-series dataframe like this feat1 feat2 target date id 0 1 12 16 192 2 15 6 90 3 2 9 18 1 1 0 3 0 2 0 9 0 3 56 9 504 2 1 5 9 45 2 6 9 54 3 5 8 40 and my problem is for regression. What I know about the LSTM sequences, is that normally, the row_id is the date, so you build sequences of n rows. In my data, as you can see, it's different. In each row that refers to the date, I have 3 more rows representing a product. What I have thinked for make the sequence to my problem, my sequence will be of 2 days: sequence = [day0,day1],[day1,day2] For every date , I have date0 = [id1,id2,id3]. For every id , I have: id = [feat1,feat2]. the sequence[0] , and it would be something like [ [ [12,16], [15,6], [2,9] ],[ [0,3], [0.9], [56,9] ] ] Is this valid? Will the LSTM layer understand this? Or do I have to do some kind of extra transformation?
