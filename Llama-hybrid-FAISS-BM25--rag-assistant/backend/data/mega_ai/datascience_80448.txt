What common/simple problem would work well as a web app?

Context I'm currently writing a simple tutorial to demonstrate a tool to data scientists and analysts that turns Jupyter Notebooks into web apps. Basically, it discusses setting up the web app as a front end, running some code in the notebook and then returning data to the web app. Question My question is, what is a small interesting problem in data science that I could solve in the notebook? I'm looking for something more interesting than doubling an input but smaller/simpler than building a computer vision model. Additional information As you can probably tell, I am new to data science. Apologies if this is the wrong forum for this type of question. Here is the version with a non-interesting problem being solved in the notebook, it may provide more context if needed. Thanks in advance for any help.
