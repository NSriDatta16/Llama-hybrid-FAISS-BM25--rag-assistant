I have a very fuzzy data set, what can I do to 'smooth' it?

Can you suggest some pointers on how I can manipulate my data to be 'smoother'? Any algorithms, or techniques that would be useful in this aspect? Updates: In response to the comments asking for more info: The data does not follow a known distribution as far as I know. It consists of 10+ different time series, which might have some relation to each other. I have another sample time series, to which I am trying to maximize the correlation of this one to that. The most important thing is to maximize correlation and hopefully preserve the shape of the aggregated 10+ time series combined together. I have tried rectangular smoothing (3-point) and triangular smoothing (3-point) but they both seem worse than not smoothing at all. Triangular smoothing is however better than rectangular smoothing. I am reading something on Savitzky-Golay and am going to try that next, and see if I can obtain a better result. My question is - what other smoothing filter/techniques should I try?
