It appears you have a time-series data (i.e. for a single dependent variable in each period), and it is stock data. Comments a) There are enough indications that in the basic regression modelling framework, the error term related to stock data is better modeled as following the Laplace distribution and not the Normal. b) With time series data, possible autocorrelation and even non-stationarity of the data will create various issues for the least-squares estimator, bias being the milder one, but also possible inconsistency and even spurious results. Now, either you were given the task to just practice the estimation routine (in which case results don't really matter), or it is expected of you to see what you can do, in light of the above possible issues, so that it will become acceptable to still apply a "linear least-squares" estimation framework. This second possibility is of course the one where learning resides. Note that "linear least-squares" does not imply any distributional assumption.
