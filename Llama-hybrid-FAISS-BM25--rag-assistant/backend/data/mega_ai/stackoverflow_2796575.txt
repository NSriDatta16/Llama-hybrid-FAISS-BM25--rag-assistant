NoSQL: How to retrieve a 'house' based on lat & long?

I have a NoSQL system for storing real estate houses. One piece of information I have in my key-value store for each house is the longitude and latitude . If I wanted to retrieve all houses within a geo-lat/long box, like the SQL below: SELECT * from houses WHERE latitude IS BETWEEN xxx AND yyy AND longitude IS BETWEEN www AND zzz Question: How would I do this type of retrieval with NoSQL ... using just a key-value store system? Even if I could do this with NoSQL, would it even be efficient or would simply going back to using a tradition database retrieve this type of information faster?
