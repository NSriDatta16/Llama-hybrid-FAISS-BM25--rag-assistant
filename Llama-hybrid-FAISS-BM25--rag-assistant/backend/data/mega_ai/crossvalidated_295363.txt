Why doesn't the exponential family include all distributions?

I am reading the book: Bishop, Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (2006) which defines the exponential family as distributions of the form (Eq. 2.194): $$ p(\mathbf x|\boldsymbol \eta) = h(\mathbf x) g(\boldsymbol \eta) \exp \{\boldsymbol \eta^\mathrm T \mathbf u(\mathbf x)\} $$ But I see no restrictions placed on $h(\mathbf x)$ or $\mathbf u(\mathbf x)$ . Doesn't this mean that any distribution can be put in this form, by appropriate choice of $h(\mathbf x)$ and $\mathbf u(\mathbf x)$ (in fact only one of them has to be chosen properly!)? So how come the exponential family does not include all probability distributions? What am I missing? Finally, a more particular question that I am interested in is this: Is the Bernoulli distribution in the exponential family ? Wikipedia claims it is, but since I am obviously confused about something here, I would like to see why.
