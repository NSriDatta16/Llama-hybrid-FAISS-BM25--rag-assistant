I spent some time with a consultant tracking this down, and eventually we discovered that for reasons unknown, the Tagging stuff just wasn't being loaded. By adding a single line of code, just three letters, to the end of environment.rb, it was resolved. I commented it so that we'd never forget wtf was going on: # Magic begins here. # We need to force Rails to load the Tag record, or # has_many_polymorphs doesn't work properly. I don't know # if there's a better fix, but this one seems reasonable. :-/ Tag That was it. I'm sure there's an elegant and proper solution to this, but this works. Weird. I hope this helps someone out there.
