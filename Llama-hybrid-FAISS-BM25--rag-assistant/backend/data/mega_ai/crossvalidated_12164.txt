Testing significance of peaks in spectral density

We sometimes use spectral density plot to analyze periodicity in time series. Normally we analyze the plot by visual inspection and then try to draw a conclusion about the periodicity. But have the statisticians developed any test to check whether any spikes in the plot are statistically different from white noise? Have the R-experts developed any package for spectral density analysis and for doing that kind of test?
