Magento's pricing is pretty tightly written to allow them the number of customizations that they have already written for the framework. As such, the default Magento install will not pull prices from a webservice on demand per customer. However, ultimately, it's just code. A skilled Magento developer should be able to replace the product price methods with ones that call your webservice and determine the price for that customer specifically. Be aware that this is not a trivial integration, and I would expect to see some issues related to prices in carts and reordering products. Hope that gives you an idea. Thanks, Joe
