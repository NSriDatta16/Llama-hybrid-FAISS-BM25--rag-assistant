Read the book Clean Code by Robert C. Martin One thing he goes into detail on is naming. Variable and function names should be as exact as possible. If you require a comment to describe it, the function is either doing too much, or the name can be clearer. The goal, is to have code that reads like a story. Changing variable and function names and breaking them down into several functions or variables if necessary to achieve this goal. Great book, worth every penny
