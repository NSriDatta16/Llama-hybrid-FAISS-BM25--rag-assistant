I quite don't understand your question fully so I'll just answer first your question on how to get the percentage. And I'll use your present query. SELECT user_agent_parsed, user_agent_original, COUNT( user_agent_parsed ) AS thecount, ((COUNT( * ) / ( SELECT COUNT( * ) FROM agents)) * 100 ) AS percentage FROM agents GROUP BY user_agent_parsed ORDER BY thecount DESC LIMIT 50; In order for me to help you further, I think I need you to elaborate it further ;-)
