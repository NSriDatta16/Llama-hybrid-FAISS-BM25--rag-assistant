Zero inflated distributions, what are they really?

I am struggling to understand zero inflated distributions. What are they? What's the point? If I have data with many zeroes, then I could fit a logistic regression first calculate the probability of zeroes, and then I could remove all the zeroes, and then fit a regular regression using my choice of distribution (poisson e.g.). Then somebody told me "hey, use a zero inflated distribution", but looking it up, it does not seem to do anything differently than what I suggested above? It has a regular parameter $\mu$, and then another parameter $p$ to model the probability of zero? It just does both things at the same time no?
