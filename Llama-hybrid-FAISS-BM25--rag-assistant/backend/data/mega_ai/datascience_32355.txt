In a random forest, are all decision trees given same priority?

In random forest algorithm, m (say) number of decision trees are generated using p ( $log_2 n$ +1, where n= number of features) randomly selected features. The label of any sample from test data is chosen by the number of votes by the result of these decision trees. But these decision trees result in different accuracy ( quite obvious). My question is, why should we give same priority to all the decision trees? If a decision tree has higher accuracy in predicting the labels of the test samples, shouldn't we give it more priority than those with lower prediction accuracy ?
