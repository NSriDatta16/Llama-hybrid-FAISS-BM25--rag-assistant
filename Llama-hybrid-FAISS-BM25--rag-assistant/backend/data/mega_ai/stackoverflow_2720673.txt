The "elegant solution" is to actually try passing it as a parameter (to the constructor or execute() ) and see if it works, rather than assuming the person who asked that previous question (then answered his own question twice) knows what he is doing. I can think of nothing intrinsic to AsyncTask that would cause Activity to be a bad constructor parameter and every other object be just fine. Now, I haven't passed an Activity (or other Context ) as a parameter to an AsyncTask , because my AsyncTasks are always private inner classes. In fact, the fact that you want a public AsyncTask to me is a code smell, suggesting these tasks should be mediated by a Service or some other control point. But, that's just me. UPDATE A better answer for handling this pattern can be found here: Background task, progress dialog, orientation change - is there any 100% working solution?
