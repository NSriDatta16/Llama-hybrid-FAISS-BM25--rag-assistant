Here's another suggestion for a "pure CSS" (not really, in the sense that we're still working with jQuery UI here) solution: notice that the class ui-draggable-dragging is added to the element whenever the element is being dragged. Therefore something simple like this: .ui-draggable-dragging { cursor: move; } Should work . Otherwise Robert's answer with the cursor option should also do.
