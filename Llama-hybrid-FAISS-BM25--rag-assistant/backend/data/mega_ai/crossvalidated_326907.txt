Linear Model Diagnostics via Machine Learning

Are there any approaches to checking diagnostics of statistical models, in particular linear regression, by machine learning methods? Many of the standard frequentist tests for numerical estimation of residual diagnostics are insufficient in my opinion. Therefore, I am looking for advanced methods to assess assumptions.
