Getting current url

I have a couple of views which are rendering the same template and I have some {% url %} tags into that template which needs to point to different location based on the current view. Is there any context variable which gives the name of the view(for named urls), like view-1 view-2, so in my template I can use it like this: {% url url-name %} It is also possible to pass additional information to the template so I can understand which view is called. But that would not be an elegant solution I guess.
