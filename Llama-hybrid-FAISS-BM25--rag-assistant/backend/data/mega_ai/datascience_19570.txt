A simple approach would be to use k-nearest-neighbors , where the distance metric is, in your case, "the number of road links away." The technique is described in chapters 2 and 13 of The Elements of Statistical Learning . Basically it would take the average traffic volume for the k nearest traffic nodes. There is essentially no training involved, other than cross validation and tuning to find the optimal k . The trade-off is that it's computationally heavy at query time (when you want to make a prediction). Side note: If you aren't already, I highly recommend using a database like Neo4j to make querying the link distance much easier. You could probably code the KNN "model" yourself using just 3-4 lines of code if you use a graph database.
