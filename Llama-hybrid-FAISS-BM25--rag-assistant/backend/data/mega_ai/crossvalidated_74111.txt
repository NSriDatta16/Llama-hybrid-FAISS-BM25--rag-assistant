For logistic regression there's no problem with imbalanced samples per se, though if the absolute number in either response class is small for separate covariate patterns the maximum-likelihood estimators of odds ratios can be rather too biased for comfort, and some prefer to used penalized-likelihood methods as discussed here . For larger models computational constraints might necessitate down-sampling the most common class, which reduces the precision of all estimates somewhat but otherwise only affects the intercept (an estimate of which for the original population can be recovered â€” see here ). In your case a minority class numbering 20k shouldn't give cause for concern unless you're trying to estimate odds ratios for some very rare predictor categories. For classification trees there's what seems to be a good answer here .
