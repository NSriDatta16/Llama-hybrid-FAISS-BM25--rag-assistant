Agile is a business oriented thing, Agile is about maximizing the customer value while minimizing waste to provide the most optimal ROI . This is what should get measured. And to do so, I use the system that Mary Poppendieck recommends . This system is based on three holistic measurements that must be taken as a package: Cycle time From product concept to first release or From feature request to feature deployment or From bug detection to resolution Business Case Realization (without this, everything else is irrelevant) P&L or ROI or Goal of investment Customer Satisfaction e.g. Net Promoter Score Sure, at the team level you can track things like test coverage, cyclomatic complexity, conformance to coding standards, etc, but high quality is not an end in itself, it's just a mean. Don't misinterpret me, I'm not saying high quality doesn't matters, high quality is mandatory to achieve sustainable pace (and we include "no increase of the technical debt" in our Definition of Done) but still, the goal is to deliver value to the customer in a fast and profitable way.
