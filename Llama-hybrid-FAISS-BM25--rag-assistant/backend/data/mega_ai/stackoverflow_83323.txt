If you choose to rewrite new/delete, I have done this and have simple source code at: http://gandolf.homelinux.org/~smhanov/blog/?id=10 This catches memory leaks and also inserts guard data before and after the memory block to capture heap corruption. You can just integrate with it by putting #include "debug.h" at the top of every CPP file, and defining DEBUG and DEBUG_MEM.
