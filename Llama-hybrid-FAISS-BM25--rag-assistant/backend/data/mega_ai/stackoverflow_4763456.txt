This is not my field of expertise (I'm a web developer), but I think you should look into neural networks. I downloaded some demo code once and did some experimenting with character recognition. It was amazing to see how the neural network that I had setup could recognize characters that I drew on the screen. But before it could do this, it first had to learn (backpropagation learning). Here's a slideshow that provides an outline: http://www.slideshare.net/alessandrobaffa/fingerprints-recognition-using-neural-networks The last slide contains further references. Good luck! /Thomas Kahn
