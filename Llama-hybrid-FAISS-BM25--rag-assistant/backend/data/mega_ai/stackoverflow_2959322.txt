You probably forgot #include in some of your files. That's where things like back_insert_iterator are declared. In the past, you could get away with forgetting that header file, since many of the other standard headers also included it. VS2010 reorganized the headers for its library implementation to be more standards compliant. As a result, it's much less forgiving of missing headers, and is a commonly overlooked one.
