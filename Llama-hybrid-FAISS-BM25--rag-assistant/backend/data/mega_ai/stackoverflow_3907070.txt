jqGrid drag and drop a copy of the row, rather than moving the row?

It's easy to connect two grids for Drag and Drop: jQuery("#sourceGrid").jqGrid('gridDnD',{connectWith:'#targetGrid'}); However, this moves the row from source to target. I want to copy the row from source to target. The default "drag_opt" for gridDnd includes "helper: 'cone'", but it doesn't appear to be cloning. Does anybody have a trivial addition to the above jqGrid that accomplishes copy rather than move ?
