font-face font embedding very slow on firefox

the rendering of a custom font embedded with font-face is really fast on webkit-based browser, but very slow on firefox: it starts to render the text before the font is downloaded, then the font is "replaced". anyone knows a really fast and clean solution to avoid the problem ? really thanks
