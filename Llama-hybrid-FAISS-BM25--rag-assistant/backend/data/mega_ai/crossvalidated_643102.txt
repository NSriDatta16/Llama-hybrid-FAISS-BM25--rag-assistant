Yes, to account for the structure of your experiment (repeated measures -> nonindependent observations) you could run a GLMM assuming a binomial error distribution. This is also known as a logistic regression. The model would follow as: prob(A) ~ condition + (1 | participantID) Where the participant ID is modeled as a random intercept. In R: (assuming your data is long and tidy) library(lme4) mod1 summary(mod1) Will print the model coefficients as odds ratios. You'll see an intercept, condition 2, and condition 3. The coefficients for each of the condition terms are the difference from condition 1 (the intercept). Note that the interpretation of this model is slightly different from the Fisher test approach. For example, a significant positive effect of condition 2 would be interpreted as "condition 2 significantly increased the probability of selecting A over B.
