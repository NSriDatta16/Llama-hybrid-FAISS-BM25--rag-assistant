How do I use a Crash Report from Apple in Xcode?

I have received a Crash Report from Apple (joy). I understand I can symbolize this report in order to see what is crashing in my code. I understand I need the dSYM and build binary to do this. My question is what are the exact steps I need to follow in Xcode to do this? I have the build folder I submitted via iTunes connect still saved on my computer. How do I get the dSYM and binary into Xcode so that I can drag and drop the crash report ?
