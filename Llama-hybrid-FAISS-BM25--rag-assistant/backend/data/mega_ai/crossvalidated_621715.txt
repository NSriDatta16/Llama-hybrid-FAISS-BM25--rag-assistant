Using XGBoost to learn insights on data itself?

I am planning to use XGBoost to fit spatio temporal dataset that I made into a column row format. My goal isn’t prediction, but rather a regression with good fit. I just want a model fit that’s good enough after which I can use it to learn insights from my data. Maybe by using partial dependence or SHAP. My hypothesis is that a model that’s fitted well can capture the “physics” of the system enough after which I can try exploring that physics. I won't go into train-tests split, but rather planning to fit the model into the whole dataset. My reason for using a boosted tree algorithm is the data itself. I believe that the features have certain quantiles which influence the target, so I believe a decision tree can capture that. Do you think this is plausible?
