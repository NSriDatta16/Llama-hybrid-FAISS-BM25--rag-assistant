I see two main ways to do this: (1) Follow the steps of Support Vector Machine - Calculate w by hand. , from which the solution follows. In summary, we use the property that the decision boundary is of the form $\mathbf{w}^\top \mathbf{x} + b = 0$ , and use inspection to guess initial values of the parameters. Then, we use the invariance of our guesses to positive scaling plus the fact that the width between support vectors (orthogonal distance between the parallel hyperplanes containing the support vectors for class +1 and -1) is expressible as a function of $\mathbf{w}$ . First, by inspection, we know that the true decision boundary is parallel to the line $x_2 = x_1 - \frac{3}{2}$ . We know that the true $\mathbf{w}, b$ should have the property that $\mathbf{w}^\top \mathbf{x} + b = 0$ , we reach the initial guess $\tilde{\mathbf{w}} = [-1, 1], \tilde{b} = \frac{3}{2}$ . However, for any $c > 0$ , note that we could potentially have a decision boundary with parameters $c\tilde{\mathbf{w}} = [-c, c], c\tilde{b} = 3c / 2$ , such that $\mathbf{w}^\top \mathbf{x} + b = 0$ . The linked answer then uses the fact that the "width" (the size of the margin on either side of the decision boundary) between the support vectors is $2 / \lVert w \rVert$ , for which you can find the derivation here . By inspection, in your problem setting, the "width" between the support vectors is $1 / \sqrt{2}$ . Given the constraint that $1 / \sqrt{2} = 2 / \lVert w \rVert$ , it suffices to find the value of $c$ such that $$\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{2}{c \lVert \tilde{w} \rVert}$$ holds. Some simple algebra shows that $c = 2$ , from which $\mathbf{w} = [-2, 2], b = 3$ result as desired. (2) Identify support vectors by inspection. Then, use the fact that for support vectors, $\mathbf{w}^\top \mathbf{x} + b = y$ as a consequence of the SVM objective, where $y \in \{-1, 1\}$ , to develop a system of equations. Anyway, by inspection, all four of the points you listed are support vectors, yielding the system of equations: $$w_1 + b = 1$$ $$-w_2 + b = 1$$ $$w_1 - w_2 + b = -1$$ $$2w_1 + b = -1$$ and some algebra yields your desired $\mathbf{w}, b$ .
