I found this which may or may not contain what you need: http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/datasets/graffiti/graffiti.html http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/datasets/sgb/sgb.html If you repost your question at https://math.stackexchange.com/ or at https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/ you may attract the attention of algorithmic graph theorists or computer scientists specialising in graph algorithms. Do post a link here if you repost your question as I'm slightly interested in where to obtain such dataset. Thanks.
