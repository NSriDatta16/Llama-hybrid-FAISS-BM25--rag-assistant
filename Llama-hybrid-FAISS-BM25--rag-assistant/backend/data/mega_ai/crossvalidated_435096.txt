Your interpretation is correct, but in your model, you also control for typical income and wage, so the interpretation for the Gini effect gets tricky if you are holding those fixed. It is hard (though maybe not impossible) to conceptualize how you could get a more unequal distribution of income without a change in average income or wages. One possibility is that the rich and poor get more at the expense of the middle. If child mortality is concentrated at the bottom of the income distribution, this shift of income there should help lower mortality by a lot. Moreover, if child mortality reductions are enabled by progressive taxation (maybe through additional hospital or other public goods funding), it is possible that this could also help. To sum up, regression coefficients require the "all else equal" clause for correct interpretation. There is another nice example of that here . I should also point out that, in addition to issues of interpretation, regressions usually don't give you casual effects, only biased versions of them. Sometimes the bias is big enough to flip the sign of the effect. Your intuitions about causality may not match the regression output for that reason as well. Simpson's paradox is one example of this.
