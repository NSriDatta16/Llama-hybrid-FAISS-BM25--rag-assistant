Image Processing in WPF

I am designing an WPF application which renders data as a 500x500 8-bit indexed image at 10 frames per second using WriteableBitmap. We would like to add some real-time image processing algorithms to our output, such as 2-D median filtering, gaussian blur or moving average, which are computationaly power hungry. Did anyone try to use WPF pixel shaders to do such tasks ? Would a platform-specific image processing library be efficient ? (e.g. Intel IPP ?) Or would a DirectX based custom renderer be the solution ? Any tip would be much welcome. At the moment everything is computed within our .NET application and I believe there is room for optimization. Thank you for your help, Best Regards, Romain
