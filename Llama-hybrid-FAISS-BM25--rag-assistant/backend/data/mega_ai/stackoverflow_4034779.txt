How to generate a list of which Features are enabled in which Spaces?

I'm running a Drupal 6.x site with Organic Groups, Features, and Spaces, and I'm interested in generating a list of which Spaces have which Features enabled. Preferably a table, with Spaces along the Y axis, and Features along the X axis. Any ideas regarding how to generate this? I can generate a list of Group Spaces using Views, but can't find a field for the enabled Features.
