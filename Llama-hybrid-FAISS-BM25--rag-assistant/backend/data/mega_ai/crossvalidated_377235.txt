A couple of points: The correlation between the outcome variable y and a predictor f1 is related to the coefficient of the predictor. When you put two predictors in the model, like in your case, then you have partial correlations. In the case of simple linear regression, you can easily transform the coefficients to correlations. But in the case of clustered/grouped data, things become more complex. To my view, coefficients are easier to interpret than correlations. And indeed the interpretation is as you wrote, i.e., that a unit increase in f1 changes the average y by 0.65. Note that the interpretation of the coefficients is independent of their statistical significance. The correlation between f1 and f2 you obtain in the output of the summary() function is the correlation between the estimated fixed effects coefficients - not the correlation between the predictors f1 and f2 .
