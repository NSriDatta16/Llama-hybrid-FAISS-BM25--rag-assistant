What Are The Best Practices For String Data Field Sizes?

Are there any recomended field sizes for commonly used string data storage types? For example things like FirstName, LastName, AddressLine1, AddressLine2, City, State, PostalCode, EmailAddress etc. I am sure anyone who has created a table to store these commonly used data fields has had to make a decision as to what maximum size to use. What did you base you value on? Do you have some kind of formula that you use to make the decision(such as all fields sizes are a multiple of 8)? Does your company have a guideline so all tables that contain these fields are uniform? Is this just a personal thing? I know for me if I had a set standard, I wouldn't have to stop and think about it and end up with fields of different sizes. This uniformity would also be great when working on the UI as it would be easier to set the maxlength on input fields and any data validation code.
