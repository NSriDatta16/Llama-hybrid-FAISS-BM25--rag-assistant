D3eclaring a namespace is particularly important if you are in a big organisation such as a bank that might have multiple implementations of a webservice method such as GetDerivativeProduct(). From the MSDN docs: It is highly recommended that this default namespace, which is http://tempuri.org , be changed before the XML Web service is made publicly consumable. This is important because the XML Web service must be distinguished from other XML Web services that might inadvertently use the namespace as the default ( http://tempuri.org/ ).
