Proof and definition aperiodic Markov Chain

In the Wikipedia page, you have the following definition for period: $k = \gcd\{ n > 0: \Pr(X_n = i \mid X_0 = i) > 0\}$ And, for a Markov Chain to be aperiodic, $k = 1$. It is stated that this happens only and if and only if there exists $n$ such that for all $n' â‰¥ n$: $\Pr(X_{n'} = i \mid X_0 = i) > 0$ Is there proof of this last statement anywhere? I can't find it and I don't feel this is intuitive or obvious nor I can prove it. For example, if $n > 0: \Pr(X_n = i \mid X_0 = i) > 0$ was true for two primes, like 3 and 5, k would already be 1, would this be considered aperiodic too?
