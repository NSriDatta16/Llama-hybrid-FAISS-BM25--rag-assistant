Performance metric for algorithm predicting probability of low probability events

I am writing a program to predict the click through rates of online ads. Two important notes about this problem: click through rates are very small (like 0.1%) click through rates depend on several parameters (like size of the ad, country in which ad is shown, whether the user has seen this ad earlier etc) As I employ statistical/machine learning techniques, I would like to measure the performance of my techniques on historical data. I cannot employ metrics like precision or accuracy since all I predict is probability rather than predicting occurrence or non-occurrence of event. In such a case, how should I measure the performance of my algorithm?
