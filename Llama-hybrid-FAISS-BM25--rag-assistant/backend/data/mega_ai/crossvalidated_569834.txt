Training twice on non-injective data

I have a large dataset of 30000 points, but most my Ys are the same while all Xs are different. Ys are from different samples, so I had means of Y for each sample and I used means alongside Xs to train an RF. Then I used the predicted values by this RF as a new Y to train another RF that uses only Xs as input. This surprisingly resulted in a 20 percent decrease in RMSE (final predicted Y vs initial non-injective Y). So to cap it: X + mean of Y for samples vs Y using RF then X vs YpredictedByFirstRF using RF Did I commit some kind of machine learning crime? My idea was to simulate noise by adding central tendency measures of output as input for first model.
