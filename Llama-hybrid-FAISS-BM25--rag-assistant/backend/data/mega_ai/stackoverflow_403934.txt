All code in one file

After asking organising my Python project and then calling from a parent file in Python it's occurring to me that it'll be so much easier to put all my code in one file (data will be read in externally). I've always thought that this was bad project organisation but it seems to be the easiest way to deal with the problems I'm thinking I will face. Have I simply gotten the wrong end of the stick with file count or have I not seen some great guide on large (for me) projects?
