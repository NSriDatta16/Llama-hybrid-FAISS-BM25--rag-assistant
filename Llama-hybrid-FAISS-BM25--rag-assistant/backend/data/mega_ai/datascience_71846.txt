value of fit_generator parameters

I am doing simple CNN based binary image classification on classifying types of waste as organic and recyclable using image augmentation. How ever I have a doubt. In the third figure i have set the steps_per_epoch = 22564/32= 705 where 32 is batch size and validation_steps as 2513/32 = 79 as per documentation does that mean out of 22564 training and 2513 validation samples 705 and 79 are trained and validated ?
