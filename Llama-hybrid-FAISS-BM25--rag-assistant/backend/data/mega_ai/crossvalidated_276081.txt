Binary effects suggest a logistic regression . Repeated measures on each subject suggest a repeated measures or a mixed effects model . (Essentially, a repeated measures model is a special case of a mixed effects model.) Put the two together and look for a mixed effects logistic regression , modeling the propensity to repay using a logistic model, with a random effect per subject, which would model exactly the kind of latent trait (in a non-technical sense) you describe. Plus, depending on your software, you might be able to model covariances between successive loan repayments using an appropriate covariance structure. In R, for instance, you could look at a corCAR() covariance, which is a Continuous AutoRegressive covariance. The idea is that successive loan repayments correlate (that's the autocorrelation), but that this autocorrelation depends on how much time has elapsed between them (that's the continuous part).
