Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services are well worth looking in to: in my experience far less buggy than Crystal and all you need to is add a Report (RDL) file to your project and drag on a viewer (with WPF may be necessary to host it in a WindowsFormsHost control, though). Or you can go the whole hog and install SQL Server with reporting services, so that the reports are processed on the server. You get a load of decent export options (PDF, HTML,..) and there's plenty of flexibility and customisation for logic and rules in the report.
