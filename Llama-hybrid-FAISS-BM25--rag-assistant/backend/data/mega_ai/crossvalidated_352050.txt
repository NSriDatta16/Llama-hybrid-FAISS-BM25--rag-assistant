Completely different inputs to a neural network

I'm looking to train a recurrent neural network model with several different types of input vector. The data includes the input vector of an image (307200x1), an input vector of the position/orientation of one object (7x1), and another input vector of the position/orientation of another object. These vectors have nothing to do with each other, so encoding is not really applicable here. I am trying to figure out if I just concatenate these vectors and feed that as an input for the RCNN, or if I should combine 3 RCNNs, one for each vector, somehow. Each of these three vectors are capable of accurately predicting the correct output of the model, but I would like to combine this information to get even more accurate. Thank you for your time.
