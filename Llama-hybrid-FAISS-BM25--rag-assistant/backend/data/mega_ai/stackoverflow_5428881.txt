how to detect a "quick touch" on a UITableView for the purpose of toggling to/from full screen?

What is the coding to detect a "quick touch" on a UITableView for the purpose of toggling to/from full screen? In particular this is because the user is on a UITableView they would still need the ability to drag the list of items up/down, and potentially click on a cell/row to dig deeper. But if they touched quickly then this could be the trigger to toggle between full-screen mode (i.e. nav bar & tool bar). Background - When I say toggling to/from full screen I'm refering to carrying out what is described here , however in this answer there was no mention in terms of how to plug this into the callbacks for a UITableView which is being displayed within a UINavigationController stack.
