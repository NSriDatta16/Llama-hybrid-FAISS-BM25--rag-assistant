Multivariate time series (ARMAX models) are a generalization of "regression models" as you know them. The ARMAX model is also sometimes called a Transfer Function model. A final model can include appropriate contemporaneous and lag structures for your pre-specified causal series and potentially both an ARIMA structure to reflect omitted stochastic series and empirically identified Pulse/Level Shift/Time Trends/Seasonal Pulses which can reflect/proxy omitted deterministic effects/series. Some data sets require either power transforms or Generalized least Squares to render an error process invariant over time.
