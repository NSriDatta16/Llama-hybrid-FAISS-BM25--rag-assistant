From the Coursera course "Data Science in real life" by Brian Caffo Machine Learning Emphasize predictions Evaluates results via prediction performance Concern for overfitting but not model complexity per se Emphasis on performance Generalizability is obtained through performance on novel datasets Usually, no superpopulation model specified Concern over performance and robustness Traditional statistical analysis Emphasizes superpopulation inference Focuses on a-priori hypotheses Simpler models preferred over complex ones (parsimony), even if the more complex models perform slightly better Emphasis on parameter interpretability Statistical modeling or sampling assumptions connects data to a population of interest Concern over assumptions and robustness
