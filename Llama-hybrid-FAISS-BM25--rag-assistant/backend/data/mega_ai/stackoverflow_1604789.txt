This might not be the answer you're looking for, but when it comes to doing anything dynamic with Flash, I just give up and use SWFObject . There is so much complicated and non-standard stuff going on when rendering Flash, and it varies across browser, Flash version, etc. So relying on an external library might be less elegant than finding the most efficient and minimalistic solution for embedding in a given situation, but saves a lot of time and you're less likely to find out later that it's broken in browser X.
