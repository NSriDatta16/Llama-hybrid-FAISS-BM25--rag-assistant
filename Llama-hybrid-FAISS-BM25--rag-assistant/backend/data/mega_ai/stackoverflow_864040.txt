Hmm. It's probably not that simple that you'd want to do it yourself, but I would look at Peter Michaux's FORK Javascript drag and drop library -- unlike JQuery or all those big libraries, FORK's modules are decoupled from each other, and are simple enough that you could probably look at Peter's source code and figure out the bits you need. (edit: I'd just use FORK.Drag as it's really small: 7.6KB total minified)
