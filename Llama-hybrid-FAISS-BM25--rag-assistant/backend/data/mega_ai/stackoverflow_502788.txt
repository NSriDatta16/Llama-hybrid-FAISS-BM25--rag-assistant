MapView with ItemizedOverlay and map scrolling

I have a problem with custom ItemizedOverlay on the MapView in Android. What I've done: Very simple offspring of ItemizedOverlay class that only wraps my own type of items and uses ItemizedOverlay for all the hard work. What works: Nearly everything - items are drawn properly, I can tap them etc. The problem: If I drag the map in the view by the map itself, I can scroll it without a problems. But if I try to start moving the map over one of items from my overlay (eg. "dragging map by item"), it doesn't move. This is really problem, because if I have "a bit more" items, there is no way to drag the map (without un-zooming and grabbing map outside items). This problem occurs even if I don't handle any events generated by ItemizedOverlay (eg. with onTap() commented out in my overlay). Any advice would be appreciated.
