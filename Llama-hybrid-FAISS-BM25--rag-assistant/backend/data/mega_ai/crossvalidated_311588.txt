As jaradniemi points out, the question relies on a mistaken premise (that there's some analytical difficulty in dealing with improper priors); typically this isn't the case. As Sycorax says, it's the posterior that's the issue. If the posterior has a finite integral, there should be no particular difficulty (though how a particular posterior is going to be calculated depends on what methodology you're using). An improper prior doesn't necessarily lead to an improper posterior. While it's possible in some situations to end up with an improper posterior, in many cases of typical practice this is simply not an issue. As an example we could look at a univariate case -- a flat prior on the real line is improper, but the resulting posterior will simply be a normalized likelihood function, and with typical sorts of problems and nontrivial sample sizes that will generally yield a proper distribution. In many cases improper priors are no harder to deal with -- and are typically dealt with in the same way -- as a proper prior. For example, generally one doesn't need to sample a prior. If you look at (for one example), the test for whether one accepts a Metropolis-Hastings proposal to move to a new value, or stays put, the acceptance probability is ${ A(x'|x)=\min \left(1,{\frac {f(x')}{f(x)}}{\frac {q(x|x')}{q(x'|x)}}\right)}$ where $q$ is the proposal density and $f$ is proportional to the density you want to sample from (which is typically some joint posterior, but may be a conditional posterior in some situations (such as in a Metropolis-within-Gibbs step). Note for example that it's only the ratio of $f$ at $x$ and $x'$ that comes into the calculations -- indeed a flat prior would simply cancel out -- but other priors would simply result in typically fairly ordinary scaling ratios (e.g. consider an improper joint prior for a location $\theta$ and scale parameter $\tau$ being $1/\tau$ --the ratio of $f$'s would be a ratio of likelihoods times $\tau/\tau'$, which presents no difficulty at all). [I'd suggest trying some basic Bayesian calculations - with very simple, tractable problems - using conjugate but improper priors and seeing how that works; this would give some intuition for how one can have a proper posterior]
