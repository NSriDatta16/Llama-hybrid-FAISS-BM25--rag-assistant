time series anomaly detection

I want to ask for time series anomaly detection we can apply tnn on multiple features or not? I used transformer for sentiment analysis where I have to provide a sentence and it predicts its output as positive or negative. In another case I provided a single word and model predicts its language. This is how it works that it takes single column input where as in time series dataset there are more than one columns as input. I implemented transformer neural network i am confused how can i add more layers in transformer like other neural network architecture ?
