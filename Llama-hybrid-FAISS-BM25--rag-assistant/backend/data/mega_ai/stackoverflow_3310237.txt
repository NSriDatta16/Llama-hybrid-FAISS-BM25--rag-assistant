The first thing I'd change for legibility is to remove the almost hidden negation by inverting the statement (by using De Morgan's Laws ): if ( field1 != field2 || field3 != field4 .... etc ) { // Perform operations } Although using a series of && rather than || does have some slight performance improvement, I feel the lack of readability with the original code is worth the change. If performance were an issue, you could break the statements into a series of if-statements, but that's getting to be a mess by then!
