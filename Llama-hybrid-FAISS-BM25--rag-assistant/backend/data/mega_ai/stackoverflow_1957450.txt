If you want to profile your application to find performance bottlenecks you can use the traceview tool . This gives you a graphical view of performance traces of your application. To create a trace add the following to your code where you want to start tracing: Debug.startMethodTracing("myapp"); and then put the following when you want to stop tracing: Debug.stopMethodTracing(); This will create a trace file call myapp.trace in the root directory of the SD Card. As it is written to the SD Card: If you're using the emulator you'll need to add an SD card to your AVD . You'll need to give you app permission to write the SD card by adding the following to your Manifest: Once the file has been created you'll need to copy it to your PC. You can do this using the adb command: adb pull /sdcard/myapp.trace c:/my/dir/myapp.trace Finally, start traceview giving it the full path to the trace file: traceview c:/my/dir/myapp.trace I did have some problems with traceview failing with OutOfMemory exceptions. I fixed this on Windows by changing the last line of traceview.bat from: call java -Djava.ext.dirs=%javaextdirs% -Dcom.android.traceview.toolsdir= -jar %jarpath% %* to: call java -Xmx1g -Djava.ext.dirs=%javaextdirs% -Dcom.android.traceview.toolsdir= -jar %jarpath% %* Adding the -Xmx1g option allows traceview to use more memory.
