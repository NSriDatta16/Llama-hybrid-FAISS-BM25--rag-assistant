You might want to distinguish between distributions of random variables in general and distributions of a special class of random variables, namely test statistics like the sum of random variables. Such distributions are called sampling distributions. These distributions are of special importance when talking about statistical tests and thus you might call them "pedagogically" important. Examples for 2. The normal distribution. The sum/average of i.i.d. normal random variables is again normal and many important test statistics like e.g. regression coefficients tend to look normal for large samples. The F distribution: In ANOVA settings, normalized ratios of variances are of special importance. Under strict assumptions, such ratios follow an F distribution. The Chi-squared distribution: It serves as an approximation to the F distribution. The Binomial distribution: Is is of key importance wherever one studies properties of the sum of i.i.d. Bernoulli random variables. Examples for 1. Money and time tend to be right skewed. Models for right skewed random variables include the exponential, the gamma, the Weibull distribution, amonst many others. The normal and the logistic distribution are models for bell-shaped distributions. The Bernoulli distribution is the (only) model for binary random variables. The multinomial distribution describes the distribution of a discrete random variable with finite number of values. The Poisson, Negative Binomial are models for counts. The Beta distribution serves as model for continuous random variables squeezed between 0 and 1. The uniform distribution ...
