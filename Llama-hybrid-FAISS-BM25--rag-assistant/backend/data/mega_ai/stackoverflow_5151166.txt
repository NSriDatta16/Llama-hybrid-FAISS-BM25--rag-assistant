The fact that you instantiate new NotesUIWorkspace means that the agent does not run on the server. So you should probably ask about the version of Excel on the computers of other users, who run the code. Note that the agent would only run on the server if it is scheduled or if you make it run on the server using notesAgent.RunOnServer( [ noteID$ ] ) .
