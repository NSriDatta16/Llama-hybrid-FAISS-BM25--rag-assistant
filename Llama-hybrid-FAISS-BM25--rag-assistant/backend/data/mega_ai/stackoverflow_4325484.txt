During update old application bundle is replaced by the new one. All other folders and so their contents in application sandbox (Documents, Library, tmp) remain untouched. So if you want to replace old database (if you must save data changed by users in old database) you just need to check database version in your app and copy the new one from application bundle if version is old (you can use sqlite user_version pragma for version tracking)
