Two ways: iTunes syncs all crash reports during a regular sync. They can be found in Library/Logs/CrashReporter/MobileDevice on a Mac and probably somewhere in %APPDATA% on Windows. You can use the iPhone Configuration Utility for Mac OS X on any Mac to access the phone's console and crash logs. Note: the iPhone Web Configuration Utility, which is available for Windows and Mac (note the "web" in the name) does not allow this kind of access and only provides a portion of the Configuration Utility's features . Er, no you can't. Xcode provides this facility in the Organizer (from the Window menu), but not iPCU.
