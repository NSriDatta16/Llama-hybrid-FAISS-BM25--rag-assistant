I'm not sure its ok "copyright wise" to do so. But here's how to do it. In XCode, create a new group called: ARToolKitPlus (or whatever u like). Drag the "src" and "include" folders from the original ARToolKitPlus folder to the group you created. Find the location of both the "include" and "src" folders by right clicking on each and selecting "Get Info" Copy these paths in the "Get Info" window. Open the project settings, choose "All configurations" and find "Header Search Paths", you can search for it directly. Add the paths you copied from the info window to the header search paths, make sure you compensate for spaces (or even better, have no spaces in your paths). Confirm and make it recursive, and voila!
