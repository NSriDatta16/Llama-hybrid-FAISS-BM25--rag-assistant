SQLite manages the foreign keys, not the ad-hoc library. Each library (if they are half-decent) will have their documentation which will list what version of SQLite is supported. To determine if foreign keys are turned on in SQLite: PRAGMA foreign_keys; To turn on foreign keys: PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON; EDIT: This must be turned on not only before database creation, but at every connection for SQLite to activate foreign keys and their magic. (This is because foreign keys are not legacy, but is expected to change).
