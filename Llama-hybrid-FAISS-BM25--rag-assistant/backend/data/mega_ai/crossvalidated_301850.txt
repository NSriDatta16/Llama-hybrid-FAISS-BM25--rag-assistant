It seems the main problem is to actually extract features from the input data. Once you encode your pairs of sets as vectors, you can use almost any algorithm you want, but it seems it would be wise to first perform some kind of dimensionality reduction, feature selection or use a classifier that has these built-in, like Lasso-regularized logistic regression. The most obvious approach is to use Bag of Words approach with integers as words (specifically it seems appropriate to encode both sets separately and then concatenate their term-frequency matrices). Of course you'll have to accept either that you give the possible integer range at the start or that some integers don't get encoded. If you want some practice for BoW model, I'd recommend trying this hackerrank problem . For example, you can solve it using scikit learn - it's documentation contains tutorial on Working With Text Data .
