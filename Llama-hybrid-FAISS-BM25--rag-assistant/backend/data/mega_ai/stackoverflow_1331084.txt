How do I validate email address formatting with the .NET Framework?

I want a function to test that a string is formatted like an email address. What comes built-in with the .NET framework to do this? This works: Function IsValidEmailFormat(ByVal s As String) As Boolean Try Dim a As New System.Net.Mail.MailAddress(s) Catch Return False End Try Return True End Function But, is there a more elegant way?
