The easiest solution to your problem is to not to treat "don't know" as missing but a separate data type in itself. By this I mean if you currently have 3 categories, with NA, make it four categories and NA where category 4 is "don't know". After this you can use the standard EM methods There are 2 points I want to make in connection with @Rociante's reply. 1) I think he/she means f(i) = 0.5*(f(i-1) + f(i+1)). I would not recommend taking the average of the previous and the next in general because a) you do not know that consecutive points are related and b) you seem to have categorical types in which case this does not make sense anyways. If you must, use the MLE estimate. 2) Be very careful while dealing with NULLs in different langauges. Go through the documentation carefully when implementing the pseudo-code. You cannot say for example i=='NULL' in python and in fact most languages will not allow it (not sure of SPSS). Most languages treat NULL as its own type which can be anything. In python you would say try: i = i + 0 except: and in R you could use is.na(..)
