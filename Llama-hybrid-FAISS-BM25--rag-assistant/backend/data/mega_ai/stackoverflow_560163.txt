Ruby and Ruby on Rails crash course syllabus

I intend to design an induction plan or you can say a crash course syllabus for developers starting to learn Ruby and Ruby on rails. I am not sure about number of topics to be covered (And the depth of coverage) as this is a 3 day course (24 to 27 hours). Also, newbies tend to compare ruby with existing object oriented programming veterans like C++, Java or C#. But since Ruby is pretty different (Absence of abstract classes, interfaces, virtual keyword etc and presence of concepts like modules, mixins etc), how should the course be designed so that newbies start "thinking" in ruby ? Because, I believe that once they start doing that, those experienced in C++, Java or C# can pick it up quickly. Could I get some tips or possibly an abstract of ruby/rails course which you might be using already from experienced ruby/rails instructors? The intend is to make newbies, the developers of production ruby/rails applications as soon as possible. The course can be extended to be of up to 5 days (40 to 45 hours) if needed.
