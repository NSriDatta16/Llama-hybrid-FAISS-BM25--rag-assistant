As carriage return/line feed (CR/LF) might cause issues depending on the system, I suggest to store the matrix "inline" or in raster-style with a short header to specify your convention, a versioning number (you might change your mind later, and increase the version), etc. and at least the matrix size, and the rest in some text format (CSV,TSV). This is similar to what is done in the portable gray map or bitmap image format. I used that to store text filter bank coefficients . A minimum example could be: 2,3,0.1,1.2,2.3,3.4,4.5,5.6 for the $2\times 3$ matrix: \begin{array} 0.1&1.2&2.3\\3.4&4.5&5.6 \end{array} but you can use for instance #2,#3,0.1,1.2,2.3,3.4,4.5,5.6 so that aliens (think about the golden Pioneer plaque ) understand that the first two integers are "different" and provide hints on how the following numbers should be read. With a square matrix (typical of symmetrical matrices), this is even more interesting, as you only need one header number #n (the side) and the acute readers will see that the remaining numbers are in $n^2$ quantity. You can also have a look at other Matrix Storage Schemes , and if your matrix is sparse, Compressed Row Storage (CRS) .
