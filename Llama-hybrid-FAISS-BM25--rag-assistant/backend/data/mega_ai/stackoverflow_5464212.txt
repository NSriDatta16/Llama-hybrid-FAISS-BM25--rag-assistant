jQuery fullcalendar plugin in MVC3 page. Updating data in Ajax style

I have an editable fullcalendar grid with a few events, hidden submit form. hijaxed submit callback function and ActionMethod that suppose to return some JsonResult. The goal is - when user drags-n-drops an event from one day to other, form submits its data to the server, server checks validity of changed data and returns a result. So basically fullcalendar provides eventDrop event, that I can use like that: eventDrop: function(event,dayDelta,minuteDelta,allDay,revertFunc) { $("form[action$='UpdateCalendar']").submit(); } and with snippet like this I can change the submit behavior: $(document).ready(function () { $("form[action$='UpdateCalendar']").submit(function (){ ... Here the data should be serialized and sent to the server. ... }); return false; // to override default form submitting behavior } The questions is. How to obtain and serialize events array on fullcalendar grid, that was already rendered and displayed?
