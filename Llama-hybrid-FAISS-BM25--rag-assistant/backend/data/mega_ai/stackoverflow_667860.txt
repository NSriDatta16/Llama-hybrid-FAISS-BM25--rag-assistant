If you are developing a WinForms application, a subtle "leak" is the Control.AllowDrop property (used to enable Drag and Drop). If AllowDrop is set to "true", the CLR will still hold onto your Control though a System.Windows.Forms.DropTarget . To fix this, make sure your Control 's AllowDrop property is set to false when you no longer need it and the CLR will take care of the rest.
