First, I don't think I make the claim that the treatment is switching 'on' and 'off' in the referenced research. I simply state in other posts that the "generalized" difference-in-differences estimator may accommodate intermittent exposures. The papers you cite investigate the effects of a staggered treatment. Treated countries adopt at widely different times. Some start early. Some start late. However, none of the treatments 'turn off' over time according to my understanding, though this estimator may accommodate a reversal of treatment. In my understanding of Dasgupta's work, once a country adopts a leniency law it remains in effect for the entire duration of the panel. Once you decompose the "generalized" DD estimator you'll find out it's actually a weighted average of (1) comparisons between early-adopters and late-adopters over the periods when the late-adopters have yet to be treated, (2) comparisons between early-adopters and late-adopters over the periods when the early adopters were already treated , and (3) comparisons between different timing groups (e.g., early-adopters or later-adopters) and the never-treated group, assuming you even have a group of never-receivers. Note how a treated entity doesn't just drop out of the model once it's treated at time $t$ . Previously treated entities still serve as counterfactuals for those treated much later. So the variation comes from comparing treated firms with untreated firms, but also in the timing impact of the laws. It actually exploits all possible two-group/two-period (2x2) comparisons present in your data. Now it's important to note that the causal estimand is plausibly unbiased if we assume constant treatment effects. However, if effects change over time, especially for the early-receivers, then it may completely offset the stability of the trends as the late-receivers become eligible for treatment. For example, the immediate effect of a law is likely different than the effects observed downstream. If we suspect strong treatment effect heterogeneity, then the "changes" in treatment effects from all the 2x2 comparisons get subtracted from the overall DD estimate. The result is actually a "variance-weighted" average of cross-group treatment effects where some of the weights may be negative. One of the major implications is your least squares estimate may place undue weight on entities with more variation in their treatment status. Thus, the entities exposed to a treatment very early may receive less weight than those treated later in the sample period. Andrew Goodman-Bacon (2019) delves into this decomposition in far more detail here . The authors you cite may have circumvented this problem by subjecting the early- and late-adopter firms to different analyses. For example, you could try running a simple 2x2 DD equation on the subset of early- and late-adopter firmsâ€”separately. But given that the timing of leniency laws vary so widely across jurisdictions, I don't think it's a worthwhile endeavor. I agree with you that their plots of the "group trends" is suspicious at first blush. It's hard to define the periods surrounding the event year when the adoption periods vary widely across treated countries . Is it possible to know when a control firm is 2 periods before their event if they never espoused the new law? Well, they state the following in Section 3 on page 2600: [T]he control firms are all firms in the same industry in countries that had not passed a leniency law in the 7 years surrounding the event date. In my estimation, they used firms in the non-adopter countries but in the same industry to create the control group trend. In other words, they're assuming the untreated firms in the same SIC3 industry would have adopted the law around the same time as the treated firms in the same SIC3 industry. Typically in event study frameworks we plot the coefficient values and not the raw trends across treatment/control groups. Thus, it doesn't appear to be a formal "pre-trends" test in my opinion. Their assessment of the parallel evolution of the trends seems rather ad hoc in my estimation, but warranted given the staggered nature of their treatment.
