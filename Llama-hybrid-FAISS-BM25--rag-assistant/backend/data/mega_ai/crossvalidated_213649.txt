You seem to be doing pairwise analysis when you in fact have three variables. This way you may miss cointegrating relationships that are not pairwise but involve more variables. The standard way in modelling of cointegrated variables is to use all the variables you have if they are integrated of the same order. Now to answer your questions, Yes, include all three variables in VAR modelling and cointegration testing. Yes, it is an acceptable method. You can find it used, e.g., in Pfaff (2008), p. 149 or in the vignette of "vars" package in R, p. 17. Johansen procedure as implemented in function ca.jo will help you find the number of cointegrating vectors. Take the output of ca.jo , start with $r=0$ and see if you can reject the null hypothesis of $r=0$ using the test statistic and the critical values reported in the output. If you reject, move to $r=1$ and upwards until you cannot reject. The first rank that you cannot reject is the number of cointegrating vectors. If you can reject all of them, all of your series appear to be stationary. In general, any modern time series textbook should include a section on cointegration testing using Johansen procedure; just follow it. Update (for the updated OP) Neglecting cointegration relationships beyond pairwise ones may lead to omitted variable bias -- because you would be omitting error correction terms associated with the neglected cointegrating vectors. Cannot understand the question, sorry. If the variables are truly integrated, you cannot have $r=m$ for $m$ being the number of time series in the system. In a three-variable case, $r=2$ is the highest rank; $r=3$ already implies the variables are not integrated to begin with. References Pfaff, Bernhard.
