Cross Domain JavaScript parent location setting firefox error

Here is the case: page A contains iframe B, B contains iframe C, A and B are under the same domain, C under another. C tries to reset parent B's location with extra information following "#" to solve cross domain communication using Fragment Id Messaging. IE6/7/8 just works fine with this case, while Firefox blocks parent.location setting with error message [ Access to property denied" code: "1010 ]. But if B is the top window, meaning there is no A, Firefox lives too. It's strange to me... Could you guys please help? Thank you!
