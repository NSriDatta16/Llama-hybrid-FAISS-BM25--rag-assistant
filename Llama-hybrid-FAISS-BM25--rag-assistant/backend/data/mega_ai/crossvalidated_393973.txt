Analyse sensitivity of hyper-parameters of Machine Learning Models

I want to analyse how sensitive my non neural net machine learning models are to the choice of the different parameters. I am currently using grid search to tune the models. Is there any method that I can use to get a good measure of the sensitivity of my models? Also, is there any quantitative method that gives me a measure of this?
