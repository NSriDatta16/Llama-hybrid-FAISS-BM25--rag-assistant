I wonder if part of the reason might be historical (apparently Hinton's 2006 paper showed it done this way), and because (I believe) it was/is common to tie the weights. I.e. the decoder is using the same weights as the encoder, and they are effectively being learned together. This question and answer https://stackoverflow.com/q/36889732/841830 discuss the advantages of using tied weights. And some more background here: https://amiralavi.net/blog/2018/08/25/tied-autoencoders
