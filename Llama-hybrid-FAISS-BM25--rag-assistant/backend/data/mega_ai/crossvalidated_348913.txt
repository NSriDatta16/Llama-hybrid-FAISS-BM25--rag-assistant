The parameterisation you are looking at is a way of expressing the beta prior distribution based on the prior mean $y_0$ and the prior strength $n_0$ . The latter is also commonly regarded as the number of "pseudo-data points" attributable to the prior belief, for reasons that will become obvious below. To see the use of this parameterisation more clearly, consider a Bayesian conjugate analysis where we observe a binomial random variable with a beta prior for its probability parameter. Using the parameterisation in your question, this yields the conjugate model: $$\begin{equation} \begin{aligned} \text{Prior} \quad \quad \quad \theta &\sim \text{Beta}(n_0, y_0), \\[10pt] \text{Sample} \quad \quad X|\theta &\sim \text{Bin}(n,\theta), \\[6pt] \text{Posterior} \quad \quad \theta|x &\sim \text{Beta} \Big( n_0+n, \frac{n_0}{n_0+n} \cdot y_0 + \frac{n}{n_0+n} \cdot \frac{x}{n} \Big). \end{aligned} \end{equation}$$ As can be seen from this model, the prior begins with $n_0$ pseudo-data points and then the data adds $n$ actual data points to this, giving posterior strength $n_0+n$ . The posterior mean is updated as a weighted average of the prior mean $y_0$ and the observed sample proportion $x/n$ , where the respective weights are the proportion of pseudo-data points and the proportion of actual data points (which depend on $n_0$ and $n$ ).
