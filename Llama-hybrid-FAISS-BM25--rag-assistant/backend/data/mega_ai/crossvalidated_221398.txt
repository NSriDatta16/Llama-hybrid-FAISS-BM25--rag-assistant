It is a theoretical result, at least for linear regression. Indeed, if one computes the so-called ''prediction error'' ( see this link, slide 11 ), one can easily see that the further the independent variable $x$ is away from the sample average $\bar{x}$ (and for extrapolation one may be far away), the larger the prediction error. In the link that I referred to one can also see that in a graphical way.
