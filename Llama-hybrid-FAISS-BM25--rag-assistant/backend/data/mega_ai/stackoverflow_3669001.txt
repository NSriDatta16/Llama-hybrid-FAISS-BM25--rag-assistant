Getting ssh-agent to work with git run from windows command shell

I have msysgit installed, with OpenSSH. I am connecting to a gitosis repo. From the git bash, I have created a .profile file that runs ssh-agent (if not already running) each time git bash is opened, using this script SSH_ENV=$HOME/.ssh/environment function start_agent { echo "Initialising new SSH agent..." /usr/bin/ssh-agent | sed 's/^echo/#echo/' > ${SSH_ENV} echo succeeded chmod 600 ${SSH_ENV} . ${SSH_ENV} > /dev/null /usr/bin/ssh-add; } # Source SSH settings, if applicable if [ -f "${SSH_ENV}" ]; then . ${SSH_ENV} > /dev/null #ps ${SSH_AGENT_PID} doesn't work under cywgin ps -ef | grep ${SSH_AGENT_PID} | grep ssh-agent$ > /dev/null || { start_agent; } else start_agent; fi I am also using git extensions, which runs the git command from the Windows command prompt, not git bash. So, ssh doesn't see the ssh-agent that is running. Is it possible to fix this?
