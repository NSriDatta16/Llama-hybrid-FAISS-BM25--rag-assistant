$query1/2 and $result1/2 can be overwritten very easily by calling them with the same name. It will not make any problem at all. Also mysql result vars are very heavy. To check if a variable is empty there's a php native function that also check if the variable is equal to NULL, '', or is not set at all: empty($var) . I'd use it for the first part of your code instead of $var == '' that is not elegant neither. Also mysql_num_rows() returns an integer, and you are comparing that result with a string with value "1". I'd correct it with: mysql_num_rows($result) == 1 . We have also the problem of echo "deny"; exit; wich can be replaced with exit('deny'); I still doubt that a page takes 3 minutes to load, maybe 3 secs?
