Ragged headlines within justified text

I am creating a pdf file with Latex via pdflatex and want to have have headlines with ragged text, while the rest of the document should use justified text. This gives me an error (! LaTeX Error: Something's wrong--perhaps a missing \item ): \usepackage{ragged2e} .. \flushleft \chapter{Something} \justifying And this one messes up the vertical spacing: {\raggedright{\chapter{Something}}} Any idea here? Thanks in advance!
