Imagine your job is to forecast the number of Americans that will die from various causes next year. A reasonable place to start your analysis might be the National Vital Statistics Data final death data for 2014. The assumption is that 2017 might look roughly like 2014. You'll find that approximately 2,626,000 Americans died in 2014: 614,000 died of heart disease. 592,000 died of cancer. 147,000 from respiratory disease. 136,000 from accidents. ... 42,773 from suicide. 42,032 from accidental poisoning (subset of accidents category). 15,809 from homicide. 0 from terrorism under the CDC, NCHS classification . 18 from terrorism using a broader definition (University of Maryland Global Terrorism Datbase) See link for definitions. By my quick count, 0 of the perpetrators of these 2014 attacks were born outside the United States. Note that anecdote is not the same as data, but I've assembled links to the underlying news stories here: 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , and 9 . Terrorist incidents in the U.S. are quite rare, so estimating off a single year is going to be problematic. Looking at the time-series, what you see is that the vast majority of U.S. terrorism fatalities came during the 9/11 attacks (See this report from the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism.) I've copied their Figure 1 below: Immediately you see that you have an outlier, rare events problem. A single outlier is driving the overall number. If you're trying to forecast deaths from terrorism, there are numerous issues: What counts as terrorism? Terrorism can be defined broadly or narrowly. Is the process stationary ? If we take a time-series average, what are we estimating? Are conditions changing? What does a forecast conditional on current conditions look like? If the vast majority of deaths come from a single outlier, how do you reasonably model that? We can get more data in a sense by looking more broadly at other countries and going back further in time but then there are questions as to whether any of those patterns apply in today's world. IMHO, the FT graphic picked an overly narrow definition (the 9/11 attacks don't show up in the graphic because the attackers weren't refugees). There are legitimate issues with the chart, but the FT's broader point is correct that terrorism in the U.S. is quite rare. Your chance of being killed by a foreign born terrorist in the United States is close to zero. Life expectancy in the U.S. is about 78.7 years. What has moved life expectancy numbers down in the past has been events like the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic or WWII. Additional risks to life expectancy now might include obesity and opioid abuse. If you're trying to create a detailed estimate of terrorism risk, there are huge statistical issues, but to understand the big picture requires not so much statistics as understanding orders of magnitude and basic quantitative literacy. A more reasonable concern... (perhaps veering off topic) Looking back at history, the way huge numbers of people get killed is through disease, genocide, and war. A more reasonable concern might be that some rare, terrorist event triggers something catastrophic (eg. how the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand help set off WWI.) Or one could worry about nuclear weapons in the hands of someone crazy. Thinking about extremely rare but catastrophic events is incredibly difficult. It's a multidisciplinary pursuit and goes far outside of statistics. Perhaps the only statistical point here is that it's hard to estimate the probability and effects of some event which hasn't happened? (Except to say that it can't be that common or it would have happened already.)
