The real answer probably has less to do with Perl than you think. Many of the things that happen are accidents of history. At the time, way back when, Perl was pretty popular, Java was getting more popular, not too many people were paying attention to Python, and Ruby was just getting started. The people who needed to get work done used Perl and made some libraries in Perl, and other people started using those libraries. Once people start using something that is moderately useful to them, they tend not to switch (economists call those "switching costs"). From there, even more people start using it because a lot of other people are using it. The same evolution might not happen today. I'd say that Perl, Python, and Ruby are all completely adequate and up to the task. All the things that mobrule quotes from Lincoln Stein could apply to any of the three today. If everyone had to start from scratch today, any one of those languages could be the one that everyone uses. I've noticed, from my own client base though (a very small and unrepresentative sample of biotech), that the people pushing the programming for a lot of the biological stuff seemed to be at least part-time sysadmins who were supporting scientists. The scientists worried about the science and did some light programming, but the IT support people were doing a lot of the heavy lifting for the non-science parts. Perl is very well positioned as a sysadmin tool since it's the duct-tape of the internet.
