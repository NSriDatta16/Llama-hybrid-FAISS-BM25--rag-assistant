Modelling Length of Hospital Stay, Poisson Regression or Cox Regression Analysis

I would like to find out what people thought about the better or more widely accepted way to model hospital Length of Stay (LOS) is? LOS can be thought of as count data (number of days) with a right-skew (most patients are discharged in the first few days, then there're stragglers with late discharges), or as survival data (time to event of discharge).
