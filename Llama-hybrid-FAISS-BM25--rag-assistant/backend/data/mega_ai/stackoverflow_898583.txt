Face Palm!!!! Floats are 32 bit numbers stored as mantissa and exponents. I am not 100% sure how MySql will split the storage but taking Java as an example they would use 24 bits for a signed mantissa and 8 bits for an exponent (scientific notation). This means that the maximum value a FLOAT can have is +8388608*10^127 and the minimum is -8388608*10^127. This means only 7 significant digits, and my FLOAT definition used 8. We are going to switch all of these 8,2 to DOUBLE from FLOAT.
