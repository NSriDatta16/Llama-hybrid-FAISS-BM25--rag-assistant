The 32bit vs 64bit refers to the JVM itself, as well as some core libraries. So the 64bit JavaSE download is the JavaSE runtime on top of a 64 bit JVM. On top of that, the majority of the JavaSE APIs and libraries are not specific to 32bit or 64bit. JavaEE runs on top of JavaSE, and so it's not 32bit-64bit specific. So, pick the JavaSE appropriate to your environment, and don't worry about it for JavaEE.
