I would use a UITableView and expand and collapse items further down the tree. You can set an indentation level for each UITableViewCell as it is displayed, depending on its position in the tree. You would need to keep track of which items in the tree are expanded/visible in order to always provide the tree with the correct data. I just did just that for a project. Unfortunately I am not at liberty to share the full code. But it should not be terribly hard to write. Let us know if you find an out-of-the-box solution.
