400 positive and 13000 negative: how to split dataset up (train, test, validation)

Working on a medical diagnostic convolutional neural networking problem, and it's not obvious (to me) how the dataset should be split up. Do I have enough data to split it in 3, or should I just have train and validation? What proportion of images should I put in each? (research article links appreciated :])
