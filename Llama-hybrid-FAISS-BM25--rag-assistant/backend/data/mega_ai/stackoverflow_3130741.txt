What are the advantages and disadvantages of CSS variables?

I'm faced with a business requirement that I believe may be solved by implementing CSS variables. Basically, while the front-end developers on this project are in charge of CSS implementation, the designer wants to be able to introduce different "themes" for the site. By swapping one theme for another, a range of changes (such as font-size, font color, border width, etc) can be made without having to change too much code. Currently we're trying to fit this requirement by splitting up the styling of components into different CSS files - e.g. one for layout, one for typography, one for colors, etc. But I don't like this approach. It makes the CSS quite unmaintainable, and it's difficult to separate out all the CSS for one particular component, which is becoming a frequent requirement. I'm hoping to instead introduce a standard set of "variables", which can be tied to a particular theme. The CSS will be pre-processed and the variables will be swapped for the actual value depending on the theme used. This will enable us developers to organize our code most effectively, while still keeping it flexible enough to be customized according to the designer's tastes. Any thoughts on the pro's/con's of this?
