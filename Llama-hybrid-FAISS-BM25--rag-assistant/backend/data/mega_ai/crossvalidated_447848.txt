Can I do a Post hoc analysis of predicted vs. ground truth data?

I developed a fully-connected neural network that predicts values based on regression. Is it possible to do post hoc analysis (e.g. Tukey HSD) on these predicted values to find pairwise differences in means? Is there a test besides Tukey that would be valid on predicted vs. sampled data? The model was trained using actual ground truth.
