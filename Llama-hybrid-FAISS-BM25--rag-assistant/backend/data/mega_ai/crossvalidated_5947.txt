You're really asking for instruction in combinatorics , which is a vast field. For this particular problem, a good method, if somewhat abstract, is to use generating functions . The probability generating function (pgf) for a d$n$, where $n = 1, 2, \ldots$, is obtained by averaging $n$ variables. Their names don't matter, so let's call them $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$. The pgf for $k$ rolls is just the $k^{\text{th}}$ power of the pgf for 1 roll. So, if you expand $$\left(\frac{x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n}{n}\right)^k$$ you can read the answer to any question by inspecting the coefficients. For example, to find the probability of rolling a full house (three of one number, two of another) in Yahtzee ($n=6, k=5$) look at all the terms in $((x_1 + \cdots + x_6)/6)^5$ involving a third power and a second power. There are 15 of them, each with the coefficient 5/3888, and each counts distinctly different outcomes, so the chance of a full house is the sum of these chances, equal to 15*5/3888. It's straightforward to write code that multiplies and adds polynomials of this sort. The number of calculations for seven rolls of your d6 is just a few thousand, far smaller than the hundreds of thousands needed to enumerate and tally all possible combinations. Mathematical analysis of generating functions often gives closed-form formulas for the coefficients. Many examples are available; you can check some of them out on the math site .
