Logistic regression with year as covariate

I am trying to investigate factors associated with disease in 2 different years (2013 and 2014) and would like to include year as one of the variables too. Would the normal logistic regression approach work on such data? Data sample provided where the values are arranged and coded as per year. x are continuous variables, year 1= 2013, 2=2014,Yes.No13.14 simly means 0=no disease, 1=disease present. x Year Yes.No.13.14 155 1 0 150 2 0 740 1 0 760 2 1 100 1 0 850 2 0 163 1 1 152 2 1 0 1 0 460 2 0 130 1 0 133 2 1 450 1 0
