Is there any supervised-learning problem that (deep) neural networks obviously couldn't outperform any other methods?

I have seen people have put a lot of efforts on SVM and Kernels, and they look pretty interesting as a starter in Machine Learning. But if we expect that almost-always we could find outperforming solution in terms of (deep) Neural Network, what is the meaning of trying other methods in this era? Here is my constraint on this topic. We think of only Supervised-Learnings; Regression, and Classification. Readability of the Result is not counted; only the Accuracy on the Supervised-Learning Problem counts. Computational-Cost is not in consideration. I am not saying that any other methods are useless.
