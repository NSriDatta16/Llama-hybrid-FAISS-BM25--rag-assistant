Physical organization of bounded context/aggregates

In the context of DDD how is everyone physically structuring their files/folders when it comes to bounded context and aggregate roots? Does there need to be a physical representation of these or is it more just for discussions? I've tried to find evans and nilsson say something about physical layout but either I missed it or they don't discuss it. I'm assuming you can't really represent bounded context in a physical layout as certain classes may be involved in multiple bounded contexts, but it still asks the question of aggregates and how you lay them out.
