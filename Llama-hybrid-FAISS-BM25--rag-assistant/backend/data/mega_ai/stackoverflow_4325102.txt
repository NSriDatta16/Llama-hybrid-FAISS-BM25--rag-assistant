If you don't want to use any other libraries then you have to do a lot of work yourself. For example, suppose you have a class with one function that you want to test: class Foo { public int bar(int input); } You can now write a test class: class TestFoo { public void testBarPositive() { Foo foo = new Foo(); System.out.println(foo.bar(5) == 7); } public void testBarNegative() { Foo foo = new Foo(); System.out.println(foo.bar(-5) == -7); } public static void main(String[] args) { TestFoo t = new TestFoo(); t.testBarPositive(); t.testBarNegative(); } } This is a very basic example but it shows you how you could write your own unit tests. That said, I strongly recommend using a library like JUnit. It gives you a lot for free and removes a huge amount of boiler-plate code that you would have to write yourself. It also generates nice reports and (when combined with something like Cobertura) can give you a fairly comprehensive view of how complete your testing is.
