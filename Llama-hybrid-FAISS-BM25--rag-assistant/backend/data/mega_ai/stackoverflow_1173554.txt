When I hit situations like this, I usually a combination of conditional compilation and environment variable / reg key. You can use these storage mechanisms to host your information without hard coding it into the application. #if DEBUG if ( null != Environment.GetVariable("CUSTOM_INFO")) { userName = Environment.GetVariable("CUSTOM_USERNAME"); ... } #endif This way it won't affect any other developers. Unless of course, they want to accomplish the same thing.
