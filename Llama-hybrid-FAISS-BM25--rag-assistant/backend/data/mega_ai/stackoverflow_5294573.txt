You can feed a configuration script to asadmin, that contains asadmin subcommands like deploy and create-jdbc-resource, etc... The 'language' does not have any real flow-of-control or looping constructs, so you would need to flatten those types of things out of the script that would get called by your dot-bat or dot-sh. If you are really leveraging jacl/jython this might not be possible... but if you aren't putting these interpreters through their paces, the asadmin 'language' may be rich enough for you.
