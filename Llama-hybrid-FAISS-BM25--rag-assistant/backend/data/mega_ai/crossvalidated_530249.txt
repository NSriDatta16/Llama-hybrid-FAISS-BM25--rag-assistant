Quantitative/statistical comparison of two orderings/permutations

There is a couple, say, Theresa and Robert. They assess their preferences on 5 books by ranking them from the most attractive to the least one. Theresa: [0,4,3,2,1] Robert: [1,4,3,2,0] What would be the metric that would quantify if they have similar preferences or not? Ideally also with some statistical justification (not necessary). Attempt so far: Number of necessary moves/edit distance for an order. [0,4,3,2,1] [4,0,3,2,1] [4,3,0,2,1] [4,3,2,0,1] [4,3,2,1,0] [4,3,1,2,0] [4,1,3,2,0] [1,4,3,2,0] Maybe, it relates to bubble sort exchanges . I need 7 swaps to get there. The question is how can I say if 7 is too much or too little (statistically significant or not).
