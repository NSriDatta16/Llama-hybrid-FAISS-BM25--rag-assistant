When is LASSO better in dimension reduction?

Are there any cases that it is better to use Lasso for dimension reduction in comparison to other methods such as PCA/ Kernel PCA/ LLE and ISOMAP and SPECTRAL EMBEDDING? Can you add an example (most preferably in R) to show its benefits over the other methods?
