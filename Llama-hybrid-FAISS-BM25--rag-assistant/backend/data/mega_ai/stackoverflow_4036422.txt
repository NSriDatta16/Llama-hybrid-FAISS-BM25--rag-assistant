You do not need to call the destructor explicitly. This is done automatically at the end of the scope of the object ob2 , i.e. at the end of the main function. Furthermore, since the object has automatic storage, its storage doesn’t have to be deleted. This, too, is done automatically at the end of the function. Calling destructors manually is almost never needed (only in low-level library code) and deleting memory manually is only needed (and only a valid operation) when the memory was previously acquired using new (when you’re working with pointers). Since manual memory management is prone to leaks, modern C++ code tries not to use new and delete explicitly at all. When it’s really necessary to use new , then a so-called “smart pointer” is used instead of a regular pointer.
