If we're talking minimize expected score, you are in effect comparing a multiple of the means of two geometric distributions. In each case you keep failing until you succeed, with constant probability of success, and the number of rounds you fail before you succeed determines the expected score. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_distribution For group 1, when you fail, you add on average $\frac{0.5\times 5+0.25\times 10}{0.5+0.25}=\frac{20}{3}$ to the score. For group 2, when you fail, you add on average $\frac{0.1\times 5+0.3\times 15+0.1\times 25}{0.1+0.3+0.1}=15$ to the score. For group 1, on average you fail $\frac{1-p_1}{p_1} = \frac{.75}{.25} = 3$ times before you succeed. For group 2, on average you fail $\frac{1-p_2}{p_2} = \frac{.5}{.5} = 1$ times before you succeed. So your expected score at success for group 1 is 20. Your expected score at success for group 2 is 15. Similar calculations can be done for other setups.
