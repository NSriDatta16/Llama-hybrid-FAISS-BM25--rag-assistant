How to properly send 406 status code?

I'm developing a RESTful API service which initially will only be accepting and responding in JSON format. I want to follow standards and in case of requester's Accept header was different than JSON I want to respond with 406 HTTP status code to inform the requester I cannot output data in other format. According to W3 I "SHOULD include an entity containing a list of available entity characteristics and location(s) from which the user or user agent can choose the one most appropriate" in my response. How do I do that, because the above explanation doesn't tell me much. What is the mentioned entity ? Any ideas/suggestions? EDIT Initially I thought that maybe could be a comma separated list in Content-Type header but after rethinking maybe I should do the same thing browsers do and use Accept header? This makes much more sense actually, but I cannot find any information to support this.
