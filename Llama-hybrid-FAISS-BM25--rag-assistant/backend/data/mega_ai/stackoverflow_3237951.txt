You have to follow below steps Create a class with date and trv property Craete a list of above class Read the file using IO classes. Read in chunks and convert to string Split whole string by "DATE" and trim Split by space (" ") The first item would be your date. Convert all other items to float and find average. Add it to list. Now you have a list of daily average. You can persist it to disk and query it for your required data. EDIT you have edited your question and now it looks totaly diffrent. I think you need help in parsing the file. Correct me if i am wrong.
