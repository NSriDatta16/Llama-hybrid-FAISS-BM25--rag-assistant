That paper seems to be talking about a really specific case where things are likely to go wrong with model misspecification. If it was true in general that you shouldn't control for non-confounding covariates, then there wouldn't be block designs . Since this question was asked, an xkcd comic appeared with the setup: "But if you control for too many variables, your choices will shape the data, and you'll mislead yourself" I honestly don't get the "shaping the data" part, but it was a popular comic and if I had to guess, it's probably a combination of the concerns: Wrong model assumptions on the covariate relationship Controlling for something that doesn't make sense For 1, the article talks about a "U-shape" relationship between the response and the covariate, which, when using a linear model, is model misspecification. For the other parameters, there's no bias if variables are uncorrelated in a linear regression, and I believe there is bias in a nonlinear model (incl. logistic regression) even if the variables are uncorrelated. Of course with OLS you're getting the best linear approximation to the non-linear case, and I would expect the bias to be mild even with correlation. For 2, this is where drawing the causal directed graph helps because you can see things that don't make sense to "control for" (in the sense of holding them constant) when you're interested in cause and effect: namely intermediate causes (aka "mediators") and downstream effects from the cause of interest (aka "colliders"). However, I'd point out that putting both colliders and mediators in your model is a great way to increase the passive predictive ability of your model , if that's what you're after. Even if you're interested in strictly the causal case, the benefits of going after non-confounding covariates is reducing residual error, thus giving you more power to detect treatment effects that you wouldn't be able to otherwise.
