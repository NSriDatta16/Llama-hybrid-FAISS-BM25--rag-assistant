Why do we sometimes define likelihood as $p(\textbf{T}|\textbf{X},w)$ and sometimes as $p(\textbf{X}, \textbf{T}|w)$?

Let's suppose we have a dataset $\mathcal{D}=(\textbf{X}, \textbf{T})$ where $\textbf{X}$ are the samples and $\textbf{T}$ are the targets. We want to find $w$ such that the likelihood is maximized. When doing this sort of exercises in my Machine Learning course, we sometime define likelihood as $p(\textbf{T}|\textbf{X},w)$ whereas sometimes we define it as $p(\textbf{X},\textbf{T}|w)$ . Why is this a legitimate thing to do? Shouldn't the likelihood be just the latter, since our dataset is composed by both $\textbf{X}$ and $\textbf{T}$ ? Is there a mathematical reason why we can do this, or is it just a matter of defining it in the easiest way depending on the context?
