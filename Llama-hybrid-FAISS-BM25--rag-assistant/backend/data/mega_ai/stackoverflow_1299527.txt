MSDN define the aliasing as the use of multiple names that refer to the same memory location. The #pragma directive used to control this optimization in VS.NET has disappeared since VS.2005. It seems that the __restrict keyword and restrict and noalias __declspec modifiers, used to annotate variables and functions, could do the same job.
