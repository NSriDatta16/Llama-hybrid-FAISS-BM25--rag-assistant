Random Projections and separability

I am new to machine learning and I am considering the following problem: Suppose you have clusters of points in $\mathbb{R}^N$ with $N$ large. The Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma specifies how distances between points are preserved when reducing dimensionality. But what if I don't care about distances and I am only interested in keeping the clusters separate when projecting to one single dimension. Which condition should hold on the clusters for a random projections from $\mathbb{R}^N$ to $\mathbb{R}$ to be able to avoid the points in the cluster to overlap? Is there a result defining these conditions?
