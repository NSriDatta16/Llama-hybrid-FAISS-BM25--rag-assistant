I believe Shao's article applies most effectively to situations where a person is trying to eliminate predictors from a model (whether linear or non-linear, such as machine learning, etc.), and he recommends using Monte Carlo CV ( MCCV ) in this case. On the other hand, if you are not worried about the size (number of factors/predictors) in your model, LOOCV might be a shorter and somewhat more intuitive method, which is probably why it is used and accepted so widely.
