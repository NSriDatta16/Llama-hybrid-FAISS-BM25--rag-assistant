They mean that $k$ -NN does not directly learn any functional form of the description of the data, but instead during prediction time it returns a sample ( $k=1$ ), or average of the samples ( $k>1$ ), that are closest to your test example. It does not have any "global" knowledge of the function, but can only give you the "local" examples, that are samples from the underlying function.
