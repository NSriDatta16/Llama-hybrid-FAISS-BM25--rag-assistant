Either UIImage* anImage = [UIImage imageNamed:@"Button"]; // without the extension or UIImage* anImage = [UIImage imageNamed:@"Button.png"]; // with the extension will work on iOS4, since apple basically discourage you from using any other image than PNG you can omit the exertion. Both work for @2x.png files as well. Make sure the @2x files have been added to your project.
