Differentiate between two set of points

Consider two sets of points (in the pictures below), whose " center of gravity " is same . What measure can differentiate between the two sets? e.g. Image 1 and 2 has both 16 points, whose average comes to the same point for both the sets. I wanted to know what measure can be used to differentiate between the both. How can I say points in image 2 are more cohesive compared to the other. (not sure if "cohesive" is the correct term for this, but I hope you get the idea) I dont want to use k-means because it will too expensive to calculate the clusters for every sets, and I have around millions of them.
