elegant way of clearing an events

i am implementing a Buthon_Click Method, which as the name suggests is being used with an event onclick button.Now in order this method to do what i want i need to clear/unbind/unsubscribe the delegate attached to the SystemEvents.SessionSwitch event.The problem is that i want to do this without caring which method has been hooked up before. For an example: SystemEvents.SessionSwitch += new SessionSwitchEventHandler(Methodx); So what i am doing now is creating a foreach and going through all possibilities - 4 overall: int [] array={1,2,3,4}; foreach (int n in array) { SystemEvents.SessionSwitch -= new SessionSwitchEventHandler(SystemEvents_SessionSwitch1); SystemEvents.SessionSwitch -= new SessionSwitchEventHandler(SystemEvents_SessionSwitch2); SystemEvents.SessionSwitch -= new SessionSwitchEventHandler(SystemEvents_SessionSwitch3); SystemEvents.SessionSwitch -= new SessionSwitchEventHandler(SystemEvents_SessionSwitch4); } i find this peace of code a bit cumbersome and awkward , and i was wondering if there is a more "elegant" way of doing this something like just SystemEvents.SessionSwitch == null or similar which would wipe out all methods hooked up ? Thanks in advance
