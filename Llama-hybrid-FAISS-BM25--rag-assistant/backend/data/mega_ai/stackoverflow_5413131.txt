these aren't the only code that you need. you will need: FileTextBox.AllowDrop = true; FileTextBox.DragEnter += new DragEventHandler (FileTextBox_DragEnter); FileTextBox.DragDrop += new DragEventHandler (FileTextBox_DragDrop); Of course, if you're using an IDE, you can achieve this by assigning the handlers in the form designer.
