Is a radioactive process describable by survival analysis?

According to this source , the survival function is defined as $ S(t) = e^{- \lambda \cdot t} $ while, according to this source , the number at time $ t $ of radioactive atoms is $ N(t) = N_0 \cdot e^{- \lambda \cdot t } $ which is quite the same, or? In general, survival analysis is described as Survival analysis is a branch of statistics for analyzing the expected duration of time until one event occurs, such as death in biological organisms and failure in mechanical systems. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_analysis I just wonder, why I can't see any hint towards the radioactive decay , nor any assignment of radioactive decay to survival analysis, though I browsed for a while. Is there something different between them?
