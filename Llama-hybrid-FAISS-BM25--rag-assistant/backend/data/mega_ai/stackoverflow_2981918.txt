UIWebView action sheet popup on a link - customization

I'm trying to replace or add more options into the action sheet popup in uiwebview. When touching long touch on a link standard uiwebview popup shows up. I saw some apps which did it, but i can't figure it out. the standard options are : open or copy, i want to hide copy and add send email. Any help ? Thanks Albert
