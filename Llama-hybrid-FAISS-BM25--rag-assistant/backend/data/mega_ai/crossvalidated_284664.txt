This looks like a situation where going Bayesian makes sense. You have very few positive cases and if you're only interested in the parameter estimates to suggest some directions for future work, a full presentation of the uncertainty associated with those estimates is going to be important, IMO. You might also consider a little bit of regularisation with e.g. a Cauchy prior on the non-intercept parameters. rstanarm will do Bayesian LR for you in one line of code and it will probably take less than a second to run for this example. If you want some help with it, include your data somewhere and I'll have a look.
