If the Service and Activity classes are in the same package, I believe they should be able to access the same private storage space. I would put them in the same package since they are part of the same overall application structure. Bundle the data into an Intent's extras as Key-value pairs and start the activity. Intent intent = new Intent(this, SecondActivity.class); Bundle b = new Bundle(); // see Bundle.putInt, etc. // Bundle.putSerializable for full Objects (careful there) b.putXXXXX("key", ITEM); intent.putExtras(b); startActivity(intent); // -- later, in Activity Bundle b = this.getIntent().getExtras(); int i = b.getInt("key");
