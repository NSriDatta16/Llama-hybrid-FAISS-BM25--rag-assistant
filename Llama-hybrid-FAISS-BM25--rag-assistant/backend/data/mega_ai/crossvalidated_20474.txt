Here is what I would do, in a two-steps answer to make things clearer. I suppose you want to compute the annual risk of getting sick (at least once). I propose a simple bootstraping procedure. First, without resampling Using your formula $r = 1- e^{-a d}$, you can compute the risk of disease $r_i$ for each of the 1000 pieces of chicken tested. You can estimate the risk $p$ of disease when eating one piece of chicken as the mean of the $r_i$’s. Here is a piece of code for that: d The result is $p = 6.9 \cdot 10^{-7}$. If you estimate that the average person eats $104$ pieces of chicken a year, her/his probability of disease in a year is $1-(1-p)^{104} \simeq 104 p = 7.17 \cdot 10^{-5}$. Now, let’s resample First, the risk estimation is dependent of your sample of 1000 pieces of chicken. Let’s resample it: d1 Then, model the number of chicken pieces the guy eats in a year by a Poisson $\mathcal P(104)$. N The probability of getting sick in a year is then p2 Just put all that in a loop of length 100000 and record the values, you’ll get a distribution of $p_1$ and $p_2$. You can plot a histogram: You could also fit a Beta distribution on these...
