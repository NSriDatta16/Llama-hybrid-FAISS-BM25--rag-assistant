This snippet (and the ViewModelLocator in general) need work, and it is going to be a major change in V4. Yes, the intent was to merge the Cleanup method generated by the snippet with the one already available. The idea is that you can just call ViewModelLocator.Cleanup() and have all the VMs clean themselves up (for example persisting their state to local storage, closing streams, etc...). Since a snippet cannot modify an existing method, I decided to just duplicate the Cleanup method. It won't compile, so the developer should know to merge them. That said, it is not satisfactory to have a CreateMain, ClearMain etc for each VM type. I think we all agree that this is a weak implementation, and I want to improve it by providing a generic ViewModelLocator in the future (V4). Regarding naming conventions, they are just conventions. I was tired to type "ViewModel", but feel free to use your own convention. As I said, the snippet will probably not be needed in V4 anymore. Apologies in the meantime for the inconvenience ;) (note that you can easily modify the snippet if you want to) Cheers, Laurent
