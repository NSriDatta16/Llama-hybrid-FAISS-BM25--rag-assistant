dijit.layout.TabContainer nested tabs auto load

I'm fairly new to Dojo toolkit, and well really like it. But I have a problem with nested tabs auto-refreshing. Here is a sample of my practice code where this problem exists. I'm currently concerned with this as it introduces a huge performance problem when the sub-tabs are plentiful; ex: my subtabs are the letters A-Z for initials for record retrieval. I've tried all sorts of things to get around this, and all to no avail. parseOnLoad=true/false executeScripts=true/false preload=true/false nested=true/false the parent page: --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- the child page (dojo5.jsp): --- --- ---
