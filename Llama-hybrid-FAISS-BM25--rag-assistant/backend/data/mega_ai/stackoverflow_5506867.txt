liferay enable organization or community by role

I am working on a new liferay implementation. I have all of my users in an external system, and have used the external env. to authenticate through my own authentication system. I also store roles in this same system. I have been able to successfully pass these to liferay so that all of my users roles are available in liferay. I would like to create an organization or community that is associated with a role. For example if I have a role called 'myusers' in my external system, I would like to tie that role to an organization or community in liferay. Then when a user logged in to liferay with that role, they would be able to be part of that organization or community. Is this possible in liferay? I know it's kind of backwards to the normal flow in liferay of adding roles to users and then adding user to a community or organization.
