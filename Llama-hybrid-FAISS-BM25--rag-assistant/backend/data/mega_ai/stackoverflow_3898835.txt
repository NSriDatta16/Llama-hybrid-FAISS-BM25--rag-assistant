This is more of a direction to investigate than an answer: Have you tried listening to the button/touch down event in one list to get the item the use wants to drag, and then listening to the button/touch up event in the other list so that you know what index to insert the item at? In the button/touch down event handler, the View object being touched is passed in. In order to recover the original object that you used to create the View, you can attach it to that view via the setTag() function and recover it from the getTag() function within the event handler. This wouldn't take care of any animation, but might achieve the desired functionality.
