I'm fairly sure the 1st fragment is actually O(n^5). Because: n times, i^2 times, where i is actually half of n (average i for the case, since for each x there is a corresponding n-x that sum to 2n) Which is therefore n^2 / 4 times. (a times) Then, a times again, and when you do: n*a*a, or n*n*n/4*n*n/4 = n^5 / 16, or O(n^5) I believe the second is O(4), because: It's iterated n times. Then it's iterated n*n times, (literally n*n/4, but not in O notation) Then only 1/n are let through by the if (I can't remember how I got this) Then n*n are repeated. So, n*n*n*n*n/n = n^4.
