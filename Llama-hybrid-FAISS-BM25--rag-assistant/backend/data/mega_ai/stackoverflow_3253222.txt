I am able to resolve it by adding this line of code: [self addSubview:object]; before this code: [object setFrame:NSMakeRect(x, y, width, height)]; So CameraIconView now is appearing at dropped location. :) ... but now I am facing a new problem- each time the CameraIconView is dragged and dropped, it is not positioning the dragged CameraIconView to new location, but is creating and showing a new instance within CameraIconEnclosingBox at new location, ie. for the first drag and drop two icons start appearing for the same CameraIconView ... for second drag and drop three icons start appearing and so on.... Can anyone suggest me some way to resolve it? Thanks, Miraaj
