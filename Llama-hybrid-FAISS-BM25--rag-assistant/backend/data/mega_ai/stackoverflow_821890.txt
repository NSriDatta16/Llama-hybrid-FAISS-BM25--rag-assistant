Short Answer: No Edit: Just to clarify I don't think this is a hard question at all. Regardless of the language. As others have posted, even if they can't get the syntax correct, the should at least be able to write it out in a reasonable pseudocode. Long Answer: I often ask interview questions I expect the candidate to miss. One could classify them as too (hard|vague|open-ended), but I am not really looking for an answer. I am looking to see the following: Do they try to answer the question? Some people just give up immediately How do they approach the problem? Even if they go down the wrong path are they generally making good assumptions and asking good questions? How well do they maintain composure under stress? The question is designed to be hard, and therefore will be stressful. Do they panic, remain calm, withdraw, talk it out, etc...? Are they able to find the solution if I give them hints and pointers? Or how well do they listen, and do they assimilate new information quickly? Occasionally I am surprised with a candidate who is whip-smart, and just codes up a quick and elegant solution. Those are definite keepers. But I also find good candidates by people who miss the final solution, but are clearly thoughtful, logical, and given enough time would eventually solve the problem.
