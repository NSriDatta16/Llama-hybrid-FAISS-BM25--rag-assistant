I see WordPerfect has been mentioned, but there's an even better example: MicroPro . They developed WordMaster, the first ever Word Processing software, and then WordStar , which was incredibly successful for DOS. What happened? Windows 3.0 came out. It became popular - ubiquitous, even. MicroPro didn't seem to notice or care. They didn't bother developing a Windows version. They didn't innovate. Eventually they bought and rebranded some other word processing software - but it was too late, Microsoft Word was already out. Ask the average teenager or even twenty-something today; I doubt that any of them have ever heard of MicroPro or WordStar. They went from having one of the most important products ever made , to bust, simply because they waited too long to update their product suite.
