How to write the content of one stream into another stream in .net?

I often run into the problem that I have one stream full of data and want to write everything of it into another stream. All code-examples out there use a buffer in form of a byte-array. Is there a more elegant way to this? If not, what's the ideal size of the buffer. Which factors make up this value?
