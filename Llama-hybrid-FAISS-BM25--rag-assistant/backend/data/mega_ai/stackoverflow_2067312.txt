Coldfusion 8 & Twitter - cffeed unable to read the source URL. Status Code: 400

In Coldfusion 8 Enterprise (8,0,1,195765), the following two lines of code causes this error: Unable to read the source URL. Status Code: 400 Try adding or changing UserAgent attribute in the CFFeed tag Yet, on my development box with Coldfusion 8 Standard (8,0,0,176276), it's working.... Argh. Any ideas why?
