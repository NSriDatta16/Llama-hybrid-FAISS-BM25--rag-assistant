What is the proper mime-type on a link rel pingback (WordPress)?

This question applies to WordPress, but maybe someone knows if it applies universally? Is there a proper mime-type (type attribute) for this... ? Something tells me it may be text/xml , but I'd rather not guess if someone knows the right answer. EDIT: I am reading here that including a link rel pingback in your is discouraged...
