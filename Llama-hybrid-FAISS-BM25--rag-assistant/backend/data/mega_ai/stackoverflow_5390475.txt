Why cannot add resources to the folder in VS 2010 Express?

Hi In order to be able to work with e.g. picture, I need to click on Resources.resx and Add Existing Item. Then it will appear under Resources folder. However I could use Context menu on that Resource folder and add existing item as well but then I cannot work with it and it is not displayed when I use the Resources.resx file. So I always need to click on Resources.rext when I want to add anything? Also in this "view" I cannot use folders so its pretty messy. Also what is New Folder in Resources dir good for - when I drag files there, there are not accessible anymore..
