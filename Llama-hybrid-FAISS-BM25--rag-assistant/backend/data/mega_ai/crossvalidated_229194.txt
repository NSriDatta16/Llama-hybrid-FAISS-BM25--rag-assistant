This is a neat question, and there has been some methodological work on this. First, one semi-natural way to incorporate several data sources is with Bayesian methods, where the posterior based on the data from Source 1 can act as the prior for the analysis of the data from Source 2. As an example, Raghu et. al. (2007) combine the data from two health surveys, one areal face-to-face (National Health Interview Survey), and one landline phone (Behavioral Risk Factor Surveilance Survey) using a Bayesian model which additionally correctly for (a known) lower quality of BRFSS frame which did not cover neither the cell-phone-only nor the no-phone-service population. Second, in some situations where you have the same population and the same variable, you can jointly calibrate the two surveys to ensure that the estimates based on both are identical, and improve the precision of each. Changbao Wu published a few papers on this based on the empirical likelihood calibration idea ( this and that ), but this can also be achieved by less computationally intensive GREG approach. I vaguely recall a JASA paper from late 1990s to mid 2000s, but I can't seem to locate it; instead, my Google searches stumble upon this and that .
