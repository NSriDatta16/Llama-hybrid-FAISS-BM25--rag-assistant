The interfaces must be visible to the implementors. The implementation may be visible to consumers. If you want to separate the implementation from interface such that they can be deployed separately, then the interfaces should reside in their own assembly. If you are disciplined enough to organize your code based on namespaces and have no special deployment requirements, the interfaces can reside in the same assembly as the implementation.
