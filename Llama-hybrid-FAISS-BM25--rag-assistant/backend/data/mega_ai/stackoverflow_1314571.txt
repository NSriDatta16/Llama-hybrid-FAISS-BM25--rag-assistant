Have you tried an even simpler approach? >>> from subprocess import Popen, PIPE >>> stdout, stderr = Popen(['ssh', 'user@remote_computer', 'ps -ef'], ... stdout=PIPE).communicate() >>> print(stdout) Granted, this only works because I have ssh-agent running preloaded with a private key that the remote host knows about.
