How do I model product ratings in the database?

What is the best approach to storing product ratings in a database? I have in mind the following two (simplified, and assuming a MySQL db) scenarios: Create two columns in the products table to store the number and the sum of all votes respectively. Use the columns to get an average at run time or using a query. This approach means I only need to access one table, simplifying things. Normalize the data by creating an additional table to store the ratings. This isolates the ratings data into a separate table, leaving the products table to furnish data on available products. Although it would require a join or a separate query for ratings. Which approach is best, normalised or denormalised?
