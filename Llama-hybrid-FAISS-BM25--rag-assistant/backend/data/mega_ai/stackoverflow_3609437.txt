The most entertaining trick I've seen — without having any idea of how efficient it is — is to leverage the IE conditional comment feature dynamically . To do that, your code takes a hidden or a in a document fragment, or whatever, and inserts into it some HTML surrounded by a conditional comment coded to check for a specific browser version: var dummy = document.getElementById('dummy'); dummy.innerHTML = ' x '; var isIE8 = dummy.innerHTML === 'x'; IE8 can show a little button next to the URL box that switches the browser between IE7 mode and IE8 mode. You can open up the "Developer Tools" and that'll tell you what the current setting is.
