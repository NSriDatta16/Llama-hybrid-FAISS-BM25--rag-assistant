Silverlight Map Tiler

I just started learning Silverlight and onTop of that I have to create a map viewer that displays our map tiles. I have search EVERYWHERE online and cant find anything that helps me. All Im looking for is a way to Display the tiles and have it draggable so that it starts pulling off more Tiles from the server. I'd like to build it from scratch but im not sure where to begin. I've looked at the whole microsoft BING thing but that doesnt help as its too much of BINGS's own stuff. Going in circles looking everywhere else.
