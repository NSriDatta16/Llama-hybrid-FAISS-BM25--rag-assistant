variance of summation/compound variable?

here is my situation. I am weighting a packet of material that has 10 individual units in it. In the end of the day I would like to know the average weight and variance of the individual units but the problem is that I cannot weight each unit individually since I would have to destroy the packet to get to the individual units. So in lieu of this, I am trying to make an inference of the individual units from what I know about the packets. I weighed 10 packets (hence I have 100 individual units). I was able to figure out the average weight of the units but am having trouble with the variance. Here is what I have done so far: $$ \begin{split} \bar{y}&=\frac{1}{10}\sum^{10}_{i=1}y_i\\ &=\frac{1}{10}\sum^{10}_{i=1} (x_{i,1}+x_{i,2}+...+x_{i,10})~~[since~y_i=x_{i,1}+x_{i,2}+...+x_{i,10}]\\ &=\frac{1}{10}\sum^{100}_{j=1}x_j\\ &=\frac{1}{10}(100~\bar{x})=10~\bar{x} \end{split} $$ thus we have the average of $x$, $\bar{x}=\frac{\bar{y}}{10}.$ But now my challenge is how to do I find variance of $x$ given the variance of $y$? Any suggestions? Thanks! ::::UPDATE:::: After some thought I came up with this reasoning: $$ \begin{split} \frac{1}{10}var(y)&=var(\bar{y})\\ &=var(10~\bar{x})\\ &=100~var(\bar{x})\\ &=100~\frac{1}{100}var(x)~~[assuming~that~all~x~are~i.i.d.]\\ &=var(x) \end{split} $$ thus we have $var(x)=\frac{1}{10}var(y).$ I am correct in that if we assume that all the individual units share the same common variance and are independent of each other, this result holds?
