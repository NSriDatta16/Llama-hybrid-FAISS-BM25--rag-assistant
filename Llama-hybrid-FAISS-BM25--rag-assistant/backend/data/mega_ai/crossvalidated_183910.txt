Intuitive understanding of this sentence with regards to time series

I am reading the lecture note here by Simon Gilchrist on equity premium puzzle. The risk free rate is not very volatile: σ(R) = 2% per year but is persistent (ρ = 0.6 in annual data) leading to medium-run variation. Can someone please provide a good intuitive explanation of how low volatility and medium persistence lead to medium-run variation.
