Posterior distribution and bayesian inference

I use the formula for posterior distribution, $$ \pi(\theta | s) = \frac{\pi(\theta) f_\theta(s)}{m(s)} $$ And for $\theta = 1, s = 1$ , $$\pi(1)=\frac{1}{5}, f_1(1)=\frac{1}{2}$$ $$ m(s) = \sum\limits_{\Omega} \pi(1)f_1(1) = \sum\limits_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{10} = \frac{3}{10}$$ My answers is $\frac{1}{3}$ but its supposed to be $\frac{3}{16}$ . Can someone explain where I'm going wrong?
