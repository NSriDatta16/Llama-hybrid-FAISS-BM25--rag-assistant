Starting to construct a data access layer. Things to consider?

Our organisation uses inline sql. We have been tasked with providing a suitable data access layer and are weighing up the pro's and cons of which way to go... Datasets ADO.net Linq Entity framework Subsonic Other? Some tutorials and articles I have been using for reference: http://www.asp.net/(S(pdfrohu0ajmwt445fanvj2r3))/learn/data-access/tutorial-01-vb.aspx http://www.simple-talk.com/dotnet/.net-framework/designing-a-data-access-layer-in-linq-to-sql/ http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc188750.aspx http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa697427(VS.80).aspx http://www.subsonicproject.com/ I'm extremely torn, and finding it very difficult to make a decision on which way to go. Our site is a series of 2 internal portals and a public web site. We are using vs2008 sp1 and framework version 3.5. Please can you give me advise on what factors to consider and any pro's and cons you have faced with your data access layer. PS. I found the subsonic web site's information a bit shallow, and a lot of emphasis seems to be placed on how 'cool' it and it's developers are. I'd much prefer a spoken explanation to their demo video than the music? Does anyone else agree?
