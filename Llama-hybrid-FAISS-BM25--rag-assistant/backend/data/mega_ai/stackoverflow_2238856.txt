The Coding 4 Fun Developer Kit (available for download from http://www.codeplex.com/C4FDevKit ) contains a Bluetooth control that you can just drag and drop onto a Windows Form. The Bluetooth control implements 3 profiles: Serial Port, File Transfer and Object Push; plus it provides Device Discovery and Service Discovery features. The kit also contains other useful controls, it is free, and it is probably a lot easier to use than trying to write your own Bluetooth control. Hope this helps.
