In the first line of your question you don't specify that you mean the multivariate normal distribution, but based on the rest of the question I'm going to assume that. You have a $p$-dimensional random vector $X$ that has a multivariate normal distribution $\mathcal N(\mu, \Sigma)$, but you only care about the first $k$ elements of this vector. You are considering two procedures: generate full draws of $X$ and keep only the first $k$ elements draw directly from the $k$-dimensional marginal multivariate normal distribution with parameters given by restricting $\mu$ to the first $k$ elements and $\Sigma$ to the upper $k \times k$ block. It turns out these two things are equivalent, and both generate samples from the $k$-dimensional marginal distribution of $(X_1, \dots, X_k)$. This is because it is a standard result (see this rather terse paragraph in Wikipedia, for example) that if $$\begin{bmatrix}X_1 \\ \vdots \\ X_p \end{bmatrix} \sim \mathcal N\left(\begin{bmatrix}\mu_1 \\ \vdots \\ \mu_p\end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix}\Sigma_{11} \dots \Sigma_{1p} \\ \vdots \\ \Sigma_{p1} \dots \Sigma_{pp}\end{bmatrix}\right)$$ then $$ \begin{bmatrix}X_1 \\ \vdots \\ X_k \end{bmatrix} \sim \mathcal N\left(\begin{bmatrix}\mu_1 \\ \vdots \\ \mu_k\end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix}\Sigma_{11} \dots \Sigma_{1k} \\ \vdots \\ \Sigma_{k1} \dots \Sigma_{kk}\end{bmatrix}\right). $$ This means you can do exactly what you propose and just sample using the first $k$ elements of $\mu$ and the corresponding elements of $\Sigma$.
