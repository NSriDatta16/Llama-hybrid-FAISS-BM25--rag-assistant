Hallo, It was nice to see your all project - I agree with MarkJ - who said that - in VBA there is no possibility to use events in arrays and also in collection - with collections and events I don't have too much experience - but I read about it - about arrays - I spent whole night - and discovered that VBA is not C++ :( . Try to show all project. Norbert
