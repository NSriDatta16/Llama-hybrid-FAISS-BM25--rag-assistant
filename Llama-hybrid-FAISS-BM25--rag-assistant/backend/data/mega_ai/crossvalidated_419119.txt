logistic regression response variable ~ Bernoulli(pi)?

I am a newbie to logistic regression. So far, I know how to derive the coefficients of logistic regression, how it basically works. What I don't know are the assumptions & inference stuff for logistic regression. Let's say binary logistic regression. One thing that confuses me is that Logistic regression assumes the response is conditionally Bernoulli distributed given the values of the features . I saw it from this link , but I don't know why. I also saw it on wikipedia. Is there any proof of this? Another thing is about inference. I know that for linear regression, we must have some assumptions, e.g. normality, non-colinearity, constant variance of error...etc for the inference (e.g. confidence interval of the coefficients) What about binary logistic regression? Do we have to care about the error term when doing inference on coefficients?
