According to UserAgentString.com , Thunderbird uses these strings. Sadly, I'm unable to find very much about other email clients. My best suggestion is to do as you are planning, but send it out to specific friends, so you can gather some baseline knowledge. However, as Scunliffe mentioned, most interfaces do not display images until you choose to. So the best way to force it, is to have your email as one big image! ;)
