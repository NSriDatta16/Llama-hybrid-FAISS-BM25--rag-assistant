Comparing a random sample and a non random sample extracted from a finite population

I am not able to formulate a more descriptive title. I have a population of five million people, I code it with R programming language: pop 41% of them have brown eyes, 42% of them have green eyes. brown Then I have 7000 people belonging to the population which test positive to a disease, obviously this is not a random sample taken from the population. sample_size The percentage of eyes color for these 7000 people is the following: 38% have brown eyes, 44% have green eyes. brown_in_sample Now a very na√Øve conclusion is that green eyed people are more prone to test positive to the disease because 38% is slightly less than 41% and 44% is slightly greater than 42%; that conclusion smells like meaningless to me because I feel that the proportions of brown eyes in the full population (41%) and in the positive-to-the-disease sample (38%) are too close and the same happens for the green eyes. How can I get some convincing arguments to support my intuitions? I have a vague idea that I have to use a multivariate hypergeometric distribution and compare the percentage of brown and green eyes found in a true random sample with the ones found in the positive-to-the-disease sample but I do not know how to proceed. As an additional constraint, I would like to follow a Bayesian approach.
