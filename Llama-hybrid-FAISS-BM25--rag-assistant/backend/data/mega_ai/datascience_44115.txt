Logistic regression in python

I have done linear and multivariate regression so I understand what probability, cost and gradient descent functions are. I do not understand what the last 3 formulas mean and how they relate to each other. I don't expect anyone to explain them to me but could someone please share a link that explains them in simple terms? I've tried looking online but the formulas used often look different from the ones below. Sorry for posting a picture like this but I don't know how to format formulas.
