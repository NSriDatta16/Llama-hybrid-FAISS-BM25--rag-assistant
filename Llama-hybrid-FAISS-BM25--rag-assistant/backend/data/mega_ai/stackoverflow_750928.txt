You've just missed a chance for having Python running on the Parrot VM together with Perl. On April 1st , 2009 PEP 401 was published, and one of the Official Acts of the FLUFL read: Recognized that C is a 20th century language with almost universal rejection by programmers under the age of 30, the CPython implementation will terminate with the release of Python 2.6.2 and 3.0.2. Thereafter, the reference implementation of Python will target the Parrot virtual machine . Alternative implementations of Python (e.g. Jython, IronPython, and PyPy ) are officially discouraged but tolerated.
