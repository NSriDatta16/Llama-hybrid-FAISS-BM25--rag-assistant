Is OLS the frequentist approach to linear regression?

In this Wikipedia article , there is this sentence: This is a frequentist approach Is 'this' referring to OLS? Is it really 'a' rather than 'the'? What are some other frequentist approaches? As far as I know, we must minimize [$\varepsilon_1, \varepsilon_2, ..., \varepsilon_n$][$\varepsilon_1, \varepsilon_2, ..., \varepsilon_n$]'. Edit: This is in relation to my previous question . Tim mentioned 'Now, to estimate logistic regression in Bayesian way...' So, how would one do it in a frequentist way? OLS? Recalled statistics class involving linear regression. Guess there's MLE too.
