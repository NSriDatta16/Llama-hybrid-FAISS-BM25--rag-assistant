I suggest you to practice with small datasets such as: the breast cancer dataset from U Wisconsin, the Titanic dataset , very famous used in many tutorials the spam detection dataset These are good for classification tasks. For regression tasks, I suggest you something like the Boston housing dataset, downloadable directly from sklearn . They are all very small datasets that can be trained in few minutes (if not seconds). They are really useful to get used to model tuning, minibatch training, and the syntax of course. In my very first experiment with Neural Networks I trained one on the breast cancer dataset, a simple dense network that trained in few seconds on an average laptop. You can take a look here .
