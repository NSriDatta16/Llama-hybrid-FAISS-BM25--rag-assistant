I used the methodology in this paper where they improve upon GLMNET to solve L1 regularized logistic regression. Since $f^{T}Lf$ is twice differentiable, I added its gradient and hessian to the solution in equation 11 of the paper. Someone has already implemented the code for the paper here which I've built upon. You can find my changes here
