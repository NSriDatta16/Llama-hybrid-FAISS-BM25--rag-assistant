Adding vectors of doubles of differing sizes in C++

I have a number of vector containers of varying size each containing doubles. I would like to add the elements of each vector to create a single vector of doubles. This simple example will example what I'm talking about: Consider two vectors A with three elements 3.0 2.0 1.0 and B with two elements 2.0 1.0. I would like to add both vectors starting at the last element and working backwards. This would give an array C with entries 3.0 4.0 2.0. What would be the most elegant/efficent way of doing this? Thanks!
