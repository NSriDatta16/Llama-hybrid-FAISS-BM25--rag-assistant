Yes, this is possible. You can put the SQLite file in the assets folder of your Android project (or download it on demand) and copy it to the database folder of the installed app. A tutorial explaining all the neccesary steps can be found here . Note however that if you include the database file into your APK, it will consume twice the disk space than absolutely necessary (since it will exist twice, as asset and as usable database). Depending on the size of your database, it might be preferable to download it instead of embedding it into the APK. Note furthermore, that prior to Android 2.3, any compressed asset file with an uncompressed size of over 1 MB cannot be read from the APK (and any asset will be compressed by default).
