Computed height of an element set to display: none

To calculate a top position for an element of variable height, I was thinking of doing the following: Move the element 1000px off the top of the viewport Set the element to display: block Get the height of the element Set the element to display: none Continue on as if everything is normal and good Any pitfalls in this approach? Is there a more elegant solution?
