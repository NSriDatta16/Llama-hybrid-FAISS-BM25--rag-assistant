Yes it is legal for the compile to generate an empty main body for the above code (thus terminating almost immediately). The C++0x FCD says 6.5 says (pay special attention to the note ): A loop that, outside of the for-init-statement in the case of a for statement, * makes no calls to library I/O functions, and * does not access or modify volatile objects, and * performs no synchronization operations (1.10) or atomic operations (Clause 29) may be assumed by the implementation to terminate. [ Note: This is intended to allow compiler transformations, such as removal of empty loops, even when termination cannot be proven. â€” end note ] So the compiler can assume that your for loop will terminate and since the body is empty it can optimize it away altogether. The quotation from the draft was copied from this question and verified against my copy.
