Does Apples UI define Drag&Drop in menus and/or context menus for menu items

I'm trying to update my GUI a little bit but don't want to run into porting problems later next year when a native Cocoa Port will be started. On Windows/Linux it is common to drag items out of menus or being able to right click on a menu item and display a context menu for this menu item. Is there anything like this on MacOSX.
