Intuition behind relation of expected value of conditional probabilities and marginal probability distribution

I have been trying the following question; If you help with any intuition I would be very appreciated. $\displaystyle p_{X}(x)=\int _{y}p_{X\mid Y}(x\mid y)\,p_{Y}(y)\,\mathrm {d} y=\operatorname {E} _{Y}[p_{X\mid Y}(x\mid y)].$ I tried to infer from classical expected value equation of a continuous random variable which is probability weighted average of all the possible values; ${\displaystyle \operatorname {E} _{Y}[y]=\int _{y}y p_{Y}(y)\,\mathrm {d} y.}$ I can intuitively easily understand the multiplication of a "value" with it's corresponding probability value. However, when it comes to interpret the first equation, I do stuck at imagining multiplication of 2 distributions...
