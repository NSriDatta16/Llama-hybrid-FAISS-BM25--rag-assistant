Use jQuery to auto select text inside a span tag when clicked

I have a div which contains a series of span tags, each containing a string of text. I'd like to attach a jQuery click event to all of the spans so that when the text inside any span is clicked, the entire line of text (dom > innerText object) will be auto selected to facilitate the drag/drop or copy/paste of the text string. For example, my content is... &nbsp;This is my text&nbsp; &nbsp;This is my text&nbsp; If the cursor is clicked on any text inside a span, I want to select the text within that span, so that it can be drag/dropped (without the span tags, just the innerText of the span) as a copy. Does jQuery have an easy means to do this? EDIT: A more detailed explanation of what I'm trying to accomplish: Without aid of script, in order to copy a block of text, the user has to manually drag select a selection rectangle across the text block. The text then becomes selected signaling that a click & drag event will pick up all of the selected text. So I'm trying to create script that allows a single click on the text to automatically select the text for the user so they don't have to manually do it themselves.
