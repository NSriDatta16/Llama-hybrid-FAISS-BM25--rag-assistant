Calling functions from plain text descriptions

I have an app which has common maths functions behind the scenes: add(x, y) multiply(x, y) square(x) The interface is a simple google- style text field. I want the user to be able to enter a plain text description - '2*3' '2 times 3' 'multiply 2 and 3' 'take the product of 2 and 3' and get a answer mathematical answer Question is, how should I map the text descriptions to the functions ? I'm guessing I need to tokenise the text identify key tokens (function names, arguments) try and map token combinations to function signatures However I'm guessing this is already a 'solved problem' in the machine learning space. Should I be using Natural Language Processing ? Plain text search ? Something else ? All ideas gratefully received, plus implementation suggestions [I'm using Python/AppEngine; I know about NLTK and Whoosh] [PS I understand Google does this already, at least for the first two queries on the list. I'm guessing they also go it statistically, having a very large amount of search data. I don't have a large amount of data available, so will need an alternative approach].
