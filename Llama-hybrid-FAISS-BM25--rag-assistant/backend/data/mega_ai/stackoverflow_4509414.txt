Hi im trying to send a file to a remote machine using ant FTP task . The code looks like this where rbhanu is the name of the host. I am trying to send an ear file present inside ragz folder to C drive of rbhanu(remote machine) its generating the following error error during FTP transfer: java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused: connect Note: I included all the libraries related to ftp task its not the problem because i can send files to ftp server but unable to send files to remote machine I greatly appreciate if any one could figure it out
