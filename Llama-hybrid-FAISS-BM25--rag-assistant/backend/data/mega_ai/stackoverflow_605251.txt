rrd tool alternative for high volume

I am interested in knowing if there is any alternative to rrdtool for logging time series data. I am looking at something that can scale for a large number of devices to monitor. From what I read on this subject, rrdtool is I/O bound when you hit it with large amounts of data. Since I envision this to scale to a very large number of devices to monitor, I am curious if there's any alternative that would not choke on I/O. Preferable SQL based, but not necessarily. Thanks
