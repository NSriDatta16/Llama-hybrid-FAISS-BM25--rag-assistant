http://www.microsoft.com/azure/howdoesitwork.mspx Windows Azure is a cloud services operating system that serves as the development, service hosting, and service management environment for the Azure Services Platform. Windows Azure provides developers with on-demand compute and storage to host and manage web applications on the internet through Microsoft data centers. So in summary, no you do not need a traditional web host if you used Microsoft's Azure. Note also that it is still only in Community Technology Preview and it isn't something you should be thinking about right now, IMHO.
