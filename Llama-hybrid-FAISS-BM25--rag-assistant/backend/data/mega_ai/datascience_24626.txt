The answer depends on what exactly outlier detector you use. EllipticEnvelope and IsolationForest authomatically adjust to the scale and correlations between variables, so you cannot easily change relative weights of features. With IsolationForest you can increase importance of B by just replicating this column several times and so icreasing its relative frequency in the tree splits. Other algorithms, such as LocalOutlierFactor and kernel-based OneClassSVM are explicitly based on the Euclidean distance between the points. And distance depends on feature scaling. It means that you can multiply B by some factor after normalization, and its importance will increase by this factor.
