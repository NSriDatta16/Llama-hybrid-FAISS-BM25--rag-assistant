How to apply my deep learning model to a new dataset?

I am doing semantic segmentation (multi-class classification of image pixels) using convolutional neural networks (CNN) in Keras. In particular, I am applying this to aerial images of crops (vegetation). In Keras, I successfully developed a workflow to segment/classify different crops for one specific dataset (let's call this dataset rural area #1 ). Can I apply my Keras weights trained on rural area #1 for initializing the training of another dataset rural area #2 ? Such as: model = load_model("weights_ruralarea1.hdf5") Then I will proceed to model.fit . The rural area #2 dataset has little training images for training the CNN. So would using my weights for rural area #1 be a form of transfer learning? or will it be a form of fine-tuning?
