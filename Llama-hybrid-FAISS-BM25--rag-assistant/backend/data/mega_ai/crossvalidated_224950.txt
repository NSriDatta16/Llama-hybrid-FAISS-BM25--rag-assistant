Why can't I find a pure representation of a PCA loading in my dataset

Perhaps I don't fully understand the PCA principles...I am applying PCA to spectroscopic data. I get a nice loading that beautifully explains 1 component in my dataset, however I cannot find this pure component spectrum (representative of this loading) in my dataset. Or does the loading just explain a trend without it actually being present in the dataset in a pure (unmixed) form. Up til now I was always able to find this pure spectrum from the scores plot but perhaps I was lucky with previous data sets. Thank you
