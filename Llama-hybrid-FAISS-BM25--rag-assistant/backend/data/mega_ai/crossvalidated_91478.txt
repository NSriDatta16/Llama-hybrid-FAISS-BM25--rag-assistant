I think a better question is, are they significantly different? To answer this, we need to compute $P(\lambda_2 > \lambda_1)$. Call this quantity $p$. If $p \approx 0.50$, then there's equal chance one is larger than the other. On the other hand, If $p$ is really close to 1, then we can be confident that yes $\lambda_2$ is larger (read: different) than $\lambda_1$ . How do we compute $p$? It's trivial in a Bayesian MCMC framework. We have samples from the posterior, so lets just compute the chace that samples from $\lambda_2$ are larger than $\lambda_1$: p = np.mean( lambda_2_samples > lambda_1_samples ) print p I apologize for not including this in the book, I'll definetly add it as I think it's one of the most useful ideas in Bayesian inference
