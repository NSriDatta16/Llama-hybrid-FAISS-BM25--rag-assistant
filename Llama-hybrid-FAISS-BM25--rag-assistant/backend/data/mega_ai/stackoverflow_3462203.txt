It can be done quite easily if the shape is convex. When the shape is concave it is much harder. In the convex case find the centroid by computing the average of all of the points. This gives a point that is in the interior for which the following property holds: If you project four rays from the centroid to each corner of a quad you define a pyramid cut into two parts, one part contains space interior to the shape and the other part defines space that might be exterior to the shape. These two volumes give you a decision process to check if a quad is on the boundary or not. If any point from another quad occurs in the outside volume then the quad is not on the boundary and can be discarded as an interior quad. Edit: Just seen your clarification above. In the harder case that the shape is concave then you need one of two things; A description (parameterisation) of the shape that you can use to choose quads with, or Some other property such as all of the boundary quads being contiguous Further edit: Just realised that what you are describing would be a concave hull for the points.
