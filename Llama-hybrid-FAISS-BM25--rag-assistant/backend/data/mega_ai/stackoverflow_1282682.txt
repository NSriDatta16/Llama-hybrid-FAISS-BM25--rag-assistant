Could you send a link to an example? From what I understand you are dynamically altering the background tag, but you can not resize a background image without using CSS 3, so compatibility is compromised. CSS Background property can contain a color, url, positions x, y and repetition. ie. background: white url("mypic.jpg") 0 0 no-repeat; Quirksmode CSS 3 Backgrounds How come you cannot use an img tag inside the table which you dynamically alter its source to the new image and set the height and width to whatever? Or if your problem is with the user dragging the images you could simply use a div rather than an image, set its height and width, and place it over the images.
