Personally, I prefer: ht = Hash.new {|h,k| h[k]=[]} ht["cats"] It's a matter of maintenance and self-documentation to me. The hash initialization dirty-work occurs once. From then on, all assignments to the arrays in the hash occurs in a standard manner, which will result in your code looking normal. The alternate method: ht = {} (ht["cats"] ||= []) starts off looking normal, but each assignment has what I call "visual noise". We have to mentally decode what ||= [] means every time something is pushed onto an array in the hash. It's mentally fatiguing, and if you're doing it throughout the code, would lead to less elegant looking code and a constant reassessment of what the heck the code is doing at THAT spot.
