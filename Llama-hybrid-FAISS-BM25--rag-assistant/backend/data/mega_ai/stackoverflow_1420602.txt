Compiling JVMTI agent (using GCC, on OSX Snow Leopard)

I am trying to build a JVMTI agent using the g++ command on Snow Leopard and I get the following error: $ g++ -o agent.so -I `/usr/libexec/java_home`/include agent.cpp Undefined symbols: "_main", referenced from: start in crt1.10.6.o ld: symbol(s) not found collect2: ld returned 1 exit status I am a total novice when it comes to gcc and C++ programming so I have no idea what that error means. The agent itself is extremely basic: #include #include JNIEXPORT jint JNICALL Agent_OnLoad(JavaVM *vm, char *options, void *reserved) { std::cout Any help with the message would be greatly appreciated.
