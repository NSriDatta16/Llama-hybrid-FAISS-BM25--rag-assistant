I'm pretty sure I answered this question before. The answer depends on how you define a better forecast. If you define it as minimizing expected loss (forecast error) then the average will be better for minimizing the square of an error and the median minimizes the absolute value of an error both in expected sense. Suppose your loss function is $f(y-\hat y)$ then you find the forecast $\hat y$ that minimizes the expected loss as $$\min E[f(y-\hat y) ]$$ It can be shown that for $f(x)=x^2$ your $\hat y=E[y]$ and for $f(x)=|x|$ the best forecast is $\hat y=median(y)$
