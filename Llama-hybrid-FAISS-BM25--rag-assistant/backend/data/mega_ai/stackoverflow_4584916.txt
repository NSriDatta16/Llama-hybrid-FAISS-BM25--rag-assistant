Java JPA: Performant check if Entity is already in DB

What is the best way / best practice to check if an entity is already in a database using JPA? I am writing a client that adds hostinformation to a db. For example the attached storage luns, hba etc... If I want to add a Lun for a host, I have to check if the lun is already in the database. (The Lun can be attached to another host already). I see 2 possibilites: I make a select for the Lun, to check if it is already in the db Try to insert the Lun and check for an exception (unique constraint) Does someone have experience with that. BR, Rene
