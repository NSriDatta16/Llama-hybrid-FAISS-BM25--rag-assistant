By the definition of the logistic regression model $\mathrm P(y = 1 | x,w) = \sigma\left(\left \right)$ thus $\mathrm P(y = 0 | x,w) = 1- \sigma\left(\left \right)$ You should be able to verify (by setting y=0/y=1) that this is equivalent to $\mathrm P(y | x,w) = \sigma\left(\left \right)^y \left[ 1- \sigma \left( \left \right) \right]^{1-y}$ I think you understand the rest?
