This sounds tricky. And I'm not sure what you'd do with the info about the changed functions in the source. You don't want to limit your code coverage to those functions: it could be that a changed function affected the coverage of an unchanged function. Perhaps the best thing to do is simply run all your tests on each check-in, or once an hour if anything has changed. Then you could skip the complex tool creation, and have better results anyway.
