I have just tried your example. I really saw some small flicking when resizing the window. I tried to replace the code fragment starting from setBounds() and finishing at AWTUtilities.setWindowShape(this, newShape); by setSize(newBounds.width, newBounds.height); and saw that the flicking disappeared. So, I'd suggest you this solution unless you have any special reasons to use setBounds .
