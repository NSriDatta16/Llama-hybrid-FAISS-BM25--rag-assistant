Building a status calendar - ASP.NET

I need to build a status dashboard that reads Events (ID, Desc, Time) out of a database, and puts a marker on a day that drills down to detail, if there is an event - and just a checkmark if there is no event. Just like http://www.google.com/appsstatus . I am a Jr. developer witha PHP background, I am using C# & ASP.NET. I chose to use the UpdatePanel/ScriptManager components for the grid even though there is some bandwidth costs. My question is about the best way to build this table. In PHP, I would use a string and just keep adding HTML to it via nested iteration, like: foreach($row in $rows){ MyHtml .= " " . $variableFromDB[i] . " "; i++ } return MyHtml; //Output built HTML In this case I need to query an array to see if an event exists for that day, if so, generate a link containing URL parameter (field1=value1&field2) so that I can display the corresponding detail information. Since I'm using .NET, I'm wondering if there is a more elegant way to do this without querying for each cell to check for an event, and an easier way to build a table. I see .NET classes like "HtmlTableCell" & "HtmlTableRow", but I haven't seen any compelling examples that require a query in each cell. Any guidance from you senior .NET folks would be great...
