Text similarity with sentence embeddings

I'm trying to calculate similarity between texts with various lengths. My current approach is following: Using Universal Sentence Encoder, I convert text to a set of vectors. I average these vectors to create the final feature vector. I compare feature vectors using cosine similarity. This gives me pretty good results for texts with roughly same sizes, but I was wondering if there is a better approach for the step #2 if texts have different lengths.
