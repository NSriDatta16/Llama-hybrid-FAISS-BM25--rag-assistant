Fixed Effects Intuition: mean subtraction; categorical variables; and more

After read this textbook chapter on fixed effects panel regression by Nick Huntington-Klein, a few questions remain: Is fixed effects regression essentially OLS after normalising the data by subtracting the mean of each individual? For clarity, this data: Individual Year Exercise (hours/week) Cholesterol (y-variable) Sarah 2020 20 200 Sarah 2021 25 190 Robert 2020 50 230 Robert 2021 60 225 after normalisation, would be: Individual Year Exercise (hours/week) Cholesterol (y-variable) Sarah 2020 -2.5 5 Sarah 2021 2.5 -5 Robert 2020 -5 2.5 Robert 2021 5 -2.5 This ensures the between differences are cancelled out and what remains is only within differences... If my understanding it correct, is that essentially what the R plm and Python PanelOLS (specifying "within") functions are doing before fitting OLS? Could one simply do the normalisation step separately and then use R's lm or Python's statsmodels OLS ? I have read that mean subtraction is equivalent to including individual dummies. If I choose to go the mean-subtraction route, and I have a categorical variable in my data, e.g. favourite food: "Pizza"/"Pasta"/"Salad", how should that be dealt with and normalised? Surely I would need to create dummies, so I'm not sure how there can be a choice... If I add a binary independent variable for each individual, e.g.: Individual Year Exercise (hours/week) Was Employed Cholesterol (y-variable) Sarah 2020 20 0 200 Sarah 2021 25 1 190 Robert 2020 50 0 230 Robert 2021 60 0 225 Should this variable be processed/normalised as if it were continuous (i.e., no special treatment)? Can variables that are constant through time for each individual (e.g., Country of birth) provide any useful information for the model, or can they be disregarded since they provide no within information to explain cholesterol? After normalisation, it seems one typically uses OLS (and this is what is built into plm and PanelOLS ). But could any regression be used? E.g. Random Forest Regression, Ridge/LASSO, Support Vector Regression, etc If the research question is "does employment influence cholesterol?", then does having Robert in the model provide any information, since he was never employed?
