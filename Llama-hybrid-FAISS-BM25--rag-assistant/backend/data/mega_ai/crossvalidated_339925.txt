I don't think you need to concatenate or group the time series in any way. Just train your NNet on the 10 data sets, with [PPG, ECG] as inputs and [ABP] as the outputs. Then use it to predict the [ABP] for the eleventh data set. So your data should look like: Patient #. Input Target 1 [PPG1, ECG1] [ABP1] 2 [PPG2, ECG2] [ABP2] ... ... ... 10 [PPG10,ECG10] [ABP10] You only have 10 data sets for training so you should use cross validation. Then feed [PPG11, ECG11] to your NNet to predict your new [ABP].
