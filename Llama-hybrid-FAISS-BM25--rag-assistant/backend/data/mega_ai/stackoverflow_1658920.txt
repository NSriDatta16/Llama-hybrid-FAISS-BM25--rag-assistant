Since you're using Stata to do the analysis, you can let it do the heavy lifting of the report automation as well. The trick is using a Stata package like -rtfutil- to export the tables and graphics you describe to a single document. At that point you'll need to convert that to pdf before emailing it. Here some sample code for using -rtfutil- automate the creation of a document including a table and two graphics (plus some paragraphs of text) in a RTF document(using the system dataset "auto.dta" as an example): ****** clear //RTF UTILITY FOR INSERTING GRAPHICS & TABLES// local sf "/users/ppri/desktop/" //SETUP sysuse auto, clear twoway scatter mpg price, mlabel(make) || lfitci mpg price graph export "`sf'myplot1.eps", replace twoway scatter price mpg, mlabel(make) by(for) graph export "`sf'myplot2.eps", replace ** tempname handle1 //RTFUTIL rtfopen `handle1' using "`sf'mydoc1.rtf", replace file write `handle1' _n _tab "{\pard\b SAMPLE DOCUMENT \par}" _tab _n file write `handle1' _n "{\line}" // Figure1 file write `handle1' "{\pard\b FIGURE 1: Plot of Price\par}" _n rtflink `handle1' using "`sf'myplot1.eps" // Figure2 file write `handle1' _n "{\page}" _n /* */ "{\pard Here is the plot and a paragraph about it. Here is the plot and a paragraph about it. Here is the plot and a paragraph about it. Here is the plot and a paragraph about it.....blah blah blah blah blah \line}" _n file write `handle1' _n "{\line}" file write `handle1' "{\pard\b FIGURE2: Plots of Price vs. MPG\par}" _n rtflink `handle1' using "`sf'myplot2.eps" // Table Title file write `handle1' _n "{\page}" _n file write `handle1' _n "{\par\pard}" _n /* */ "{\par\pard HERE IS A TABLE WITH THE CARS: \par\pard}" _n file write `handle1' _n "{\par\pard}" _n // Summary Table rtfrstyle make mpg weight, cwidths(2000 1440 1440) local(b d e) listtex make foreign mpg if mpg This will put all the elements you asked about into a RTF document (be careful with any issues with wrapping of this code when copy/paste it from the webpage). In your question, you also mentioned wanting to create a PDF during this process. Here you'll need to go to use some non-Stata solution. If you're using Mac OSX you can use the Terminal -convert- utility or automator to do this, or here are some other solutions: http://codesnippets.joyent.com/posts/show/1601 I don't use windows so I'm not sure about solutions with that OS. Good luck.
