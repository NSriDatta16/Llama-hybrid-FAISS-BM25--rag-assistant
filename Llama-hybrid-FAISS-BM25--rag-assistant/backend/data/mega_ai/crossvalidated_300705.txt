Introducing instrumental variables is likely to cause multicollinearity. (You can check how big this is by calculating the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF); if you use R the package to use is "car".) And multicollinearity often creates exactly the effect you described, namely erratically changing signs of coefficient involved in multicollinearity. Please also note, as you introduce interactions, say IV1*IV2, your original effect of IV1 gets split into IV1 and IV1*IV2. Let $\beta$ be the coefficient for IV1, $\rho$ the coefficient for the interaction IV1*IV2 and mean(IV2) the average value for IV2 in the sample. If you want to calculate what effect a one unit increase of IV1 has in the case of interaction, you need to compute $\beta*1+\rho*1*$mean(IV2). This is called the marginal effect if you want to google it further. Does this make sense?
