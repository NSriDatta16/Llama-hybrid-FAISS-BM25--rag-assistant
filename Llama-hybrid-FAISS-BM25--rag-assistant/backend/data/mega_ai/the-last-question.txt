"The Last Question" is a science fiction short story by American writer Isaac Asimov. It first appeared in the November 1956 issue of Science Fiction Quarterly; and in the anthologies in the collections Nine Tomorrows (1959), The Best of Isaac Asimov (1973), Robot Dreams (1986), The Best Science Fiction of Isaac Asimov (1986), the retrospective Opus 100 (1969), and Isaac Asimov: The Complete Stories, Vol. 1 (1990). While he also considered it one of his best works, "The Last Question" was Asimov's favorite short story of his own authorship, and is one of a loosely connected series of stories concerning a fictional computer called Multivac. Through successive generations, humanity questions Multivac on the subject of entropy. The story blends science fiction, theology, and philosophy. It has been recognized as a counterpoint to Fredric Brown's short short story "Answer", published two years earlier. History In conceiving Multivac, Asimov was extrapolating the trend towards centralization that characterized computation technology planning in the 1950s to an ultimate centrally managed global computer. After seeing a planetarium adaptation of his work, Asimov "privately" concluded that the story was his best science fiction yet written. He placed it just higher than "The Ugly Little Boy" (September 1958) and "The Bicentennial Man" (1976). The story asks the question of humanity's fate, and human existence as a whole, highlighting Asimov's focus on important aspects of our future like population growth and environmental issues. "The Last Question" ranks with "Nightfall" (1941) as one of Asimov's best-known and most acclaimed short stories. He wrote in 1973:Why is it my favorite? For one thing I got the idea all at once and didn't have to fiddle with it; and I wrote it in white-heat and scarcely had to change a word. This sort of thing endears any story to any writer. Then, too, it has had the strangest effect on my readers. Frequently someone writes to ask me if I can give them the name of a story, which they think I may have written, and tell them where to find it. They don't remember the title but when they describe the story it is invariably 'The Last Question'. This has reached the point where I recently received a long-distance phone call from a desperate man who began, "Dr. Asimov, there's a story I think you wrote, whose title I can't rememberâ€”" at which point I interrupted to tell him it was 'The Last Question' and when I described the plot it proved to be indeed the story he was after. I left him convinced I could read minds at a distance of a thousand miles. Plot summary "The Last Question" is told in a series of vignettes spanning billions of years, and follows a line of advanced computers that grapple with the problem of entropy, the inevitable increase in disorder that will eventually cause the universe to run down. By the year 2061, Multivac, a self-adjusting and self-correcting computer, has allowed mankind to reach beyond the planetary confines of Earth and harness solar energy. Two technicians, Alexander Adell and Bertram Lupov, celebrate Multivac's role in this development. Over drinks, they debate whether the Sun's energy will last forever. Lupov argues it will not due to entropy, prompting Adell to ask Multivac if entropy can be reversed. Multivac responds, "INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR MEANINGFUL ANSWER". In an era in which mankind has achieved interstellar travel, the Jerrodd family travels to a new planet, X-23, guided by a Microvac. When the children ask about the stars running down, Jerrodd queries the Microvac about reversing entropy, receiving the same answer: "INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR MEANINGFUL ANSWER". When humanity's rapid population growth starts filling galaxies, two immortals, VJ-23X and MQ-17J, discuss the energy crisis this creates. They ask the Galactic AC if entropy can be reversed, getting the same response. Later, Zee Prime and Dee Sub Wun, two clusters of disembodied human minds, explore galaxies and
