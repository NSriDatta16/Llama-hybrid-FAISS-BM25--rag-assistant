It may be that you're misunderstanding what exactly Groovy and Grails are. Groovy is a dynamic language that uses Java's JVM (virtual machine). It can compile to Java bytecode and run anywhere that a typical Java program can run. It's only a language, not a framework for developing web applications. You could use Groovy by itself to build a web application, leveraging Servlets, JSPs, and other libraries to help you. However... Grails is a framework that uses the Groovy language to help you build web applications. Grails gives you easy ways to create all of the web application components that you'd normally have to build yourself (using Servlets, JSPs, etc.). This may help explain to you why Bozho suggested to go straight to Grails (and why I agree with him).
