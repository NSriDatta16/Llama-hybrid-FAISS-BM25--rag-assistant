I've no idea why GCC organizes its stack the way it does (though I guess you could crack open its source or this paper and find out), but I can tell you how to guarantee the order of specific stack variables if for some reason you need to. Simply put them in a struct: void function1() { struct { int x; int y; int z; int *ret; } locals; } If my memory serves me correctly, spec guarantees that &ret > &z > &y > &x . I left my K&R at work so I can't quote chapter and verse though.
