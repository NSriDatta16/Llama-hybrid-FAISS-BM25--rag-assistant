Move Nice Menus to Just below the Title

I can't get the Nice Menu ( located on the top left) down to below the title bar. (i.e., just above the word " Organize the information and make them accessible to the world ") in Drupal. http://lh5.ggpht.com/_SDci0Pf3tzU/SeDF5T6fBAI/AAAAAAAAErI/vEoQQPmC164/s400/site%20menu.jpg I tried to move the Nice Menu to content block in admin/build/block , but it will then be located at the bottom, below the content block and above the powered by drupal sign. If I move it to Header then the above image is what I observed. There is no in between. Anyone has any idea?
