Very interesting image compression. Here's my try to convert a RGB888 image into a Index8 with your function: QImage image8(image.size(), QImage::Format_Indexed8); QVector lut(256); for(int i=0;i It basically fills up the 8-bit color table as it converts from 888 to 8-bit data. For better result, you can accumulate the RGB values at an index, then average the values before putting them into the color table. It can also use some optimization on walking the image buffer.
