How to create maze walls in NetLogo?

I am trying to create a 5x5 grid with 2 exits and put some walls in it. In other words, I want to create a maze or a labyrinth. I was wondering if there is a way to make a border line thicker or change the colour of only one side of a patch. I want to put only one agent inside and let him find the exit by rewarding him with some points. (Q-learning algorithm) Does anyone have an idea? If this is not possible can you suggest comparable code please? Here is an example of what I want to create: As asked, I've posted some of my work (although it seems inefficient to have done this manually). Here is what I have so far: breed [frame frames] to setup ca ask patches [ set pcolor white] ask patch -7 8 [ set pcolor black] ask patch -6 8 [ set pcolor black] ask patch -5 8 [ set pcolor black] ask patch -4 8 [ set pcolor black] ask patch -3 8 [ set pcolor black] ask patch -2 8 [ set pcolor black] ask patch -1 8 [ set pcolor black] ask patch 1 8 [ set pcolor black] ask patch 0 8 [ set pcolor black] ask patch 2 8 [ set pcolor black] ask patch 3 8 [ set pcolor black] ask patch 6 8 [ set pcolor black] ask patch 7 8 [ set pcolor black] ask patch 8 8 [ set pcolor black] ask patch -7 7 [ set pcolor black] ask patch -7 6 [ set pcolor black] ask patch -7 5 [ set pcolor black] ask patch -7 4 [ set pcolor black] ask patch -7 3 [ set pcolor black] ask patch -7 2 [ set pcolor black] ask patch -7 1 [ set pcolor black] ask patch -7 0 [ set pcolor black] ask patch -7 -1 [ set pcolor black] ask patch -7 -2 [ set pcolor black] ask patch -7 -3 [ set pcolor black] ask patch -7 -4 [ set pcolor black] ask patch -7 -5 [ set pcolor black] ask patch -7 -6 [ set pcolor black] ask patch -7 -7 [ set pcolor black] ask patch -7 -7 [ set pcolor black] ask patch -6 -7 [ set pcolor black] ask patch -5 -7 [ set pcolor black] ask patch -4 -7 [ set pcolor black] ask patch -3 -7 [ set pcolor black] ask patch -2 -7 [ set pcolor black] ask patch -1 -7 [ set pcolor black] ask patch 1 -7 [ set pcolor black] ask patch 0 -7 [ set pcolor black] ask patch 2 -7 [ set pcolor black] ask patch 3 -7 [ set pcolor black] ask patch 4 -7 [ set pcolor black] ask patch 5 -7 [ set pcolor black] ask patch 8 -7 [ set pcolor black] ask patch 8 8 [ set pcolor black] ask patch 8 7 [ set pcolor black] ask patch 8 6 [ set pcolor black] ask patch 8 5 [ set pcolor black] ask patch 8 4 [ set pcolor black] ask patch 8 3 [ set pcolor black] ask patch 8 2 [ set pcolor black] ask patch 8 1 [ set pcolor black] ask patch 8 0 [ set pcolor black] ask patch 8 -1 [ set pcolor black] ask patch 8 -2 [ set pcolor black] ask patch 8 -3 [ set pcolor black] ask patch 8 -4 [ set pcolor black] ask patch 8 -5 [ set pcolor black] ask patch 8 -6 [ set pcolor black] ask patch -6 5 [ set pcolor black] ask patch -5 5 [ set pcolor black] ask patch -4 5 [ set pcolor black] ask patch -4 4 [ set pcolor black] ask patch -4 3 [ set pcolor black] ask patch -4 2 [ set pcolor black] ask patch -4 -1 [ set pcolor black] ask patch -4 -2 [ set pcolor black] ask patch -4 -3 [ set pcolor black] ask patch -4 -4 [ set pcolor black] ask patch -5 -4 [ set pcolor black] ask patch -6 -4 [ set pcolor black] ask patch -1 7 [ set pcolor black] ask patch -1 6 [ set pcolor black] ask patch -1 5 [ set pcolor black] ask patch -1 4 [ set pcolor black] ask patch -1 3 [ set pcolor black] ask patch -1 2 [ set pcolor black] ask patch 2 5 [ set pcolor black] ask patch 2 4 [ set pcolor black] ask patch 2 3 [ set pcolor black] ask patch 2 2 [ set pcolor black] ask patch 5 5 [ set pcolor black] ask patch 5 4 [ set pcolor black] ask patch 5 3 [ set pcolor black] ask patch 5 2 [ set pcolor black] ask patch 5 1 [ set pcolor black] ask patch 5 0 [ set pcolor black] ask patch 5 -1 [ set pcolor black] ask patch 6 5 [ set pcolor black] ask patch 7 5 [ set pcolor black] ask patch -1 -1 [ set pcolor black] ask patch 0 -1 [ set pcolor black] ask patch 1 -1 [ set pcolor black] ask patch 2 -1 [ set pcolor black] ask patch 3 -1 [ set pcolor black] ask patch 4 -1 [ set pcolor black] ask patch -1 -2 [ set pcolor black] ask patch -1 -3 [ set pcolor black] ask patch -1 -4 [ set pcolor black] ask patch 0 -4 [ set pcolor black] ask patch 1 -4 [ set pcolor black] ask patch 2 -4 [ set pcolor black] ask patch 3 -4 [ set pcolor black] ask patch 4 -4 [ set pcolor black] ask patch 5 -4 [ set pcolor black] end Again, this is an inefficient method. If I were to continue with this method, how can I merge 4 patches into 1 so that I can enter my agent inside and be centered? Thank you in advance.
