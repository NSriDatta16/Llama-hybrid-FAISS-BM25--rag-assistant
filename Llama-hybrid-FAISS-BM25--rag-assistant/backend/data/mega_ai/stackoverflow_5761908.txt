Use HttpClient. Then, with your InputStream, check this link: http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/data-storage.html#filesInternal And write it to the file you want. A quick and dirty example: // This goes inside a try... HttpClient htc = new DefaultHttpClient(); HttpGet get = new HttpGet("http://www.google.com"); HttpResponse htr = null; htr = htc.execute(get); InputStream is = htr.getEntity().getContent(); File saveFile = new File(getApplicationContext().getFilesDir().getPath() + File.separatorChar + "datos.txt"); FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(saveFile); // Validate if exists and so on... int c; while ((c = is.read()) != -1) { fos.write(c); } // Catch, finally, close, etc... You may also want to buffer your reading and writing code. Another method would be using: InputStream is = URL("http://www.google.com").getContent(); It's up to you. I like HttpClient 'cos you can handle more things.
