The two-period DID is typically taken to estimate the ATT. This can easily be seen by doing out the expectations. Consider the specification at the unit $i$ level, $$Y_i = \alpha + \gamma G_i + \theta T_i + \beta D_i + \epsilon_i$$ Here we use $G_i\in\{0,1\}$ to denote the group and $T_i \in \{0,1\}$ to denote the period. And $D_i = G_iT_i$ denotes treatment status. Then to extract the treatment effect $\beta$ (and determine what it is) we will look at the potential outcomes when the group and period indicators are switched on. We have the potential outcome for the control as, $$\mathbb{E}[Y_i(0)|G_i=1,T_i=1]=\alpha + \gamma + \theta$$ And for treated, $$\mathbb{E}[Y_i(1)|G_i=1,T_i=1]=\mathbb{E}[Y_i(0)|G_i=1,T_i=1]+\beta$$ So we have, $$\beta = \mathbb{E}[Y_i(1)-Y_i(0)|G_i=1,T_i=1]=\mathbb{E}[Y_i(1)-Y_i(0)|D_i=1]=ATT$$ In the case of a generalized DID estimator where there are multiple periods and multiple groups whose treatment status can be switched on at different times the answer is more complicated. As I wrote in this answer the generalized DID can always be broken down into a weighted average of two-period DIDs. Each of these will exhibit an ATT. But overall, you will have estimated an average of ATTs. The exact interpretation of this is a little bit uncertain. Under a constant treatment assumption (which is very strong) this will indeed be the ATT. However, usually, that is not the case. Goodman-Bacon (2018) provides a little more study of how to interpret this. See section 2 of the attached paper.
