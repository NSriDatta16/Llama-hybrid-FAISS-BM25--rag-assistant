What quantities are we typically interested in when we perform statistical analysis on a time series? We want to know Its expected value, Its variance, and The correlation between values $s$ periods apart for a set of $s$ values. How do we calculate these things? Using a mean across many time periods. The mean across many time periods is only informative if the expected value is the same across those time periods. If these population parameters can vary, what are we really estimating by taking an average across time? (Weak) stationarity requires that these population quantities must be the same across time, making the sample average a reasonable way to estimate them. In addition to this, stationary processes avoid the problem of spurious regression .
