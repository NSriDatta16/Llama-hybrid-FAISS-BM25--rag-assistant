Influence function used in partykit for binary classification

What is the influence function used for binary classification in the R package partkit , specifically for the conditional tree ( ctree ). I could not find any details in the R package documentation. In the vigente I found this paragraph about classification: But the function $e_J(Y_i)$ is not defined. What is $e_J(Y_i)$ ? and is it the influence function used for the function ctree ?
