this means that they (their?) parameters are estimated before you split the equation up? I guess you could see the regression exercise as solving a system of $n$ equations (4 in your example) and $p$ unknowns (2 in your example). Because you have more equations than unknowns you (typically) cannot have a single solution as if you had $n = p$ . So you need the error term to adjust the discrepancy between fitted value and observation in each equation. (I think before OLS, people used to select the most trustworthy datapoints or average them in order to reduce the system to $n = p$ , but I can't remember a reference for this and I may be wrong...). Also, the regression line in your example should be $y = 2.07 + 0.09x$ . From: y |t|) (Intercept) 2.06897 3.77346 0.548 0.6385 x 0.08621 0.02438 3.536 0.0715 . ```
