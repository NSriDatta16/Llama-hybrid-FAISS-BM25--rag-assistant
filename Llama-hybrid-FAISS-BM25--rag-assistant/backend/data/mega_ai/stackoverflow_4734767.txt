Install Productivity Power Tools and use Solution Navigator instead of Solution Explorer: Solution Navigator is a new tool window that acts like an enhanced Solution Explorer. With it, you can: * Expand code files to navigate to its classes, expand classes to navigate to their members, and so on (C# and VB only) * Search your solution, all the way down to class members * Filter your solution or projects to see just opened files, unsaved files, and so on * View related information about classes and members (such as references or callers/callees for C#) * Preview images by hovering over them, or preview rich information by hovering over code items * We've also added support for multiple selection and drag & drop. (New!) It also haves a collapse all button.
