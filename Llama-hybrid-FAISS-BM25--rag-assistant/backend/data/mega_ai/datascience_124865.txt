Why Relu is correct for CNN?

Relu only passes positive values, so when we calculate the gradients for this layer, we will only get positive gradients. The gradient for the filter weights of this layer is the convolution of the input image and the derivative of the loss function (which, as I said, is positive). This means that the gradient is also positive, which means that the filter weights are always decreasing. Something seems off. I have tried to use leaky_relu, but filter weights are still decreasing (just with the lower rate)
