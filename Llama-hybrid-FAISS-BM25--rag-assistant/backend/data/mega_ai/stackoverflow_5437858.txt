confused about Android's 'preferExternal' manifest filter

The Android docs say: The .apk file is saved to the external storage, but any application data (such as databases) is still saved on the internal device memory. So what I'm supposing is that anything in your /raw or other resource goes with the the apk onto external storage, eh? Also, does the download from the Market go straight to external storage, or do you have to have room for the app on internal storage so that it can download it and them move it when the download is complete?
