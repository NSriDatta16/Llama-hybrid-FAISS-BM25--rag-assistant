First, you should define what you mean with similarity and a corresponding metric to measure it. The second step is to apply the metric to (A, D), (B, D), etc. Then, the set that gives the smallest value is the one with the highest similarity. If you find that your metric does not what you want, simply change it until it meets your requirements. You need to be clear about what you mean with "similarity" and how to measure it though. One possibility is to interpret the sets of parameters as a point in a N-dimensional space and calculate the average euclidean distance.
