In a generalized linear model, a link function $g()$ defines the association between the expected outcome $y$ and the $k$ corresponding predictor values $x_j$ : $$g(y)=\beta_0 + \sum_{j=1}^k \beta_i x_j.$$ If you specify an inverse link in your model, $g(y)= 1/y$ , then it will be difficult to have an easy interpretation of associations of individual coefficients with outcome, because you then have: $$y=\frac{1}{\beta_0 + \sum_{j=1}^k \beta_i x_j} .$$ Even without interactions among predictors, the association of any one predictor with outcome thus depends on the values of the others. You can still use that formula for predictions, however, as your answer illustrates. With a numeric outcome scale representing increasing values of loneliness, this type of data might instead be modeled via ordinal logistic regression . With a logit link, the individual predictor coefficients then have reasonably straightforward interpretations in terms of changes in the log-odds of changing the outcome by 1 level, given that other predictor values are held constant.
