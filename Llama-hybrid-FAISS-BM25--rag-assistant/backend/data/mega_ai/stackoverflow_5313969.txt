Razor HTML Conditional Output

I have a list of items I want to output as the contents of a main (the main in not included below). Each Item has 3 attributes: a Section Name, a Label and a Value. Each item is enclosed in a and everytime the Section Name changes I have to open a (and close the previous one, if any). I'm using a Razor view with this code: @foreach (LocalStorageItem lsi in Model) { string fld_name = "f_" + lsi.ItemName; if (lsi.SectionName != sn) { if (sn != "") { Html.Raw(" "); } sn = lsi.SectionName; @sn Html.Raw(" "); } @lsi.ItemName . } @if (Model.Count != 0) { Html.Raw(" "); } The problem is: each time the Section Name changes no fieldset tag (open and/or close) is generated. Where am I wrong? If I don't use Html.Raw (or @: as an alternative) the VS2010 parser signals an error.
