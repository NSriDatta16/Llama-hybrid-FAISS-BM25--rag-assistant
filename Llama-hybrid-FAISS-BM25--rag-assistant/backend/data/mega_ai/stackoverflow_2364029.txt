MySQL DB design help

Pardon the elementary question but my newness to the realm of database design leaves me in a bind quite often. I have a site that keeps growing with regard to families of information. In the beginning I had one sort of item I was describing and all was well. That item occupied one record and had 34 columns (a lot now that I look back) attributed to it of descriptive data. As I get more and more into this stuff, I see that many developers break out data (when practical) into distinct tables. I've now got additional tables that relate to the original item but are not always needed when describing the original item so I broke them out so they're not queried unnecessarily. Anyhow, I have a new item I've been trying to organize which is a USER. The user table has typical columns like username, email, last_login, path to associated image, etc. These users have been making comments, which I keep in yet another table that contains columns with IDs that relate to the user and the item on which they are commenting. Now... I am in the process of adding the obligatory user profile page to the site. Should I create yet another table containing only essential profile data or append the existing user record with profile data in the original user table? I am thinking housekeeping might be a pain if I am to add a "Remove me from site" function as I would have to run something that kills the user record, the user profile record, and any other data associated with that user ID in other tables. Basically what I am asking is should I keep going with this "granular" design method - breaking everything out into essential parts or does it ever serve me to consolidate into larger tables? I see a few instances where if a user deletes their account, I'll be left with a bunch of non-relevant data. For instance, the original item are restaurants... if I make a table to record "Visits" to restaurants, containing the Restaurant ID and the User ID, if the user or restaurant get removed from the site, this "Visits" table will have a bunch of useless records saying either "non existent restaurant was visited by user 45" or "Restaurant 21 was visited by non-existent user" I hope I make sense here... I'm just wondering if it's normal to end up with this "junk" data over time. Thanks much, Rob
