For those of you who are wondering, stoplion is referring to this feature: Loading Page Fragments (scroll down on the page): The .load() method, unlike $.get(), allows us to specify a portion of the remote document to be inserted. This is achieved with a special syntax for the url parameter. If one or more space characters are included in the string, the portion of the string following the first space is assumed to be a jQuery selector that determines the content to be loaded. Since $.get() doesn't appear to support it, I assume that $.ajax wouldn't either. A simple way to implement this would be the following: $.ajax({ url: 'http://example.com/page.html', data: {}, success: function (data) { $("#el").html($(data).find("#selector")); }, dataType: 'html' }); This would be the equivalent of $("#el").load('http://example.com/page.html #selector'); However, note that the special syntax (' #selector') means that scripts present in the loaded HTML will not be executed. See Script Execution in the .load() docs.
