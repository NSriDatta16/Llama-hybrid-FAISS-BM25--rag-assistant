No, there isn't. I suggest you use DOM parsers to read the various HTML bits into memory, and then construct a combined document in UTF-8. Once these HTML fragments are in memory (after parsing) they'll be in some sort of Unicode representation (depending on the programming language), and so no information should get lost along the way.
