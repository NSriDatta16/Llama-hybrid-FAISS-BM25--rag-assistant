Applying the MVC Concept in JAVA

Good day! With regards to my previous post , to adapt to the concept of MVC as suggested, I changed my code and included an IO class as follows: public class IO { public void output(String msg) { JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, msg); } public String input(String prompt) { return JOptionPane.showInputDialog(prompt); } public int inputInt(String prompt) { return Integer.parseInt(input(prompt)); } } public class GuessGame { private int numberToGuess; private ArrayList player; private IO io = new IO (); public void acceptPlayers(){ int num_players = io.inputInt("Enter number of players"); player = new ArrayList (num_players); for (int i = 0; i Is this correct? How can I improve my code? Thank you.
