Logistic regression classifier with non-negative weights constraint

My feature data is defined in such a way that I believe all weights must be non-negative. I am looking for a reference discussing how to optimize the weights of a logistic regression classifier with the constraint that the weights must be non-negative, and perhaps also a constraint on the sign of the bias. Will replacing weights with squared weights and using the regular ML cost function with a local optimization scheme work?
