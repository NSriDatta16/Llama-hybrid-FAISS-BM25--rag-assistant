I think you are perhaps worrying too much! Does it make sense logically? Do you know where to find your code within the namespaces? I would much rather see a codebase like the above with a small number of classes, relevant to the name with a hierarchy, than one large namespace where everything is interrelated.. Remember, namespacing is there for precisely this, to organise your codebase logically What you have seems logical :) EDIT: As an example: using System.Data; using System.Data.Sql; ;)
