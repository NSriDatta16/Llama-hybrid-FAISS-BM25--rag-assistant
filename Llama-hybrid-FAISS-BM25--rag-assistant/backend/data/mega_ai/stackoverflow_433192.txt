In Visual Studio 2003, Visual Studio 2005 and possibly earlier versions (this works in 2008 as well) you can include the text file in your project, then in the 'Properties' panel, set the action to 'Embedded Resource'. Then you can access the file as a stream using Assembly.GetManifestResourceStream(string) . Other answers here are more convenient. I include this for completeness. Note that this approach will work for embedding other types of files such as images, icons, sounds, etc...
