Are the same features used to split a node, in random forest, used in all the trees? If so, can we skip a feature selection method?

I have a dataset of 20 features. I have optimised Random Forest and the parameters it uses are: number of trees: 167 max # of features used to split a node: 9 If I can find out what features where used to split a node and if these same 9 feaures are used in all the trees; can I skip a feature selection method? I mean I just eliminate the 11 features not used.
