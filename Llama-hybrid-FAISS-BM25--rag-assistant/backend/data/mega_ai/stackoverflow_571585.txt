Some basic rules for you. Try to make effective use of whitespace. Don't cram everything together in an effort to get as much stuff on screen as possible. This will make grouped controls more clear and text more legible. Basic typography. Limit your use of fonts to 1 or 2. Don't use bold too much or it loses its emphasis. The same goes for colours. Don't use too many, the fewer the better most of the time. Don't just use icons to save space. Tiny icons with no explanation are useless. Copy. Not wholesale of course, but if you are not well-versed in UI design yourself, it makes sense to take elements of interfaces you know work and apply them in your own designs. Be clear about the purpose of the interface. How does it fit within the broader application for example? And what are the specific objectives you are trying to satisfy with it? Get people to test it for you, early and often. I don't know what setup you are working with, or what kind of organisation you are in, but getting some kind of human feedback on your work will always be helpful, even if you lack the time and expertise to conduct proper usability evaluations.
