Yep, users has to be careful when mixing locales on Unix in general. GUI file managers that displays and changes filenames also have this problem. On Mac OS X the standard Unix encoding is UTF-8. In fact the HFS+ filesystem, when called via the Unix interfaces, enforces UTF-8 filenames because it needs to convert it to UTF-16 for storage in the filesystem itself.
