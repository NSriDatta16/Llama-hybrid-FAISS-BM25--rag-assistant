How to deal with many NAs in dataset when comparing several models?

My task is to compare different logistic regression models to examine which theory better explains the data we have collected. In doing so, I have a set of IVs with a considerable amount of missing data (NAs). My issue is that when building a model with all IVs and in that process omitting the observations for which at least one of the IVs is missing, some of the effects that show up in models that consider only a subset of the IVs vanish. Even more, I stumble on perfect separation. At the same time, I understand that to compare models, I must test them all with the same data (thus, with all non-complete cases omitted). So, my question is if there is a better way of dealing with these NAs, while still being able to compare the multiple models.
