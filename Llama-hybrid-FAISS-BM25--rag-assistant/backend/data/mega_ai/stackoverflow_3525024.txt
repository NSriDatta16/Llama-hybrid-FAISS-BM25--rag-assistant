How can I forward touches to a UIButton from another UIView?

I have a UIButton and a UIView. The View sits above the button, and is larger than the button in size. The view itself is what I want to have accept the touch events, and I'd like to forward them to the button, so that all the normal button visual changes on touch happen. I can't seem to make this work-- my UIView implements touchesBegan/Moved/Ended/Cancelled, and turns around and calls the same methods on the button with the same arguments. But the button doesn't respond. I have ensured that the touch methods are in fact being called on the UIView. Is there something obvious I'm missing here, or a better way of getting the control messages across? Or is there a good reason why this shouldn't work? Thanks! [Note: I'm not looking for workarounds for the view+button design. Let's assume that that's a requirement. I'm interested in the notion of controls that are touch proxies for other controls. Thanks.]
