Conclusions from combination of P value and Effect size

Limitations of P values are being increasingly highlighted in recent literature (e.g. here and here ). To evaluate results of unpaired t-test, following is an approach combining P values and effect size : Which of these conclusions are most vulnerable to limitations of P value and hypothesis testing and which of these are least likely to be incorrect? Also, for which of these situations, Bayesian analysis/Bayes Factors have distinct advantages over hypothesis testing? Thanks for your insight. Edit: Following algorithm adds power assessment if P>0.05: Codes at end of conclusions are as follows: SDL- small difference likely; MDL-moderate difference likely; LDL- large difference likely; SDVL- small difference very likely; MDVL- moderate difference very likely; LDVL- large difference very likely
