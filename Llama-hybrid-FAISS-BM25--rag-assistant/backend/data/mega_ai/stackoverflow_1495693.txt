Sure, just write an expression in SQL that generates the number of months since the first sale (Do you mean the first sale for that afiliate? If so, you'll need a subquery) And since you say you want a list of sales, I assume you don't really want to "Group By" affilaite and monthcount, you just want to Sort, or Order By those values) If you wanted the Average sales amount, or the Count of sales, or some other Aggregate function of sales data, then you would be doing a "Group By"... And I don't think you need to worry about sorting by the number of months, you can simply sort by the difference between each sales date and the rearliest sale date for each affiliate. (If you wanted to apply a third sorting rule, after the sales date sort, then you would need to be more careful.) Select * From Sales S Order By Affiliate, SalesDate - (Select Min(SalesDate) From Sales Where Affiliate = S.Affiliate) Or, if you really need it to be by the difference in months Select * From Sales S Order By Affiliate, Month(SalesDate) - (Select Month(Min(SalesDate)) From Sales Where Affiliate = S.Affiliate)
