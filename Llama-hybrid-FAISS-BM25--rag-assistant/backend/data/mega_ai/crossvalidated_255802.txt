Implementing a CNN using tensorflow

I have a 2-class classification problem in hand. I have extracted a set of 3 features for each training example .. I am planning to use a very simple CNN to learn the weights. My model looks like I am planning to use tensorflow for implementing this CNN in python. The official tutorial https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/deep_cnn/ seems to be somewhat abstract . Can I get a basic code to train this?
