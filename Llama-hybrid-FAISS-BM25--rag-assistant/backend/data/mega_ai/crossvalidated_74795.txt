Assuming you have enough data points, I don't see why you couldn't just normalize everything into units of standard deviations. For each group, calculate the group's average value, and the group's standard deviation. Then for each data point in each group, subtract the corresponding group average, and then divide that result by the group's standard deviation. For example, let's say that your first group (with the scale from -5 to 5) has a mean of 1.7, and a standard deviation of 2.3. For each observation in the group, subtract 1.7 from the observation, and then divide the result by 2.3. The result is the number of standard deviations above (if the result is positive) or below (if the result is negative) the observation is from the mean of the group. All of your observations from each of the three groups will now be on a common scale, whose mean is zero, standard deviation is one, and the units of this new scale is standard deviations.
