Yep, it's fine, you just need to be aware that other processes/threads may not be able to open the log file for writing while your service has it open. I think other processes can still open it read-only, though I don't know if that's system-dependent. If other threads/processes do need to be able to write to the file intermixed with your service's writes, you could do something like caching log lines in the MyLogger instance; then once you have, say, 100, open the file in append mode, write them out, and close the file. That's not a particularly elegant thing to do, though.
