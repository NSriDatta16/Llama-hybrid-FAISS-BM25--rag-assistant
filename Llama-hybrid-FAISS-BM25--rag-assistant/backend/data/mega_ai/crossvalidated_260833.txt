I think logistic regression and linear models for classification are widely used in "large feature" data sets. For example, in natural language processing, or computer vision, where we treat the word counts and pixels as features, respectively, and use linear models to do the classification. The only difference is when using logistic regression on large feature data sets, we do not emphasize the assumptions too much, or the interpretation of the coefficients, and care more about the classification accuracy.
