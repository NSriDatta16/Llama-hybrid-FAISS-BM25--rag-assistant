This is not (yet) and answer, only a comment but too long for the box I do not really know how to determine such significance; but out of couriosity I did a bootstrap-procedure: from a replication of the original data to a pseudo-population of $N=19200$ I draw $t=1000$ randomsamples of $n=150$ (each row of the dataset could occur at most $128$ times). From each of this $t=1000$ experiments I computed the pca-solutions and stored the first pc only in a list. From this 1000 instances of first pc's I got the following statistics for their loadings: PrC[1]: Mean Min Max Stddev SE_mean lb(95%) mean ub(95%) ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ S.L 0.362 0.314 0.412 0.015 0.000 0.361 0.362 0.362 S.W -0.085 -0.131 -0.023 0.017 0.001 -0.086 -0.085 -0.083 P.L 0.856 0.841 0.869 0.004 0.000 0.856 0.856 0.857 P.W 0.358 0.334 0.382 0.008 0.000 0.358 0.358 0.359 The 95% confidence interval for the item S.Width was -0.085 .. - 0.083 and this shows that this value seems to be from zero not by the pure random-effect of the sampling. (Similarly narrow appear all 95% confidence intervals for the other loadings) After that it's clear I need more clarification what it means for a loading to "contribute significantly" - significance derived from what expectance? (But that's what I do not yet understand, I'm competely illiterate yet with the question of significance-estimation for covariances and for loadings in a factormodel, so this all might be of no help at all here) [Update 2] Here is a picture which shows the location of the Iris-items in the coordinates of the first 2 principal components, evaluated by the Monte-Carlo-experiment ("population": $N=128 \cdot 150=19200$, "sample": $n=150$, number-of-samples: $s=1000$) Picture 1: (using covariance-matrix, loadings from eigenvectors as done in the OP's question) From the picture I'd say, that the small loading of Sepal.Width of -0.141 on pc1 is a reliable (different from zero, however small) estimate of the loading in the "population" (because the whole cloud is separated from the y-axis) Using the standard interpretation of PCA (based on correlations, using scaled eigenvectors) the picture looks a bit different, but still with very little disturbances of the loadings of the items. The statistics are as in the following: PrC[1] Mean Min Max Stddev SE_mean lb(95%) mean ub(95%) ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ S.L 0.891 0.840 0.937 0.015 0.000 0.890 0.891 0.892 S.W -0.459 -0.705 -0.159 0.081 0.003 -0.465 -0.459 -0.454 P.L 0.991 0.987 0.994 0.001 0.000 0.991 0.991 0.991 P.W 0.965 0.946 0.980 0.005 0.000 0.965 0.965 0.965 Picture 2: (using correlation-matrix, principal components taken in the standard method) [Update 1] Just for my own couriosity I made a set of plots of the empirical loadings-matrices when samples are drawn from a known population. That's somehow bootstrapping, and I've not yet seen similar images. I took as population a set of 1000 normal random distributed cases with a certain factorial structure. Then I draw 256 random samples from the population with n=40 and did the same components-analysis/rotation for each of that 256 samples. To compare and to see, how the accuracy of the estimation improves I took the same number of samples, but now each sample with n=160.
