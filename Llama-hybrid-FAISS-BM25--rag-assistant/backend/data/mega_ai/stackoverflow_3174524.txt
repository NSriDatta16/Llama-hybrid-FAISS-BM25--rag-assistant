Constant declaration in Ada

Being new to Ada, I'm exploring its syntax and rules and I would like to draw attention on the code given next. Here I'm trying to set a variable Actual_Stiffness to hold a constant value. Its value is given by the product: Actual_Stiffness := Stiffness_Ratio * Stiffness_Total where Stiffness_Total has been defined to be a constant Long_Float in the specification file Material_Data.ads and Stiffness_Total has a value already set in the ads file. WITH Ada.Text_IO; WITH Ada.Long_Float_Text_IO; WITH Material_Data; USE Material_Data; PROCEDURE sample IS Stiffness_Ratio : Long_Float; Actual_Stiffness : CONSTANT Long_Float := Stiffness_Ratio * Stiffness_Total; BEGIN -- main program Ada.Text_IO.Put("Enter stiffness ratio: "); Ada.Long_Float_Text_IO.Get(Item => Stiffness_Ratio); Ada.Long_Float_Text_IO.Put(Item => Stiffness_Ratio); --Ada.Text_IO.New_Line; --Ada.Long_Float_Text_IO.Put(Item => Actual_Stiffness); --Ada.Text_IO.New_Line; --Ada.Long_Float_Text_IO.Put(Item => Stiffness_Total); END sample; On compiling I get the warning message warning: "Stiffness_Ratio" may be referenced before it has a value and on running the program, Actual_Stiffness doesn't get the right value. I could defined Actual_Stiffness to be just a Long_Float (without adding CONSTANT) and then get its value from the product Actual_Stiffness := Stiffness_Ratio * Stiffness_Total after BEGIN in my program when Stiffness_Ratio would have already gotten a value. This would be the right thing to do. My question is: I have defined Stiffness_Total as a constant Long_Float with a prescribed value. How to define Actual_Stiffness to be constant also (as it won't be changing in the program) while keeping the ability for a user to interactively being able to enter a Stiffness_Ratio at the terminal? Is that even possible to do? Thanks a lot..
