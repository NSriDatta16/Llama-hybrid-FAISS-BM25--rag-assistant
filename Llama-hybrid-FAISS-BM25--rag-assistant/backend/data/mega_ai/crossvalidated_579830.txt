Binomial Bayesian Regression with Metropolis Hastings in R

I'm trying to implement the Metropolis Hastings algorithm in this problem but I'm having problems with the convergence. $$Y_i|\beta_0,\beta_1 \sim \text{Binomial}(m_i,\theta_i)$$ where $logit(\theta) = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_i$ . $Y_i$ is the number of damage incidents of 6 possible (i.e number of successes). This also means $m_i = 6$ . I assume a normal distribution for the regression coefficients and I'm using random walk as a candidate distribution, so $$\beta_0 \sim N(0,10)$$ $$\beta_0 \sim N(0,10)$$ $$\beta_j^*|\beta_{j}^{t-1} \sim N(\beta_{j}^{t-1},\sigma^2)$$ For the data I'm using temp # Posterior distribution post_beta S $success x temp init The results using a frequentist framework using glm are the following. res_freq = glm(cbind(data_p2$success,data_p2$failures)~x,family = binomial()) summary(res_freq ) And I tried to use this result as initial values but that doesn't seem to work to either. I have the feeling that the mistake could be in post_beta function. Thanks in advance!
