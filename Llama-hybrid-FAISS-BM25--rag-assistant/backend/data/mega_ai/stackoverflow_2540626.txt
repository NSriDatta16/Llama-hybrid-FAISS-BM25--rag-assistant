My suggestion is similar to Ed Marty (what he suggests "without a second UIScrollView"): Place the UITableView inside a simple UIView. Make the cell backgrounds transparent so background from below the tableview would show Below the UITableView, place an UIImageView with your desired background. Both the UITableView and UIImageView now sit inside the same enclosing UIView. Listen to scroll events of UITableView. When detecting a scroll, simply change the background UIImageView position (frame.origin.y) appropriately, so that it would "stick with" the tableview. You can have the background as one gigantic image, or have a series of them so you do tiling. You can have an array of the images and add to the array from top/bottom when needed, and also remove the images that have "scrolled away" from screen to conserve memory. You will need to calculate the positions for all these background images yourself, but there's nothing complicated in that.
