This depends on your definition of probability. This has been a very heated debate in statistics. My take on it now is that the debate has become more polite but is still unresolved and is probably unresolvable. You can find an introduction on this theme in: Ian Hacking (2001) An Introduction to Probability and Inductive Logic. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. On a less philosophical and more pragmatic level I have no problem with designating those proportions as (frequentist) estimates of probabilities. If I were to describe the association in that cross-tabulation I would probably compute an odds ratio $\frac{a d}{b c}$ or equivalently $\frac{f(1,1)f(0,0)}{f(1,0)f(0,1)}$, but other measures of association in a cross-tabulation exist.
