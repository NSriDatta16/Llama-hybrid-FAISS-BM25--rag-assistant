It is possible to compute coherence scores, but you will really need to implement it from scratch yourself from the definitions of coherence I am afraid. Top2Vec doesn't have topic-word distributions. Instead you will be looking at ranking of topic words in terms of their distance from the topic vector in the joint topic/word/document embedding space. Such a ranking is sufficient for many of the types of coherence score.
