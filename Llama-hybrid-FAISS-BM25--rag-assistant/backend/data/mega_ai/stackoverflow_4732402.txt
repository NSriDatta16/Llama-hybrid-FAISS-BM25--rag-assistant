I had an answer half typed, but then Jon answered so my answer in its current form became pointless.... I will offer a counterpoint on Jon's answer though. Think carefully before using immutable objects - they are good from some perspectives, but you will quickly run into trouble if using them for binding to editable fields, or if serializing them (either to storage or for transferring, ie WCF web service calls).
