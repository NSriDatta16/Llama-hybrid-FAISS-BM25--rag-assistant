how to create a general project only containing one folder in netbeans 6.9

how to create a general project only containing one folder in netbeans 6.9? In eclipse i can do it, but in netbeans sometime i just want to organize some files related to some category, so i want to create a single project just only containing folder and files, but now it seems that it's not possible. if someone has the same problem, and can share your experience, thank u.
