There are multiple issues going on; the first is your legal right to use the FFMpeg code specifically. This code is governed by the license chosen by the FFMpeg developers, and they have portions with GPL and portions with LGPL embedded. If you compile with the GPL-licensed portions, then the entirety becomes GPL, and you must either distribute the source code for FFMpeg OR offer to make it available for three years. If you link your code against FFMpeg, then you must also provide your source code OR offer to make it available for three years. If you disable the GPL portions, then you do not need to provide source code for your project, and you only need to provide FFMpeg source code if you modify the LGPL-portions of FFMpeg. BUT , this is only to abide by the copyright on FFMpeg. You also must comply with the intellectual property of the algorithms inside FFMpeg. This means in the United States and most other countries you must license the underlying algorithms from the organizations that patented the algorithms. E.g., if you use FFMpeg to decode MPEG2 Layer 3 data, then you must license MP3 support from Fraunhofer or one of their licensees. They may or may not place restrictions on the source code that is legal to use their intellectual property. There are probably dozens of patents on technology in FFMpeg across dozens of patent offices from countries around the world. Which is why a lot of companies buy their source (and licenses!) from a single source, to avoid the complication of licensing agreements in every country where you will have a user and a license holder has registered an intellectual property through the local patent office.
