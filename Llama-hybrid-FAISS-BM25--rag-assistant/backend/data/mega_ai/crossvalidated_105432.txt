Additive vs Multiplicative decomposition

My question is a really simple one but those are the ones that really get me :) I don't really know how to evaluate if a specific time series is to be decomposed using an additive or a multiplicative decomposition method. I know there are visual cues as to telling them apart from one another but i don't get them. Take for instance this time series: How would you describe it? Thanks in advance for your help.
