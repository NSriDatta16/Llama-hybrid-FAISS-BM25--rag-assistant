Both std::vector and ublas::vector are containers. The whole point of containers is to manage the storage and lifetimes of their contained objects. This is why when you initialize them they must copy values into storage that they own. C arrays are areas of memory fixed in size and location so by their nature you can only get their values into a container by copying. You can use C arrays as the input to many algorithm functions so perhaps you can do that to avoid the initial copy?
