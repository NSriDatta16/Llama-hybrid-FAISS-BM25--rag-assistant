This may surprise many, but to solve this problem you don't necessarily need to estimate s . In fact, you don't need to know anything about the spread of the data (although that would be helpful, of course). For instance, Wall, Boen, and Tweedie in a 2001 article describe how to find a finite confidence interval for the mean of any unimodal distribution based on a single draw. In the present case, we have some basis to view the sample mean of 112 as a draw from an approximately normal distribution (namely, the sampling distribution of the average of a simple random sample of 49 salaries). We are implicitly assuming there are a fairly large number of factory workers and that their salary distribution is not so skewed or multimodal as to render the central limit theorem inoperable. Then a conservative 90% CI for the mean extends upwards to $$112 + 5.84\ |112|,$$ clearly covering the true mean of 200. (See Wall et al formula 3.) Given the limited information available and the assumptions made here, we therefore cannot conclude that 112 differs "significantly" from 200.
