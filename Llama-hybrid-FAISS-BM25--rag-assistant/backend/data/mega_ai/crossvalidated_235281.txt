Reliability tells us about internal consistency , i.e. it shows that we are able to replicate the results . Imagine that you measured your child's temperature, after repeating the measurements few times during fifteen minutes you got the following readings: 35.1°C, 36.6°C, 38.1°C, 35.7°C, 37.3°C, 39.9°C - what do they tell you? I'd say that they show that your thermometer is unreliable and cannot be trusted. Could there be some good reason that a measure isn't reliable? Yes, for example, when you do not have anything better on hand. Another example, you may want to make your test shorter so your study participants do not have to answers multiple-page long questionnaire so not to discourage them, what can potentially make it less reliable than the full test etc. Saying it shortly, sometimes practical reasons make you use less reliable measurements.
