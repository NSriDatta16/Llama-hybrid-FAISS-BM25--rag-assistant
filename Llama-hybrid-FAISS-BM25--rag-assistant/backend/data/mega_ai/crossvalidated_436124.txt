CNN weights greater than 1

I am looking to visualize a class activation map (CAM) on my 1D data with Keras. I found that CAM values were not included between 0 and 1. After searching I found that some of the last layer weights were greater than 1 (6.240733, 0.15269098, ..., 0.5547908 , 1.6323686). I thought that the weights should not exceed 1, Am I wrong?
