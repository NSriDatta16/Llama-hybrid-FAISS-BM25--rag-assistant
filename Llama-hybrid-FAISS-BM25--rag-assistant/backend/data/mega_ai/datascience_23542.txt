I think the answer also depends on your usecase. If you just want to detect these kind of strings I would focus on heuristic rules that suit my needs, rather than creating a system that learns to recognize the patterns of the strings. However, if your aim is generating similar kind of strings based on the current patterns or finding new strings in a stream of text, you should look for regex generators. There is this list of resources regarding regexes in general and you should focus on the generators for the task at hand. For a similar task in the past, I had used an online, free tool that will generate a regex (if possible) that satisfies as many of your sample strings as possible. So you could give it a try, as a fast solution. Either way, I would first do some data exploration(e.g. are numbers and letters also intermixed or do numbers always come up after or letters/symbols etc.), in order to get a better understanding for the problem at hand. Also, this could lead to simple heuristic rules that could suffice as a crude solution or at least a simple baseline system against which I would "pitch" a machine learning model.
