Flash toggle snapping

long, long ago in a galaxy far far away, You used to be able to toggle snapping in Flash with the ctrl key. Let's say you were dragging the end of a line very close to another object. You could very easily hold the ctrl key down to shut off the snapping and get it in there nice and close without the snap. At some point, Macromedia removed this functionality. I'm wondering if that single-key-toggle-snapping functionality has gone somewhere else within the app or do I have to click through the menus every time?
