On (1), take a look at these 2-3 papers that use a data-driven approach: Chay, K. Y., P. J. McEwan, and M. Urquiola (2005). The central role of noise in evaluating interventions that use test scores to rank schools. American Economic Review 95(4), 1237– 1258 Bertrand, M., R. Hanna, and S. Mullainathan (2010). Affirmative action in education: Evidence from engineering college admissions in India. Journal of Public Economics 94 (1), 16–29. They essentially run a series of regressions of treatment on a dummy that equals 1 after each possible cutoff point and choose the one cut-off that gives the highest $R^2$ of the regression.

On (2), see this question about fuzzy RD as IV, a kind of Wald estimator.
