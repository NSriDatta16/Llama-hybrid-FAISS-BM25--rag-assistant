It looks like you're determining whether to display the mobile page (the story) or the description page by screen width. From my understanding, it would probably be better to detect mobile phones by user agent or user a pre-built browser detection script to determine which page to display. I often use browser windows less than 800px wide, so an issue like this would have prevented me from seeing the page correctly on my browser.
