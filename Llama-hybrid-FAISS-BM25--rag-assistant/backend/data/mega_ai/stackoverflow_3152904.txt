Begin and End do not slow down your code, as others have already said. I am writing another answer to encourage you even more explicitly to ALWAYS use begin and end whenever you could use them. It is good to be liberal with using Begin and End, and not worry about them slowing you down (because they don't). If you go the other way, and leave out begin and end wherever you can, you get into a different type of trouble. This has happened to me lots. You can get in trouble when you insert a line into a place where no begin and end statement exist. You then end up scratching your head wondering what you did that broke your code. Begin-end-everywhere, even where not needed, is standard operating procedure for a lot of Delphi coders.
