Is this a good classification model?

I'm training a CNN model for binary classification. The obtained confusion matrix and some corresponding performance measures on validation set are as follows: ans = 11046 177 561 9306 accuracy: 0.965007 sensitivity: 0.943144 specificity: 0.984229 precision: 0.981335 recall: 0.943144 f_measure: 0.961860 gmean: 0.963467 It seems the results are good. But the training loss seems bad, as shown as follows: Is this a good model?
