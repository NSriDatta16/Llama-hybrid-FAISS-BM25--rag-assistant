Has anyone studied the properties of the following method of estimation?

In Bayesian inference, we usually sample from the posterior $f(\theta_1,\theta_2|-)$ via MCMC to compute point estimates for the parameters of interest. I am investigating an alternate form of arriving at a point estimate. Sometimes it happens that drawing from the full posterior, $f(\theta_1,\theta_2|-)$, is difficult but it is relatively easy to draw from the conditionals $f(\theta_1|\theta_2,-)$ and $f(\theta_2|\theta_1,-)$. Thus, I want to investigate the properties of the following sampler: Initialize $\theta_1=\theta_1^0$, $\theta_2=\theta_2^0$ Converged = False Do While Not(Converged) $\quad$ Set $\theta_1^i$ = $E(\theta_1|\theta_2^{i-1},-)$ $\quad$ Set $\theta_2^i$ = $E(\theta_2|\theta_1^{i-1},-)$ $\quad$ If $|\theta_1^i-\theta_1^{i-1}|\le \epsilon$ and $|\theta_2^i-\theta_2^{i-1}|\le \epsilon$ Converged = True End If End While Some preliminary simulations suggest that the above sampler converges very fast in the context of linear regression. Could someone point me to an existing literature which looks at theoretical properties of the above sampler?
