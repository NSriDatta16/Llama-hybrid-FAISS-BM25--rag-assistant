There are two things that strike me. Let me demonstrate a little R code I ran to reproduce your dataset: set.seed(10) score |t|) (Intercept) 1.6667 0.6011 2.773 0.00875 ** daypartMidday -0.1373 0.6520 -0.211 0.83444 daypartMorning -0.2549 0.6520 -0.391 0.69812 daypartNight 0.3333 0.8501 0.392 0.69727 So, as in your dataset, no time of day is doing significantly "better" than Evening. (At this point another comment becomes necessary: By doing the analysis your way, you only compare Midday, Morning and Night AGAINST Evening. If you were interested in seeing whether there is an overall difference, you would have to run an ANOVA (or in the case of Treatment as Covariate an ANCOVA). If you were interested in contrasts of the different times of the day, you could run Tukey.) Back to the dataset. So far no time of day was significantly better than Evening. So now we will include the treatment in our model: summary(glm(score ~ daypart*exposure)) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.6250 -0.6250 0.0000 0.6111 1.7778 Coefficients: (1 not defined because of singularities) Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 1.000e+00 1.066e+00 0.938 0.355 daypartMidday 4.444e-01 1.124e+00 0.395 0.695 daypartMorning 2.222e-01 1.124e+00 0.198 0.844 daypartNight 8.158e-16 9.735e-01 0.000 1.000 exposureExposed 1.000e+00 1.306e+00 0.766 0.449 daypartMidday:exposureExposed -8.194e-01 1.405e+00 -0.583 0.564 daypartMorning:exposureExposed -5.972e-01 1.405e+00 -0.425 0.674 daypartNight:exposureExposed NA NA NA NA 1) As you can see (the same as in your model provided above) you get the warning: "(1 not defined because of singularities)", which means there is singularity in your data. The problem (in my case, I assume for you it will be the same) is quickly found: sum(daypart == "Night" & exposure == "Control") [1] 0 So there are no observations of "Night" and "Control" in the dataset. You will have a similar problem. 2) As you can see in my example, my Intercept contains "Evening" and "Control", so every parameter estimate is interpretable. e.g. Individuals who were both exposed and shopped in the morning will on average display a 0.59 lower score than my Intercept, so Individuals who shop in the Evening and are not exposed (this effect, however, is not significant). In your data provided, it is unclear, what the Intercept is. Obviously it contains "Evening", but what is aggregate of control and exposed ? If it is the mean of the two, then how can both Control and Exposure have a negative effect? Also this seems a bit over complicated for me, it would be much easier and cleaner to just compare control to exposure. So to sum it up: Firstly, I suggest you take a look at how your "gfk_data$Exposure" is defined and I suggest coding it just with 0/1 or C/E. Then you will get cleaner interpretations of your parameters. Secondly, I suggest you rethink whether a glm is actually what you want to use here. (AN(C)OVA, Tukey, ...), since it's p-values will only allow you to interpret significant differences towards the reference time&treatment, and not overall. If you now run your analysis again, I am sure the results will be less confusing.
