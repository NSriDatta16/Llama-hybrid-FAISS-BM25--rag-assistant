Client Side Caching of XML returned from HTTPHandler

I have an HTTPHandler that returns some XML. I am trying to figure out how to get this to cache in the browser, as if it were a static XML file. I've tried this along with a few other variations and other Cache options, but nothing I do seems to make it cache (according to Fiddler). Any ideas on how I can cache the output on the client's browser? public void ProcessRequest(HttpContext context) { context.Response.ContentType = "text/xml"; context.Response.ContentEncoding = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8; context.Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.Private); context.Response.Cache.SetMaxAge(new TimeSpan(1, 0, 0)); string sXml = GetTableAsXml(); context.Response.Write(sXml); }
