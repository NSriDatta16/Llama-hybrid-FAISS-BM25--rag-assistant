A cohort study is an observational study wherein each study participant is observed/measured on the dependent variable at two or more points in time. Any explanatory variable(s) may or may not also be observed/measured at each time of observation/measurement. The observation of the dependent variable across time allows measurement of it's rate of change (over time) in individual participants, and estimation of average rate of change in the target population. The analytic question of interest in a cohort study is does estimated rate of change differ across values of, or rate of change of, an explanatory variable? Some points on nomenclature The dependent variable is typically referred to as the outcome in epidemiology. The explanatory variable is typically referred to as the exposure in epidemiology. A defined cohort means that the participants share some value in the dependent variable, the explanatory variable, or both. For example, an exposure defined cohort might be one where all participants have no exposure when first observed/measured; some of them will become exposed at different levels across the study. An outcome defined cohort might be one where all participants do not have the outcome when first observed/measured. Cohort studies may be defined on both dependent variable and explanatory variable. When the dependent variable takes only two values (0 or 1), and the cohort is defined on the dependent variable by all participants having 0 at the start of the study, the change rate is called an incidence rate . Observational study means that exposure and changes in exposure are not randomly assigned by the researchers in the sense that they are in randomized control trials and other experimental designs.
