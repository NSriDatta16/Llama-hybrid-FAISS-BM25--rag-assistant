Read list of doubles separated by spaces (or some other delimiter) repeatedly and for different purposes

I am very much new into C++ and I ran into the following problem. My goal: I want to have a code which does the following: The user enters a line containing doubles separated somehow The doubles are being parsed into an array of doubles A computation(*) on the array takes place. For example its sum If the user doesn't brake the loop, it reads a new line, and loop back to 1. Once the user broke the first loop (by entering empty line or something like that), a new one starts. The user enters a line containing doubles separated somehow The doubles are being parsed into an array of doubles A computation(**) on the array takes place. For example its average. User brakes the second loop. Program quits. My code: #include int main() { do { double x1, x2, x3, y1, y2, y3; std::cin >> x1 >> y1 >> x2 >> y2 >> x3 >> y3; if (!std::cin){ break; } std::cout > x1 >> y1 >> x2 >> y2 >> x3 >> y3; if (!std::cin){ break; } std::cout The Problem: When I try to stop the first loop, and move to the second by either hitting CTRL-D or giving a letter as input, then the program quits and skips the second loop. I realized that it relates to the cin mechanism, but I failed to cure it. The question: How should I program this? What is the least painful manner to overcome the problem? Thanks in advance!
