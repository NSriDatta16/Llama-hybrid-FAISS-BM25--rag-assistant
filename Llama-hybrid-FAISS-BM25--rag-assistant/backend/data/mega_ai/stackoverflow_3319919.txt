C++ has the combination of efficiency and abstraction that makes it still the only practical choice for large-scale systems that require efficient responses[1]. Hardware interface layers are, as a general rule, in C or C++ as well, meaning a foreign language interface does not have to be set up to talk to the hardware abstraction layers. Further, it has the advantage of a large community experienced in writing games, as well as numerous frameworks. On a personal note, I have used games written in other languages, and they have consistently been slower. [1] Ada or Delphi may also be usable in this area, but their popularity level means it's not as pragmatic to choose them unless you have a niche need.
