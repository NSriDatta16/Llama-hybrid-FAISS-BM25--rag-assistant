I found a solution for this problem as follows. Instead of using @Stateless annotation for the class, I changed the class with the @WebService annotation to a servlet. This workaround eliminated the need for stateless session beans in the war file even though this should be possible for JavaEE6. The context root of the war file when deployed now corresponds to that in the application.xml file.
