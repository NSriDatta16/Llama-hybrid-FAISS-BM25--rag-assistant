As far as I can tell, you're basically right. If we look at the code , we can see that the calibration process directly calls SVC's decision_function method. SVC's decision_function notes: If decision_function_shape=’ovo’ , the function values are proportional to the distance of the samples $X$ to the separating hyperplane. If the exact distances are required, divide the function values by the norm of the weight vector ( coef_ ). See also this question for further details. If decision_function_shape=’ovr’ , the decision function is a monotonic transformation of ovo decision function. Unfortunately, it's for me hard to tell what exactly is returned from libsvm 's decision function method (i.e. $f(x)$ )... but it is almost certainly distance from the hyperplane in the binary case, such that $\text{sign}(f(x))$ gives the prediction .
