How does the loss backpropagate through the convolutional layer in CNN during backpropagation?

This maybe a tough and confusing (the subject itself is confusing) question. I understand how forward pass works in a typical multi-layer CNN (with multiple convolution, pooling, and ReLU). How does the backward pass convolution work in CNN backpropagation? That is, loss is first calculated in the output layer and how does it (the loss) backpropagate through a convolution layer?
