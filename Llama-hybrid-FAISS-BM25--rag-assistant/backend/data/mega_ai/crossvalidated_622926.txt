How can a linear autoencoder with $h=1$ hidden unit reconstruct any rank 1 matrix?

I've had this as a homework problem as a true or false type of question and I'm trying to wrap my head around why this is true. Is the reason simply represent each datapoint as a scaled version of a single vector? Could someone illustrate this for me I've been having a hard time coming up with an example. If I am completely off I would also be super grateful for an intuitive explanation. Many thanks!
