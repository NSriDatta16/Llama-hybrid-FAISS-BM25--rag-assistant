You could perform a two-sample individual t-test which would tell you how significant any differences in the average rating are. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-test Because you are using 3 groups, you need to compare every group with every other group to see if there are differences between any of them. For example, might turn out that group 2 has a statistically lower rating of 2.5 compared to group 3 with a rating 3.2. In terms of sample size, since you are conducting this yourself, I don't imagine it is too big, so this test should suffice to show any differences.
