If you are willing to remove the ID from StockItemPrice, you could better handle this by using a map . Declare your Prices property as follows: IDictionary Prices { get; set; } And map it like this: Pay special attention to the lazy="extra" attribute. It means when you do this: decimal priceInNY = item.Prices[nyOffice]; Only the price for nyOffice (an Office instance or proxy) will be retrieved from the DB.
