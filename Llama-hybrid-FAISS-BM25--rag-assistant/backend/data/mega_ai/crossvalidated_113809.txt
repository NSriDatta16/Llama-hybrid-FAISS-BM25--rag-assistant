Reliability test, Cronbach's alpha or else

I have a set of questions for my research on Importance Menu Design towards Customer Purchasing Decision. After running Cronbach's Alpha for reliability test, it turned out less than 0.5 These are the set of questions in the survey. Psychology Effects I read the menu thoroughly before I make an order I always order the same / familiar item without looking at the menu I always end up order more items than my initial plan after I look at the menu The menu is attractive and persuade me to order The menu is user friendly and interested Layout The menu has clear dish classification I am attracted to big pictures on the top or left upper corner The pictures are appealing and encouraging me to order I always look at pictures before I read the menu descriptions The grid format used in the menu help me to read better Dynamic of Menu Design The menu book is sturdy and has clean appearance The menu is too heavy to hold and make me uncomfortable to make decision The menu size is too big which make it difficult to flip over and take too much space on the table The menu color is encourage me to order The book format is suitable to cover menu range offer by restaurant Menu Information The dish description is too complicated I prefer rounded nominal of price without currency symbol (eg. 10, 20) rather than decimal nominal of price with currency symbol (eg. RM 9.99) I am aware with the price given I ask waiter for more details before I order The font type and size can be read easily All the question is answered on scale 1=totally disagree, 5= totally agree Can someone help me to pin point my mistake? Did I use the wrong reliability test or something wrong with the question I constructed? Thank you. PS: I am a newbie in research
