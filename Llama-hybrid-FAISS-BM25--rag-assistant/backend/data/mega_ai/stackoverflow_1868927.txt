Where did you get these strings? Anything short of a real parser will be fragile. Below is what I would recommed, if I had not seen Alex Martelli's brilliant answer before! You may parse them as JSON arrays, but JSON wants to read double-quoted strings, not single quotes. This introduces fragility to the method, but still much preferable to eval() which is unsafe. import json line1 ="['a.b.c','b.c.a','c.d.e']" json.loads(line1.replace("'", '"')) The result is a parsed list like [u'a.b.c', u'b.c.a', u'c.d.e'] , you may than go on to join the parsed lists.
