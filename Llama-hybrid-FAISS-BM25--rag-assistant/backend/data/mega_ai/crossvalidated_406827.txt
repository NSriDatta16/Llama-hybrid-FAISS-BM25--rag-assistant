You have two classes? Maybe classification is the wrong tool, and you should at least try probability modeling and estimation. One possibility then is logistic regression. See Why isn't Logistic Regression called Logistic Classification? . Then you will get estimated probabilities for each case, and can eventually decide afterwards on probability thresholds for classification. Those thresholds do not need to be constant, they can depend on individual case costs. See also Logistic Regression Model Validation and Using proper scoring rule to determine class membership from logistic regression .
