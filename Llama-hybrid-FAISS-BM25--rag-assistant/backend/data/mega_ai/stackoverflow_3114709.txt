You can use the FILTER function. An example: t = (0:.001:1)'; %#' vector = sin(2*pi*t) + 0.2*randn(size(t)); %# time series wndw = 10; %# sliding window size output1 = filter(ones(wndw,1)/wndw, 1, vector); %# moving average or even use the IMFILTER and FSPECIAL from the Image Package output2 = imfilter(vector, fspecial('average', [wndw 1])); One final option is using indexing (not recommended for very large vector) %# get indices of each sliding window idx = bsxfun(@plus, (1:wndw)', 0:length(vector)-wndw); %'# compute average of each output3 = mean(vector(idx),1); Please note the difference in padding: output1(wndw:end) corresponds to output3
