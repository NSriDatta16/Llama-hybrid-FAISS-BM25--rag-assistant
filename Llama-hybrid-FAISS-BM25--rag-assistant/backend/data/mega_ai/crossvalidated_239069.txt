Is PCA invariant to orthogonal transformations?

Let $A$ a be an $n$ x $p$ matrix and let $B$ be the transformed data set of $A$ under $Q$: $$ B = A Q $$ where Q is a $p$ x $p$ orthogonal matrix: $$ Q Q^T = I $$ $n$ is the number of samples (rows) and $p$ is the number of features (columns). $A$ and $B$ are centred (zero mean for each feature). Now suppose we perform PCA on both $A$ and $B$: $$ \frac{1}{n-1} A^T A = V_A L_A V^T_A $$ $$ \frac{1}{n-1} B^T B = V_B L_B V^T_B $$ The question is, are the projections of $A$ and $B$ on their principal directions equal and why? $$ A V_A = B V_B \ ? $$ That is, are the datasets identical upon "transforming" them with PCA? Later edit: I simplified the question to only refer to orthogonal transformations (rotations). The original question referred to translations as well (the explanation in that case is trivial).
