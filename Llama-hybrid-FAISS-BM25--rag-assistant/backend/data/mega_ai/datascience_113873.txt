Did you make an improvement in your reflection? I am working on a similar subject. The way I see this: We have windows of record (1h or 1day, ...) for one machine coming from many sensors (a time series for each) We cannot rely on the raw data, on this period we can extract features (such as statistical and/or temporal features) using a library such tsfel (in Python) fts = tsfel.time_series_features_extractor(cfg, x[t : d], verbose = 0) where x is the data vector during the window time for 1 sensor and t and d the win size. Then for each time interval (windows) we also a flag event = 0 if everything ok or = 1 if something happen (Note I'm talking about training data - so that suppose a hand labelisation on the data) So we have : TimeInterval (d-t) | ft1 | ft2 .... | event On this base we start working on survival model (+machine learning) That is the way I see thing, let me know what are your advance Also, articles you may consider: Lifetime prediction of sealing Bearing remaining useful life prediction
