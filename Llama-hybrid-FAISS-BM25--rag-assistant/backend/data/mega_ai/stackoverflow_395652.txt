Is there a PHP equivalent to Java URL filters/interceptors?

One of the things I like about Java servlets is the use of unobtrusive filters and interceptors. Basically you could use these things to enforce security, put extra information on the HttpRequest , do monitoring or whatever. Is there some equivalent in PHP? From what I've seen so far it seems that you tend to include a certain file in all your pages that will do things like start the session, enforce security, etc. Not as elegant. Is that the only solution?
