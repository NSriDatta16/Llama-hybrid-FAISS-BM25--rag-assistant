Standard deviation of a casino's profit

For the following question, I've determined the mean to be \$0.20, but how do I determine the standard deviation? A slot machine at a casino pays out an average of \$0.9, with a standard deviation of \$120. It costs a dollar per play. If a person plays 2 times, what are the mean and standard deviation of the casino's profit? I've calculated the variance to be $\$120^2=\$14400$, and then $(\$14400)(2^2)=57600$ (since the person played twice), taking square root: SD=$\sqrt{57600}=\$240$. But in fact, the SD= $\$169.71$. Why? Update: I now realize that each event is independent and that I should add the variances instead of multiply.
