Scalable multinomial regression implementation

I need to do a high dimensional biological data analysis. My data consists of hundreds of thousands of dimensions. I am looking for an implementation of multinomial logistic regression that will scale well to data of this size. Ideally, it should allow me to also do Ridge and Lasso regressions also. Which software should I be using?
