Forecast combination using optimal weights

I am struggling with a case where I am supposed to calculate optimal forecast weights of two forecasts. We have fitted the models on a training set (time series) and want to calculate optimal weights by minimizing the variance of the errors. It almost seems as though we should calculate the weights using the forecast errors, but then we would in theory use previously unseen observations to calculate these weights. Do any of you know if we should use forecast error or training error when calculating optimal weights of forecast combination?
