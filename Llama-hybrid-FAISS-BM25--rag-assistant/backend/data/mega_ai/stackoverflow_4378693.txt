Thanks for updating your question. As an alternative strategy, you could have a master-slave arrangement in which workers ask for a job from a boss process, do the work, and then ask for more work. The boss hands out small fragments of work until no work remains. The advantage of this strategy is that provided the jobs are chosen small enough (e.g. 2x2 pixel squares) all workers will be kept busy until very near the end, and you avoid the need to calculate explicit estimates of region complexity beforehand.
