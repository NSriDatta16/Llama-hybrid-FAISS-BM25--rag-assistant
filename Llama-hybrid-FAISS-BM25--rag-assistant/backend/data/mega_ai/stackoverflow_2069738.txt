Since you'll probably have to do other stuff with the information later on, I would create a custom data storage class with all the required fields, then extract the information from the XML into a collection of those custom classes. To do the display, all you need to do is add the items to the list (or data bind, whichever you prefer), and override ToString on the custom class.
