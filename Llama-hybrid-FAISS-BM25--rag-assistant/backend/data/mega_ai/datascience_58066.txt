How to solve this problem as Machine Learning?

I have a time series data. I have to identify the point in red. I know how to solve this using statistics. But if I had to use Machine Learning to detect these points how can I solve this. How can I modify this data in order to feed it to machine learning model. Data is just one column readings as show in plot. Any idea?
