What do the variables mean in the SVM objective function?

For a linear SVM, the documentation tells me the formula is: $$\frac{1}{2}w^Tw + C\sum_{i=1}^l\xi_i.$$ Please explain to me in layman's terms what $w$ and $Î¾$ represent. Is w the distance to the hyperplane, the weight of different variables, ... ? Also, is there a difference with the formula $$f(x)=w^T x+b$$ or is it just a different notation?
