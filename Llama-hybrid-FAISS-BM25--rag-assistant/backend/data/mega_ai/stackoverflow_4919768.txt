A widget model? That is not so nice. Have you tried looking at PyroCMS ? https://github.com/pyrocms/pyrocms/blob/master/system/pyrocms/modules/widgets/libraries/Widgets.php From the sound of it you may be more interested in our Plugins library (sounds like the same thing with a different name). It is set up with a MY_Parser and runs on top of Dan Horrigan's Simpletags implementation. Either way this has all be done plenty. If you want some more specific tailored advice you might have to demo some of your code.
