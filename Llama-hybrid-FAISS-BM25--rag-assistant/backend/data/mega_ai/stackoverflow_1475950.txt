tail -f in python with no time.sleep

I need to emulate "tail -f" in python, but I don't want to use time.sleep in the reading loop. I want something more elegant like some kind of blocking read, or select.select with timeout, but python 2.6 "select" documentation specifically says: "it cannot be used on regular files to determine whether a file has grown since it was last read." Any other way? In a few days if no solution is given I will read tail's C source code to try to figure it out. I hope they don't use sleep, hehe Thanks. MarioR
