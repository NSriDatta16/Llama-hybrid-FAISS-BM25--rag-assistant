OK, so your data is very expensive to get. If you have some indication of the shape of the data then perhaps a bootstrap / bayesian / optimization (sticking in keywords :)) approach would work best. See the optim command in R as an example. You would need to know some things though. For example, could we assume something like normality? If so then fitting a small number of data points to the normal distribution will likely give you a much better estimate of your parameters than simple mean and sdev values.
