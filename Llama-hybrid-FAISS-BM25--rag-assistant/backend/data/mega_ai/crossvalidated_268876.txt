Averaging model Coefficients in binary logistic regression

I am running a binary logistic regression to estimate the probability for frost occurrences of a frost event given a set of explanatory variables. I intent to carry an accuracy assessment and therefore have divided my data into two proportions. 75% of it for training the model, and 25% for testing it. The thing is, every time I select a random sample of 75% to train the model, I get different estimates of coefficients. I therefore decided to run several iterations and average the coefficients to come up with final coefficient estimates. My question is; Is this kind of averaging acceptable in statistics? and what else might I do? any direction to relevant literature of these is appreciated.
