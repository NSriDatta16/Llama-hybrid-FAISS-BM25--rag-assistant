Magento: After ordering configurable product, its canceled because its out of stock

my problem is: i have a product with simple products as childs. (maybe tshirts whith size S-XL and some colors) Now if i order one of this, it is canceled with the order-confirmation email. I think its a problem with the stock but i dont know. There are 99 items in stock of every kind and all are activated and ready to deliver. Anybody who has had the same problem?
