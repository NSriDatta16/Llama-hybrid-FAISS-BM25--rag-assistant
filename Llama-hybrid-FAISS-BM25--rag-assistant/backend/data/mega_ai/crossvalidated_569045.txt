To summarize: You collected data from a (randomized?) experiment to compare treatment vs control. And you have information about a single covariate, gender. What you have done to analyze the data: You split the participants by gender and compared treatment and control separately for each group. What you could do instead: Model all your data points with a single model that includes main terms for treatment and gender plus a treatment-gender interaction. Regression is a good place to start. The details of what kind of regression is most appropriate depend on the outcome about which you provide no information. A regression model can handle gracefully the complexities you are worried about: It will estimate all parameters of interest at the same time, so you don't have to make corrections for multiple comparisons afterward. It will quantify the evidence that the treatment effect is different in males and females. Once you fit the model (and verify that it fits the data well), you can perform various comparisons of interests. These are also called contrasts. The interpretation of the model coefficients depends on how the categorical variables are encoded in the design matrix. This is a big topic of its own; you can learn more about it here . Instead I show how to estimate contrasts; they are the same no matter the encoding. If that weren't true, the conclusions from an experiment would depend on an arbitrary choice such as the reference level for a categorical variable. I use R but this analysis can be performed with any statistical software. library("contrast") library("tidyverse") set.seed(1234) # Simulate data n lm model parameter contrast #> #> Contrast S.E.
