Normalize age frequency data for PCA

I am working on a project to forecast house ownership rates. One dataset I have consists of number of people of each age from 1-99 per geographic area code. For example, 20 people aged 1, 59 people aged 2, ... 5 people aged 99. The dimensionality of this data seems quite too large to use unprocessed, and so I was thinking of applying PCA to reduce it down. In this scenario, should I be standardising my data in any way, given it is frequency data? For what it's worth, a normal distribution is not a good approximation (far more individuals aged 1 than 99). I'd also appreciate any better ideas if PCA is the wrong approach to this!
