UIImageView is available in iOS 2.0 and later. New image view objects are configured to disregard user events by default. If you want to handle events in a custom subclass of UIImageView , you must explicitly change the value of the userInteractionEnabled property to YES after initializing the object. The question related can be tagged using uiimageview . When a UIImageView object displays one of its images, the actual behavior is based on the properties of the image and the view. If either of the imageâ€™s leftCapWidth or topCapHeight properties are non-zero, then the image is stretched according to the values in those properties. Otherwise, the image is scaled, sized to fit, or positioned in the image view according to the contentMode property of the view. It is recommended (but not required) that you use images that are all the same size. If the images are different sizes, each will be adjusted to fit separately based on that mode. All images associated with a UIImageView object should use the same scale. If your application uses images with different scales, they may render incorrectly.
