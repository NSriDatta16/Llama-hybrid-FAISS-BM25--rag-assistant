SEM is (in my opinion) very far removed from traditional probability theory and some basic statistical techniques that extend easily from it (such as point estimation, large sample theory, and Bayesian statistics). I think SEM is the result of a great deal of abstraction from such methods. I furthermore think that the reason why such abstractions were necessary was because of the overwhelming demand to better understand causal inference . I think a book that would be perfect for someone of your background would be Judea Pearl's Causality . This book specifically addresses SEM as well as multivariate statistics, develops a theory of causality and inference, and is very philosophically sound. It's not a mathematical book, but draws heavily upon logic and counterfactuals, and develops a very precise language for defending statistical models. I can say from a mathematical background that these results are very sound and do not require an extensive understanding of calculus. I also think it's unrealistic for someone of your pedigree to catch up on the necessary mathematics when you're already a graduate student, that's why there are statisticians!
