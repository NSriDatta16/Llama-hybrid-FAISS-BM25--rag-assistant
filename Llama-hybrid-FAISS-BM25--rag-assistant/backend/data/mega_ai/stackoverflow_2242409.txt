How to drag a file from Virtual TreeView to Windows Explorer

I have a TVirtualStringTree, each node represents a file, what I want to do is to allow a user drag a node to the Windows Explorer or Outlook and the target gets a real file. It seems that I need to implement the OnGetUserClipboardFormats and RenderOLEData event handler? But I don't know where to start...Would you help me?
