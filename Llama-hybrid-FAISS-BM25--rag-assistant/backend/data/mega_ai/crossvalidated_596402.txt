"No Classification" for a CNN Neural Network on Audio

It it possible for a Convolutional Neural Network to output "no classification" for a multi-audio classifier? Is it common practice to set % thresholding to the output vector of probabilities? I am building a CNN audio classifier that is able to detect chicken chirps in raw audio data. So far I have trained the model based off of labeled segmented audio of chicken chirps. The model performs well on the validation set of similar segmented audio with a clear classification. My goal is to run this model on extended raw audio data that contains both chicken chirps and nothing/ silence and have it classify the time in which the chirps occur. I have segmented the raw audio data into windows and fed it into the model. The problem though is the output of the CNN model is a vector of classification probabilities. What if there isn't a chirp and its silent? How do I get the model to output "no classifcation" or give no classification at all? Is it possible to set a % threshold on the output vector of probabilities that if above we can confirm a classification or below no classification? Is there a rule of thumb at which this % threshold should be?
