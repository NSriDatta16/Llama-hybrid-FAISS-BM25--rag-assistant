What you need to do is keep retrieving and analyzing the html source for each page in the chain. For each page, you need to figure out what the form submission will look like and send a request that will match that to get the next page in the chain. What I do is build a custom class the wraps System.Net.HttpWebRequest/HttpWebResponse, so retrieving pages is as simple as using System.Net.WebClient. However, my custom class also keeps the same cookie container across requests and makes it a little easier to send post data, customize the user agent, etc.
