A probability that's randomly generated is a perfectly legitimate thing to have in a model. Such a model is an example of a hierarchical model: a model in which some parameters are themselves treated as random variables. Hierarchical models come up most frequently in Bayesian statistics, but they see a lot of use in frequentist statistics, too, especially in the form of so-called random effects, which are regression coefficients that are modeled as random variables. In your example, the marginal probability of picking a white ball at any given time will be the mean of $p_w$. In Bayesian terms, if the specified distribution of $p_w$ is its prior, then the marginal probability of picking a white ball will be the posterior mean of $p_w$.
