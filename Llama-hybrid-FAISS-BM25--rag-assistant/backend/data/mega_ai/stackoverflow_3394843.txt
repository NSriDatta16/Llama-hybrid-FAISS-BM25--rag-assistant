As a basic guideline: If you need the functionality of a database (relations, transactions, search, etc.) then you should use a database. If you just need an object store, then you should just save your objects into Isolated Storage directly (serialising where necessary). I haven't used each of the different DB options available but would probably go with Perst as it's the most established (there's also a good guide here ), winphone7db is also not available yet.
