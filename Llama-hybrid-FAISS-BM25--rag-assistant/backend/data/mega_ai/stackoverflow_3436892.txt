The content keeps playing even after you remove the file from the temp folder because Flash has read the file into memory in order to display it. It's conceptually the same reason as why, if you drag a locally-stored image into a browser, the browser doesn't stop displaying the image if you then delete the file. As for why the file gets stored, it's simply being cached, like any other file your browser displays, so that if you reload the page, you won't (necessarily) have to reload the media file. For video there may be caveats to all this, though - for example, if you seek forward or backwards in a video I couldn't swear to whether the video will be played from memory if the cached version has been removed... and I would imagine that there are situations where Flash doesn't keep the entire movie in memory. But as a general case answer things should be as described here.
