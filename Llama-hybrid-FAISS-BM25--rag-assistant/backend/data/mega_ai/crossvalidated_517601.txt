How do I compare two count data and show that there is true difference between them through Bayesian statistics?

I have two categories : Protein and Carbohydrate denoting two type of food available in a setup. From Protein, 335 food pieces has been eaten from a total of 1095 pieces and from Carbohydrate, 70 food pieces has been eaten from 1095 pieces. The experiment is being done on dogs. At a time, a dog can eat upto 15 pieces of each food category (15+15 = 30 food pieces are provided each time and a dog can eat from both.)I have prior information from a previous experiment for both of them (Protein : 50/1020; Carbohydrate : 23/1020). I would like to compare the two categories of data while including the prior data I have. In frequentist method, I would have done a chi square goodness of fit test by assuming the expected ratio of eating from the two categories as 1:1. All the packages in R that I found such as Bayesian first aid, Bayes factor etc. don't let us use informative priors for the test. so my questions are : Is there a way to include the prior information in the chi square test formula? If yes, how? If no, what sort of test should I be doing? Edit 1 : No. of dogs in previous experiment = 68 ; No. of dogs in current experiment = 360 Edit 2 : The previous experiment was on individual dogs (n=68), the current experiment is on groups of dogs (n=73) of varying sizes with a total of 360 dogs across all groups. Each group is exposed to the experimental set-up once and we count the number of pieces left/eaten after each trial I am not looking to be spoon fed each line of the code. Feel free to point me towards the right resources (blogs/articles/videos etc) Information about me : I have been learning Bayesian stats for a month and a half now. I come from a biology background with minimal math and programming skills so math heavy explanations tend to go over my head but I am willing to learn.
