tion, and autonomic model transfer in computing systems. IBM Watson Around 2009, Tesauro joined the IBM Research team, led by David Ferrucci, that developed IBM Watson, the question-answering system famous for defeating human champions Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter on the quiz show Jeopardy! in 2011. Tesauro focused on Watson's game strategy components, including algorithms for buzzer timing, clue selection, and wagering decisions (especially for Daily Doubles and Final Jeopardy!). He and colleagues developed a Game State Evaluator and used simulation-based optimization, employing techniques from Bayesian inference, game theory, dynamic programming, and reinforcement learning to refine Watson's strategic play. These strategic algorithms contributed significantly to Watson's success, enabling it to manage risk effectively and make near-optimal wagering decisions. During this time, Tesauro also continued research in core AI algorithms, co-authoring a paper on Monte Carlo Simulation Balancing with David Silver (later of DeepMind) at ICML 2009. After Watson, Tesauro continued research at IBM, on areas such as deep reinforcement learning, hierarchical RL, multi-agent systems, and continual learning. Honors and awards Hertz Foundation Fellow (Class of 1980) Fellow of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), elected 2013, "For significant contributions to neural computation, game-playing (Backgammon, Chess and Jeopardy!), autonomic computing, and economic agents." Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), elected 2018, "for contributions to reinforcement learning, neural networks, and intelligent autonomous agents."
