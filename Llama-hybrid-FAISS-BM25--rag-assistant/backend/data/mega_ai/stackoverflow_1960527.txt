I think closures have enormous benefits which should not be overlooked. For example, Apple leverages "blocks"(closures for C) with GCD to provide really easy multithreading - you don't need to setup context structs, and can just reference variables by name since they're in scope. I think a bigger problem with Javascript is that it doesn't have block scope(blocks in this case referring to code in braces, like an if statement). This can lead to enormous complications, forcing programmers to use unnecessary closures to get around this Javascript design limitation.
