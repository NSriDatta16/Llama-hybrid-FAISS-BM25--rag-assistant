Python dictionaries can be constructed using the dict class, given an iterable containing tuples. We can use this in conjunction with the range builtin to produce a collection of tuples as in (every-odd-item, every-even-item), and pass it to dict , such that the values organize themselves into key/value pairs in the final result: dictionary = dict([(List[i], List[i+1]) for i in range(0, len(List), 2)])
