It's often a good idea to do PCA before fitting a neural network, so your instinct could be right there. The only way you are going to determine which model is better for a given problem is to cross-validate both and compare out-of-sample error. The caret package in R is a good way to compare models using this technique (specifically the train function ). As a bonus, it includes a model call pcaNNet which calculates principle components before fitting a neural network.
