Embedding Lua is much easier than embedding Python. Lua was designed from the start to be embedded; Python's embeddability was grafted on after the fact. Lua is about 20x smaller and simpler than Python. You don't say much about your build process, but building and testing can be simplified significantly by using a really powerful version of make. I use Andrew Hume's mk , but you would probably be even better off investing the time to master Glenn Fowler's nmake , which can add dependencies on the fly and eliminate the need for a separate configuration step. I don't ordinarily recommend nmake because it is somewhat complicated, but it is very clear that Fowler and his group have built into nmake solutions for lots of scaling and portability problems. For your particular situation, it may be worth the effort to master it.
