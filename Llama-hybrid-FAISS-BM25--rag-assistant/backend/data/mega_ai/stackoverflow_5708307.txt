Programmatically creating a UIButton inside a custom UIView subclass, how does one access the file owner to add a target method? delegates?

I have a root view controller which loads a custom UIView subclass I have created and adds it as a subview. Inside this custom UIView subclass I code/generate a UIButton in the awakeFromNib method. Is there a simple way to access the File Owner without creating a delegate if the UIButton's action method is inside the root view controller? E.g [myButton addTarget:[self.file_owner ?] action:@selector(methodInFileOwner:) .... Using Interface Builder it's still easy to assign a UIView my custom UIView subclass and just drag a UIButton's selector reference to the file owner. Voila! How is this done through code though? Do I have to create a delegate and use [myButton addTarget:[self.delegate] ... ?
