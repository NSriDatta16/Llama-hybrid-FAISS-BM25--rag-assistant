If you are using the v2 API , you will need an API key from the Maps API Sign Up site. However note that the v2 API has been officially deprecated as of May 19, 2010, and you are encouraged to use the v3 API instead. The v3 API does not require an API key. As for the sensor parameter , no, it will not make the map load faster.
