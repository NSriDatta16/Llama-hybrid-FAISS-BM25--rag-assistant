A single quote is the start and end of a string. A semicolon is the end of a statement. So if they were doing a select like this: Select * From Students Where (Name = ' ') The SQL would become: Select * From Students Where (Name = 'Robert'); DROP TABLE STUDENTS; --') -- ^-------------------------------^ On some systems, the select would get ran first followed by the drop statement! The message is: DONT EMBED VALUES INTO YOUR SQL. Instead use parameters!
