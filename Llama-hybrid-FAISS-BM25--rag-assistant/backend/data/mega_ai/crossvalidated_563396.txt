Measure to indicate overfitting?

I am working on a binary classification suing random forest with 977 observations and 15 columns. (75:25 class portion). Imbalanced dataset.. I got the output like below for train and test datasets Train data Test data While I understand that test data performance is poor. But for train dataset it is too good. q1) How do I know whether it is overfitting on train dataset? Just because it is doing good on train and poorly on test dataset, does it mean it has overfit the train dataset? I wish to build a baseline model using default parameters, so, am not doing hyperparameter tuning. q2) Why is it not normal to have too good performance on train data? q3) If there is any measure to indicate overfitting of the model, that would be helpful. q4) Am using hold out (train-test split) for training and test the model due to my dataset size of 977 records. Is there anything else that I can do to make sure that my model is not overfit? q5) When I run decision tree, I also get similar output shown below. So, confused as to whether it is overfitting or not
