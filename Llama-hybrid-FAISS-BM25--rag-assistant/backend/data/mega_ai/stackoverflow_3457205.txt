Simple uses a TransformCache to map types to Transformer objects. So if filed is of a java.lang.Date' type it will use the org.simpleframework.xml.transform.DateTransform` to transform the Date object to String. I guess you have to implement a custom Transformer for Date or the primitive long and (temporarily) replace the default Transformer for that type in the cache. I didn't find any guide too, the drafted strategy is based on a look on the simple sources .
