I want to estimate the individual contributions to the group scores, considering the characteristics provided. It seems that you’re looking for the posterior probability $\Pr(S=s|\boldsymbol X = \boldsymbol x)$ of having score $s$ given individual feature vector $\boldsymbol x_i = (\mathit{D1}_i, \dots, \mathit{MaritalStatus}_i)$ . It will tell you how each feature value makes a certain score more or less likely. Repetition of Score: … does the fact that Score is repeated within each group raise concerns? Where does the score repeat? Each line of your code gives, for each feature (variable), a vector whose component $i$ is the value for the $i$ -th individual. It happens that each individual of the same group has the same score. Unless you have wrong data, it is what it is. However, of course, the team ID shouldn’t be taken in a predictive analysis as we could directly determine the score from it. Also, look at D2, are you concerned by the fact that value 0 repeats? Modeling Constrained Score: Since the Score variable is constrained between 0 and 1 and follows a normal distribution Do you assume a truncated normal distribution with $\mu \in (0, 1)$ and $\sigma$ small enough so that $f_S(0) = f_S(1) \approx 0$ ? how can I appropriately model this variable, taking this into account? IMHO, you can perform a Bayesian analysis. For instance, you could: Estimate, based on the data, any regression model that gives you a decision function $\hat f \colon \boldsymbol X \mapsto S$ that minimizes any appropriate loss/risk function (MSE, etc.). Since scores go from 0 to 1, you could use a logistic regression. Identify a reasonable normal prior of $X$ (using the data if needed). Apply the decision function to the prior to get the posterior distribution of $S$ given each feature of $\boldsymbol X = (X_1, \dots, X_j, \dots, X_n)$ . Or, given $\hat f$ , you could just comment on the coefficients of your regression model.
