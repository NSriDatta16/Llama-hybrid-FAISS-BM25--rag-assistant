Best canvas for drawing in wxPython?

I have to draw a graph of elements composing a topological model of a physical network. There would be nodes and arches, and the latter could be unidirectional or bidirectional. I would like to capture the clicking events for the nodes and the arches (to select the element and show its properties somewhere), and the dragging events for the nodes (to move them around) and arches (to connect or disconnect elements). I've done some research and I've narrowed the alternatives down to OGL (Object Graphics Library) and FloatCanvas . I would not like to go down to the DrawingContext, but it is not discarded if necessary. Which canvas option would you choose?
