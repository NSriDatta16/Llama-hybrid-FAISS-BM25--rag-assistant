Theoretically , it should. There is even documentation for it on MSDN . Basically, you need to set up a "generic test project" which wraps the NUnit test. In practice, I've been trying to get it to work for almost three hours now and it still doesn't. The assembly is instrumented, but there are no coverage results. I always get this message: "Empty results generated: none of the instrumented binary was used. Look at test run details for any instrumentation problems.", but no problems are reported in that file. Also, a VSPerf error in the event log pops up. I submitted this as a bug to Microsoft . However, this might be related to my machine. Since I submitted that bug just now, I don't know yet whether others can reproduce the issue or not.
