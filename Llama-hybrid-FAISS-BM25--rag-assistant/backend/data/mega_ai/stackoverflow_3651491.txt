What's the significance of TLD-first domain-like identifiers?

"TLD-first domain-like identifiers" is a mouthful but that's all I can come up with. I've seen these used in various places over the years and wondered what the history/reason behind this convention is, since you might be forgiven in thinking that there is one true way to mention a domain. I don't use Java but I recall from poking around that namespaces are often done like this: uk.co.tophats.stitchkit A specification file for a "Launch Agent" on Mac OS X: ws.agile.1PasswordAgent.plist A preferences file on Mac OS X: com.apple.iTunesHelper.plist Why is the TLD first? Is it just hierarchical pedantry like UK vs. US date formats?
