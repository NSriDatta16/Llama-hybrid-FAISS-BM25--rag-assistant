Fixed effects in logistic regression

I understand that using fixed effects in the context of a logistic regression estimated using a panel of firms can be problematic. For example, if we have a panel of firms across multiple years, firm fixed effects are not estimated consistently because the number of observations per firm in not converging to infinity (incidental parameters problem). Is it problematic to use year-fixed effects?
