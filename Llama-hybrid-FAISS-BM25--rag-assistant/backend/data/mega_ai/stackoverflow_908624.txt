jquery UI dialog open is mind-numbingly slow in IE7

Have a large amount of HTML, but where I thought the bottleneck would be is incorrect: it's when I'm opening the dialog, not when I'm building the string of HTML (~35ms), nor when I'm appending it to the dialog container div (~50ms). When calling dialog("open") below In FF, I'm consistently getting 1800+ ms, IE7 is around 17000(!) ms. I can live with 1800ms, but in IE7 (99% of my user base), that's way too long. // prep dialog $("#print-box").dialog({ bgiframe: false, width:900, height: 1000, modal: true, autoOpen: false, draggable: false }); // display selected items in print preview modal $("#print-preview").click( function() { $('#print-box').empty(); var tmp = [' ']; var rows = $('[name="print-this-listing"]:checked').parents("div.listing").clone(); for (var i=0; i '); $('#print-box').html(tmp.join('')); $('#print-box').dialog('open'); }); Any ideas? I'm trying to build a print preview page and would rather not take another round trip to the server to fetch all that data again, but it's much much quicker than client-side right now.
