Evicting objects is elegant and it is the only good solution when doing reports, exports to CSV etc. The best elegant way is to implement it inside a service, which will open iterator, evict each item after process. The class would be provided for service call, that would be item consumer. public interface ItemConsumer { void consume(Item item); } public void processAllItems(ItemConsumer consumer) { .. do your job }
