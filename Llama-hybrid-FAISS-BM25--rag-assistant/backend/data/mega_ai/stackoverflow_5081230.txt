In some of my apps, I have added a column onto content types called status , which can be either "posted", "draft", or "removed". This way, users can make drafts or remove posted items without messing up the index views. As far as elegance, it might not be the best, but I just create a new_draft method on the content types, which creates a new object with status set to "draft". Then, when the user posts their draft, I call a post method which sets status to "posted". Once posted, if a user removes their item, I call a remove method which (you guessed it!) sets status to "removed".
