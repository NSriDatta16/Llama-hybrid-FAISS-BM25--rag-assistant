Usually if a window accepts files for drag'n'drop - it just accepts them anywhere in the window. If you have a list of files (listbox/view) or an just an text box that accepts a single file, those individual control windows could be the drop target rather than the entire window. Normally there is no visual indication that a window accepts file drops. The only indication would be that you try it and you don't get the no-drop cursor when you drag across the window. (Note: this is under MS Windows, other os window systems may have different standards)
