Buy an IDE that has good refactoring support. I think IntelliJ is the best, but Eclipse has it now, too. The unit test idea is key as well. You will want to have a suite of large, overall transactions that will give you the overall behavior of the code. Once you have those, start creating unit tests for classes and smaller packages. Write the tests to demonstrate proper behavior, make your changes, and re-run the tests to demonstrate that you haven't broken everything. Track code coverage as you go. You'll want to work it up to 70% or better. For the classes you change, you'll want those to be 70% or better before you make your changes. Build up that safety net over time and you'll be able to refactor with some confidence.
