My take is that localstorage is a proper rewrite of the way cookies should have been done in the first place. It has a very simple api and low barrier to adoption. Web SQL is pretty heavy duty and would be a serious pain for saving just a simple value so they have very different use cases. localstorage is actually implemented in WebKit using SQLite but just not exposed via WebSQL. Session storage cannot be implemented easily inside the database as it is effectively in global scope and you don't want the data visible to other tabs. Because it is transient data you wouldn't typically want to store lots anyway so wouldn't need transaction and querying.
