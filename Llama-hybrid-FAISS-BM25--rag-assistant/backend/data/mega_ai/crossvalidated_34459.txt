Bayesian models and exchangeability

I did not see that explicitly mentioned, even though I think it is correct. Isn't the exchangeability assumption the most common assumption about examples in the Bayesian setting? I am thinking of a model of the form $p(x_1,\ldots,x_n,\theta) = p(\theta) \prod_{i=1}^n p(x_i \mid \theta)$, where $p(\theta)$ is a prior. By deFinetti's theorem, I think this means that the $x_i$ exchangeable. Having a prior this way is very common in the Bayesian setting. Hence my conclusion. Is there anything wrong with my reasoning?
