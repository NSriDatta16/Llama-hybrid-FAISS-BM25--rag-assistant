Estimating a restricted (sparse) VAR in R

Assume that I want to estimate a VAR or SVAR model for some monthly economical time series without a long history (i.e. in the range of 2000-2016, which consists of only ~180 data per variable). However, because of deep underlying covariances between the data a low order VAR(p) is not suitable, I want to estimate i.e. VAR(24) model. Assuming I'm doing this only for 2-3 variables, I'm still estimating too many (insignificant) parameters for the data I've got. My question is: what R packages allows restricting some VAR coefficients to 0 and estimating only the remaining ones using R? So far I've found vars and MTS packages, both of which allows to specify a (i.e.) VAR(24) model and by using restrict() or refVAR() accordingly, to iteratively reestimate the models by restricting some coefficients to 0 by their t-statistics (by setting, for example, thres = 1.96 in the refVAR ). The problem I've noticed here is that all of the (re)estimations are done by OLS (correct me if I'm wrong here), though, as far as I remember from LÃ¼tkepohl "New Introduction to Multiple Time Series Analysis", a restricted VAR should be estimated by FGLS instead of OLS. However, I haven't yet found any package in R that allows estimating a VAR in FGLS (and which allows a restriction by some criteria). Is there any which I've missed? Additionally, I've found a paper that discusses sparse VAR's and LASSO-VAR's, but, again, I was unable to find any R packages for these or similar methods. Any help would be appreciated!
