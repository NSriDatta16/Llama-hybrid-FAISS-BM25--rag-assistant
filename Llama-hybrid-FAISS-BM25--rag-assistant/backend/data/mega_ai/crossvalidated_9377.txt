Origin of strange formula for equilibrium standard deviation

In the paper M. Avellaneda and J. H. Lee, Statistical arbitrage in the U.S. equities market , July 2008, in the Appendix on page 46, how does he get equilibrium standard deviation as following: $$\sigma_{eq} = \sqrt{\frac{\text{Variance}(\zeta)}{1 âˆ’ b^2}}$$ If anyone knows the paper, please explain. Much appreciated,
