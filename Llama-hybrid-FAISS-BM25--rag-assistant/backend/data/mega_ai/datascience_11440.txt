Multi Model data set Visualization Python

I have a data-set with two variable frequency values as given below col[0],col[1],col[2],col[3] val1, 23, 34, key1 val1, 23, 56, key2 val1, 23, 54, kay3 val2, 34, 76, kay1 val2, 34, 87, key4 val3, 90, 23, key2 Real Datasets Reduction_Paris 957 228 #promos Reduction_Paris 957 214 #promos Reduction_Paris 957 181 #paris Reduction_Paris 957 175 #promos CNNsWorld 361 156 #breakingnews CNNsWorld 361 156 #gamedev CNNsWorld 361 156 #paris CNNsWorld 361 156 #parisattack FollowParisNews 705 131 #france FollowParisNews 705 131 #news FollowParisNews 705 131 #paris Reduction_Paris 957 128 #promos Reduction_Paris 957 128 #paris FollowParisNews 705 128 #france FollowParisNews 705 128 #news FollowParisNews 705 128 #paris FollowParisNews 705 125 #france FollowParisNews 705 125 #news FollowParisNews 705 125 #paris Reduction_Paris 957 123 #paris FollowParisNews 705 119 #france The data set has more than 1000s of rows val is a string variable and key is also string. where as the col[1] and col[2] are the frequencies respectively of val and key . The val and key are connected to each other several values are connected to several keys. I am trying to plot two kinds of graphs. A graph to show pair inverse cumulative distribution function (ccdf). col[1] and col[2] are to be considered in this case. When it is only one value we can very well plot ccdf as individual but as a pair I have no idea how to get the distribution plots. A connected graph to show the connection relationship between the val col[0] and key col[3] . I tried using Cytoscape and chose key as node and val as edge but I do not get the graph that I am looking for. Any solution on how I can show the relationship between the two ? May be something like this kind of solution I am looking for, Cluster of Keywords col[3] and the col[0] connected to them.Either of the one type of graph. I am comfortable with python so any suggestion in that area will be helpful. Thank you.
