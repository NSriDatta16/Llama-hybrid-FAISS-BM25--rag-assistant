Hotlinking Twitter avatar images?

The Twitter API returns this value for the Twitter account 'image_url': http://a1.twimg.com/profile_images/75075164/twitter_bird_profile_bigger.png In my Twitter client webapp, I am considering hotlinking the HTTPS version of avatars which is hosted on Amazon S3 : https://s3.amazonaws.com/twitter_production/profile_images/75075164/twitter_bird_profile_bigger.png Any best practices which would discourage me from doing this ? Do 3rd party Twitter client applications typically host their own copies of avatars ? EDIT : To clarify, I need to use HTTPS for images because my webapp will use a HTTPS connection and I don't want my users to get security warnings from their browser about the page containing some content which is not authenticated. For example, Firefox is known to complain about mixed http/https content. My problem is to figure out whether or not hotlinking the https URLs is forbidden by Twitter, since these URLs are not "public" from their API. I got them by analyzing their web client HTML source when connected to my Twitter account in HTTPS.
