Premature optimization is the root of all evil. Is there justification for this, do you actually have a bandwidth problem? In my experience, tracking changes can be lots of work (ie lots of code to maintain) depending on how it is implemented. There are some elegant ways but I think what you are doing is fine unless there is some evidence to support a change. If you were planning to implement some custom form of change tracking I would certainly not 'chat' with the database about it. Make a copy of your object locally when you first pull it from the DB and compare against that.
