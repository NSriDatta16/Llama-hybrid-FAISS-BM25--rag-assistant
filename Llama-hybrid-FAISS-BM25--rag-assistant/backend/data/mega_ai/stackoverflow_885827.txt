I'm pretty sure that name does not come from the certificate. As far as I understand Tibco, you should have a daemon process rvd or rvrd (or some sort of an agent process) somewhere - either on the server, or on both client and the server. Look for configuration files for these. The chances are that the name comes from one of these files.
