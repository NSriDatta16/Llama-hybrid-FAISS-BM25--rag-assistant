In IE8, jquery-ui's dialog set the height of its contents to zero. How can I fix this?

I am using jquery UI's dialog widget to render a modal dialog in my web application. I do this by passing the ID of the desired DOM element into the following function: var setupDialog = function (eltId) { $("#" + eltId).dialog({ autoOpen: false, width: 610, minWidth: 610, height: 450, minHeight: 200, modal: true, resizable: false, draggable: false, }); }; Everything works just fine in Firefox, Safari, and Chrome. However, in IE 8 when the dialog is opened only the div.ui-dialog-titlebar is visible -- the div.ui-dialog-contents are not. The problem seems to be that while in the modern browsers, the div.ui-dialog-contents has a specific height set in its style, i.e. after opening the dialog, the resulting HTML is: ... while in IE8 the height style attribute is set to zero, and the resulting HTML is: ... What do I need to do to get the height (and min-height ) style attributes set correctly?
