Here are two WORKAROUNDS to the problem of triggering downloads from the client only. In later browsers you should look at "blob" 1. Drag and drop the table Did you know you can simply DRAG your table into excel? Here is how to select the table to either cut and past or drag Select a complete table with Javascript (to be copied to clipboard) 2. create a popup page from your div Although it will not produce a save dialog , if the resulting popup is saved with extension .csv , it will be treated correctly by Excel. The string could be w.document.write("row1.1\trow1.2\trow1.3\nrow2.1\trow2.2\trow2.3"); e.g. tab-delimited with a linefeed for the lines. There are plugins that will create the string for you - such as http://plugins.jquery.com/project/table2csv var w = window.open('','csvWindow'); // popup, may be blocked though // the following line does not actually do anything interesting with the // parameter given in current browsers, but really should have. // Maybe in some browser it will. It does not hurt anyway to give the mime type w.document.open("text/csv"); w.document.write(csvstring); // the csv string from for example a jquery plugin w.document.close(); DISCLAIMER : These are workarounds, and does not fully answer the question which currently has the answer for most browser: not possible on the client only
