I modified your example to use a multimedia timer that has a precision down to 1 ms, and most of the jerkiness went away. However, there is still some little tearing left, depending on where exactly you drag the window vertically. If you want a complete and perfect solution, GDI/GDI+ is probably not your way, because (AFAIK) it gives you no control over vertical sync.
