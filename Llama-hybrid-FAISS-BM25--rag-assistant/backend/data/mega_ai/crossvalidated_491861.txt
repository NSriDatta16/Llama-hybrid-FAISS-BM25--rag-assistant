Penalized or standard logistic regression?

I am trying to conduct multiple logistic regression. My independent variable has 22 events (yes) and 310(N0) (total sample 332). I am trying to include 20 independent variables (to minimize confounding variables).In this context, do I need to use penalized or standard regression method? Any suggestion and references, please. Thank you.
