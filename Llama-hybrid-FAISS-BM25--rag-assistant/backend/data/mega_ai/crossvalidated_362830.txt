For multiclass classification purpose I have to use a imbalanced dataset

I am facing a problem. It's a multiclass classification problem I have 5 categories A has 107 instances B has 101 instances C has 882 instances, D has 229 instances and E has 129 instances. I used Knn, random forest and svm I got maximum accuracy score 62% . So, my question is Am I getting low accuracy score because of imbalanced data(since C has 882 instances which are far more than other categories)? or there is something else? NB: I looked the y_pred vector which has the predicted value and I noticed that all the values are 2(I encoded C as 2)why is that?
