The "public" vs. "package" specifier has to do with whether classes in other packages are allowed to "see" the class. Most hello world programs ignore packages, so they go with the more common public option. Most people never have to learn about other package specifiers (and their limitations) until they actually learn to organize their project into packages. Of course, if you have only one class, it doesn't matter either. Also, I'm not sure why you mock novice programmers. I've been coding in Java for 10 years and still learn new things all the time.
