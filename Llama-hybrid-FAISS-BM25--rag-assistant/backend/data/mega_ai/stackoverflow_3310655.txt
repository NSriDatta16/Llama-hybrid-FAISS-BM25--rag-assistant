How do you plan to actually transfer data from Mac to iPhone? Is this something you do during development, or something people do during daily use? If the latter, you are probably better off building decoupled export/import into your app right away. So the Mac would serialize data into XML or JSON, push it somewhere in the cloud (not sure if local network/bonjour transfer is easier or useful, cloud is more universal), and iPhone fetches the data and deserializes it into the local schema/repository. You should not plan to work on the SQL layer with Core Data. Different platforms may use a different storage backend.
