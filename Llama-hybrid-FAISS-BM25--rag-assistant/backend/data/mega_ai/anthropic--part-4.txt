copies of the authors' work, including from participants Kirk Wallace Johnson, Andrea Bartz, and Charles Graeber. On June 23, 2025, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California granted summary judgment for Anthropic that the use of digital copies of the plaintiffs' works (inter alia) for the purpose of training Anthropic's LLMs was a fair use. But it found that Anthropic had used millions of pirated library copies and that such use of pirated copies could not be a fair use. Therefore the case was ordered to go to trial on the pirated copies used to create Anthropic's central library and the resulting damages. In September 2025, Anthropic agreed to pay authors $1.5 billion to settle the case, amounting to $3,000 per book plus interest. The proposed settlement, pending judge approval, stands as the largest copyright resolution in U.S. history. In June 2025, Reddit sued Anthropic, alleging that Anthropic is scraping data from the website in violation of Reddit's user agreement.
