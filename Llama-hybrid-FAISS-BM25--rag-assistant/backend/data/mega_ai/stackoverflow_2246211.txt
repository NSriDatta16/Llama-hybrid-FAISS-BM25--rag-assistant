Regarding the NexusOne crash. As Corey Trager mentioned in his comment, the missing permission is not the issue when looking into the ApiDemos package that comes with the 2.1 SDK. One solution I've found to this issue is simply changing the requested preview size in CameraPreview public void surfaceChanged(SurfaceHolder holder, int format, int w, int h){..} replace this line: parameters.setPreviewSize(w,h); with parameters.setPreviewSize(352,288); This resolution is the legal resolution that the G1 DevPhone works with.
