You mean static websites (HTML only) versus dynamic websites (PHP, ASP, JSP, ...)? There is only one relevant difference between static and dynamic pages for SEO, and that are URLs. Static pages work "naturally", that is, the organization of the URLs in folders follows the organization of your website, there is only one URL for each page, etc... If you use a dynamic website, it depends on how do you structure it. If you have a separate server page for each page then it's the same. If you use a front controller pattern, then you should attempt at using URL rewriting, so that your URLs follow the logical structure of your site. For the rest, there is no difference, as both static and dynamic pages just produce HTML, which is the content consumed by users and search engine, regardless of the technology employed.
