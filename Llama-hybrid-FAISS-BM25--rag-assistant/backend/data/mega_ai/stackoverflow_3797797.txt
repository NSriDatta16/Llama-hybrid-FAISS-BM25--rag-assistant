Java Enums - Number add() and classification method

I am creating an api for a phonebook which has 3 different types of phone-numbers:FAX, HOME, WORK, CELL I want to add a number to a specific type but do not want to classify FAX,HOME,WORK etc. as primitive types as I am considering that I could change it at a later date. I was trying to use enums but am not clear how I can use it efficiently in this case. The code I worked up till now for this part: private enum NumberType{ FAX, WORK, HOME, CELL} class PhoneNumber{ PhoneNumber(int Number, NumberType type){ this.number = Number; this.type = type; } .. getter and setter for above .. } But I still do not get how I could assign a specific phoneNumber to a specific NumberType. I am still confused. I want to make it easy for someone to use this feature. Please help. Thank you.
