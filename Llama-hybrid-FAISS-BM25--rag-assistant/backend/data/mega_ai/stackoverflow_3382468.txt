This is an instance of java.util.zip.ZipException . There are a number of things which might cause it. One cause is the executed path being too long, for instance if you extracted the zip to a sub-directory (instead of, say, the root). But there are a number of other things which might cause it, e.g. file corruption. So if the directory path length is not the problem you will need to give us more details. For instance, what OS are you installing on? Also, is there any more info regarding the error in the log file: $ORACLE_HOME/assistants/opca/install.log ?
