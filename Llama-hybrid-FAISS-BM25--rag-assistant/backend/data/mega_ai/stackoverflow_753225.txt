pdf paragraph or blocks of text positions

I want to retrieve the rectangles that make up paragraphs and/or blocks of text in a PDF page. I have looked at iTextSharp and DataLogics. The best I have been able to do is find an individual words. However, I need to know if the words are in the same block of text. I am using C#. Does anybody have any ideas?
