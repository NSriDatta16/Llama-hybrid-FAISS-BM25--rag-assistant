What kinds of learning problems are suitable for Support Vector Machines?

What are the hallmarks or properties that indicate that a certain learning problem can be tackled using support vector machines? In other words, what is it that, when you see a learning problem, makes you go "oh I should definitely use SVMs for this" rather than neural networks or decision trees or anything else?
