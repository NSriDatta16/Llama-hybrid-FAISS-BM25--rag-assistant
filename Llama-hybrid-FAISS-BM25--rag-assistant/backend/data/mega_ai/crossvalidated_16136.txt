Charlie's answer is good, and it's where I'd start. If you don't want to use ACF graphs, you could create k-1 dummy variables for the k time periods present. Then you can see if the dummy variables are significant in a regression with the dummy variables (and likely a trend term). If your data is quarterly: dummy Q2 is 1 if this is the second quarter, else 0 dummy Q3 is 1 if this is the third quarter, else 0 dummy Q4 is 1 if this is the fourth quarter, else 0 Note quarter 1 is the base case (all 3 dummies zero) You might want to also check out "time series decomposition" in Minitab -- often called "classical decomposition". In the end, you may want to use something more modern, but this is a simple place to start.
