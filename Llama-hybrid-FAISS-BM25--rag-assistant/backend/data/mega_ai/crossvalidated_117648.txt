Quating Buddha: Don't believe anything you see, read, or hear from others, whether of authority, religious teachers or texts [..] Find out for yourself what is truth, what is real. Essentially, any journal or other source may contain crappy papers. This is because there's no really good way to stop low-evidence or simply false articles being published. Best thing you can do is to try to reproduce result described in the paper and make conclusions. Try to find the truth yourself. There are, however, some signs indicating that sources are more likely to provide high-quality papers, and most important of them is peer reviewing . E.g. arXiv is simply a collection of preprints that is not actually reviewed by anyone. Essentially, any person with any qualification can upload their work to arXiv, which leads to an average quality of papers being pretty low. Peer-reviewed journals are normally considered more respectable. But still, for any important paper you rely on, it's definitely worth to try to reproduce the result. (And, by the way, make sure results of your own study are reproducible as well.)
