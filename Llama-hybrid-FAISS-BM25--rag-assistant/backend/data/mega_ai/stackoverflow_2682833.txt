My two pence of advice - if you need to persuade anyone in management or business for use of something new or different, you need to tell them that it result in increased income (due to the benefits like productivity gains or hours of business manual effort saved etc). But certainly, in today's environment its really sad to hear that the working population or devs in your organisation are not enthusiastic to try and use new tools/tech. You should also try putting your case with your head of technology - I am sure they will take it seriously.
