This question is a fairly difficult one. There is no real software limitation on the number of active connections a machine can have, though some OS's are more limited than others. The problem becomes one of resources. For example, let's say a single machine wants to support 64,000 simultaneous connections. If the server uses 1MB of RAM per connection, it would need 64GB of RAM. If each client needs to read a file, the disk or storage array access load becomes much larger than those devices can handle. If a server needs to fork one process per connection then the OS will spend the majority of its time context switching or starving processes for CPU time. The C10K problem page has a very good discussion of this issue.
