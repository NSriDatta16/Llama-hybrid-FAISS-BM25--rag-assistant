SourceSafe is an antiquated technology built upon Windows shares. The storage mechanism (non-transactional "flat files") is a recipe for poor performance and bugs. Its adoption has nothing to do with what it has over other SCM's, and everything to do with the fact that it was "already there". I can't comment on Perforce, but I can say that VSS compared to, say, Team Foundation Server is a very weak offering and should be used only in circumstances where there is already a large investment in it and NO money can be spent.
