Magento Layered Navigation Categories

I would like the user to be sent to the category landing page when the user clicks the category in layered navigation. So instead of the user getting /category.html?cat=11 , they would get /category/RedWidget.html?cat=11 when they click the RedWidget category. I found this link , but his code doesn't work. Thanks ahead of time!
