.NET is not for cross platform. It is very painful to code and make it work effectively for MONO and .NET. The reason why individuals go with .NET more than TCL/Tk or Qt or Java Swing is because of Rapid Application Development. RAD is virtually impossible with any of the other frameworks that exist. RAD is possible on simple cases, but when was the last time you wrote a business based application that had simple use cases. GUI toolkits in general are difficult to work with because you need to understand the basics. The basics being data binding, clipping, refreshing, layout managers and event handling. All of these concepts are difficult for average developers. The reason being is that most of it is being abstracted away with more of the modern toolkits out there. For instance, with Java Swing I do not need to know anything about clipping or refreshing since they do it "magically" for me. What happens in the case of when something does not refresh magically, that situation then presents a virtually impossible solution. The code then becomes exponentially more complex. .NET is typically used by many UI developers because extending it is very simple. Creating an extension method to extend a control is very easy. Creating a method to bind data is even becomming more simple with .NET entity framework. There is a cost to use this RAD tool though, and that is that it is not platform independent.
