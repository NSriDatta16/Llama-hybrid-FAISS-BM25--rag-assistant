VS Express comes in different flavors , each targeting different roles and purposes. I think you may find ASP.NET development with VS Express somewhat fragmented (some features are only available in the WebDevelop edition, while other only in the C# edition) - but it certainly is possible. If you are looking for a free IDE for .NET to do ASP development, you may also be interested in looking into Mono Develop - it can target all versions of the .NET framework at this point (not just the Mono ones) and it's quite stable. I've used that successfully for development on several projects - and while it's not as feature rich as VS, it is quite good.
