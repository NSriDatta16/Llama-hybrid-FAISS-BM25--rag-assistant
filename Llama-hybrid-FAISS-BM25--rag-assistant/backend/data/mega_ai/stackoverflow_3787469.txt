It is easier to see where the comment begins and ends. One need only scan down the left column until the asterisks 'run out' to find the next bit of code. Where the first method breaks down is when it comes time to rewrite the comments. Now it requires reformatting the lines to make the asterisks line up. That is a no-no unless you have a tool to do that for you automatically. In McConnell's "Code Complete" (second ed), p 790, he says: For longer comments, the task of creating long columns of double slashes, manually breaking lines of text between rows, and similar activities is not very rewarding, and so the /* ... */ syntax is more appropriate for multiline comments. The point is that you should pay attention to how you spend your time. If you spend a lot of time entering and deleting [text] to make [the asterisks] line up, you're not programming; you're wasting time. Find a more efficient style.
