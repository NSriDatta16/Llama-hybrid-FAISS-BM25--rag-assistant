if __name__ == '__main__': import __main__ as main else: main = __import__(os.path.basename(os.path.splitext(__file__))) This is quite a fragile approach, since it relies on relative import behavior for all modules from within a package. There is a much better solution -- faster, more concise, and more reliable: import sys main = sys.modules[__name__] The weird choice of main for the name remains (I normally use something like thismodule when I use this approach) but the approach taken to bind that name is now sound.
