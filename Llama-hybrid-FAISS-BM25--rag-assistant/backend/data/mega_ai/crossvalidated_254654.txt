When $\nu_\theta$ is the true cdf, this method is called minimum distance estimation and there are consistency results in the literature. Since you can approximate $\nu_\theta$ with an arbitrary precision by simulating enough points, the above results extend to this case. One famous paper in this literature is Berkson's 1980 "Minimum Chi-Square, not Maximum Likelihood!" , but I do not find the arguments there completely compelling towards giving up maximum likelihood estimation. Maximum likelihood is most often enjoying asymptotic efficiency, which other methods may fail to meet. Note that, when considering a Bayesian approach to the problem, this method pertains to approximate Bayesian inference ( ABC ).
