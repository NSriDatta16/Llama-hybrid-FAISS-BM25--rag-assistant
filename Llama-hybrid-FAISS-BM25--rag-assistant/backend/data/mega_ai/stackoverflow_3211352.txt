Here's another repro: let inline f (x:^T) = box x type test4 = | A of 'a with member t.M() = match t with | A a -> f a string is an inline function that uses static type constraints, and the error diagnostics for such functions are sometimes poor. I don't really understand the diagnostic message itself, but the point is, at the call site, we don't know the generic type 'a , which means we can't inline the right version of the call to string (or f in my repro). In e.g. the case where you upcast to obj , we know that we want to inline the obj version of string , so that is ok.
