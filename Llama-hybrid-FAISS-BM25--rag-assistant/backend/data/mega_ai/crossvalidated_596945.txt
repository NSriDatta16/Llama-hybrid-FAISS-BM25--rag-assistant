Zero inflated models are using a distribution (like Poisson or something else) that is mixed with a point mass at zero. Logistic regression relates to binary data which is modelled with a Bernoulli distribution. When you mix a Bernoulli distribution with a point mass at zero then you get another Bernoulli distribution. So zero inflation does not make much sense. An exception could be when your response is a Binomial distribution that is modelled with a logistic function for a parameter $p$ . E.g. instead of whether a patient has a disease or not, the response could be something like during how many years $x$ out of $n$ a patient has had some rare symptom.
