So, you wanna become a new Google, heh? :-) Many sites are "SEO friendly" these days. This enables you to go for the headings and then look for paragraphs bellow. Also, look for lists. There is a lot of content in some sort of tab-like (tabs, accordions...) interfaces that is done using ordered or unordered lists. If that fails, maybe look for a div with class "content" or "main" or a combination and start from there. If you use different approaches, make sure you keep statistics of what worked and what didn't (maybe even save a full page), so you can review and tweak your parsing and searching methods. As a side note, I've used htmlagilitypack to parse and search through html with success. Well, at leasts it beats parsing with regex :-)
