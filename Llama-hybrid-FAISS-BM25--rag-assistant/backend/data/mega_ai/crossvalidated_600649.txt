Together with the features, the series will be a multi-variate time series. Think of it like having different measurements of different things at the same time point (e.g. temperature, humidity, wind speed at time $t$ and bundling them as a vector signal). So, if we call a vector signal at time point $t$ as $\mathbf x_t$ , value of this vector at each time point will be your sample point. And, each of the values inside the vector are called features. So, it is (150, 5) if you have 5 different entities you measure at each of the time instants.
