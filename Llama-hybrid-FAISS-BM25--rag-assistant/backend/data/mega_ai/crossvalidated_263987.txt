Note that, there are two components and each of them individually could be either in working or failure state. Then the states of the Markov chain be designated as $ff$ both components failed, $wf$ one component working and one component failed, and $ww$ both components working. Given that, the components function independently of each other. If the chain is in state $ff$ at time $n$, at the next time point it could be in the state $ff$ with probability $(1-r)(1-r)=(1-r)^2$, as the probability of not being repaired by next time point is $(1-r)$; $wf$ with probability $2r(1-r)$, as it may be the first component that was repaired or the the second component that was repaired, so that only one of the two components will be working; $ww$ with probability $r^2$, if both the components got repaired. If the chain is in the state $wf$ at time $n$, then at the next time point it could be in the state $ff$ with probability $p(1-r)$, as the working component failed and the component requiring repair was not yet repaired; $wf$ with probability $pr+(1-p)(1-r)$, as the working component was not failed and the component requiring repair is not repaired, so that only one component is working, which has a probability $(1-p)(1-r)$; or the component working at the previous time has failed and the component requiring repair has got repaired, which has a probability $pr$; mutually exclusiveness of the events results in the required probability; $ww$ with probability $r(1-p)$, as the working component does not require repair and the failed component got repaired. If the chain is in the state $ww$ at time $n$, then at the next time point it could be in the state $ff$ with probability $p^2$, as both components have failed; $wf$ with probability $2p(1-p)$, which is the sum of probabilities of two mutually exclusive events, viz., the first component failed and the second working or the first component working and the second component failed; $ww$ with probability $(1-p)^2$, as both components are still working. Hence, the transition matrix: \begin{equation*} P=\begin{array}{c|ccc} &ff & wf & ww\\ \hline ff & (1-r)^2& 2r(1-r) & r^2\\ wf & p(1-r) & pr+(1-p)(1-r) & r(1-p) \\ ww & p^2 & 2p(1-p) & (1-p)^2 \end{array} \end{equation*}
