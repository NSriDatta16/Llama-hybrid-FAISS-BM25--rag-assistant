By reading off the arguments of the exponentials, it is evident that $X$ is a mixture of Normals centered at $\pm 1$, whereas $Y$ is a Normal with the same mean and variance as $X$. Here are their density functions when $\sigma=1/2$: $X$ is blue with two peaks; $Y$ is red with one peak. (When $\sigma$ is much larger than $1/2$, $X$ will have only a single "merged" peak, but it will be flatter at the top than $Y$'s peak.) From this picture it is apparent that All odd moments will be zero, because both variables are symmetric about the origin. The red curve ($Y$) has fatter tails than the blue ($X$), implying its higher even moments will be greater. The easiest way to do the calculations is with the characteristic or moment generating functions. The MGF of a Normal$(\mu, \tau)$ distribution is $$\exp{(t \mu +\frac{t^2 \tau ^2}{2})};$$ when expanded as a MacLaurin series in $t$, the coefficient of $t^n$ is $1/n!$ times the $n$th moment. Plugging in $\mu=0$ and $\tau = \sqrt{1+\sigma^2}$ gives the MGF of $Y$ as $$1+\left(\frac{1}{2}+\frac{\sigma ^2}{2}\right) t^2+\left(\frac{1}{8}+\frac{\sigma ^2}{4}+\frac{\sigma ^4}{8}\right) t^4+\left(\frac{1}{48}+\frac{\sigma ^2}{16}+\frac{\sigma ^4}{16}+\frac{\sigma ^6}{48}\right) t^6+\left(\frac{1}{384}+\frac{\sigma ^2}{96}+\frac{\sigma ^4}{64}+\frac{\sigma ^6}{96}+\frac{\sigma ^8}{384}\right) t^8+\ldots$$ whereas that of $X$ is the average of MGFs of its components, which works out to $$1+\left(\frac{1}{2}+\frac{\sigma ^2}{2}\right) t^2+\left(\frac{1}{24}+\frac{\sigma ^2}{4}+\frac{\sigma ^4}{8}\right) t^4+\left(\frac{1}{720}+\frac{\sigma ^2}{48}+\frac{\sigma ^4}{16}+\frac{\sigma ^6}{48}\right) t^6+\left(\frac{1}{40320}+\frac{\sigma ^2}{1440}+\frac{\sigma ^4}{192}+\frac{\sigma ^6}{96}+\frac{\sigma ^8}{384}\right) t^8+\ldots.$$ The agreement with the preceding MGF in the first two terms is evident. The coefficients of $t^4$ give the fourth moments: comparing, we see that of $Y$ exceeds that of $X$ by $4!(\frac{1}{8}-\frac{1}{24})\gt 0$, as expected. Similar comparisons bear out (and quantify) our impression that $Y$ has the greater higher moments.
