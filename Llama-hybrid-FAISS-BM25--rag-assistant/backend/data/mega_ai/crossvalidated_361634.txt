Yes. That's exactly what principal component regression is: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_regression . No need to rotate. In fact, rotating would not make any difference as far as prediction is concerned; see Using varimax-rotated PCA components as predictors in linear regression . Of course if you want to interpret individual regression coefficients, then you'd need to have interpretable predictors; rotated PCs might be more interpretable (or not). No need to transform. The dependent ("outcome") variable should be left alone. Including it into PCA would be cheating. There is no transformation that you should use only because you use PCA. In general, you might want to read How can top principal components retain the predictive power on a dependent variable (or even lead to better predictions)? .
