Number 2: because I write many short functions and refactor them freely, it'd be a significant nuisance to maintain forward declarations. If there's an Emacs extension that does that for you with no fuss, I'd be interested, since the top-down organization is a bit more readable. (I prefer top-down in e.g. Python.) Actually not quite your Number 2, because I generally group related functions together in the .c regardless of whether they're public or private. If I want to see all the public declarations I'll look in the header.
