Besides singletons, what are some compelling reasons to use static methods in PHP?

I recently answered this question: What are good reasons to use static methods in PHP? The first thing to come to mind, of course, was a singleton. With little exception, the other answerers provided the same singleton example. But that got me thinking... I don't really ever use static methods or properties for anything besides creating singletons! A brief search netted many tutorials on using static methods, almost all of which implement some variation of the same singleton class. I'm really interested: What reason do we have to make static methods other than creating singletons (or other than just being lazy and wanting a global function)? Does anyone have a pragmatic example of using a static method that could not be accomplished better using a dynamic design pattern? The example can be a singleton if that makes sense in it's context, but I'm interested in other reasons besides the singleton-aspect of the solution.
