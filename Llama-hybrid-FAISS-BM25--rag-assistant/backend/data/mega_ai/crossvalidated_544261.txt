How to create bayesian test for ROI/ROAS metric

I am interested in using A/B Bayesian testing to compare ROAS for marketing scenarios. I've seen references dealing with cases such as: Using a beta distribution prior to model a binomial-distributed random variable; Using a gamma distribution prior to model a Poisson-distributed random variable. In my case, knowing that $\text{ROAS} = \text{Revenue}/\text{Cost}$ , is there any convenient prior in the Bayesian context? In other words, in a situation where I have the cost and revenue data for two scenarios A and B, how can I use Bayesian Testing to calculate the probability that $\text{ROAS}_A > \text{ROAS}_B$ ? The distribution of revenue for each conversion (success event) is not necessarily known, but I accept modeling suggestions to simplify the problem.
