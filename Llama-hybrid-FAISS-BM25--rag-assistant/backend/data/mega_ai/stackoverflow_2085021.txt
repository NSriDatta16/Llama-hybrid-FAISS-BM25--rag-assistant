How can I migrate my user-generated data to the computer?

I have a query regarding BackUp of third party application data on PC. I am developing an application which can store photos, text, recordings. The user can add number of photos or recordings. So at the runtime, size of application storage will go on increasing. User will never want to loose his data but storage is limited. Hence taking backup of data on his computer and then deleting from iPhone seems essential. So what is the standard way of taking backup of third party application data? Is there any way by which we can save the data on MAC as well as Windows using iTunes? Is there any limit on amount of storage a third party application can take?
