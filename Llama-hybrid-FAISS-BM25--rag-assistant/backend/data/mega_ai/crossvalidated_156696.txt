Regression performed using Principal Component Analysis

I have a dataset consisting of 10 correlated variables. I need to explain a response variable using these 10 variables, so I am using PCA to reduce dimensionality. Say, I use the first 3 components from PCA as regressors in Linear regression. Once I have performed Linear reg, I will have 3 beta values associated with three components. How do I split the beta value between 10 varaiables in each PCA component?
