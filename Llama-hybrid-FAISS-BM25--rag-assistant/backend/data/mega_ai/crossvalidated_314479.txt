It's not clear why it's important to have only a single-word term. I'd say that for most purposes don't be afraid of three shortish words: "number of columns"; the very term you began with, which served to perfectly convey the idea you asked about. It is a mere 5 syllables, it's not a strain to say or write. A term consisting of just a few common words is likely to be less of an intellectual effort to grasp on the fly than one longish or unfamiliar one. There may well be four or five terms that might serve, but if I was only writing it a few times, I would feel the strong inclination to go back and edit such a term out and replace it with "number of columns". If I would need to write about a specific case many times, I'd start with something like "Let $X$ be an $n\times p$ matrix" and then refer to $p$ thereafter; or if I had to refer to the number of columns of many matrices, to have a notation like "denote the number of columns of a matrix $A$ as $c_A$", or something similar as suited the circumstances.
