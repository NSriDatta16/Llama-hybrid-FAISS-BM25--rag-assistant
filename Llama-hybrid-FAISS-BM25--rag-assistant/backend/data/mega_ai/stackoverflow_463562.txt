Java and other clients for WCF RESTful Services

I am wanting to expose some data service endpoints for internal application use and am debating on WCF REST as a possible solution. What are my options for other languages/platforms as clients? Keeping in mind that I need to service Java, Python and .Net clients. Essentially, I want to be able to demonstrate a single point of organization data access for multiple clients, and feel that the REST toolkit, especially with JSON could work very well. Being able to address multiple clients with a single data access layer would be a really good thing. I feel that WCF + REST is probably the best solution for this on the server-side, but want to demonstrate the other languages working against the services. As a point of really selling the option for use beyond my developer group within the organization.
