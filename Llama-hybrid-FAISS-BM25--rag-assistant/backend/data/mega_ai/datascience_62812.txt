This depends somewhat on the model and language (implementation). First please understand that categorical data is not the same as non-numerical data! Many models can handle categorical data (e.g. regression formats) just fine and some can even handle non-numerical data. Finally and most important for you feature engineering has to be done on the whole data set before the train/test split. All models can only predict on data that has the exact same input formats as the data it has been trained on! So yes if you one-hot encoded some column it also needs to be one-hot encoded for the prediction.
