How to set the same number of datapoints in the different ranges in correlation chart

I am beginner in working with machine learning. I would like to ask a question that How could I set the same number of datapoints in the different ranges in correlation chart? Or any techniques for doing that? . Specifically, I want to set the same number of datapoints in each range (0-10; 10-20;20-30;...) in the image above. Thanks for any help.
