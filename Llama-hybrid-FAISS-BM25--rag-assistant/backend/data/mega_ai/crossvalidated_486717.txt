How should two cross-validated logistic regression models be compared?

I'm using 100 times 10-fold repeated cross-validation to assess the ROC-AUC performance improvement of adding a biomarker to an existing model: Model_A : pred1 + pred2 Model_B :pred1 + pred2 + pred3 I've seen advice before to use the Wilcoxon rank test to compare the AUCs between each fold. Averaging ROC curves over folds in cross-validation Should I pull the median p-value from this? Is it acceptable to use the diff.resamples function in the Caret package and use the Wilcoxin rank instead of the default t-test? Does it need Bonferonni correction if only looking at AUC? https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/caret/versions/6.0-86/topics/diff.resamples Lastly, any thoughts on using DeLong or the likelihood ratio test. instead?
