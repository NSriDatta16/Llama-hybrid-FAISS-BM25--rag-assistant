min max algorithm in python

In the minmax algorithm,How to determine when your function reaches the end of the tree and break the recursive calls. I have made a max function in which I am calling the min function. In the min function , what shud I do?? For max function, I am just returning the bestscore. def maxAgent(gameState, depth): if (gameState.isWin()): return gameState.getScore() actions = gameState.getLegalActions(0); bestScore = -99999 bestAction = Directions.STOP for action in actions: if (action != Directions.STOP): score = minAgent(gameState.generateSuccessor(0, action), depth, 1) if (score > bestScore): bestScore = score bestAction = action return bestScore def minvalue(gameState,depth,agentIndex): if (gameState.isLose()): return gameState.getScore() else: finalstage = False number = gameState.getNumAgents() if (agentIndex == number-1): finalstage = True bestScore = 9999 for action in gameState.getLegalActions(agentIndex): if(action != Directions.STOP I could not understand how to proceed now?I not allowed to set the limit of depth of tree. it has to be arbitrary.
