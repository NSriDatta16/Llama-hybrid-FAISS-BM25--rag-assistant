Help with Arrays for Java

// **************************************************************** // Sales.java // // Reads in and stores sales for each of 5 salespeople. Displays // sales entered by salesperson id and total sales for all salespeople. // // **************************************************************** import java.util.Scanner; public class Sales { public static void main(String[] args) { final int SALESPEOPLE = 5; int[] sales = new int[SALESPEOPLE]; int sum; int average; int max=sales[0]; int min=sales[0]; int salemade; Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in); for (int i=0; i max) max=sales[i]; System.out.println("Salesperson "+sale[i]+ "has the max sale of $ " + max); if(sales[i] =salemade) System.out.println(sales[i]); } } } I'm trying to write this program that asked the user to put in the amount of sales of 5 people, and it will display the max and min value and print out the sale person id and amount of min and max sale("Salesperson 3 had the highest sale with $4500.") after the program prints the min, max and average, it will ask the user to enter a random number and compares it to those previous number and see who met or exeeded the max amount and print that person id. I'm having trouble getting it done.Can some one take a look and help me? These are the error i got Sales.java:33: cannot find symbol symbol : variable sale location: class Sales System.out.println("Salesperson "+sale[i]+ "has the max sale of $ " + max); ^ Sales.java:33: cannot find symbol symbol : variable i location: class Sales System.out.println("Salesperson "+sale[i]+ "has the max sale of $ " + max); ^ Sales.java:34: cannot find symbol symbol : variable i location: class Sales if(sales[i]
