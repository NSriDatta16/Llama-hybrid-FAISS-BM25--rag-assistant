How to disable floating tabs in Visual Studio 2010

I now use the new Visual Studio 2010 and I experience something very annoying that wasn't happening before with Visual Studio 2008. Something changed with the way it handles the floating of tabs and I can't stand it. Every once in a while, I would somehow trigger the floating of a tab instead of just switching to it. It may have to do with the way I click (maybe a very fast double click gets sent), or maybe I very slightly drag the mouse when clicking the tab. I don't know. All I know is that I was fine with Visual Studio 2008. Is there a way to disable this somewhere? I want to either un-register the double click as a floating tab trigger, or remove the floating option altogether. How can I do that? Thanks.
