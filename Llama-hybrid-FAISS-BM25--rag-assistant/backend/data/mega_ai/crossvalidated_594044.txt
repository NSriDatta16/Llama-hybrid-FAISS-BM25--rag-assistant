I think you could use PCA or SVD to get the first 5-10 principal components, and you can look at the explained variance to see how pca works. Then, you could do a regression to find the connection or try random forest models(you have enough data compared to the feature now, but do not tune the hyper-parameters too many times, they could still lead to overfitting.). Or you could using lasso to pick 5-10 number of features and do the regression.
