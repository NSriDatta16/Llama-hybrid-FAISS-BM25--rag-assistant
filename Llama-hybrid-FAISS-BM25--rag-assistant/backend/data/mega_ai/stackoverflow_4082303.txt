Check your server logs for the actual content of the response to the Yandex request. HTTP 405 is Method Not Allowed, and is usually returned if the user agent has used an HTTP verb not supported for the particular resource. For example, using Fiddler , I issued several requests to http://huti.ru , and I got 200 response for the HEAD , GET , and POST , but I got 405 for the TRACE . It's conceivable that Yandex issues either TRACE or OPTIONS , before making a request for the actual page as a form of a ping to determine if the page exists. Note: @smilingthax mentioned that your server returns 405 on HEAD . However, issuing the following request from Fiddler worked for me: HEAD http://huti.ru/ HTTP/1.1 Host: huti.ru Proxy-Connection: keep-alive Accept: application/xml,application/xhtml+xml,text/html;q=0.9,text/plain;q=0.8,image/png,*/*;q=0.5 User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/534.10 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/8.0.552.23 Safari/534.10 Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate,sdch Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.8 Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.3 Thus, your problem might be specific to HEAD requests with particular headers.
