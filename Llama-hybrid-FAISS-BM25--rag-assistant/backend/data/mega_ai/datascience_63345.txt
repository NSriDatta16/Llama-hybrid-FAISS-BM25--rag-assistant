What you describe is called padding and is indeed used frequently in language modeling. For instance if one represents the sequence "A B C" with trigrams: # # A # A B A B C B C # C # # The advantages of padding: it makes every word/symbol appear the same number of times whether it appears in the middle of the sequence or not. it marks the beginning and end of a sentence/text, so that the model can represent the probability to start/end with a particular word.
