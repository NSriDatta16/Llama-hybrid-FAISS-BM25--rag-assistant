I've been a Stack Overflow user for two years, as well as an avid user of several other Stack Exchange web sites . I'm a retired pro-tem moderator from Webmasters SE and did my very best to help turn it into a successful site. At the time, moderator nominations were conducted on individual meta sites, I was nominated and accepted. Unfortunately, this collided with a life altering job change and schedule. Things have settled again, and I miss moderating. I was also the operator of a (now defunct) SE 1.0 site. I had the idea that a SE site for startup companies would work, so did several other people. One of the things that attracts me to Stack Overflow and other sites in the network is that the community runs pretty much everything. My view on moderation is that we're here to do what the community can't , while giving a bit of time to behind the scenes maintenance and upkeep to ensure that all visitors have the best possible experience. The biggest difference in my opinion between moderators and users, beyond access to special privileges, is accountability. I'm ready and willing to be held accountable for every action that I take as a moderator. I think it is an absurdity to expect that everyone will like every action that you take as a moderator. I really value this community, and I will work to ensure it continues to thrive. That might mean locking something that found its way into StumbleUpon and received fifteen 'thank you' answers in an hour, or letting someone know through a variety of available tools that their behavior simply isn't acceptable for our community. I'm confident that the majority of my time will be spent doing more rewarding things, like asking people heavily vested in tags that lack tag wikis to create them. Typically, I let the community speak with their votes and flags before taking action unless I'm certain that not taking action immediately would be detrimental to the community. Examples would be obvious SPAM or blatantly abusive behavior. I don't have as much free time as many others, but I do spend a significant amount of what time I have on SO. If elected, that time would be even more productive. I tend to be on-line approximately 15 hours a day, active on SO and other SE sites at least 3 hours daily. My Skype ID as well a a link to a page that sends me e-mail is on my profile. A little about me: Husband & Father I work in the web hosting industry - That 'cloud' thing. Mostly I work on low level tools, APIs kernels and hypervisors. Home is both US and Asia. We try our very best to visit a new country every year I speak English , relatively broken Spanish and enough Tagalog (Filipino) to get by I've been programming for over 20 years, 10 professionally Avid amateur photographer who is ashamed to have little activity on photography SE Free / Open Source software developer (yes, I have commit access to projects that aren't mine) Notable badges: Suffrage (I tend to use all of my votes, frequently, it's not like they roll over) Strunk & White (I just can't help it) Electorate (I love questions that give me something to do or think about) Sportsmanship (I usually up vote answers before adding something I feel is missing) Pundit (here and on MSO) Convention (I tend to be quite vocal in the shaping of Stack Exchange) Why do I want to be a moderator? Every time I see something that should be fixed, I feel like I'm adding to someone else's work load by just flagging it. I'm a 10k+ user which means I should be able to fix most things, but the sheer volume of SO is quite taxing. This is equally compounded by knowing how odd flags can be. SO needs diplomatic hands. I know the tools, I know how things work, I have a very good idea of how people work and I want to help. I am a 3k + user on several other sites and can help guide question migration. I'm not easily offended or disturbed, and there apparently was an opening SO is a source of fun for me, I want to help improve it I've moderated before and I fully know what the job entails. Moderators should first and foremost want the responsibility. I do and I know what I'm getting myself into. Most memorable SO experience: I helped to translate a question that was asked in Spanish. Someone arrived here and Chrome translated the page, so naturally, they asked a question in Spanish. A few of us pulled it out of down vote city, translated it and it actually ended up getting good answers. Now, I can't remember which one it was, but it is in my history for the morbidly curious. As broken as my Spanish is, it felt good to know enough to help someone. Low and behold, despite all of that, I'm a POSIX/*NIX programmer who doesn't have a generalist badge :) How could that possibly happen?
