Ok let's go part by part. There's quite a few parts here where you do not take into consideration the bias in your network. Choosing your inputs and output If the vector 0-6 is determined there really is no need to output 1-7. The 1-6 is already known and adding additional outputs will only add complexity to your model. Unless you have substantial amounts of data you want to keep your model as simple as possible in order to get good performance. Thus, I would output a simple neuron with a continuous value. You can use RMSE as your loss function with a regression output from your neural network. Additionally, you should supplement the samples you put into your input space with some additional information that you might think would contain information about the trend line. For example, if I had 2 different products, bitcoin and gold, and their input vector was the same, I might expect the gold to have very little fluctuation but the bitcoin to have very high fluctuation. Your input features to your network contain all the information from which your network will learn. Thus, you want to make sure that you are supplying sufficient information to have a meaningful prediction. Deep learning is data hungry You will need approximately 100,000+ instances. Each instance is a set of features. These should be drawn independently and such that they are identically distributed. In other words, you want to get multiple trendlines from a varied source of data that you wish to use your network with and then you will randomly draw 0-6 points, that is your features, and 7 which will be your label. Consider the data distribution you are trying to learn. If you want your network to classify cats/dogs, you need to give a wide range of different looking cats and dogs such that the network can identify the variance which exists in both of these classes. If you restrict the data source too much it will have high bias and will not generalize to novel data that you will later feed into it. Try these things and let us know what happens.
