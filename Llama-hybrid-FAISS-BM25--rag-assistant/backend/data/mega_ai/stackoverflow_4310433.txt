You could write code directly in your skin file. Do some logic like: Where 33 is the page id for the page you want to run custom code on. There are other ways to do this like creating skin objects, or creating custom modules, but this is probably the easiest thing to do. Just write code directly in you skin. Or make a copy of your skin for each page you need to do custom code for... again, more elegant ways but this will get'er done.
