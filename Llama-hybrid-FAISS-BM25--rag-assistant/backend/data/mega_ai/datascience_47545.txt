Detect sensitive data from unstructured text documents

I know this question is broad, but I need an advice to know if it's possible to achieve what I want to do. The problem is that I have around 2500 documents with sensitive data being replaced by four dots. I do not have the original documents, so I wonder if there is a way to build a model that can detect sensitive data from any new documents (with sensitive data not being removed) using the previous documents? I want to apply machine learning or deep learning approaches. And what I know is that the original data set with annotated sensitive data should be used for training, which I can't obtain. I am new at this field so any advice would be very appropriated
