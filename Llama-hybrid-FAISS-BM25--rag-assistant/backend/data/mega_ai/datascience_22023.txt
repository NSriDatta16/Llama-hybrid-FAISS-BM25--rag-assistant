Deep neural networks for mostly zero valued data

I have some data with around 1000 features. Problem is most of the features are 0. In each row usually around 100 features have values and rest of the features are 0. A sample example data is given below ID f1 f2 f3 ........ f1000 label 1 45 0 0 32 1 2 23 0 0 0 2 3 0 40 0 0 1 4 0 0 23 24 3 5 78 0 64 0 2 As you can see there are lot of 0 in each row. Which deep neural networks method should I use? I was thinking about RNN or CNN but I am not sure if these are the best choices. I was thinking about some methods which will ignore zero values i.e does not consider the zero values in the calculation. I think RNN can do this. But I am not exactly sure.
