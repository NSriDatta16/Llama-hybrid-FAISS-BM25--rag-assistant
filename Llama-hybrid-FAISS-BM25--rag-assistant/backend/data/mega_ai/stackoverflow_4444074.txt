Unfortunately it is a problem (for lack of a better term) in XPath (not InfoPath/XML or MS specific). So even if you figured out a way to create your own type I think the processing engine internally would still convert it back to double anytime you tried to access and create the same floating point problems you have now. Check out this article that uses rounding to solve (sort of) the problem. Not the most elegant solution but I think it is what you are stuck with as far as InfoPath goes. http://blogs.msdn.com/b/infopath/archive/2008/04/17/invalid-data-error-when-calculating-the-result-of-2-or-more-fields.aspx
