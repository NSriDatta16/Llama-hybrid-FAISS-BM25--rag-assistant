Talking about usability here, one thing hasn't been mentioned. For the list of countries in particular, if you're including the full list of 200-whatever it's often a good idea to list the most popular few at the very top of the list, based on your anticipated market. It might seem counter-intuitive since programmers like nice, neatly sorted lists of things (myself included), but no one likes scrolling to near the bottom of the list to find "USA". Or, always seeing Cambodia, Cameroon, and then Canada. I couldn't show where Cambodia or Cameroon are on a map (though my geography skills are below-average), but the names have been seared into my mind by these lists. Remember that not all users use, or even know about, auto-complete or even typing what they want in a list. It's certainly an excellent aid, but it should not be relied upon.
