Choice of time series models

I built a model for time series in order to forecast new values. What is the best way to choose the correct model? Are better criteria like AIC and BIC or the comparison between prediction errors? In this last case I have to split dataset in train and test while in the first case is not necessary, reducing time of implementation. Thanks!
