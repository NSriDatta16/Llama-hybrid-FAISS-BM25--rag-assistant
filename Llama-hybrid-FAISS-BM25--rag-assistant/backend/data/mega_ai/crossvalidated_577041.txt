Income Transformation In this case it is helpful to remember the reason why these types of regressions and economic analyses use the log transformation, it is because it tends to make the residuals more normally distributed. The foundational assumption of the lm algorithm and parameter variance estimates is that the residuals are normally distributed. You can also see this thinking in discussions on Box-Cox transformations. Below is my personal heuristic for how to work through the various options. At each stage, you ask if the residuals form an approximate normal distribution and then stop. I use a quantile quantile plot to check normality primarily. If there is a question about whether some of the data values are missing, but recorded as zero, you have to solve that first. Check the residuals without transformation. Log transform Income. This is generally a good place to start if there are no zero or negative income values. Square root. Very much like the log transform and allows for zero income values. Cubed root or higher odd root. This is good in the case of positive and negative income values because you can preserve the sign. If you have reason to believe that one of these transformations works for the positive values, but the zeros fit differently, then you may require a mixture distribution or Bayesian model to handle this situation. If you find that the zeros are really a recording of an income below some threshold, like "below the poverty line", then you may want to switch to a censored data analysis like a Cox Proportional Hazard model or Accelerated Failure Model. Transform the Monetary Values? My answer to this is yes, you should transform the incomes to a constant dollar amount as long as the other variables mean something consistent across monetary types. Age, gender of the head of household, household size, and period all mean the mean same thing regardless of country. You also want their coefficient to mean the same thing (e.g. the increase in income due to an 1 year increase in age). Class might mean the mean the same thing across countries if a common distributional argument is used, or it might be dependent on country specific values. You might also consider including a country effect if you have sufficient degrees of freedom. You should also consider transforming 2018 dollars into a constant inflation adjusted 2000 dollars. You may also have to adjust the class definitions depending on how that was done. Graph Advice I think the figure that you create should be central to the hypothesis you intend to test. I am investigating whether earnings differences have widened between different social classes in several European countries by comparing two different periods. In this case, it seems that you are testing the coefficient on period*class holding age, gender, and household size constant. In cases where you want to show the effect of an interaction variable, there are common ways to do that you could look up. Essentially people plot Income versus period with lines for two different classes. If you want to show this in a country-specific way, then you would want to add country to that interaction.
