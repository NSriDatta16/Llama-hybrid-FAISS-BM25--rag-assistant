How can a random variable have random mean?

According to these papers 1 (pg 6) 2 (pg 118) involving Bayesian inference, $\beta_{jkc}$ ~ $N(\mu_{\beta j k}, \tau_{\beta j})$ $\mu_{\beta j k}$ ~ $N(\lambda_j, \eta_j)$ So $\beta_{jkc}$ is a random variable with random mean? Is it a conditional mean then ?
