I have learned to avoid all but the simplest regexp. I far prefer other models such as Icon's string scanning or Haskell's parsing combinators. In both of these models you can write user-defined code that has the same privileges and status as the built-in string ops. If I were programming in Perl I would probably rig up some parsing combinators in Perl---I've done it for other languages. A very nice alternative is to use Parsing Expression Grammars as Roberto Ierusalimschy has done with his LPEG package, but unlike parser combinators this is something you can't whip up in an afternoon. But if somebody has already done PEGs for your platform it's a very nice alternative to regular expressions.
