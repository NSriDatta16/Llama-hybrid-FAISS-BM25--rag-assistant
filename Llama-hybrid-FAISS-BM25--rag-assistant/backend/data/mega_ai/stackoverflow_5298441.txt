Well let me clear you one thing, you need to embed font for input and dynamic text field. static text-field works fine without embedding. now if you create dynamic text-field using new operator , the fonts of the text-field must be embedded also. Embed the font first , set linkage option and use Font Class to load the embedded text then assign this loaded font to dynamically created text-field.. it will work.
