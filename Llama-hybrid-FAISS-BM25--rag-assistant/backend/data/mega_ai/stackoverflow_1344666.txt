Wow - I am amazed! The problem was because I was loading the soria.css from AOL/CDN. I made this switch: Commented out this: Replaced with this: and it worked! What a waste of my afternoon! The first issue was that sometimes in Firebug - it was show no data for the soria.css, and the left side of the page would lose its blue boxes. So sometimes the css was loading, sometimes it wasn't - about 80/20. It was driving me crazy because I could press F5 to refresh and it might work or might not. So that's one reason I switched to a local copy. Then this link also gave me encouragement to switch: http://www.dojotoolkit.org/forum/dijit-dijit-0-9/dijit-support/unable-run-my-editor-aol-or-google-cdn . Supposedly it's an old bug that was fixed, but maybe it sneaked back in? Neal
