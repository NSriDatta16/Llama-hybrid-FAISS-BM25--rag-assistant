Honestly, I think it boils down to code optimization, apart from just the infrastructure. In StackOverflow Podcast 19 , Jeff discussed about how they had to tweak SQL Server to handle the kinds of loads StackOverflow has; notice that it was not .NET that needed tweaking here. One also has to note that MySpace.com, one of the most massive social networks out there, runs on ASP.NET . The MySpace use of ASP.NET alone is a testament to its scalability. It will boil down to how developers will write their applications in such a way that best leverages that capability.
