getParentNode() doesn't work on attributes. All nodes, except Attr, Document, DocumentFragment, Entity, and Notation may have a parent. not 100% sure, but i think you can select all nodes that have an attribute with the following expression: //*[@*] you can then easily loop over the attributes and check if they are empty
