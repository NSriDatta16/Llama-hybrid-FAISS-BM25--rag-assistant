Imputing should be done when the data is actually missing, that is, it was supposed to be recorded in data collection process but somehow the value could not be captured. For variables with values like "-" can be filtered along with the set of other variables. In building the machine learning model such variables can be excluded. However, exclusion will depend upon the degree of missingness. Suppose a dataset with 4 variables, 'A, B, X, D'. Suppose, variable 'X' has 80 percent values coded like "-", and then depending on the importance or effect or contribution this variable has for the question to be solved, it can be removed or used. This brings me back to answer the question OP asked, "how to deal with such missingness?". I think a good strategy will be to ascertain what kind/type of value this variable was supposed/meant to contain/hold. Look at the remaining values that are not missing in the variable 'X'. Are they continuous, categorical (ordinal or nominal)? Basis of it, you can then statistically justify the imputation.
