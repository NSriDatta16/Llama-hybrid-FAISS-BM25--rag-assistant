I would argue that you should validate the IP Address before it is stored in the database because: The retrieval from HTTP Request and database storage won't always be close to each other in the code. So at some point in the future someone might call the database storage method using bad data. If you write the code to validate it now, you are less likely to deal with problems in the future.
