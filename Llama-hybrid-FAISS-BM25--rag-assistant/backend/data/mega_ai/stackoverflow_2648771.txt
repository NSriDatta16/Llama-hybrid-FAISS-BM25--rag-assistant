Gmail HTML5 Feature to "drop" attachments

I've seen this and I have to admit I'm pretty impressed: (source: blogspot.com ) http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2010/04/drag-and-drop-attachments-onto-messages.html I'm almost certain that this is an HTML 5 feature (it's supported on Chrome and Firefox 3.5), and was wondering if somebody knew how is the browser feature called. Bonus points for a tutorial/article on how to do something similar!
