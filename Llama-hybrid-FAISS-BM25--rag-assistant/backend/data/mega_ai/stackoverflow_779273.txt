I'm puzzled. You're asking for an embeded database - where the database itself is stored on the server. that translates to storing the data file on a network share. You then say that SQL Compact Edition won't work... except that if one looks at this document: Word Document: Choosing Between SQL Server 2005 Compact Edition and SQL Server 2005 Express Edition On page 8 you have a nice big green tick next to "Data file storage on a network share". So it seems to me that your first thought was the right one.
