Transformation of Confidence Interval = Confidence Interval of Transformation?

I am wondering about the following situation: I have a confidence interval estimator $\delta(x)=[lb, ub]$ , which returns valid a%-confidence intervals for a value $\theta \in \mathbb{R}$ (not necessarily a parameter). How can I obtain a confidence interval for a value $f(\theta)$ ? In particular, i am interested in f(x)=2*x-1 f(x)=x/(1-x) The naive approach of simply transforming the bounds using $f$ , that is, $\delta_f(x)=[f(lb), f(ub)]$ seems to produce confidence intervals with the correct $a\%$ coverage. However, given the existence of more complex procedures, like the delta method, this seems too good to be true.
