How to make a control "transparent" for the mouse or Route MouseMove event to parent?

I want to create a card playing game. I the use mousemove event to drag cards through the window. The problem is if I move the mouse over another card, it is stuck because the card underneath the mouse cursor gets the mouse events, so that the MouseMove event of the window isn't fired. This is what I do: private void RommeeGUI_MouseMove(object sender, MouseEventArgs e) { if (handkarte != null) { handkarte.Location = this.PointToClient(Cursor.Position); } } I tried the following, but there was no difference: SetStyle(ControlStyles.UserMouse,true); SetStyle(ControlStyles.EnableNotifyMessage, true); Iam looking for a way to implement an application-global event-handler or a way to implement so called event-bubbling. At least I want to make the mouse ignore certain controls.
