How to explain features' importance after PCA?

I had a dataset that was terribly haunted by colinearity. I carried out PCA on it to remove the colinearity. Let's assume I am going to build a linear regression model, which is easily explainable, on the PCA'd data. Since the data columns are no longer the original ones, how can we find the most important one original feature according to the model, or say, explain the model using the original input features?
