Azure Table Storage data Consistency

Let say I have Table in Azure Table Storage public class MyTable { public string PK {get; set;} public string RowPK {get; set;} public double Amount {get; set;} } And message in Azure Queue which says Add 10 to Amount . Now let say one worker role Takes this message from queue Takes row from table Amount += 10 Updates Row in Table And Fails After a while message is available in queue again. So next worker role: Takes this message from queue Takes row from table Amount += 10 Updates Row in Table Removes message from queue Those actions results in Amount += 20 instead of Amount += 10 . How can I avoid such situations?
