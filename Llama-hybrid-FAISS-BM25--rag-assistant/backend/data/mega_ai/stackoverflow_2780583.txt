Well, the latter snippet won't even compile because it's trying to assign true to str.Equals("Hello") (you've got a single = instead of ==) but either: if (str.Equals("HELLO")) or if (str.Equals("HELLO") == true) will work. The latter is pretty strongly discouraged though - it's pretty ugly. Bear in mind that string overloads ==, so you can actually write: if (str == "HELLO") which is somewhat simpler.
