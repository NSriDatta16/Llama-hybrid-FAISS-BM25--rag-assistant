You have a very low amount of images to create a CNN from scratch. You may be able to train your model via transfer learning from a pre-trained model, but you still may have too small of a dataset. See something like this: https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/06/transfer-learning-the-art-of-fine-tuning-a-pre-trained-model/ Basically, you can take an image model that has been trained on tons of images, and either use their weights to seed or (more likely) just retrain the fully connected dense layers.
