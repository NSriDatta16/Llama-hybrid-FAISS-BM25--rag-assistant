How do I know if my Ordered Logistic Regression is a good model?

I have a few questions about Ordered Logistic Regression Model (OLR). In general, how do I know if this is my model is good, and how do I enhance it? Using this example from https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/r/dae/ordinal-logistic-regression/ , if these are the outputs I am looking at: ## R OUTPUTS ## Call: ## polr(formula = apply ~ pared + public + gpa, data = dat, Hess = TRUE) ## Coefficients: ## Value Std. Error t value ## pared 1.0477 0.266 3.942 ## public -0.0588 0.298 -0.197 ## gpa 0.6159 0.261 2.363 ## ## Intercepts: ## Value Std. Error t value ## unlikely|somewhat likely 2.204 0.780 2.827 ## somewhat likely|very likely 4.299 0.804 5.345 ## ## Residual Deviance: 717.02 ## AIC: 727.02 ## R INPUT exp(cbind(OR = coef(m), ci)) ## R OUTPUT ## OR 2.5 % 97.5 % ## pared 2.8511 1.6958 4.817 ## public 0.9429 0.5209 1.681 ## gpa 1.8514 1.1136 3.098 What can I do to enhance/improve my OLR model in R? What output values should I be focusing on? Does improving my OLR model mean looking at my P values and coefficients and removing the ones that are not statistically significant? I am stuck as I don't really know what to do after I run the model. Thank you.
