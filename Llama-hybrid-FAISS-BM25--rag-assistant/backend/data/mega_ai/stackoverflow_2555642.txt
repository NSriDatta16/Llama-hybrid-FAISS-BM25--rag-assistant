Objective-C Framework PSMTabBarControl does not work - NSTabView Tabs with Style

In my App I'm trying to get PSMTabBarControl working, but all I do - nothing... I have copied the framework File in my Frameworks folder of my App, then included it. In my InterfaceBuilder (3.2.1) I was able to drag and drop the PSMTabBarControl to my Window and link it with the NSTabView (PSM -> tabView -> NSTabView && NSTabView -> delegate -> PSM), but after i tried a Demo (apple+r) I cant see the Tabs... Tried all I can - but dont know why.. Am I doing sth. wrong? Which other Framework or Source I can use to create Tabs like Firefox oder Safari? Thank you!
