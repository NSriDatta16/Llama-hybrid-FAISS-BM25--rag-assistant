Yes. You can average two colors together like that (simple averaging). It's the approach used by OpenGL to blend colors together (e.g., in creating mip maps for rendering distant objects, or rendering a 50% transparent texture). It is fast, simple, and "good enough" for many situations. It isn't completely realistic, however, and probably wouldn't be used on photograph-quality images.
