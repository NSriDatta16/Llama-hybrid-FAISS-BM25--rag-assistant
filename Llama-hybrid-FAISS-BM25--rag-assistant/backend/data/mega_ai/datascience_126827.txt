How to Determine the Minimum Value of a Continuous Variable for Predicting Categorical variable using Logistic Regression?

I am using logistic regression to predict df['MortSubiteCardiaque'], which contains 0 and 1, based on my continuous variable df['NTProBNP']. I would like to determine the threshold for df['NTProBNP'], specifically the minimum value of df['NTProBNP'] that predicts 1. How can I do that? df['constante'] = 1 X = df[['constante', 'NTProBNP']] y = df['MortSubiteCardiaque'] model = sm.Logit(y, X) result = model.fit() y_probs = result.predict(X) fpr, tpr, thresholds = roc_curve(y, y_probs) roc_auc = auc(fpr, tpr) # optimal cut-off point optimal_idx = np.argmax(tpr - fpr) optimal_threshold = thresholds[optimal_idx] # i had 2361 with this line df['NTProBNP'][y_probs >= optimal_threshold].min()
