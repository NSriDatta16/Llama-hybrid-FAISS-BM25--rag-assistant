Bayes test function with a discrete prior

Let X be exponential with mean θ. Consider testing H0 : θ = 1 versus H1 : θ = 2 with a single observation. Loss function: 0-1 Loss function. So the risk of the test function φ is R(1, φ) = E1 (φ(X)) and R(2, φ) = E2 (1 − φ(X)). Prior distribution θ with θ({1}) = 2/3, and θ({2}) = 1/3 Find the Bayes test function for the prior θ. Hint: Your test should minimize [R(1, φ) + 2R(2, φ)]/3. I know how to deal with questions when there's a squared error loss and a continuous prior. But this 0-1 loss function and discrete prior. The only book that helped me a little was the Theory of Statistics | Mark J. Schervish. but I could only find little information about bayesian hypothesis testing on pages 218-222. Any guidance,direction would be highly appreciated.
