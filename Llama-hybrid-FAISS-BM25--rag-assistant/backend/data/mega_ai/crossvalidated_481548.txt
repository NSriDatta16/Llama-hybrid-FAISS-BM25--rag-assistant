Suppose you're sampling from a population of college students with heights distributed $\mathsf{Norm}(\mu = 68, \sigma=4).$ Heights in inches. This distribution has about 68% of heights in the interval $68\pm 4$ or $(64,72).$ Let's call heights in this interval Medium, ones below Short and ones above Tall. If I take just one student from the population (s)he might be S, M, or T with probabilities about 16%, 68%, and 16%, respectively. And I won't have a very reliable estimate of $\mu.$ But if I take four students from the population, it's very unlikely they'd all be S $(.16^9 \approx 0.0007)$ or all T. So I'm very likely to get some sort of mixture of students, maybe 2 M's, 1 T, and 1 S. So the average height of the four $\bar X_4$ will be a better estimate of the population mean. In fact, one can show that $\bar X_4 \sim \mathsf{Norm}(\mu=68, \sigma = 2).$ Moreover, if I sample $n=9$ students at random and find their mean height, I'll get $\bar X_9 \sim \mathsf{Norm}(\mu=60, \sigma=4/3).$ Among nine students, I can expect a pretty good mixture of heights and a pretty good estimate of $\mu.$ [I'll be within 2in of the true average 68, about 87% of the time.] Suppose I simulate the average heights ( a in the R code below) of samples of size $n = 9$ and repeat this experiment 10,000 times. Then I can make a histogram (blue bars) of the 10,000 $\bar X_9$ 's and how the distribution looks. The red curve shows the density function of $\bar X_9 \mathsf{Norm}(\mu=60, \sigma=4/3).$ The dotted curve is for the density of the original population distribution. The vertical lines separate S, M, L heights. [R code for the figure, in case you want it, is shown at the end.] set.seed(2020) a = replicate(10^5, mean(rnorm(9, 68, 4))) mean(a) [1] 68.00533 # aprx 69 sd(a) [1] 1.331429 # aprx 3/4 hdr = "Means of 10,000 samples of 9 Heights" hist(a, prob=T, xlim=c(56,80), col="skyblue2", main=hdr) curve(dnorm(x,68,4/3), add=T, col="red", lwd=2) curve(dnorm(x,68, 4), add=T, lty="dotted", lwd=2) abline(v=c(64,72))
