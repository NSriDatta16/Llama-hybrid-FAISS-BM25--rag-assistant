Sharepoint as a CMS

I do not know anything about Sharepoint, and my company is rolling it out in a few departments. I am familiar with the workings and usage of Oracle (Stellent) CMS (for storing docs with meta-data, searching for docs, etc), and I am asking if I may use Sharepoint in a similar way? Can I programmatically upload docs to Sharepoint, from a java web application, and do searches and doc retrieval?
