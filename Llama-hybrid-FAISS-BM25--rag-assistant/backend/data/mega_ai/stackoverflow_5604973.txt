Method for rendering simple HTML fragments

I am writing an Android app for accessing StackExchange and I am looking for the best way to handle rendering the simple HTML fragments used in the StackExchange API. The only HTML in the API are in the bodies of questions, answers, and comments. Comments, of course, use a more restricted subset of HTML. Most of the HTML is just simple formatting like , , , etc. but there are also and the occasional tag to deal with. I was considering just trying to use a TextView and replace the HTML with styling, but that might be too restrictive. I took a look at WebView, but that almost seems overkill. WebViews seem to be for loading external dynamic content and start multiple threads. I'm only planning on rendering simple, fixed HTML provided in the API which does not include any CSS or JavaScript. Also, I'm having an encoding issue with WebViews where characters like curly quotes show up as multiple characters where they display fine when used in a TextView.
