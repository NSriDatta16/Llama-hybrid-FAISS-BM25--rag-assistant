This is called the big O notation . This page shows you the most common sorting algorithms and their comparison expressed through big O. Computational complexity (worst, average and best number of comparisons for several typical test cases, see below). Typically, good average number of comparisons/operations is O(n log n) and bad is O(n^2) From http://www.softpanorama.org/Algorithms/sorting.shtml
