Evaluate integral using R

I need to evaluate $\displaystyle{\int_{1}^{1}\int_{1}^{1}\int_{1}^{1}(y)e^{x+}}dxdz}$ using in R. Here is my attempt: f The f function is defined at the beginning of the code. It takes a vector A of length 3 as input, and returns the value of the function at the point $(x,y,z) = (A[1], A[2], A[3])$ . The runif function is used to generate $N$ random numbers from a uniform distribution between 0 and 2. These numbers are used to sample points in the region of integration. The for loop then iterates over the random points, evaluating the function at each point and adding the result to a running sum. Finally, the average function value is calculated by dividing the sum by $N$ and multiplying by the volume of the region of integration, which is 8 in this case (since the region is a unit cube with sides of length 2). However, I'm getting 671.5147 and it's far from . (based on Wolfram Alpha). Anything wrong with the code? Which part is wrong or can be improved?
