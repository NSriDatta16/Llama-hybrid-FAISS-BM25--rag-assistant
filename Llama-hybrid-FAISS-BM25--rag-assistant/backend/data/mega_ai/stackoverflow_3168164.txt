May I suggest you take a look at the cron_schedule table of your database ? As soon as the cron.php file has been called (should it be via crontab or via a browser request), there must be a line added to the table. The line is "newsletter_send_all". If a previous "neswsletter_send_all" was scheduled it should be run and its status set to "success" and the new one to "pending". Or, if there's a problem, the warning message is stored in the cron_schedule table on the same line as the newsletter_send_all that failed. If when running cron.php the cron_schedule table is not appended with a new line, there may be a problem with the config.xml file of the Newsletter module or with your cron settings in the admin configuration. About that last subject see : http://www.jnorton.co.uk/blog/setting-magento-cron-system All the above may give you a few tracks.
