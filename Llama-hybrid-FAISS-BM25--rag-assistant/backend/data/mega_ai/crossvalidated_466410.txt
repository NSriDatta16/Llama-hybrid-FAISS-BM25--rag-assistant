How does Random Forest split?

Random forests or random decision forests are an ensemble learning method for classification, regression, and other tasks that operate by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees. There are many Massive open online courses (MOOC) that will take directly the coding part in implementing the Random Forest Algorithm but no one will take you through the Math behind the algorithm. Could anyone explain how does it select the node to split?
