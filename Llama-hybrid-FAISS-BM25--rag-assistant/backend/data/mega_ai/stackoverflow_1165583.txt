linq to sql creating decimal type on my zip code field that should be int (I guess)

in the sql server database I have a field that is type "numeric". Precision is set to 18 in the database. when I create a linq to sql class it comes up as this: [Column(Storage="_zip", DbType="Decimal(18,0)")] public System.Nullable zip { Questions are: do you know why it would choose to my it Decimal. this is obviously not the way I want to store and view zip codes. what is the best format to store zip codes in my sql server database? any suggestions?
