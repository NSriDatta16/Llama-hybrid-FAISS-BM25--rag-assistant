Is there any way to put Android WIFI (droid handset) into promiscuous monitoring mode?

For a Computer Science Information Warfare class a few years ago I wrote a python script that ran on libpcap promiscuous packet capture files to parse out facebook chat traffic (earlang tuples passed in clear text), and thought an interesting project would be to port the program to Android. I would like to rewrite it in Java but can't find any information about packet capturing directly on the handset.
