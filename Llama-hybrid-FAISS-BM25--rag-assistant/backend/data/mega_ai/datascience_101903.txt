Since you have labeled training data, it is a supervised machine learning problem. It is a text classification problem, given document inputs train a model that will later predict what group new documents belong to. There are a variety of machine learning algorithms to solve this problem. Common options are Naive Bayes and Deep Learning. It is clearer if the data structured like this: Data Label / Target Doc 1 "A" Doc 2 "B" Doc 3 "A" Doc 4 "C"
