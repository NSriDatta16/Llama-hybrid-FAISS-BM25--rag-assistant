Learning the raw mathematics behind VAR modelling to implement it myself

I have recently been using R, along with the very handy vars package, to model time series and generate forecasting based on the results it produces. I have found a fairly accurate way to model my data with it after spending some time configuring it. Using R is handy, but as a software developer, I now desire to implement it into one of my projects that uses a different language. This requires me to learn how the modeling works at the most basic mathematical level. I have prior experience with regression and statistics, but am newer to time series modelling. Because of this, I have searched the internet for resources that will help me learn to essentially do this modelling by hand so that I know how to implement it elsewhere. Unfortunately, most resources just specify to use the existing R package, or another software such as Minitab. Additionally, the documentation for the vars package is quite complex and reads as gibberish to me, and I am not fluent enough in R to be able to port the raw source code of the package itself. tl;dr I am looking for resources (books, courses, etc) that will teach me the fundamentals of vector autoregression modelling without the use of preexisting software implementations. Starting from the very beginning (learning AR, ARIMA, etc) is perfectly acceptable. I just want to know how it works and why.
