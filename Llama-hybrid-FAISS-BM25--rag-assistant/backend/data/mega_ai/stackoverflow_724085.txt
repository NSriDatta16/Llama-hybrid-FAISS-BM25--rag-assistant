Events - naming convention and style

I'm learning about Events / Delegates in C#. Could I ask your opinion on the naming/coding style I've chosen (taken from the Head First C# book)? Am teaching a friend about this tomorrow, and am trying to come up with the most elegant way of explaining the concepts. (thought the best way to understand a subject is to try and teach it!) class Program { static void Main() { // setup the metronome and make sure the EventHandler delegate is ready Metronome metronome = new Metronome(); // wires up the metronome_Tick method to the EventHandler delegate Listener listener = new Listener(metronome); metronome.OnTick(); } } public class Metronome { // a delegate // so every time Tick is called, the runtime calls another method // in this case Listener.metronome_Tick public event EventHandler Tick; public void OnTick() { while (true) { Thread.Sleep(2000); // because using EventHandler delegate, need to include the sending object and eventargs // although we are not using them Tick(this, EventArgs.Empty); } } } public class Listener { public Listener(Metronome metronome) { metronome.Tick += new EventHandler(metronome_Tick); } private void metronome_Tick(object sender, EventArgs e) { Console.WriteLine("Heard it"); } } n.b. Code is refactored from http://www.codeproject.com/KB/cs/simplesteventexample.aspx
