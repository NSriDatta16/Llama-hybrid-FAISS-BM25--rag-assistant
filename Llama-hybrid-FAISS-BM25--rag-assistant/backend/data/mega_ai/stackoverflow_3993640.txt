The short answer is YES. But you should keep in mind that duplication may become a trouble or even nightmare of your system development and maintenance. If you want to store some pre-calculated cache values to improve performance, the calculation process of cache should be encapsulated and transparent to other processes. In this case: Solution 1: When one user votes on the poll, the detailed information will be recorded, and the vote count should be increased one automatically. (i.e. the cache calculation is encapsulated in data-writer process). Solution 2: When the vote imformation is recoreded, nothing to do on the vote count, only a flag will be changed to mark the vote count value as dirty now. When the vote count is read, if its value is dirty, calculate it and update its value and the flag; if its value is latest (not dirty), read it directly. (i.e. the cache calculation is encapsulated in data-reader process). Read Section 7 of the famous book The Pragmatic Programmer , you may get some ideas. Actually, the Normal Forms used in database design is a special case of the DRY principle.
