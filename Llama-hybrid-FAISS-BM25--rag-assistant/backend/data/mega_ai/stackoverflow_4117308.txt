NSAttributedString: wrapping + truncation

I have a view that draws multicolored text inside UITableViewCell. To draw multicolored text I'm using NSAttributedString However, I would like to make it so that if the text is too long to fit into the view, the last visible line is truncated to display an ellipsis at its end. Obviously this is very easy to do when drawing only a single line, as you can just set kCTLineBreakByTruncatingTail for the line break mode of the paragraph style. The problem is that I want my text to wrap to fill the rectangle, and then only have the last line truncated with an ellipsis - setting the line break mode confines the whole text to one line. Does anybody have any ideas of how I would go about this? Many thanks in advance for any suggestions, JC.
