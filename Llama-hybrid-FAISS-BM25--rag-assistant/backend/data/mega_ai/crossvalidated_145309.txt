Can you leave out more than one dummy variable to have more than one variables in the reference category?

For example, in the simple OLS regression: $y = a + b_1x_1 + ... + b_kx_k + \varepsilon$ if your dummy variable $d$ has 10 categories, could you include just one dummy variable for instance: $y = a + b_1x_1 + ... + b_kx_k + B_1d_1 + \varepsilon$ and even interact with just one dummy variable for instance: $y = a + b_1x_1 + ... + b_kx_k + B_1d_1 + B_2d_1x_1 + \varepsilon$ If this is possible, is the interpretation of $B_1$ the effect of being in the $d_1$ category relative to all other categories (and what does this quite mean - I think it is the average distance between the slopes of the other categories with the $d_1$ category?) Likewise, would this make the interpretation of $B_2$ the additional effect of $x_1$ from being in the $d_1$ category relative to all other categories?
