Bayesian complexity tests

I have seen an apparently interesting quantity called the Bayesian complexity, which in this case is defined as $-2(\overline{\ln\mathfrak{L}} - \ln\mathfrak{L}_\mathrm{max})$. I am not sure what this is used for. I.e., what sorts of tests can be made on this quantity and what does it imply?
