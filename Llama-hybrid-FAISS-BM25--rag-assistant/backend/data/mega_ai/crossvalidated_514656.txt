MLE is informed entirely by the likelihood and MAP is informed by both prior and likelihood. Both methods return point estimates for parameters via calculus-based optimization. MLE comes from frequentist statistics where practitioners let the likelihood "speak for itself." Whereas MAP comes from Bayesian statistics where prior beliefs (usually informed by domain knowledge of parameters) effectively regularize the point estimate. Note: MAP, while Bayesian, is atypical of Bayesian philosophy. Bayesian statistics generally treats parameters, themselves, as distributions as opposed to point estimates. Sampling techniques such as MCMC, or newer methods like variational inference can help approximate the distribution.
