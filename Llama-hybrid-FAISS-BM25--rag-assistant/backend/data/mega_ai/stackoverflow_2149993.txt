I ran a very small and unscientific test and found there to be roughly no difference between having a catch that never gets called or having it outside a try catch statement. I ran each of these two scripts 5 times each through my profiler and averaged the total times. Results With Try/Catch statement: 1.34 seconds Without Try/Catch statement: 1.3 seconds The Code Try/Catch No Try/Catch
