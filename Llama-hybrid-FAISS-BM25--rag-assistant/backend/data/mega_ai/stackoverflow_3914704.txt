Well in the first case of course you get 5 slices from the same texture. Think about what you are doing. Take a y coordinate of 0.6. (1 - 0.6) = 0.4 mod( 0.4, 0.2 ) = 0.0 0.0 + 0.2 = 0.2 Basically you force the y coordinate to be in the range 0.2 to 0.4 which will always be image1. I'm not sure why you are seeing image2 though ... As for the 2nd case ... this heavily implies that the texture coord you are receiving is wrong. So .. do you want to show us the vertex shader as well as this fragment shader? I have to admit, though, I can't understand why you don't just put the 5 slices into a single texture and just render it ...
