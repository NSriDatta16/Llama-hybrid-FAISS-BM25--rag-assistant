Am I missing some important fact about interning symbols in LISP?

To be brief. Here is my several tries to intern and use a symbol in clisp. [1]> (setq sym (intern "foo")) |foo| [2]> (eq sym 'foo) NIL Why??? [3]> (defun internup (me &optional (package *package*)) (intern (string-upcase me) package)) INTERNUP [4]> (eq 'abc (internup "abc")) T Probably must be upcase. [12]>(let ((abc 2)) (eval '(+ 2 abc))) *** - EVAL: variable ABC has no value The following restarts are available: ok [18]> (let ((abc 2)) (eval '(+ 2 'abc))) *** - +: ABC is not a number The following restarts are available: Interesting. Should I set it before. [14]> (setq a (internup "abc")) ABC [15]> (let ((abc 2)) (eval '(+ 2 a))) *** - +: ABC is not a number The following restarts are available: And again wrong. Hmm I must be missing some important fact about interning symbols in LISP. Can you help me ?
