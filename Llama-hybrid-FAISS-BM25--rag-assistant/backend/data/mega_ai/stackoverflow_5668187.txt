Downloading VM from VMWare ESX to VMWare player, preserving thin storage format

I'm using ESX 4.1 and want to download VM's to run on VMWare Player (v3.1.3). I'm able to download and run them, but the space on the virtual disk files, which are in "thin format" expands to the full provisioned storage size. How do I make the download preserve the thin format, or re-compact the virtual disk file once it's downloaded?
