In trying to compare two population means by looking at the difference in sample means, there may be three criteria to consider. 1) Practical importance. If you're wondering whether a method of helping people lose weight is effective, you might have a huge number of subjects. Then you might get a very small P-value, and so a "highly significant" difference. But if the actual average weight loss of a group of subjects who used the method for a month was 1/2 lb (or 1/4 kg), you might decide that even though the effect of the method may be significant, it is too small to be of practical importance. Whether a real difference is of practical importance is a judgment to be made by people who are familiar with the measurements and with the practical effect of a change. 2) Statistical significance. Statistical significance is often judged by looking at the P-value of the test. It is the probability of a result more extremely different from the null hypothesis. If this probability is very small (say, below 5% or 1%) you can say that the departure from the null hypothesis is 'statistically significant' (at the chosen level). In the weight loss example, you might have a small group of subjects with an average weight loss of 22 lbs (10 kg). If real, that amount of weight loss might be of practical importance. But for a small group of people, the significance level might not show a significant decrease in weight. Then you might have anecdotal evidence that the method worked well for a few people, but not enough evidence to be generally convincing to people who care about statistical significance. 3) Measures of effect size. Cohen's $d$ is one of a number of proposed measures of effect size. Roughly speaking it measures the difference obtained by looking at a difference between two means in terms of the number of standard deviations that difference represents. It is often used in two-sample tests, so that $d = \frac{\bar X_{\mathrm{trt}}-\bar X_{\mathrm{ctr;}}}{S},$ where $s$ is an estimate of the standard deviation based on the two samples. In (1) "practical importance" may be judged by experts on the kind of data involved. Cohen's $d$ can be used as a fixed standard of what practical importance may mean. If the observed difference between treatment and control groups is half a standard deviation $(d \approx 1/2),$ then the effect may be interpreted as moderate in size; if $ d \approx 1,$ then the effect may be interpreted as large or very large. In a weight loss study, subjects who are carefully screened and about equally motivated may yield very similar weight losses, giving a small $s$ and inflating $d.$ Then people who know and care about typical weight losses may have differences of opinion about the usefulness of Cohen's $d.$ Consider a two-sample t test on (simulated) data for $n_1 = n_2 = 500$ treatment and control subjects with weight losses x.trt and x.ctrl . Welch Two Sample t-test data: x.trt and x.ctrl t = 24.559, df = 995.12, p-value Here the observed difference in sample means is about 4.83 lbs., and Cohen's $d$ is about 1.5. The difference is very highly significant, and Cohen's $d$ is large, but people who know and care about weight loss may argue whether a difference in weight loss of less than 5 lbs. is of practical importance.
