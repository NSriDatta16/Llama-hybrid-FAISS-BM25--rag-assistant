Who gives good advanced Silverlight 4 courses?

I've been trying to find a good advanced Silverlight 4 course, but can't really find anything. I've found this: http://www.develop.com/training-course/silverlight-4 But the most interesting topics are only talked about in the course material, not in the actual course. The extra topics from this course which is of particular interest, are: Working with Files: local files, Isolated Storage, data files, zip files. Extensibility: working with MEF to build extensible applications PRISM: using PRISM (Composite Application Guidance) to structure Silverlight applications Also: Test driven development with Silverlight would be good to learn better. Does anyone know anyone who gives good courses which include these topics? I'm not a total Silverlight newbie, but not an expert either. Preferably the course will be held in Europe or Eastern USA.
