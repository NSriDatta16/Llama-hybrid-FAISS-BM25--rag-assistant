Comparing two means from the same participants

I have a question on comparing two means (from categories A and B). All the measurements were taken once from a single group (30 participants). The experiment applied 100 stimuli to each participant. When prompted, participants produced either A or B for each stimulus (that is, for a given stimulus, some participants produced A and some, B). All participants were exposed to the same stimuli. The duration of the productions of A and B were measured in milliseconds (ms). Thus, I have a table that looks like this: This is the summary table showing the number of category A and B collected, the mean and the standard deviation for each category. I would like to compare those two means and see whether they are significantly different and thus determine whether duration plays a role or not on how to tease categories A and B apart. My understanding is that I could use a t-test but Iâ€™m confused about which one would be the most appropriate for my case. The data come from a single group of people, but it is not paired since the measurements were taken once and also each person produced a different number of As and Bs. Should I use an independent t-test? (but my understanding is that it compares the averages of two samples that were selected independently of each other). Thanks.
