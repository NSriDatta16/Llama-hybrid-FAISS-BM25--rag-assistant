Creating and destroying lots of objects really quickly doesn't necessarily mean heap fragmentation. Often, if the objects are of the same size, then the space freed by one can be allocated for the next. Often, even just as an optimization, a program might not free and delete memory for objects, but keep old ones in a pool and simply grab one and overwrite the contents to create a 'new' object.
