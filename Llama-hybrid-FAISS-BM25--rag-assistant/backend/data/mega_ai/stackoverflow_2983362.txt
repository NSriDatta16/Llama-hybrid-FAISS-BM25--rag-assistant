It works by using Event.addNativePreviewHandler(NativePreviewHandler handler) But there are some things to consider: The handler is not restricted to a widget. It is global for your application. If you change widgets you might have to register and unregister the handler manually. There are browser differences with keyboard events. Some browsers send keyDown- and keyPress-Events, others just keyDown-Events. To work around the second issue you can get the name of the browser using this code: private static native String getUserAgent() /*-{ return navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase(); }-*/;
