Help me understand data output from R bayes glm model

I have been given a bunch of csv files which are ouputs of a bayesian glm model run. I have minimal understanding on machine learning, so apologies beforehand. I'd like to understand what the variables in each column mean, since that is important for my task. Here is a few first lines of a csv file: Genotype Beta SEBeta P pepP1__avg_access_sa_folded__x__hlaP.21__avg_access_sa_folded 0.492653351282333 0.133971382666172 0.000235713099632736 pepP2__avg_access_sa_folded__x__hlaP.21__avg_access_sa_folded 0.374252821916212 0.166440963798524 0.0245403780812961 pepP3__avg_access_sa_folded__x__hlaP.21__avg_access_sa_folded 0.128236595516439 0.144158623951455 0.373706477622523 pepP4__avg_access_sa_folded__x__hlaP.21__avg_access_sa_folded 0.265587277639511 0.135504095415586 0.0499964366890409 pepP5__avg_access_sa_folded__x__hlaP.21__avg_access_sa_folded -0.0678042568311556 0.147863754510041 0.646550877911669 I know what Genotype is, and I'm guessing P is the p value but if anyone knows what the rest are, I'd highly appreciate it.
