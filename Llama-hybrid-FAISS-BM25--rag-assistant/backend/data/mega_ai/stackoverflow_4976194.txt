You can use System.Windows.Analytics class to get systems stats.. It has a AverageProcessorLoad which you can use to get the current CPU usage(Value between 0 and 1) .And its for Silverlight only. You can simply use it like this: float averageCPUUsage = System.Windows.Analytics.AverageProcessorLoad; float myAppCPUUsage = System.Windows.Analytics.AverageProcessLoad;// Get cpu usage by your current app. Update But from Silverlight this is as far as we can go.. for RAM and Processor count you will need to have somthing installed on the client side itself to tell you.. from browser you can't.
