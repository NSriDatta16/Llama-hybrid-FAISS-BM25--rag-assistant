Gold Standard data for training but not validation

My goal is to determine which among the three classification algorithms perform better { Logist Reg or Neural Network or SVM } . I have a training dataset and the outcome variable y has been manually verified to determine which is true which not true. So I have a gold standard for this dataset. I have a validation dataset where the y has not been manually verified to determine which is true and which is not, so I dont have gold standard data for this validation dataset. How do compare the performance of these three algorithms under such conditions where I have gold standard for training data and not for validation data. Any pointers or suggestions are much appreciated.
