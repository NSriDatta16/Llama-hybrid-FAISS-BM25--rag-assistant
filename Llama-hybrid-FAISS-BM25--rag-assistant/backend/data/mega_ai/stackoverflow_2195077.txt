Not yet, but as soon as the new "virtual machine role" becomes available, you'll be able to configure your own virtual server(s) to support classic ASP. No timeline given AFAIK, but "soon" has been mentioned. These servers will run on the Azure hardware, but they won't run the Azure Guest OS 1.x, so you cannot easily use Azure features like Storage or AppFabric... then again, you might not want to from a classic ASP environment :-) EDIT : at the time of asking my answer was correct (there was no full IIS available), but a lot has changed, so the answer in 2012 would definitely be "yes", as detailed below.
