why my webpages can't break line in Iphone browser?

This is my website for mobiles to visit : m.looa.com If you got an Iphone,please visit it and you will find that the words don't break line . This only happens in Iphone's browser, it looks fine for android and almost all browsers for PC,including IE Chrome FireFox and even Safari(you can try that). I know this must have something to do with CSS but I can't figure out where the problem lies . Below is the code from my webpage,please pay attention to the class : middigest,I think that probably is where the problem lies(I have delete some code to make it more clear): 北京 收藏夹 距离 0.0km 商家 纯视觉摄影工作室 性感翘臀，迷人水腰，诱人S曲线，这一站就是你 现价 3 元 原价 264元 购买 1人 网站 团宝网 剩余 6天9小时 ************* Repeat ***************** and the CSS related is : .middigest {word-break:normal;float:left;width:98%;line-height:17px;font-weight:bold;padding:6px 0 8px 0;clear:both;margin:0 1%;} also,if you want to see the whole CSS,please go to http://m.looa.com/theme/mobile/img/style.css Anyone of you has the experience of web developing for Iphone ? Give me a hand please. Thanks so much !!!
