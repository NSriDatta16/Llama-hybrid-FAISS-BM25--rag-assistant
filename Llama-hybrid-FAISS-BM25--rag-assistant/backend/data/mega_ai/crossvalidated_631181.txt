the best position You could say that the best position is the position where we have the largest probability of a goal. That is $$p(goal|x,y)$$ With a Bayesian approach you would compute $$p(goal|x,y,data)$$ and you could have some parametric model that describes $p(goal|x,y)$ based on a few parameters $\beta_i$ for which we have prior distributions. Then based on the data we can update the distributions for those variables and compute the posterior. $$f(\beta|data) \propto f(data|\beta) f(\beta)$$ with the given $f(\beta|data)$ you can describe also $p(goal|x,y,data)$ and figure out which place is the best. The computations are not easy and the choice of model with coëfficiënts $\beta$ and their prior is subjective. I would go instead with MattF's comment and just compute at every point x,y the frequency of goals for all attempts within a certain range.
