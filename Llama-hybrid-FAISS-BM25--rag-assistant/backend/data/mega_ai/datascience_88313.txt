To help you find other resources, this is commonly referred to as "Missing Not At Random." Some models, like xgboost, handle missing values inherently, making tree splits at a real value but then choosing which branch to send the missing values along. (Other implementations of CART don't do that, and the Quinlan family of trees does something entirely different.) For other models, I'd recommend adding a "missingness indicator" feature and then imputing. For linear models especially, the coefficient on the original feature can fit to the "real" slope, while the coefficient on the indicator "fixes" for the missing values (and whatever imputation you use). See e.g. this stats.SE answer .
