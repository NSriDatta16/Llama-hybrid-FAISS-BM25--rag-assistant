I've asked a question on the nvidia forums recently which might be related to this: link Unfortunately I didn't get a real answer to my questions but managed to do what I want to do, using a spring in the joint might help you here if you only add a damping constant without a spring constant. This works in my case but I can't explain why so while I'm happy to use it I'm not totally sure whether to recommend it. I don't know whether you could also add angular damping to all of the individual parts of the ragdoll, that would make them slow down quicker after they've started moving but it might not look right. Probably one of those things you will have to experiment with.
