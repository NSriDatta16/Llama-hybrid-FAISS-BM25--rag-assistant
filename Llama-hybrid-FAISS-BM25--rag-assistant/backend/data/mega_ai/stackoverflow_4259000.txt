Browser support of drag and drop file uploads

I can't seem to find it online anywhere, just demos or links to the spec, or the Google Gears implementation. That's all great, but I was curious what the actual browser support of it is across the main browsers AND OS. Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera, and does IE have an alternative? What about IE9?
