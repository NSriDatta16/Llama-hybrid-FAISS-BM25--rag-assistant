You could calculate the minimum detectable effect (MDE) for the average treatment effect (ATE) under the assumption that your outcome $Y$ is normally distributed. Then $$\text{MDE} = \sqrt{\frac{\widehat{\text{Var}(Y)}}{n}}\sqrt{\frac{1}{p(1-p)}}\left( q_{1-\frac{\alpha}{2}}+q_\lambda\right)$$ where $\widehat{\text{Var}(Y)}$ is the estimated variance of the outcome, $n$ is the sample size, $p$ is the fraction of program participants, $q_{1-\frac{\alpha}{2}}$ and $q_{\lambda}$ are the $1-\frac{\alpha}{2}^{th}$ and $\lambda^{th}$ quantiles of the standard normal distribution; $\alpha$ is the level and $\lambda$ is the desired power which are chosen by you. Typical choices are $\alpha = 0.05$ and $\lambda = 0.2$. In terms of participation (number of treated relative to untreated), the MDE is the smallest when $p=0.5$, i.e. when you have the same number of treated and untreated individuals. The MDE also decreases when you increase the sample size $n$. All of this is easily done in your case. The term $\sqrt{\frac{\widehat{\text{Var}(Y)}}{n}}$ is the standard error of your treatment parameter, $p$ you can calculate from your data, and the above quantiles of the standard normal distribution are $q_{1-\frac{\alpha}{2}} = 1.96$ and $q_{\lambda} = 0.85$ for $\alpha = 0.05$ and $\lambda = 0.2$. Then if you find that your treatment effect is smaller than the MDE, $\beta
