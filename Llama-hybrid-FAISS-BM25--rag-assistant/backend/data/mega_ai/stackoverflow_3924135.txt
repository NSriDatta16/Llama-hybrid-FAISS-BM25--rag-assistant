I have lots of questions about c++ that are really confusing me

I started learning c++ about 3 weeks ago after 2 years of java. It seems so different but im getting there. my lecturer is a lovely guy but any time i ask a question as to why something is that way or this way. he just responds "because it is". Theres lots of comments in the code below with a few random questions, but the main problem is im getting two build errors, one says the arraytotal has not been initialized (even though i found a value for it) and the other says an external reference in main. would anyone mind reading the code and answering a few comments within, and maybe the overall problem im having? #include #include #include using namespace std; //double decimals[5] ={2,4,6,8,10}; const int arraySize = 5; // does an arraySize have to be const always? is it so it doesnt channge after the array has been created? //double decimals[arraySize]; /* this array is being created in the function averageN() but why? cant i just create it up top and reference it in? */ // why do you have to write the name of the function up here before you even create it? double averageN(); int main() { averageN(); return 0; } // why does the array have to be created here? double averageN(double decimals[arraySize]) { double average; double arrayTotal; for (int i = 0; i
