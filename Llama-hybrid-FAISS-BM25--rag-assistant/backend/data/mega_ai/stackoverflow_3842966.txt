Building an index table from a MySQL database with PHP

Using MySQL and PHP; I'm trying to build an index that contains the averages from table_1 grouped by: type, name, hour, day, month, year So I need to know which combination's of values are in table_1 so I know what to put in my AVG() queries. What I want is to figure out all the different combination's that can be made when comparing the following rows in the table: type name hour day month year Here's an example of table_1: ID|type|name|location|amount|year|month|day_num|day|hour|minute|second 1|car|ben|1|1.00|2010|10|01|Friday|03|05|45 1|car|bob|1|3.00|2010|10|01|Friday|04|05|45 2|cow|bob|2|2.00|2009|07|12|Sunday|09|10|12 2|cow|ben|2|4.00|2009|07|12|Sunday|10|10|12 So what I would end up with is: type|name|year|month|day|hour car|ben|2010|10|01|Friday|03 car|bob|2010|10|01|Friday|04 cow|bob|2009|07|12|Sunday|09 cow|ben|2009|07|12|Sunday|10 How would I format a query to do that?
