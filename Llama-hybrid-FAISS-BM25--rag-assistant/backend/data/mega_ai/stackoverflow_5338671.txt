Two points come to my attention: Did you set the DrawMode to DrawMode.OwnerDrawFixed or DrawMode.OwnerDrawVariable , as stated in the documentation ? You seem to be drawing the text directly over the image. Why do you use e.Bounds in DrawString instead of a rectangle that starts a little bit to the right? E.g. something like: Dim rect As New Rectangle(e.Bounds.X + 16, e.Bounds.Y, _ e.Bounds.Width - 16, e.Bounds.Height) ' use rect instead of e.Bounds in DrawString BTW, you shouldn't forget to call DrawBackground and DrawFocusRectange as seen in the example in the documentation .
