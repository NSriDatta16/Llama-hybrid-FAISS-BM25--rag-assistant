Cool question. To me this looks like a regression problem with interactions. As @Raphael (did I mention correctly? how does it work?) mentioned above it's not a linear sum problem. for example an overpowered character may force the probability to 1, but averaging reduces the probability. A second example would be (I don't know the games so don't judge me :P) that a team with no healers has a lower probability of winning, so adding a healer would increase the probability. But a team of all healers is no good either. So we know it's not a summation problem, and we know that interactions are important. and what we want to find is the following: $P(win|c_1,c_2,c_3,c_4,c_5)$ where $c_i$ are the 5 characters. One way to do it is to assume that $P(c_i)$ is a function with interactions of the following form: $P = a_0 + a_1*c_1 + a_2*c2 ... a_n*c_n + b_{1,2}*c_1*c_2 + b_{1,3}*c_1*c_3... + b_{n,n}*c_n*c_n$ where $a_0$ is a bias term, $c_i$ are indicator variables (0 or 1) for each character and $a_i$ are their coefficients. a second interaction term for each character pair is also added and represented by coefficients $b_{i,j}$ . which can easily be interpreted as a matrix and $a_i$ a vector. so in Einstein notation we can write it as: $P = a_0 + a_i*c_i + b_{i,j}*c_i*c_j$ we now want to find the missing coefficients that optimize our problem. We can further force it to be a valid probability by making it a logistic regression: $P = \frac{1}{1+e^{-(a_0 + a_i*c_i + b_{i,j}*c_i*c_j)}}$ And a final version I'd suggest would be to use a factorization machine, where we replace the indicator variables by a vector of coefficients (an embedding) that we optimize: $P = \frac{1}{1+e^{-(a_0 + \Sigma_i a_i*c_i + \Sigma_{i,j} e_i^Te_j*c_i*c_j)}}$ where $a_0$ is a constant, $e_i, e_j$ are the embeddings of the i'th and j'th characters and $c_i,c_j$ are the indicator variables, T is transpose. we now loop over all 5 added characters, so when having 5 healers we'll have: $P = \frac{1}{1+e^{-(a_0 + 5*a_{healer} + 5e_{healer}^Te_{healer}}}$ If necessary we can add 3rd order terms. Here for example if having multiple healers is a bad thing, the interaction will be negative and the more healers we'll have the worse the probability will become. That's my 2 cents.
