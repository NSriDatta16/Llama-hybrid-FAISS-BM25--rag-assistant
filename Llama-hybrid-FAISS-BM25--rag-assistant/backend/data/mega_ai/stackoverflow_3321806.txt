If you know the type, you should be able to Reflect on the type and get all the information you need. Type.GetMembers would probably be your best bet. You may need a second call to get any static methods as well: var instanceMembers = typeof(Color) .GetMembers(BindingFlags.Instance | BindingFlags.Public); var staticMembers = typeof(Color) .GetMembers(BindingFlags.Static | BindingFlags.Public); Each MemberInfo object will be able to tell you the MemberType (Property, Field, Method, Event, etc.) Just use the instanceMembers when the user types a variable (like c in your example) followed by . and use the staticMembers when the user types a type name (like Color in your example) followed by . .
