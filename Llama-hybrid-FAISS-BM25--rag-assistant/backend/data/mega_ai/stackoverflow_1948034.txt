With Grails you have a few options to validate the model: You can write a setter for the emailAddress that converts it to a consistent case: public void setEmailAddress(email){ emailAddress = email } A more involved but correct answer would be to create a custom editor ( PropertySupportEditor ) that will handle the normalization for you automatically. You will also would want to write a custom validator to ensure that Grails' validation fails if the emailAddress is not correctly normalized. If you wanted to make it really elegant you could make the validator into a reusable constrtaint using the constraints plugin which could result in something like this: static constraints = { emailAddress(normalizedEmail:true) }
