You want the data in a format optimal for analysis, not work on your raw data. Clustering is expensive, and the performance overhead of working on multiple tables will usually make it unacceptably slow. You need to carefully preprocess the data to guide your algorithm. Just running k-means on age, transaction amount will return garbage results. And of course, preprocessing requires a copy of the data. You also need to aggregate the data appropriately. If you want to cluster transactions, then a simple "join" may be okay. But to cluster customers, you need to find an appropriate aggregation (read: "feature engineering") of your data, one row per customer. All of above steps provide good reasons to copy your data from your storage format (e.g. SQL tables) into a separate analysis format (e.g. CSV files) to load into your analysis tool (e.g. sklearn, R, ELKI, Weka).
