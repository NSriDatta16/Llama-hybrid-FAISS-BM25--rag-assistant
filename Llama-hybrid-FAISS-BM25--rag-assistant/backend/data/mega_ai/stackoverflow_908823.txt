I would consider using the built in Cache (System.Web.Caching.Cache) That way you can store them where ever you want (say in a database), change them from within the app easily, and have quick and cheap retrieval. From within a class which inherits from BasePage use the given Cache object (eg Cache.Add(..)) and from elsewhere use HttpContext.Current.Cache (eg. HttpContext.Current.Cache.Remove(Key))
