User forms authentication in JSF

I'm a novice at JSF and I got a couple of questions concerning organizing user authentication there. 1) How can i redirect the registered user to a welcome page (for example welcome.xhtml)? I heard about using Filter or navigation-rule tag, but i didn't found a full-blown tutorial of how it works. 2) How can i tell the server that unauthorized users can access not only the login page but also the registration page? Is there an analog for ASP.NET web.config tag or something like this?
