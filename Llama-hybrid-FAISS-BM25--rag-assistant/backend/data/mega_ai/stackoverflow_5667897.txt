First you need to convert the MySQL time to a unix timestamp which is what most of php date functions use. If you are using MySQLs DateTime type, you can perform the conversion in SQL with the MySQL function unix_timestamp() mysql date functions . Or you can convert the mysql date to a unix timestamp in PHP with the strtotime($mysqlDateTime) function php strtotime function once you have the unix timestamp of the time you would like to format, the conversion would look something like this (86400 is number of seconds in 24 hours): function displayDate($timestamp) { $secAgo = time() - $timestamp; // 1 day if ($secAgo This method has the benefit of not requiring extra object creation in PHP (a tad slow) or performing unnecessary calculations on the SQL server. It might also help to know that MySQL's timestamp type stores data as a unix timestamp (number of seconds since Jan 1 1970) value requiring only 32bits for storage compared to datetime which uses 64bits of storage. 32 bits should be enough for everyone, until 2038 or something....
