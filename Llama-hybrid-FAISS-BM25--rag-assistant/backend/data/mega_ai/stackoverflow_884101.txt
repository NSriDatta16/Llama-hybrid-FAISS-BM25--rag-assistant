Being an architect is nothing more than a state of mind. There are potentially bad connotations that come along with having status of Architect . Particularly because nobody can truly answer the question, "What is an architect?" First and foremost... Does this mean one draws up solutions but does not really implement them? If so, that is something to work towards I guess... but how does one work towards it by just "drawing up solutions"? Practical experience is prerequisite and must. A truly good programmer ultimately has good problem solving skills. A good problem solver ultimately knows how to construct good solutions. In my opinion, if one focuses on becoming an excellent programmer , the problem solving skills naturally start to develop. It's unavoidable that this will get recognized. Once recognized, people will start to ask for opinions on the best ways to solve problem X . When one starts getting asked these types of questions, one inherently become an architect. In corporate organizations, one can move up to this state of mind and potentially have a physical title (and potential pay) to represent this state of mind. But we must not forget that it requires ACTUAL development of good solutions to problems. This is what ultimately brings us to this state of mind. In the end, it's just a word that tells very little behind the person carrying the title.
