Mono is mostly compatible with .NET (see here ) and has a development environment similar to Visual Studio called MonoDevelop. We've used it a little bit at work as an experiment to see if we could build and run our Windows services and websites under Linux. We experienced mixed success, but your mileage may vary. Most of the build problems were caused by Linux filesystems being case-sensitive. Apart from that it was quite easy to get things going, save for getting licensed components to work (licensing is a bit tricky as MonoDevelop has no built-in support for it). However, simply drag-dropping a pre-built Windows application to the Linux host allowed us to run it just by clicking the EXE, and it worked like a charm.
