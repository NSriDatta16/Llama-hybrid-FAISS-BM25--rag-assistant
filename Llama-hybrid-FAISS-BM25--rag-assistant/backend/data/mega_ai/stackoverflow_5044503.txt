I took a look at the code base and it looks like the way that plugin is programmed, it will not support the use case you're describing. It lumps the modifier keys ( shift , alt , etc.) together as a special case, which allows you to create combinations involving mod keys. It doesn't support multiple standard keys, however. I would suggest you ask the plugin developer to add this feature in a future release. In the mean time, you can either adapt your goals to fit this plugin, try modifying the plugin yourself, or write custom code for this special case. By the way, the code isn't particularly complicated so you should definitely take a gander. Maybe you'll see something I don't. The plugin file .
