goals in cobertura plugin for maven 2 independent of each other?

in the cobertura plugin for maven 2 , are all the goals exclusive of each other ? as in .. what i want is that there should be a check as well as there should be report generation , when i use the cobertura goal in my build , check is not done .. when i use the check goal , reports are not generated , i had to use both goals to get what i desire , but then it runs the tests as many times .. this is what i am doing org.codehaus.mojo cobertura-maven-plugin 93 88 html verify cobertura check or is it that i am doing something wrong ?
