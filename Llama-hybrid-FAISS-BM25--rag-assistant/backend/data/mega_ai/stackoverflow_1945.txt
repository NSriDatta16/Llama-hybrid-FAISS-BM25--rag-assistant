Are there any more specific details on the kind of distortion? If, for example, your latitudes and longitudes are "distorted" onto your 2D map using a Mercator projection, the conversion math is readily available . If the map is distorted truly arbitrarily, there are lots of things you could try, but the simplest would probably be to compute a weighted average from your existing point mappings. Your weights could be the squared inverse of the x/y distance from your new point to each of your existing points. Some pseudocode: estimate-latitude-longitude (x, y) numerator-latitude := 0 numerator-longitude := 0 denominator := 0 for each point, deltaX := x - point.x deltaY := y - point.y distSq := deltaX * deltaX + deltaY * deltaY weight := 1 / distSq numerator-latitude += weight * point.latitude numerator-longitude += weight * point.longitude denominator += weight return (numerator-latitude / denominator, numerator-longitude / denominator) This code will give a relatively simple approximation. If you can be more precise about the way the projection distorts the geographical coordinates, you can probably do much better.
