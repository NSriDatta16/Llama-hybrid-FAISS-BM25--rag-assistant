"When you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail." Regular expressions are a very useful tool; but I agree that they're not necessary for every single place they're used. One positive factor to them is that because they tend to be complex and very heavily used where they are, the algorithms to apply regular expressions tend to be rather well optimized. That said, the overhead involved in learning the regular expressions can be... high. Very high. Are regular expressions the best tool to use for every applicable situation? Probably not, but on the other hand, if you work with string validation and search all the time, you probably use regular expressions a lot; and once you do, you already have the knowledge necessary to use the tool probably more efficiently and quickly than any other tool. But if you don't have that experience, learning it is effectively a drag on your productivity for that implementation. So I think it depends on the amount of time you're willing to put into learning a new paradigm, and the level of rush involved in your project. Overall, I think regular expressions are very worth learning, but at the same time, that learning process can, frankly, suck.
