Any kind of "writer" object like TextWriter, XmlWriter, etc do some level of buffering as does the underlying stream which is entirely out of its control. In other words, you can't rely on the length of the underlying file to determine whether or not prior calls to the writer have been made. But specifically speaking, there is a Flush method available on many of the classes in System.IO such as Stream and TextWriter that can be used to push the buffered contents to disk but this makes for pretty fragile code, in my opinion. You should maintain some other kind of state to determine whether or not you have already written the start of the document.
