Welcome to CV. In your comment you say that your DV is ordinal and ask if any of the pictures show violation of OLS. When your DV is ordinal, you don't need pictures. OLS assumes that the DV is continuous. As Whuber noted, your first plot does show this, but interpreting that plot requires experience and expertise. I also noted that that plot should be blobby. That is, it shouldn't have patterns. But never mind that. Your DV is ordinal. Maybe a 7 point scale. OLS will make nonsensical predictions. None of the predicted values will be integers (although they might be close) and some might be below 1 or above 7. You should use ordinal logistic regression, at least as a starting point.
