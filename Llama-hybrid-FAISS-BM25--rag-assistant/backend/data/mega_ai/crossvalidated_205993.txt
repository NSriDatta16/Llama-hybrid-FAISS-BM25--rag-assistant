Yes, you can use xgb.cv like so: import xgboost as xgb d = xgb.DMatrix(X_train, label=y_train.label) p = {"learning_rate":0.05} res = xgb.cv(params = p, dtrain=d, num_boost_round=300, verbose_eval=50, metrics="rmse") And you'll get the metrics you're after per round and even their standard deviation cross-validated
