Here is a little expansion of my previous answer related to your chart viewer. there are many ways you may adapt it, but it should give you some ideas into solving your problem. rebol [] plot: [] data: reduce [ ] refresh: func [/local clr delta prev-pos pos] [ clear plot prev-pos: 0x300 foreach [clr delta] data [ pos: prev-pos + (delta * 0x1) + 7x0 append plot compose [ pen (clr) line (prev-pos) (pos) fill-pen (clr) pen none circle dot-size (pos) ] prev-pos: pos ] show panel1 ] add-data: func [i][loop i [append data reduce [(random white * .85) + (white * .15) (-20 + random 40)]] refresh] grid: [800 600] step-grid: 5 max-n-points: (grid/1 / step-grid) - 1 x-axis-border: 20 Y-margin: 10 X0: 5 grid-color: coal dot-size: 3 viewer-size: 800x580 ; open up console before vid window main: layout [ origin 20x0 space 1x1 field 800 panel1: box viewer-size black rate 30 effect [ line-pattern 4 4 grid 30x30 0x0 grid-color draw plot ] feel [ ;probe first panel1 over: func [face over? offset /local d][ panel1/pane: either over?

Better systems are obvious, but this is sufficient to illustrate what needs to be done to receive all mouse move events and act on them. Also note that the over feel receives Window offsets, so you must remove the face's offset to get the real face-relative coordinates. PS: The red arrow above, is my mouse cursor.
