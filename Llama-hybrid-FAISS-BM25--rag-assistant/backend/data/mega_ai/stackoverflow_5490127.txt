If the file is in the format given (i.e. using *), it'll be fairly easy to use bash pattern matching to compare this to the ip address. However, as @Mark Drago pointed out, this format anything except octet-boundary subnets, so if you need to support arbitrary subnet boundaries, you need a better format. Assuming you are using the "1.2.*" format, this should work: #!/bin/bash ip="$1" found_match=false while read subnet socks_port socks_ip; do if [[ "$ip" == $subnet ]]; then # this'll do glob-style pattern matching against $subnet echo "subnet=$subnet, socks_port=$socks_port, socks_ip=$socks_port" found_match=true break # assuming you don't want to check for multiple matches fi done
