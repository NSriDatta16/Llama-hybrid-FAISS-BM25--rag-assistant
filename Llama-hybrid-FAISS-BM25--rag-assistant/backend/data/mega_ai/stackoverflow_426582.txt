An IDE debugger lets you change the values of variables at run-time. An IDE debugger lets you see the value of variables you didn't know you wanted to see when execution began. An IDE debugger lets you see the call stack and examine the state of the function passed weird values. (think this function is called from hundreds of places, you don't know where these weird values are coming from) An IDE debugger lets you conditionally break execution at any point in code, based on a condition, not a line number. An IDE debugger will let you examine the state of the program in the case of an unhandled exception instead of just crapping out.
