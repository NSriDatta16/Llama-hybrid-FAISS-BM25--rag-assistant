It is definitely possible. What you want is called "capping". The documentation of UIImage has what you need. The function that you would want is: - (UIImage *)stretchableImageWithLeftCapWidth:(NSInteger)leftCapWidth topCapHeight:(NSInteger)topCapHeight You would call it on an instantiated image for your background and assign the result as your UITableViewCell background.
