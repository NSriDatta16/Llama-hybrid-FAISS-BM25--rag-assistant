Table view only appears after the app is restarted

Now my problem is not one but two, which are as follows: App Requirement: Input details of employees and click on Save button. the name of the employee should get added in the table view. Click on a single row, details should be displayed in the detail view. Problem 1: after clicking save button for the first time, it's displayed in the table view but from the next clicking, it's not displayed until and unless the app is relaunched. My code for this is as follows: (void)saveDetails{ EmployeeDetailsAppDelegate *appDelegate = (EmployeeDetailsAppDelegate *) [[UIApplication sharedApplication] delegate]; NSManagedObjectContext *context = [appDelegate managedObjectContext]; NSManagedObject *newDetails; newDetails = [NSEntityDescription insertNewObjectForEntityForName:@"Details" inManagedObjectContext:context]; [newDetails setValue:empID.text forKey:@"EmployeeID"]; [newDetails setValue:empName.text forKey:@"EmployeeName"]; [newDetails setValue:empDepartment.text forKey:@"EmployeeDepartment"]; empID.text = @""; empName.text = @""; empDepartment.text = @""; [[appDelegate rootViewController]addNewObject:empName.text]; NSError *error; [context save:&error]; [self dismissModalViewControllerAnimated:YES]; } Problem 2: This is basically not a problem but a query. On clicking a row in the table view, the employee department is displayed in the detail view. Now I want to display the employee id as well. How can I do that? My code for employee department display is: (void)tableView:(UITableView *)aTableView didSelectRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath { if([self.array count]){ dictionary = [self.array objectAtIndex:indexPath.row] ; if([dictionary objectForKey:@"EmployeeDepartment"]){ [dictionary objectForKey:@"EmployeeDepartment"]; NSString *empDep = [dictionary objectForKey:@"EmployeeDepartment"]; NSLog(@"Dep is %@",empDep); } } detailViewController.detailItem = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"Employee Department: %@",[dictionary objectForKey:@"EmployeeDepartment"]]; self.navigationItem.leftBarButtonItem.enabled = YES; } PS: This is for iPad with Core data used as storage.
