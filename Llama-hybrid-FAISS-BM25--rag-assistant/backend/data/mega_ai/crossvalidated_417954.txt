I think you want to do paired t test on dates, with the null hypothesis that on average dates agree against the alternative hypothesis that dates differ from DB 1 to DB 2 (earlier or later). Here is a 'power and sample size' analysis from Minitab. Lacking details from you, I assumed the SD of the difference is $\sigma = 2$ and that it is important to detect a systematic difference as large as one or two days. Power Curve for Paired t Test Power and Sample Size Paired t Test Testing mean paired difference = 0 (versus ≠ 0) Calculating power for mean paired difference = differenceα α = 0.05 Assumed standard deviation of paired differences = 2 Sample Target Difference Size Power Actual Power 1 44 0.9 0.900031 2 13 0.9 0.910708 As you can see, under these assumptions, you would need to look at about 44 pairs (customer IDs) to detect a difference of one day, and only about 13 for a difference of two days. You need to contrive a method to sample these customers at random. You should check to see if differences are roughly normal. If there are many huge outliers (either positive or negative), then a t test may not be appropriate. If the sample SD of differences is much different from my assumed $\sigma = 2,$ then you need to re-do the computations for sample size. (For example, if $\sigma=1,$ then respective sample sizes drop to about 13 and 5; if $\sigma=4,$ then increase to 170 and 44.) Note: For the purpose you stated in your Comment, you should not reduce the differences to 0's and non-0's. The actual size of the difference matters.
