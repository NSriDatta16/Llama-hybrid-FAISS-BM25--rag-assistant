robots.txt and wildcard at the end od disallow

I need to disallow indexing 2 pages, one of them dynamic: site.com/news.php site.com/news.php?id=__ site.com/news-all.php What should I write in robots.txt: User-agent: * Disallow: /news or Disallow: /news* or Disallow: /news.php* Disallow: /news-all.php Should one use wildcard in the end or not?
