Computers don't age and slow down the same way we do. If your server is getting slower -- actually slower, not just feels slower because every other computer you use is getting faster -- then there is a reason and it is possible that you may be able to fix it. I'd try cleaning up some disk space, de-fragmenting the disk, and checking what other processes are running (perhaps someone's added more apps to the system and you're just not getting as many cycles). If your app uses a database, you may want to analyze your query performance and see if some indices are in order. Queries that perform well when you have little data can start taking a long time as the amount of data grows if they have to use table scans. As a former "IT" guy, I'd also be reluctant to throw hardware at a problem because someone tells me the system is slowing down. I'd want to know what has changed and see if I could get the system running the way it should be. If the app has simply out grown the hardware -- after you've made suitable optimizations -- then upgrading is a reasonable choice.
