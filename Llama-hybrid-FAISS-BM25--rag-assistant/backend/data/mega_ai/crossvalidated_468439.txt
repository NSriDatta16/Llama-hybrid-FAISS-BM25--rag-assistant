Is the multimodal as in multimodal machine learning the same as that as in multimodal distribution?

The multimodal distribution is a distribution with multiple modes as shown below. It reminds me of the multimodal machine learning where multimodal implies multiple types of information, just like that in multimedia, thus I wonder if multimedia machine learning or multimedia deep learning would be more appropriate? Does the multimodal machine learning have some connections with the multimodal distribution?
