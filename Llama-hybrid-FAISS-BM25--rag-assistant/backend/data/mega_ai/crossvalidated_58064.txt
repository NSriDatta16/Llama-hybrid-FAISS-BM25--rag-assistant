I would recommend playing around with the statistics in R, if you're familiar with R. use arima.sim() to generate time series with different characteristics (order=c(1,0,0) for an AR(1) model) then you can use arima() or ar() functions to estimate the parameters. To graphically understand whats going on, use pacf() and acf() to plot the partial/ autocorrelation function of the simulated time series. These plots are used as diagnostic plots. If you have a strictly AR process, you should see a single peak in the pacf() plot, and the location of the peak indicates the order of the AR process. For the AR process, the acf() plot should decay to zero. Also, the directions of the peaks in the pacf() and acf() plots is indicative of the sign of the AR() coefficients. #Example of AR(1) process testAR1 Things then change a bit when you are looking at a MA process, or a process that is a combination of AR and MA. You didn't ask about these, so I won't explain. However, I should point out that a car driving with cruise control on is one of the few examples of an MA process that seemed intuitive to me when I was first learning about ARIMA models. Best of luck.
