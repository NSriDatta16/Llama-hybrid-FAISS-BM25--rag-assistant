WAV file splitter utility

I have a PROGRAMMING task (homework) to investigate brute force neural net methods. That part of the problem is MY homework. We have to show that certain simple words repeated in a verbal conversion might be able to be recognized as similar. We don’t have to workout what the word is, just that it is a possible repeat. To limit my ‘search space’ I want to break up the WAV file into fragments. To avoid the ‘Donald Knuth’ syndrome I don’t want to divert energies into learning RMS, Fourier analysis for frequency profiling etc. So I am looking for a windows based util to split wav files. I have looked at one called GramoFile.exe . It works well at the LP song level of breaking up vinyl platter recordings, but not at the small speech fragments. It is a Linux util with a DOS version. It is limited to split into 99 files only. I have tried to split to 99 fragments then run the first, second, etc split files through the GramoFile.exe but no luck. It can’t deal will the infinitesimal pauses between words. Any suggestions people ?
