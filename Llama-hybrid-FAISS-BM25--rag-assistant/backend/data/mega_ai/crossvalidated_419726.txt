What should a player flipping a coin "expect"?

Thanks for reading. Earlier today, I asked this question on the Math StackExchange: https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3307837/do-i-break-even-in-a-fair-game If someone were to run a computer simulation of the coin-tossing game, what would the score be for the player choosing heads every time? And why? What should we interpret as the "expected" value - the average, or the standard deviation? Thanks!!!
