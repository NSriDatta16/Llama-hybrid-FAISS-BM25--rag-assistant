Investors generally use standard deviation(like standard deviation of log returns) as an proxy for risk for financial assets. This is a blanket statement that is probably incorrect. You could say "some investors" to make it more reasonable. You can look up risk measures in Google. There are many different ones used. For instance, it was noted that people are more averse to losses compared to gains. This would make a symmetrical measure of risk inappropriate in some situation. In some cases absolute deviations are used instead of squared ones etc. The basic textbooks in MBA programs would only cover Markowitz' model, of course, leaving them with an impression that it's all that investors do. There's this whole cottage industry of portfolio optimization not based on Markowitz's mean-variance approach, but using other measures of risk. In reality distribution of return is more peaked at the center and higher mass in the tail as predicted by the normal distribution. It's very well known that equity returns are not Gaussian, and many other financial series too. If you Google "fat tails returns" or something like that, you'll get a ton of papers on the subject. The investors, at least sophisticated ones, know this very well and for a long time. Those who didn't pay attention, surely, got the message delivered in 2007. Also, as statisticians will tell you the standard deviation can be computed on any distribution, not only Gaussian. It's a measure of dispersion of the random variable. As long as you don't stick "Gaussian" p-values to it, it's not misinforming you at all on fat tailed distributions. For this reason, mean-variance framework for portfolio optimization is not necessarily inappropriate for fat tailed distributions. It can be inappropriate for other reasons, such as asymmetrical risk aversion or non-quadratic risk-aversion.
