I've looked at the file with a hex editor, and found 3 JFIF headers. After extracting each part, I found 2 thumbnails and an image. Nothing special, because embedded thumbnails seem to be part of the EXIF2 standard . The thumbnails themselves load fine in Delphi, and converting the file to something readable can be done with almost every piece of software that I've tried. Anyway, this page will give you very detailed information about the picture, and what headers are inside (just paste the url of your image in the textbox): http://www.monster-submit.com/resources/jpeganalyzer/
