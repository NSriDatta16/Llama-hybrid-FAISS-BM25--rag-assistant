Rob Hyndman and user 11852 provide excellent answers. Just to add to it a bit, one of the main purposes of AIC and BIC is to detect a model overfitting. And, an ARMA model could be vulnerable to overfitting by adding many more variables compared to a more parsimonious regression structure. In the end, AIC and BIC tests on a stand alone basis may not give you all the information you need to make your model selection. A more straightforward way of detecting model overfitting and differentiating between models is to conduct cross validation, Hold Out, or out-of-Sample testing. All those methods are very similar. They consist in testing the models on new data (real or created from the existing time series). In view of the above, the definition of an overfit model is a model that fits the history very well, but does not forecast as well. And, ARMA models given their structure are highly vulnerable to that. That is not only because they use additional variables. It is because they use the majority of their information from endogenous variables, or from the time series itself. Once, you forecast future periods beyond the lags or the lag in the error correcting mechanism in the model, these models forecast accuracy collapse. That's not something that AIC and BIC capture. That is what you uncover when you test with new data as mentioned above. And, that is probably the better way to truly test and compare the accuracy of forecasts between your ARMA model and your simpler regression. By definition, your regression will not fit the history as well. And, as you indicated its residuals will often have some degree of autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity that is not as problematic as people think (just make adjustments with Robust Standard Error methodology to ensure that your selected variables are still statistically significant... and you are good). ARMA models by contrast have typically far cleaner residual behaviors than simple regression, but at what price... The minute you conduct some sort of medium term to long term forecast, in the out periods very often the simpler regression model prevails.
