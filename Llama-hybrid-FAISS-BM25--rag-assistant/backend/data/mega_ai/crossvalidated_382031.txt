This is a much harder question than one would think and I doubt there are clear answers. The answer is relatively clear when we talk about clinical trials for regulatory purposes (whatever the regulatory authority says). I have the impression that this is an area of pragmatic traditions that have evolved in a kind of ad-hoc and not necessarily philosophically consistent manner within each field of science. There are simply some standard conventions that are typically (but not always) followed in certain fields. However, even with a field where type I error rate control per study has a lot of tradition such as medicine, there is still a debate on this topic.
