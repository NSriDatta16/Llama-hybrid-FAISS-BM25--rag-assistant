The runtime characteristics are different: A tree-based map always has a runtime (worst case, average case) in the order of O(log n ), i.e. the height of the (balanced) binary search tree. Hash maps , on the other hand, have a much more complicated runtime behaviour. But in the usual case, a hash table has an expected runtime of O(1), i.e. constant overhead. In general, the worst case is O( n ), which sounds bad. However, it can be shown that for a good choice of parameters, this worst case gets so rare as to not play a role in practice. “Rare” here means really rare, as in winning the lottery ten times in a row and then being killed by a comet. In practice, a bad choice of parameters (hashing technique, load factor …) can raise this probability considerably.
