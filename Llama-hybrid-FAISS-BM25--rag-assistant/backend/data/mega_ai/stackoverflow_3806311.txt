For a web application, the best place to store this would be in the database. Create a database with a field for article ID and a field for the number of visits. Index the table by the number of visits. Whenever an article is viewed, add the record or increment the existing record. When you need to see the list of most popular, just query the table. Databases are frequently the best answer for where to store data in a web application. In this case, the database will index the table based on the number of visits. This makes it a bit slower for inserting and updating, but databases are designed to do this work so it won't be too bad. Retrieval of this data will always be super fast because of the maintained index.
