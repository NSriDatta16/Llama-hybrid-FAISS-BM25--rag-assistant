Interpreting a log-level model: Dummy is switching 'on' and 'off' over time

How does the interpretation of the coefficient on a dummy variable change in settings where the indicator is switching 'on' and 'off' repeatedly over time? Suppose I have complaint data on hotels $i$ over days $t$ . Some of the hotels employ guards, while others do not. Interestingly, security is only present in and around the treated facilities two days per week. The other hotels have no coverage at all. The model is taking the following form: $$ \text{log}(y_{it}) = \beta d_{it} + \gamma_i + \lambda_t + u_{it}, $$ where $d_{it}$ is equal to 1 if a hotel is assigned guards and only during the days when they are actually surveilling the location. The parameters $\gamma_i$ and $\lambda_t$ represent hotel and day fixed effects, respectively. This framework mirrors the more general difference-in-differences estimator. Here is what I know about the interpretation of a dummy variable when the outcome is log-transformed: If $d_{it}$ switches from 0 to 1, the % impact of $d_{it}$ on the outcome is: $100 \times (\exp(\hat{\beta})-1)$ If $d_{it}$ switches from 1 to 0, the % impact of $d_{it}$ on the outcome is: $100 \times (\exp(-\hat{\beta})-1)$ But the intervention dummy is switching back and forth somewhat arbitrarily. Hotels receive this 'on' and 'off' coverage over the entire year. If this helps, see the abridged data frame below (only hotel 2 receives intermittent coverage): $$ \begin{array}{ccc} hotel & day & d_{it} \\ \hline 1 & 1 & 0 \\ 1 & 2 & 0 \\ 1 & 3 & 0 \\ 1 & 4 & 0 \\ 1 & 5 & 0 \\ 1 & 6 & 0 \\ 1 & 7 & 0 \\ \hline 2 & 1 & 0 \\ 2 & 2 & 0 \\ 2 & 3 & 0 \\ 2 & 4 & 1 \\ 2 & 5 & 0 \\ 2 & 6 & 0 \\ 2 & 7 & 1 \\ \end{array} $$ This estimator is often described as averaging all the two-by-two difference-in-differences estimators. It is my understanding that the estimate of $\beta$ is the average of all the sub-estimators when there is a change from 0 to 1. Question: Does the "percentage" interpretation need to account for hotels moving in and out of the treated condition repeatedly? As shown, hotels 'switch out' of the treated condition multiple times.
