How to know that a posterior probability is significant in bayesian inference

First of all I would like to apologize if I am making any misconceptions or not using the right vocabulary since I am just getting started in Bayesian inference. That said, the problem I am facing is the classification of a series of devices in different classes using the measurements that they are reporting. In order to do that, I am using the new evidences (data reported by the devices) to obtain the likelihood probability for each class with which I then obtain the posterior probability for each class. As we know, the posterior probabilities of each class obtained by the Bayes inference will sum 1. In this sense, to finally classify to which class each device belongs, I am taking the hypothesis for which the posterior probability is higher. The problem is that, sometimes, the posterior probabilities are too close to each other so the probability of the hypothesis with the maximum posterior probability is not significant compared with the others. Example: imagine that we have three hypotheses with the posterior probabilities being 0.4, 0.3 and 0.3. Currently I am classifying the device to the first class based on these probabilities but, as can be seen, the three probabilities are too close each other, not being any of them significant to the others. In this sense, is there any test that I can perform to obtain if the maximum posterior probability is significant enough to the rest of them? Thanks in advance and sorry again if I am making any mistake with the vocabulary or any misconception.
