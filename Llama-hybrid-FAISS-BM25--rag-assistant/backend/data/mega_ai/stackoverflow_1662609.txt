The answer Thomas gave is correct, and works well if you have a file path, don't want to cache the bitmap, and don't want to use XAML. However it should also be mentioned that BitmapImage has a built-in way to load the bitmap immediately by setting BitmapCacheOption: BitmapImage img = new BitmapImage { CacheOption = BitmapCacheOption.OnLoad }; img.BeginInit(); img.UriSource = imageUrl; img.EndInit(); or This will load the bitmap immediately and explicitly close the stream, just as using a FileStream would, but with several differences: It will work with any Uri, such as a pack:// Uri. It can be used directly from XAML The bitmap is cached in the bitmap cache, so future use of the same Uri won't go to the disk. In your particular application this may be a bad thing, but for other uses it may be a desirable feature.
