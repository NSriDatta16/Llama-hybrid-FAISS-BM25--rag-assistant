Save current data from UITableView

Trying to figure out how data storage from UITableViews is ment to work. What is good practices when saving a UITableView data on e.g. viewDidDisappear. Do I have to update an array with every changes made while working in the view, or can I collect all current values form the table on exit view? Can someone point me in the right direction? Thanks!
