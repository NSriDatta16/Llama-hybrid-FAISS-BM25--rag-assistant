I'm wondering why you are looking for a language that specifically encourages mixing it up rather than just doing it anyway with a language that does functional programming and OO programming well? It could be easily brought into effect with Python, Ruby, Perl or similar interpreted languages. In addition C based OO languages tend to mix pure C with OO features, for example Objective C could easily be written in such a way should you choose. EDIT: I have been made aware I'm incorrect, I've left this answer here incase someone can learn from my mistake - see comments.
