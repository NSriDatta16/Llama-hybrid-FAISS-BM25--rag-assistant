One approach is you don't attempt to interpret individual variables once PCA is applied. The idea being you found your latent factors, and these are now your variables. Another approach is that the PC is nothing but a linear combination of your original variables. You know the coefficients of each variable, so you can easily imply the effective slope of each variable. It will be the sum product of the slopes of PCA regression and the coefficients of the variable in each of the components.
