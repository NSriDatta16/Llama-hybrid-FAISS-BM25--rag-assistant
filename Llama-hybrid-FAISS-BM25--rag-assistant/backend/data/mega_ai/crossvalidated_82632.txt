To add to the already existing answers, the band represents a confidence interval of the mean, but from your question you clearly are looking for a prediction interval . Prediction intervals are a range that if you drew one new point that point would theoretically be contained in the range X% of the time (where you can set the level of X). library(ggplot2) set.seed(5) x We can generate the same type of plot you've shown in your initial question with a confidence interval around the mean of the smoothed loess regression line (the default is a 95% confidence interval). ConfiMean For a quick and dirty example of prediction intervals, here I generate a prediction interval using linear regression with smoothing splines (so it is not necessarily a straight line). With the sample data it does pretty well, for the 100 points only 4 are outside the range (and I specified a 90% interval on the predict function). #Now getting prediction intervals from lm using smoothing splines library(splines) MyMod (note: actual confidence intervals are smoother, as there was a code typo in the original answer) Now a few more notes. I agree with Ladislav that you should consider time series forecasting methods since you have a regular series since sometime in 2007 and it is clear from your plot if you look hard there is seasonality (connecting the points would make it much clearer). For this I would suggest checking out the forecast.stl function in the forecast package where you can choose a seasonal window and it provides a robust decomposition of the seasonality and trend using Loess. I mention robust methods because your data have a few noticeable spikes. More generally for non-time series data I would consider other robust methods if you have data with occasional outliers. I do not know how to generate prediction intervals using Loess directly, but you may consider quantile regression (depending on how extreme the prediction intervals need to be). Otherwise if you just want to fit to be potentially non-linear you can consider splines to allow the function to vary over x.
