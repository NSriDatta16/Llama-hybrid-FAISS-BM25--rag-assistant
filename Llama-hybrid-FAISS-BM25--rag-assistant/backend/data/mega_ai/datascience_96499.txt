What if root of a such tree is pruned in xgboost?

Extreme Gradient Boosting stops to grow a tree if $\gamma$ is greater than impurity reduction given as eq (7) (see below) , what does happen if tree's root has a negative impurity? I think there is no any way to boosting goes on because the next trees would depend of the tree that would've grown by this removed root.
