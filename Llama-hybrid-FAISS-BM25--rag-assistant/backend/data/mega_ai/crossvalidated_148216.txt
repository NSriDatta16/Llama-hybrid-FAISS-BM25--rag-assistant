How to compare 3D accelerometer data in time series?

I'm trying to find similarity between two time series of 3D accelerometer data: Just by looking at the graphs I can tell that red-circled parts looks pretty similar to me, but I would like to get algorithm telling me exactly how similar they are. Suppose if I put left side on identical to itself it should yell a similarity of 100%. There is also a time-shifting involved but I think if I could compare series of 10 points, I could simply compare another series by shifting it by one point and get a result that I want? FYI: both data sets are recorded by trying to do the exact same action, i.e. lifting hand up and down and doing that at the same exact moment each time - start lifting at 0 seconds starting putting it down at 1 second. (If that's of any help)
