One way to do this is to write something like the following: eForeign_key_violation EXCEPTION; PRAGMA EXCEPTION_INIT(eForeign_key_violation, -2292); FOR aRow IN (SELECT primary_key_field FROM A_TABLE) LOOP BEGIN DELETE FROM A_TABLE A WHERE A.PRIMARY_KEY_FIELD = aRow.PRIMARY_KEY_FIELD; EXCEPTION WHEN eForeign_key_violation THEN NULL; -- ignore the error END; END LOOP; If a child row exists the DELETE will fail and no rows will be deleted, and you can proceed to your next key. Note that if your table is large this may take quite a while.
