Suppose you have n people in each group and they experience a total of r events. You can then calculate the average number of events per person (r/n). Now suppose you are willing to make an inferential leap and say that the number of events per person is distributed as Poisson. You now know the Poisson parameter (usually denoted $$\lambda = r/n$$ lambda) so you can estimate the number with zero events, and hence the proportion who experienced at least one, possibly more events.
