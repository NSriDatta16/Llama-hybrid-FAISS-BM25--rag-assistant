How to find important features in unsupervised data?

I have data that defines the characteristics of an elevator. This data contains hundred of fields (height, weight, speed, number of persons inside the elevator, etc...). From this data, I want to classify the elevators according to their complexity. For example, I want to find which elevators share the same properties even if they are slightly different in some characteristics. To tackle this problem, I was thinking of finding the most important features of the elevator first and later group them according to the results. But I don't know if I should use Random Forest to find the most important features so that I could group them with the help of K-means. Should I use Random forest to find the most important features of an elevator? Or, should I use any other model like feature importance or correlation map? How to know which statistical model should I choose?
