Calculating the average color between two colors in PHP, using an index number as reference value

In PHP, I am trying to calculate the average color (in hex) between to different hex colors. However, I also need to be able to supply an index number between 0.0 and 1.0. So for example: I have $color1 = "#ffffff" $color2 = "#0066CC" If I would write a function to get the average color and I would supply 0.0 as the index number, the function would need to return " #ffffff ". If I would supply 1.0 as the index number, the function would need to return " #0066CC ". However if I would supply 0.2, the function would need to return an average color between the two colors, but still closer to $color1 than to $color2 . If I would supply index number 0.5, I would get the exact average color of both colors. I have been trying to accomplish this for several days now but I can't seem to figure it out! Any help would therefor be greatly appreciated!
