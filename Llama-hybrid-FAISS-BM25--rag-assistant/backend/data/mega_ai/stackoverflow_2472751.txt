You could settle for a simpler solution than some arcane settings or shortcut: resize your Eclipse main windows a bit smaller drag the views you do not want to be covered after a "tab double-click" outside the main Eclipse window there is no 3. When you double-click, the Editor will cover only the main Eclipse window, while the other views will still be visible just beside that window.
