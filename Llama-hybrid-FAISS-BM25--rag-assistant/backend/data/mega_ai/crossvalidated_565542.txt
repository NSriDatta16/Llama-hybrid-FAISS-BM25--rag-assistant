I am wondering under what conditions it makes sense or is appropriate to pool the data? The model without year as a factor looks like $$ \operatorname{logit}(p) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 {CGDD} + \beta_2{t} $$ Where $t$ is a year factor. If $\beta_2$ is small enough to be negligible over the three years or so you choose to pool the data then it makes sense to pool. We can actually test this assumption statistically. Fit two models (one with year and one without) and perform a likelihood ratio test. If you treat year as a continuous variable (and you should) this will be equivalent to the Wald test reported in the summary of the model. When using 2015-2017 data and training it against 2018, is there logic to this decision? This is something for you to convince us of. It makes most sense to forecast on unseen data from the future (I disagree that accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity are the best measures). Clearly, if the model is going to be used, it will be used to predict the future from the past (not the past from the future). But I would encourage you to justify your approach rather than asking the reader to infer proper justification.
