How do I discover all mailboxes for an Exchange Server using Exchange Web Services?

I'm using Exchange Web Services Managed API 1.0 to access the Exchange servers (2007) in my organization. I need to iterate over all the mailboxes on a given server. I haven't seen a way to get the list of mailboxes defined for a given Exchange server. I have been able to use the AutoDiscover service to find the address of a hub server for a specific mailbox, but I'm interested in getting a list of all mailboxes. Can someone point me in the right direction?
