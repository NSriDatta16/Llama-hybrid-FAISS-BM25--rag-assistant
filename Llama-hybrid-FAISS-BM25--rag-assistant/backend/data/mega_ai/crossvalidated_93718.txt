Ways to simplify a neural network in R for interpretation

I would like to try to make some sense of a neural network. The neural network has a single hidden layer and is used on 30-40 attributes, which are used to classify the probability that the observation belongs to 1 of 3 different classes. My goal is to the find 5-10 main interactions in order to understand the model better. To do this I've been recommended by my adviser to look into the 'Optimal Brain Damage'-algorithm ( http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-90b.pdf ), which removes connections between nodes one by one. However, I cannot seem to find any R packages that supports this algorithm. I would therefore like to know what other algorithms exist to simplify neural networks and make them more easily interpreted. My efforts searching has so far been pretty useless, which is likely due to the fact that I don't have any clue of which key words to use. Thanks!
