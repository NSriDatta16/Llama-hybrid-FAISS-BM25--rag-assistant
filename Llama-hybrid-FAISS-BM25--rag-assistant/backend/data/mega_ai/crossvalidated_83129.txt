Significance Test for Comparison of Variables

I am not sure how to ask this question without giving an example. I am trying to measure the "cleanliness" of office buildings. I have two variables that try to measure this. Variable one is a person who inspects a random sample of the offices in a building and rates the cleanliness of each office. These scores are averaged together to get an overall score for the building. Variable two is the number of janitorial requests to clean up a messy area in a building. Someone actually calls the maintenance office and says "there is a mess in this office can someone with a broom/mop come clean it up." This is the exact count at the building level, not a sample. The idea is that both variables are trying to measure the same concept, "cleanliness." As such, I expect some "congruity" between the two variables. The way I am trying to measure the congruity is by using Spearman's Correlation (ranking the buildings by cleanliness for each variable and applying the correlation formula to the ranks). Here are my questions: 1) Can Spearman's correlation coefficient be used as an indicator of whether or not the inspectors are accurately scoring the offices (assuming janitorial requests are an appropriate measure of cleanliness). 2) Does the fact that the building's score from the inspector is a function of a sample of offices from the building while the number of janitorial requests is a population measure affect the calculation of correlation coefficient? 3) If Spearman's correlation is an OK measure to use, what range of values would be considered "Strong", "Medium", "Weak"? Is this up to the end user of the data? 4) If I am only concerned with 10 buildings and I have data for all 10 buildings, do I need to use significance tests? For example, is the coefficient different from zero? My understanding of significance tests is that they are needed when data is being sampled from a population but not when you have the population level of data.
