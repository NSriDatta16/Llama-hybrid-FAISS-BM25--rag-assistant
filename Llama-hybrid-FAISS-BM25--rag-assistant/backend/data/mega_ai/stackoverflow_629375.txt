It depends. Creating, Deleting and Updating will be slightly slower in average since it is more likely that index structures will have to be reorganized. Also, if more data is frequently requested from the database system, then it is less likely that the data you are trying to access in cached in RAM and must be read from the hard disc. But these differences should not be very significant for modifying queries. Fetching/Reading will certainly be slower though. It is just obvious that having to fetch, filter, sort and group large amounts of data is slower than doing the same with small amounts. This is especially true if the data you are working on is too large to fit into the machine's RAM.
