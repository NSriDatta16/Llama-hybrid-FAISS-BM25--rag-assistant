You might try LDA . There are libraries available for modeling large and small datasets. Choose a parameter of 2 or 3 and verify it can reliably segment your product IDs into several topics. Then ask for about 11 topics and hope you get a 1:1 product:topic mapping. Ask the model for a few more topics if you really want to encourage a product to get its own topic. The nice thing about LDA is it's easy to explain to stake holders, as the model is simply keywords that can be sorted by importance (sorted by their weights).
