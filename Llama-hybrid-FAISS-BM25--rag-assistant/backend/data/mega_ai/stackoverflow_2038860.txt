I think your approach is a good one. I think a well design architecture is the best approach. You will most likely see a lot of variance in the DAO layer. A good design would see a DAO interface, then each specific model access would have its own implementation of that interface e.g. JpaMyObjectDAO, JpaGAEObjectDAO etc. Also like you siad, App Engine has some special requirements when it comes to declaring your entity classes. Perhaps you could have different versions of the entity classes (each that conforms to its storage scheme like App Engine or Hibernate), then have a common DTO representation for your higher layers to use.
