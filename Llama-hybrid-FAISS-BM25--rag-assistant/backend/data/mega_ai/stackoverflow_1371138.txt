refreshing mkannotation properties and refreshing the annotation

I have a mkannotation located on a mapview which has a mkannotationview as well as a calloutview which when clicked goes to a child uiviewcontroller. I am updating some properties from the callout's uiviewcontroller, but after I'm finished I want to move the annotation's position on the map and change the annotation title and subtitle. How can I easily do this from the callout's uiviewcontoller? What's the most elegant way to handle this? A code sample would be great if anyone has any. Thanks
