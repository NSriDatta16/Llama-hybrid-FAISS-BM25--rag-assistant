Essentially, the question is, how come that one coefficient in the linear model is significantly different from 0, but ANOVA shows no significant effect and vice versa. For this, let's consider a simpler example. set.seed( 123 ) data You can see that there is only one group (d) that stands out of the line (has a coefficient significantly different from zero). However, given that the nine other groups do not show an effect, the anova returns $p > 0.1$. However, let us remove some of the groups: data2 returns Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F) g 2 6.8133 3.4066 5.7363 0.01182 * Residuals 18 10.6898 0.5939 ANOVA considers the overall variance within and between the groups. In the first case (10 groups) the variance between the groups is smaller because of the many groups with no effect. In the second, there are only two groups, and all the between groups variance comes from the difference between these two groups. How about the reverse? This is easier: imagine three groups with means equal to -1, 0, 1. Total average is 0. Each group separately does not necessarily has a significant difference from 0, but there is enough difference between group 1 and 3 to account for significant total between group variance.
