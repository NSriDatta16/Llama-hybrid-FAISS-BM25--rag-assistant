That sounds strange, I would guess it is a numerical coincidence. The only difference in R's glm between binomial and quasibinomial family is in the calculation of standard errors, the estimation process is exactly the same. Or, it might be that the difference in calculation of standard errors cause differences in the criteria for declaring convergence. Anyhow, you should not trust the model for hypothesis testing, the standard errors (for both binomial and quasibinomial case) is bogus. See my answer here Why does logistic regression become unstable when classes are well-separated? for some ideas of what to do in this case of separation.
