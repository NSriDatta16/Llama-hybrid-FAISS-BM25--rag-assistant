I believe your instinct is correct but your mistake is to attempt to adjust the scrollbars rather than moving the PictureBox within the scrollable panel. You should intercept the MouseMove and adjust the PictureBox's Location property by the mouse movement delta — the scrollbars should automatically update to reflect the image's new location within it. Updating your code would look something like tho following (untested): private void pictureBox1_MouseMove(object sender, MouseEventArgs e) { if (dragging) { if (e.Button == MouseButtons.Left) { int horizontalChange = (e.X - startingX) * -1; // move the image inverse to direction dragged int verticalChange = (e.Y - startingY); pictureBox1.Left += horizontalChange; pictureBox1.Top += verticalChange; } } startingX = e.X; startingY = e.Y; } (Also, I would be inclined to record the starting mouse and PictureBox locations at the start of the drag and update them relative to this starting position on each MouseMove event rather than make incremental changes as the code above (and your original code does). The reason for this is that if there are any unexpected values, for whatever reason, then this will only cause a transitory effect — the next good event will self-correct.)
