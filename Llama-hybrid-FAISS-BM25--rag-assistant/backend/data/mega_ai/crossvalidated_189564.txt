Fourier Transform on varied time data

So... no clue where I should be asking this question but I'm hoping someone here can at least point me in the right direction. I have a time series that I would like to do spectral analysis on but I can't find any tools for doing FFT that accommodate a varied time difference between data points (they all assume dt is constant). Does anyone know of a tool that would work for this (I'm specifically looking for a periodogram or some other way to determine periodicity). My only thought is to do linear interpolation between data points at a specific time interval to give the data a constant dt but I'm worried that will scew the spectral analysis data. Here is a small chunk of the data; time, data, dt time data dt 39.630 49662.1 0.170 39.810 49582.5 0.180 40.150 49430.0 0.340 40.320 49413.8 0.170 40.490 49324.0 0.170 40.670 49092.5 0.180 40.830 49025.6 0.160 41.010 49101.5 0.180 any suggestions??
