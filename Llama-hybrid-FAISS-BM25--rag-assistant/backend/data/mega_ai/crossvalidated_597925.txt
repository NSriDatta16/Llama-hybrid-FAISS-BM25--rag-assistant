Why does CoxPH always underperforming vs a simple Kaplan Meier?

For context, my company have outsourced a lifetime prediction to a big firm. The goal is to predict lifetimes of a categorical variable. The data includes customers from 2012 to 2022. I have the survival times. If the customer is still with us, they get censored in 2022 (today). There is only 1 categorical covariate with 6 categories (dummy Variables). Big Firm's Model: Generate KM curves for each (Category + Cohort) where Cohort is (Year-month-01). For example, category_3|2015-05-01. For each Category, get an average of the (Category + Cohort) KM curves to get 1 single KM curve per category. The average is an exponentially weighted average to give recent Cohorts more importance. My model: I have used CPH with breslow estimation for baseline hazard. Covariates include the categorical covariate, cohort year, cohort month. Validation: Artificial censoring: I will artificially censor the data at a specific date, for example 2019-01-01. Train both models on this. Then I will try to predict survival/retention at 2021-01-01 of the customers who were still with us at 2019-01-01. Then I find the error, Predicted Retention - Actual Retention for analysis. Edit: This is just one date for validation. I have used various dates for validation and got the same results Results: KM curves are always correctly predicting retention while CoxPH overestimates the retention by alot. Cox = .55 vs KM = .42 vs acutal = .4. I have tried using "sample_weights" column to give more importance to recent customers but to no avail. Is there any underlying issue?
