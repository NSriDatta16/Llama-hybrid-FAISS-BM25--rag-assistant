Extracting Data Client Side

I need to be able to extract and transform data from a data source on a client machine and ship it off via a web service call to be loaded into our data store. I would love to be able leverage SSIS but the Sql Server licensing agreement is preventing me from installing Integration Services on a client machine. Can I just provide the client copies of the Integration Services' assemblies to be referenced by my app? Does anyone have any ideas on how to best implement a solution to this problem apart from building a custom solution from the ground up? Ideally the solution would include leveraging an existing ETL tool? Thanks for your suggestions.
