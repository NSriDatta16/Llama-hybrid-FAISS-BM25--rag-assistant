I would encourage you to get and use NetBeans or GlassFish Tools Bundle For Eclipse to start working with Java EE 6 and GlassFish v3... (read my profile to find out why). If you are determined to avoid using either of these IDEs, then I would recommend that you download the Java EE 6 SDK , to get started. The SDK includes a number of different samples that can be built and deployed using Ant. (Use -verbose to learn the 'secrets')
