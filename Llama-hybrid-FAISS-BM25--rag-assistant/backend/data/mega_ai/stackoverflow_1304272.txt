1. Top 25 tables based on number of different entries for "site" IIUC, "site" is UNIQUE, so you should be able to: select TABLE_NAME, ifnull(TABLE_ROWS, 0) as SITES from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES where TABLE_SCHEMA='bookfeather' order by SITES desc limit 25 But substituting TABLE_ROWS for no. of unique SITE records with a wink and a nod is cheating -- better to redesign. :) 2. Top 25 tables based on sum of "votes_up" If you cannot, for whatever reason, follow the excellent advice to redesign, you'll have to programatically iterate over each table. In your code you might loop over SHOW TABLES , accumulating the result of select 'tblName', ifnull(sum(VOTES_UP), 0) as UPVOTES from tblName sorting on the second field of your accumulated rows and pruning to the top 25. A variant of this involves a summary table which keeps track of tables and sum()'d UPVOTES, perhaps re-written periodically by cron , updated on the fly by per-table triggers, or presented in a VIEW (re- CREATE d for each new table) which is a UNION of all constituent queries. But don't do any of this. :) Switch to a single-table design (perhaps asking your storage engine to partition, if that's a concern).
