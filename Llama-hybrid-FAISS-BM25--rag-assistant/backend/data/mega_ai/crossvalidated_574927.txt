How can the sum of averages of my sample exceeds average of entire population? - market concentration

I want to see what percent of a market of listeners on a livestreaming platform my sample of top 100 musicians with the highest number of average listeners during a given month has. I only have average number of listers active during the month on the platform and each musician's average and peak number of listeners. Say there were 25,000 active listeners in a given month month, but when I sum all of the average number of listeners each of musician had in my sample it comes out to 140% of the entire platform's average. How can this be? I can see the peak number of listeners my sample had and I can also see that the top musician at one point had a peak of 5000 listeners (of the average of 25,000 active listeners on the entire platform), which is a very large amount for one musician. But how can the sum of averages exceed the entire platform average? Or rather, what can I take away from this? "The these 100 musicians accounted, on average, for the entire market/active listeners on the platform"? Edit: Perhaps these musicians attract a massive influx of listeners when they're performing which leads to high average listeners every time, the sum of which is higher than the platform average, which is low due to the lower average listener numbers when these sampled musicians don't play? Edit 2: Knowing that the sum of the average listeners is 140% of the platform's average listeners, would it make sense to infer that these performers attract a large number of new listeners to them and the platform and also account for a substantial and/or disproportionate number of platform listeners on average when they are performing (compared to the next top 101-500)? I do not know a way to statistically back up any of this information unfortunately besides the '140% of average monthly listeners' part, but eye-balling this gives me this impression. I appreciate any pointers
