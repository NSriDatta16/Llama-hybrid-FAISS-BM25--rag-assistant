Just to add a more recent (2019) answer: Flux . Flux is an elegant approach to machine learning. It's a 100% pure-Julia stack, and provides lightweight abstractions on top of Julia's native GPU and AD support. Flux makes the easy things easy while remaining fully hackable. For example: model = Chain( Dense(768, 128, Ïƒ), LSTM(128, 256), LSTM(256, 128), Dense(128, 10), softmax) loss(x, y) = crossentropy(model(x), y) Flux.train!(loss, data, ADAM(...))
