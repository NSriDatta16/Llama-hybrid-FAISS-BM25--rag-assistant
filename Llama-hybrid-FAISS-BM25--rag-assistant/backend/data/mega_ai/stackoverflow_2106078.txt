Where is 'Class Actions' in the 'Object Identity' panel in Interface Builder?

I thought I was fairly experienced at iPhone development, but I'm tripping up on the Stanford iPhone course on the very first video . (38 mins in) The teacher, drags an NSObject into the MainWindow.xib. And when he inspects the Object in the Identity Inspector (Cmd-4), there are Class Actions and Class Outlets sections. However, these don't appear for me, just Class Identity and Interface Builder Identity... Where have they gone?
