lasso regression on top of random forest

Some time ago, I found a paper describing usage of lasso/elastic net regression on binary variables come from random forest. In short, (i,j)-th variable takes 1 if given observation belong to leaf no. i inside tree no. j. Because this will result in a huge number of variables, authors suggested using lasso regression to obtain sparse and interpretable solution. Does somebody know if such a procedure is implemented in R/Python or can (at least) post a link to this article (or similar). Thanks in advance.
