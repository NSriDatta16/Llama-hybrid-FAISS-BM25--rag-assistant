GUNZIP / Extract file "portion by portion"

I'm on a shared server with restricted disk space and i've got a gz file that super expands into a HUGE file, more than what i've got. How can I extract it "portion" by "portion (lets say 10 MB at a time), and process each portion, without extracting the whole thing even temporarily! No, this is just ONE super huge compressed file, not a set of files please... Hi David, your solution looks quite elegant, but if i'm readying it right, it seems like every time gunzip extracts from the beginning of the file (and the output of that is thrown away). I'm sure that'll be causing a huge strain on the shared server i'm on (i dont think its "reading ahead" at all) - do you have any insights on how i can make gunzip "skip" the necessary number of blocks?
