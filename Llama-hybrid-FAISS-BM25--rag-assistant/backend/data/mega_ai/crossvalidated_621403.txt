Estimate of SATE and ATE

I am trying to understand the connection between sample average treatment effect (SATE) and average treatment effect (Population)-PATE or ATE $SATE=\frac{1}{n} \sum^n_i (Y_i(1)-Y_i(0))$ $ATE=\frac{1}{N} \sum^N_i (Y_i(1)-Y_i(0))=E(Y_i(1)-Y_i(0))$ The estimator: $\hat{\Delta}=\frac{1}{n} \sum^n_i (Y_i*(T_i=1)-Y_i(T_i=0))$ , $T_i$ is the treatment status and we assume treatment is randomly assigned. $\hat{\Delta}$ is sample mean difference between treated and untreated subjects. So $\hat{\Delta}$ is the estimate for both $SATE$ and $ATE$ , right? One more question: Why should we be interested in this $SATE$ ? this $SATE$ may vary from sample to sample. Why should we care whether treatment works or not in one particular sample?
