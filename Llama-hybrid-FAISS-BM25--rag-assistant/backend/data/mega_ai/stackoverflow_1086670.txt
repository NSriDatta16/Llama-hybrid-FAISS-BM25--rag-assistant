According to the strict JavaEE visibility semantics, classes inside a WAR should not be visible to other components of the same EAR. JBoss relaxes this a fair bit, and tries to flatten out the classloading hierarchy to make it less irritating, but the WAR restriction still stands. The solution I use is to put only web resources into the WAR, and to put the WAR's class files into a seperate JAR inside the EAR. That way, the webapp itself can find the classes, and so can your unit test webapp.
