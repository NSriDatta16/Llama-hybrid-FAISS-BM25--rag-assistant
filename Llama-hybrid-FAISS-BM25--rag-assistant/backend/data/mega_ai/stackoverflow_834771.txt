Java/SWT: How to receive mouse events from an embedded window

I am embedding a windows application into my SWT application using 'reparenting'. That part works ok. I would now like to hook my SWT app into the message queue for the embedded app to receive mouse move events. I see that the OS class in SWT has a number of interesting methods for adding hooks but I have not been able to figure out how to use them. Can anyone help? Thanks
