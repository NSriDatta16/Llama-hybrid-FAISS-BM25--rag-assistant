The Facebook app is not really a web app but rather a native Cocoa Touch app. If you are really creating a web app, your only option is to use localstorage and fetching new data asynchronously using XMLHTTPRequest . If – on the other hand – your app is a native app, you’ll most likely want to use Core Data for storage and get incremental updates in a separate thread (or using libdispatch in case you’re only targetting post 4.0 devices) using a separate managed object context which you can then merge to the main thread using mergeChangesFromContextDidSaveNotification: .
