Best way of splitting website into Cities/Countries?

i am running a dating website, or better say, try to. I want to be as generic as possible in terms of, coverage for countries. Since it's a local dating oriented website, i have to keep track of cities and so on so i am running into a few problems: I need to have information about cities, people could join from (a country i don't know anything about, i really can't decide about a city or anything) When people join from different countries, they would like to see people near by. How would you approach this sort or problem? This may seem like 2 easy points but they really make me some trouble these days. ** Try to approach them as Database related issues ** I circled around SE and find this to be the best point to ask, not any other SE website. Thank you very much
