Univariate time series: Only one variable is varying over time. For example, data collected from a sensor measuring the temperature of a room every second. Therefore, each second, you will only have a one-dimensional value, which is the temperature. Multivariate time series: Multiple variables are varying over time. For example, a tri-axial accelerometer. There are three accelerations, one for each axis (x,y,z) and they vary simultaneously over time. Considering the data you showed in the question, you are dealing with a multivariate time series, where value_1 , value_2 and value_3 are three variables changing simultaneously over time.
