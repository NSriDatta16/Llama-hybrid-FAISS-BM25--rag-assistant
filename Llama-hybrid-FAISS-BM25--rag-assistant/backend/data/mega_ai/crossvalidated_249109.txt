Procedure for Bjørnland & Leitemo (2009) methodology in R

I've been looking for a solution in R to estimate a structural VAR with long and short run restrictions as done in Bjørnland & Leitemo (2009) , where they represent a stable VAR in a moving average form: $$ y_t=B(L)u_t $$ where $B(L)$ is a convergent matrix polynomial in L (the lag operator), representing the long-run dynamics of the model. Assuming the reduced-form residuals $u_t$ are linear combinations of the structural errors $\varepsilon_t$, i.e. $u_t=S\varepsilon_t$, they arrive at $$ y_t=B(L)S\varepsilon_t $$ $S$, then, describing the short-run dynamics. The authors then impose a series of restrictions on $S$ and one in $B$, totalizing the needed number of restrictions for just-identification. I've found a RATS script that reproduces their work, but nothing similar in R . I know that in R the vars package allows for the estimation of AB-models, which relates the errors mentioned above as $Au_t=B\varepsilon_t$, but I'm not sure how this (and if) could help me reproduce such methodology. I'm about to use the RATS script for guidance and implement the methodology in R from scratch, but I thought it was a good idea to first check if someone here could suggest me an easier path.
