We can add multiple hidden layers which contain neurons in a Feed Forward neural network. For a neuron in the hidden layer, $ output = act( w . x + b )$ Where $act$ is the activation function. Here, the value of $x$ could be the input features ( if the neuron lies in the first hidden layer ) or it could be the activations from the previous layer ( if the neuron lies in an intermediate hidden layer ). With some more comfort, we can write the above equation as, $ output = act(\sum_{i=0}^{N} w_i x_1 + b ) $
