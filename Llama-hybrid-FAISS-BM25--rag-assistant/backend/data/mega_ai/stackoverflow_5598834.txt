Replacing first and second occurrence of the same text with different values

I'm searching for a way to replace the first occurrence of a certain text in a text file with a value ${A} and the second occurrence of the same text, on a different line, with ${B}. Can this be achieved with sed or awk or any other UNIX tool? The toolset is fairly limited: bash, common UNIX tools like sed, grep, awk etc. Perl, Python, Ruby etc. cannot be used... Thanks in advance for any advice Robert Example: ... Text Text Text Text TEXT_TO_BE_REPLACED Text Text Text TEXT_TO_BE_REPLACED Text Text Text ... should be replaced with ... Text Text Text Text REPLACEMENT_TEXT_A Text Text Text REPLACEMENT_TEXT_B Text Text Text ...
