You prob. need to calculate the lat/lng coordinate of the mouse cursor yourself to get it running in all browsers. This means you have to keep polling the mouse position on the map div and get the matching coordinate with the helper functions of gmaps (see http://code.google.com/intl/en-US/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/reference.html#MapCanvasProjection )
