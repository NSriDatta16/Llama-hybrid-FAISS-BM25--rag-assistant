Using an 'apps' folder to organize your applications without editing PYTHONPATH This has come handy when I want to organize my folders like this: apps/ foo/ bar/ site/ settings.py urls.py without overwritting PYTHONPATH or having to add apps to every import like: from apps.foo.model import * from apps.bar.forms import * In your settings.py add import os import sys PROJECT_ROOT = os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__)) sys.path.insert(0, os.path.join(PROJECT_ROOT, "apps")) and you are ready to go :-) I saw this at http://codespatter.com/2009/04/10/how-to-add-locations-to-python-path-for-reusable-django-apps/
