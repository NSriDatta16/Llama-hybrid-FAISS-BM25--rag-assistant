Color mapping a texture in opengl

I am displaying a texture that I want to manipulate without out affecting the image data. I want to be able to clamp the texel values so that anything below the lower value becomes 0, anything above the upper value becomes 0, and anything between is linearly mapped from 0 to 1. Originally, to display my image I was using glDrawPixels. And to solve the problem above I would create a color map using glPixelMap. This worked beautifully. However, for performance reasons I have begun using textures to display my image. The glPixelMap approach no longer seems to work. Well that approach may work but I was unable to get it working. I then tried using glPixelTransfer to set scales and bias'. This seemed to have some sort of effect (not necessarily the desired) on first pass, but when the upper and lower constraints were changed no effect was visible. I was then told that fragment shaders would work. But after a call to glGetString(GL_EXTENSIONS), I found that GL_ARB_fragment_shader was not supported. Plus, a call to glCreateShaderObjectARB cause a nullreferenceexception. So now I am at a loss. What should I do? Please Help. What ever might work I am willing to try. The vendor is Intel and the renderer is Intel 945G. I am unfortunately confined to a graphics card that is integrated on the motherboard, and only has gl 1.4. Thanks for your response thus far.
