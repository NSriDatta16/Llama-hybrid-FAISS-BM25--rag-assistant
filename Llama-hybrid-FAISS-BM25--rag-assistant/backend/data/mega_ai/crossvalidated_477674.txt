The short answer is that you seem to be trying to interpret a linear term in the presence of higher degree polynomial terms (as evidenced by the .L, .Q, .C, ^4, ^5 suffixes on your coefficients). Don't trust your intuition about what should be reasonable versus not reasonable in this situation. Your odds ratio of 5.57 is interpreted as the relative increase in odds per increase in class when all other covariates, including the higher order polynomial terms of class, are held constant . That said, I'm also wondering why are you surprised at this result. From the data you share, there does seem to be an increasing prevalence of your outcome with class, so I would expect odds ratios > 1. But I have other questions: Why are you using a logistic regression model when the outcome is an integer valued score? I'm surprised that you can even fit this model without errors or warnings at least. Also, how did you arrive at the choice of using a five-degree polynomial? How many observations are in your data?
