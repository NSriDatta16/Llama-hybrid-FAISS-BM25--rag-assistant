I would suggest using Canonical Correspondence Analysis (sometimes called Constrained Correspondence Analysis). In your case, the "sites" are temporal, rather than spatial, but it should work just fine. You'll need a sites by species abundance matrix (which you seem to have) and a sites by environmental data matrix (which I presume you have or can construct). There is a great discussion of CCA (and associated methods) in Numerical Ecology with R . It's geared towards using the R programming language, but the underlying theory is well described and should be extendable to whatever programming language/software you use. If you don't have free access through your university to the book, then there are a few websites out there that describe how to use it. Just google it, but be careful not to confuse it for Canonical Correlation Analysis (which is different). If that still doesn't work for you, try these tutorials on basic ordination analyses like PCA, DCA, and NMDS (the precursors to CCA), and work your way up.
