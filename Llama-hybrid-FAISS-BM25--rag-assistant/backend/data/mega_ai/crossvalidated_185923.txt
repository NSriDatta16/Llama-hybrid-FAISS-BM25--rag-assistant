Can one compute the autocorrelation of covariance matrices sampled by MCMC?

Imagine that we sample a covariance matrix from a Wishart distribution by MCMC. At every iteration, we get a new sample matrix $S_i$ from the Wishart distribution. Question : Given the trace that contains all the samples $S_1,...S_n$, can I plot the autocorrelation of these samples? I have seen someone using the autocorrelation of $\log(\det(S))$, but I found no justification.
