You may wish to take a look at Microsoft Managed Add-in Framework [MAF] and Managed Extensibiility Framework [MEF] (links courtesy of Kent Boogaart). As Kent states , the former is concerned with isolation of components, and the latter is primarily concerned with extensibility. In the end, even if you do not leverage either, some of the concepts regarding API versioning are very useful - ie versioning interfaces, and then providing inter-version support through adapters. Perhaps a little overkill, but definitely worth a look! Hope this helps! :)
