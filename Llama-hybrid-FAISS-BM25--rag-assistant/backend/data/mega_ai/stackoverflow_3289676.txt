Dragging issue in DIV

In a DIV tag, I had appended a SPAN control by using the following script, at load $("# ").append(" " + $(ui.draggable).text() + " "); where "divDimensions" is the DIV control. And the jquery script I had wriiten for dragging the span control created above is as follows : $("# SPAN.draggable").draggable({ appendTo: 'body', helper: 'clone', scroll: false, drag: function() { $('# ').val("DimensionBox"); } }); But the issue is that I am unable to drag the span control created. Can you help me resolve this ? And another issue regarding dragging is that, the draggable element gets disappeared while dragging over the FusionChart control, which I had to drag near to the FusioChart. Whats the solution for draggign over the FusionChart ?
