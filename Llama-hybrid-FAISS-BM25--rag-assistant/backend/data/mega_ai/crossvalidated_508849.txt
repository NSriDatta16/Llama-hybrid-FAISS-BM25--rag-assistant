Infinite variances do not fit into GLM theory. I can see three options within h2o : glm : Use a quite skewed distribution, e.g. a Tweedie with power >= 2. Tweedie power 3 is the inverse Gaussian. deeplearning : Use the deep learning algo with robust loss function and without a hidden layer. xgboost : Use xgboost with booster = gblinear and a robust loss function.
