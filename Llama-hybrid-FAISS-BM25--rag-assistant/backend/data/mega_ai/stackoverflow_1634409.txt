Given your update, here's an educated guess. I don't know much about the Infragistics WebDialog componen, but most dialogs are centered on the page. If your column has anything to do with the positioning of the dialog, it may be calculating the position of the dialog based on the size of the data that is being displayed. If the data is too large to display, that may put the dialog at a position that is theoretically outside the bounds of the Unit class's acceptable range of values. If the column is hidden, everything is fine, because the dialog would fit on the window, and the coordinates (specifically, the Top coordinate, as shown in your stack trace) would be negative. If it's displayed, the dialog would not, because it would stretch beyond the confines of the browser window. That's all just theory and speculation, but it's based on what we can see here.
