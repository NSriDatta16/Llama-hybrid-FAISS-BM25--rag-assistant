You can have a look at one-vs-one and one-vs-all ensemble leaners. For example, you can use an ensemble of logistic regression models. You could also explore support vector machines too. Your idea about one-hot encoding the classes isn't a bad idea. After the one-hot encoding you could instead consider multinomial regression rather than 5 distinct models. This assumes you can't have more than one class 'activated' at a time (mutually exclusive), so the probabilities assigned from the multinomial regression will sum to 1.
