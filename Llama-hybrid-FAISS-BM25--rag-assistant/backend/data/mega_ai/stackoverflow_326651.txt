As usual, " It Depends " :) If you have a stored procedure, for instance, that sends results to your presentation layer (whether a report, grid, etc.), it probably doesn't matter which method you go with. What I typically run across, though, are views which have sorting (because they were used directly by a report, for instance) but are also used by other views or other procedures with their own sorting. So as a general rule, I encourage others to do all sorting on the client-side and only on the server when there's reasonable justification for it.
