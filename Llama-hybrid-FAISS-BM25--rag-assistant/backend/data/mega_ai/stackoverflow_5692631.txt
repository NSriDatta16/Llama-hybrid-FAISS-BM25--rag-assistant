Where to get previous versions of iOS disk image?

I just became a member of iOS Developer Program and I'm reading the document iOS Developer Program User Guide. It says: Download the iOS Disk Image (.dmg) from the iOS Dev Center for the Apple device you are using. Well, in my Xcode Organizer, I can see two versions: 4.2.1(8C148) and 4.3.2(8H7). Suppose I want to test my application on previous version of iOS, say 4.0 or 3.x. Where can I find/download the iOS Disk Image(firmware) as the document says? Thanks.
