What's the advantage of multi-gpu training in real?

The decreasing speed of training loss is almost the same between one gpu and multi-gpu. After averaging the gradients, the only benefit from multi-gpu is that the model seems to see more data in the same time. But why average the gradients? Is it that the model is indeed feed with more data in the same time?
