The Sun JVM requires a lot of memory for HotSpot and it maps in the runtime libraries in shared memory. If memory is an issue consider using another JVM suitable for embedding. IBM has j9, and there is the Open Source "jamvm" which uses GNU classpath libraries. Also Sun has the Squeak JVM running on the SunSPOTS so there are alternatives.
