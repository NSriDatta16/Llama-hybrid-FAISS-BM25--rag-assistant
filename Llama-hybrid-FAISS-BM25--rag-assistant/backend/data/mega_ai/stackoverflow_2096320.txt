Don't try what others have suggested to "learn by doing". That is monkey-style learning. Human intelligence/knowledge has gone far beyond the point where for the most specimens of the species, it is still possible/productive to "learn by making mistakes". Trust me, if you just go down the "learn-exclusively-by-doing" path, the only thing you will end up doing is repeating the same mistakes that millions have already made before you. The only thing suggested in the other answers here that I can second, is "buy a good book". But "being a good book" does mean that it should give a thorough coverage of the theory . Otherwise you are likely to end up building database applications like the Romans built their aquaducts : by overdoing certain things "just to be on the safe side". (That is exactly what those Roman engineers did when they built those monuments that often still stand to this very day, in the absence of any knowledge/understanding of things such as gravity and the strenght of concrete spannings : they threw in a few dozens of extra bricks, without really knowing precisely whether they were really needed or not. But their world wasn't as economically competitive as ours.)
