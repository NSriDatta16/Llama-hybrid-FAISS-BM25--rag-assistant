custom slide to reveal toolbar

i want to do a custom toolbar, something like the slide to unlock of android phones. In idle state, the user can see a button of the bottom left of the page. the user would then tap it, drag towards the right. When the user reaches the right end, the toolbar will then 'lock'. Buttons would be located at the toolbar. I'm think of using a customview and touchmoved functions, but what I don't know how is how to make the view move with the touch, and how to actually lock the bar.
