You can look at time series cross-validation , but as you note, there is not overly much you can do with the results, since tbats() does not allow you to explicitly set parameters. You can, of course, determine based on your cross-validation whether or not to use a Box-Cox transformation or a trend etc. The help page ?tbats gives you a list of function parameters you can set.
