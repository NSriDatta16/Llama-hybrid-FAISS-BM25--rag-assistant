As this answer says in detail, the assumptions underlying the t-test only strictly hold when the individual data values are sampled from a normal distribution. Proportions are limited to values between 0 and 1, while values taken from a normal distribution can be any real number. And unlike a normal distribution, where the mean and variance of a sample are independent, once you know the proportion you have some information about the variance. So proportions don't meet the assumptions needed for a t-test to be valid. As you take more and more samples, however, the distribution of average values in most practical applications comes close to a normal distribution. The z-test is based directly on the normal distribution. So although the z-test might not be exact with very few observations it doesn't take very many observations for it to be a very good approximation.
