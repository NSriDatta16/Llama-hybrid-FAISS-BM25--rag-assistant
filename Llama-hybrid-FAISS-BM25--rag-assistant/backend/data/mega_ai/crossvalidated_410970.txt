Let $X_1$ and $X_2$ be random variables corresponding to the IQ of the mother and father. The average of their IQs also has a normal distribution with $$ Y_1 \equiv \frac{X_1 + X_2}{2} \sim \mathcal{N}(100, \frac{1}{4}(15.5 + 14.5 + 2\mathrm{Cov}(X_1, X_2)). $$ It's probably the case that $\mathrm{Cov}(X_1, X_2) \neq 0$ for parents of the child - you could include this in your simulations if you wished. Anyway, continue by letting $\sigma^2 = \frac{1}{4}(15.5 + 14.5 + 2\mathrm{Cov}(X_1, X_2))$ . Now if $Y_2$ is another random variable for the IQ of the child (say it's a girl) then the joint distribution of $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ is multivariate normal with $$ \begin{pmatrix} Y_1 \\ Y_2 \\ \end{pmatrix} \sim \mathcal{N}\left( \begin{pmatrix} 100 \\ 100 \\ \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} \sigma^2 & \mathrm{Cov}(Y_1, Y_2) \\ \mathrm{Cov}(Y_1, Y_2) & 14.5\\ \end{pmatrix} \right). $$ The off-diagonal covariance terms can be found by the definition of correlation $$ \frac{\mathrm{Cov}(Y_1, Y_2)}{\sqrt{14.5}\sqrt{\sigma^2}} = 0.5. $$ Now you can use the formula for the conditional distribution of the multivariate normal to find the distribution of $Y_2 | Y_1 = y_1$ where $y_1$ is the realisation of the parent's average IQ, which you have. This should give you a univariate distribution which can be simulated from easily (say using rnorm if you are using R.)
