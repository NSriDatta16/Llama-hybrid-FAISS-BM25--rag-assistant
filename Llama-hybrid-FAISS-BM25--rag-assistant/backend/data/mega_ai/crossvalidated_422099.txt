How to modify RMSE loss function to adopt for integer valued predictions, using a Neural Network?

Context: Prediction of dependent variables like Age, Siblings, Children, etc (which are not categorical, but bounded, and integer-valued) from a dataset using Neural Network. I'm experimenting with a simple network, and plan to train it using Gradient Descent for starters. While RMSE is a natural choice for minimization, the predictions currently are float values. I could probably round the predictions (or ceil/floor them) and calculate the loss (again using RMSE), but is that a correct approach?
