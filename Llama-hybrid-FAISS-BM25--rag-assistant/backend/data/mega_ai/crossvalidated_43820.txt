Outliers are usually thought of in relation to the model, as the comments already discuss. But that does not say anything about how they are generated: They can be rare events by the very process described by the model (roughly 1 in 10‚Åπ standard normally distributed numbers will be Usually, one doesn't care about the former, as the model is adequate for them. But with respect to the latter, you can simulate only things where you have an idea of the generating process. If you want unexpected rare events, there is no way but collecting data and waiting for them to occur. And IMHO it doesn't make sense to discuss this without discussing the underlying process/problem/task (not only the model). It is the very nature of these things that you cannot give a typical outlier. And you need to discuss the relevance of your outlier generating process to the model and problem. IMHO, the no free lunch theorem applies very much for outlier detection. Recommended reading ;-) "Journal of Machine Learning Gossip" Paper of which a few copies still float aroud in the net .
