Adjust for multiple comparisons in several mixed models

I am fitting several generalized mixed models with binomial family to model proportions data(dependent variable) and 3 factors.The data looks like this: Sample Day ligand Condition Conc1 Conc2 .... Conc10 1 1 A M 0.99 0.86 .... 0.0058 1 1 B M 0.96 0.85 .... 0.0024 1 1 C M 0.92 0.88 .... 0.0022 In each model I did post hoc analysis for comparing A vs B, A vs C, A vs D and A vs E for Day 1 and condition M and so on for all days and conditions separately using lsmeans with Tukey correction followed by contrast function in R. However, the it performed other comparisons like B vs C, B vs D, B vs E and so on which I am not interested in. 1) I am not quite sure how to give a contrast matrix for the comparisons that I am interested in with respect to each day and condition (for a three way comparison) 2) Is the Tukey correction applied with respect to all the other comparisons that I am not interested in? 3) Do I have to adjust again for the multiple comparisons across the models (across concentrations)?
