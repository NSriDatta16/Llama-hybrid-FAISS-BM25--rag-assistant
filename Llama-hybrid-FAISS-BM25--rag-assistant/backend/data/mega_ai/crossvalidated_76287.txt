Learn R. Absolutely, definitely do so. R is open source and I think will soon become the de facto standard for the statistics & machine learning. You also need to learn a scripting language and I would strongly recommend Perl. It doesn't have the fanciness of other languages but it is super powerful and guaranteed to be a solid return on invested time, not to mention the vast swath of packages that are already created for you on CPAN. Finally, you also need to get your hands on some books to learn statistics. Some of the best books in statistics, can be found here . Linear algebra is also a good to know but not necessary. If interested here is a list of books for learning linear algebra. HTH
