Learning curve of CNN model

I have a graph for a model on train accuracy and validation accuracy: But I'm having trouble interpreting it. By the way i interpreted, I would say it is of poor performance. But I would like to know how this graph is interpreted in a more broad manner. As in if we were to look at the point where the validation acc begins to bisect the train acc line, and went all the way down, what does this indicate? Would appreciate some help on this as I'm horrible at interpreting graphs.
