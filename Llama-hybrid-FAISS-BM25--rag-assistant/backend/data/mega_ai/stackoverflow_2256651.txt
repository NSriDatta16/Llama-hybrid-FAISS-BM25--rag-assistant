How to get principal name from HTTPRequest in CXF JAX-RS webservice method called from android app

How can I get the principal name, session and ideally check if the principal is authenticated with the Spring Security context inside a CXF JAX-RS webservice method receiving a call from an Android client? This is the code I am currently working with. I have commented where and what I am trying to get. Android code to call webservice: httpclient.getCredentialsProvider().setCredentials( new AuthScope("192.168.1.101", 80), new UsernamePasswordCredentials("joesmith", "mypasswd")); HttpGet httpget = new HttpGet(WEBSERVICE_URL+"/makePayload"); httpget.setHeader("User-Agent", userAgent); httpget.setHeader("Content-Type", "application/xml"); HttpResponse response; try { response = httpclient.execute(httpget); HttpEntity entity = response.getEntity(); ... parse xml from response } CXF, Spring webservice code: @GET @Path("/getPayload") @Produces("application/XML") public Response makePayload(@Context Request request){ //Get user principal name //Get session? //Get Spring security context? Payload payload = new Payload(); payload.setUsersOnline(new Long(200)); return Response.ok().entity(payload).build(); }
