Which Gantt chart/Project management tool would you recommend for linux?

I need a Project management tool that works in Linux, and has Gantt charts. It doesn't have to be free, just not expensive. I don't care how it stores the information I give it, as long as I can access it. I must be able to print the Gantt charts. Must work in Linux. With those requirements, what can you recommend? TheObserver asked a windows specific version of this question here . Thanks for the help everyone.
