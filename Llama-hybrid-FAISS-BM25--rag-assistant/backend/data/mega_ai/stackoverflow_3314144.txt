It depends on your application architecture. If your architecture is the good old "flock of php scripts" - PHP scripts called directly from the browser - then you'll be including it at the top of each script, one way or another. Most developers (and frameworks) these days marshall all their requests through /index.php one way or another, usually with some URL rewriting going on to make nice, pretty URLs for users to see. In this day and age, you should probably be doing the latter, or at least thinking about it. It leads to much better organization, and even more importantly, allows you to keep all your code outside of the web server's document root, which is a good security practice for several reasons that are outside the scope of this answer.
