Dynami's answer works but makes multiple passes through the data to get a result. This is a single pass method that calculates the sample standard deviation : public static double StdDev(this IEnumerable values) { double mean = 0.0; double sum = 0.0; double stdDev = 0.0; int n = 0; foreach (double val in values) { n++; double delta = val - mean; mean += delta / n; sum += delta * (val - mean); } if (1 This is the sample standard deviation since it divides by n - 1 . For the normal standard deviation you need to divide by n instead. This uses Welford's method which has higher numerical accuracy compared to the Average(x^2)-Average(x)^2 method.
