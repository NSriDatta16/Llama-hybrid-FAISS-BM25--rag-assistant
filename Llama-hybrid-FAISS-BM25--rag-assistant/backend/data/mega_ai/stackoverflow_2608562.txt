Working for 12 years in the printing industry, I ran into problems with customer fonts that wouldn't embed in PDF documents, which was required for our workflow. As it turns out, a lot of fonts are "freeware" and simply have badly formed portions, missing glyphs, etc. Also, font authors can sometimes mistakenly leave the tags enabled that prohibit embedding or printing, etc. The best course of action would be to contact the publisher or author of the font to see anything can be done. (Perhaps embedding was not meant to be denied.) There are tools like ttfpatch that can change the tags inside TTF fonts, but like many things, you could be violating a copyright if you use it incorrectly.
