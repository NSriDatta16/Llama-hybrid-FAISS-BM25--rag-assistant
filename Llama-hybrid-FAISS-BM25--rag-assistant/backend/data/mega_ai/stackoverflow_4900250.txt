I've never found an elegant solution to this; app builds I've done seem to sit better alongside rather than within CMS-managed content, using similar but copied HTML/JSP templates. Any presentation layer reuse you can get is a bonus! One particular issue is version control of app source code and DB structure/data, which is obviously A Good Thing. Other site content may not sit within source control (SVN, etc) and you sure as hell don't want to take that risk with your app... Having said all this, it's perhaps worth making a feature of such separation rather than apologising for it. Base your architecture around it prominently and design for a clean integration.
