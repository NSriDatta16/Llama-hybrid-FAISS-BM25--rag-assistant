Using XGBoost with Large Features for Yield Prediction

I have approximately 500 datasets and want to predict yield in one season (about 1000 dataset). I only have one kind of feature (20 years monthly rainfall) so there are 240 features I use. I got RMSE of 900 and average of data is about 4000-6000. Is it possible to prevent overfitting using small dataset? Thank you in advance
