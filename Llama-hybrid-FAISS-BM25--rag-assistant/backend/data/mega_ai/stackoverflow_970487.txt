Parsing text into sentences?

I am trying to parse text off of a PDF page into sentences but it is much more difficult than I had anticipated. There are a whole lot of special cases to consider such as initials, decimals, quotations, etc which contain periods but do not necessarily end the sentence. I was curious if anyone here was familiar with an NLP library for C or C++ that could help me out with this task or just offer any advice? Thank you for any help.
