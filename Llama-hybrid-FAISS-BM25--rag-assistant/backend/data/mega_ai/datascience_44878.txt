I would say that essentially they all have A definition of a cost function: A SINGLE number that determines how good/bad the algorithm is doing. It improves over time: Essentially ALL machine learning algorithms are a loop that runs for a number of iterations, over iterations, the cost defined in point (1) tends to decrease (maybe not at EVERY interation, but in the long term). If you think in those terms, you will see that ML algorithms match that: Linear and Logistic Regressions, Neural Networks, Random Forests...
