Fast restart technique instead of keeping the good state (availability and consistency)

How often do you solve your problems by restarting a computer, router, program, browser? Or even by reinstalling the operating system or software component? This seems to be a common pattern when there is a suspect that software component does not keep its state in the right way, then you just get the initial state by restarting the component. I've heard that Amazon/Google has a cluster of many-many nodes. And one important property of each node is that it can restart in seconds. So, if one of them fails, then returning it back to initial state is just a matter of restarting it. Are there any languages/frameworks/design patterns out there that leverage this techinque as a first-class citizen? EDIT The link that describes some principles behind Amazon as well as overall principles of availability and consistency: http://www.infoq.com/presentations/availability-consistency
