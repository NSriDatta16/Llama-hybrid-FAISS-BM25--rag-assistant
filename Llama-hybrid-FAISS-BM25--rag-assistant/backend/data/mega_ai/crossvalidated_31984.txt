Probability distribution of income

I create an agent-based simulation of some economic phoenomenon, and I need to assign each citizen a random income level. I want to select the income level using a probability distribution that approximates the realistic distribution of income in a modern economy. What distribution should I use? Does it make sense to use exponential distribution? NOTE: I am not looking for actual census data of a certain economy, but for a more general approximation.
