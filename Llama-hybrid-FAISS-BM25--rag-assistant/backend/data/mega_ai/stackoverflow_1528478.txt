I'm going to describe a solution using a database as the storage mechanism, you can use whatever works, but this will be easier to describe. Start I'd build a table that holds all of the "Pages" of the survey. This would just be used to group questions, and to define any requirements for display Second build a table to store every question in your form. This table should hold the base information about what the question is, it's type, answers (if predefined), etc. As well as any information specifying where predefined data might come from if it's dynamic. Third build a table/tables to hold your users data. Now that you have all of your data taken care of build a single web page that will load all users data for the form. Use the users data + session data to determine what "Page" from your database needs to be displayed. Using that information pull all questions for the "Page" being displayed and build them into an HTML form for display to the user. Your form should submit back to itself, could have multiple buttons to control Previous, Next functionality. If when your page loads it's been submitted you'll need to store any values POSTED before pulling your user data back out. That is how I'd solve this problem working from scratch. You can break many of these pieces up into various objects to help encapsulate your data and functionality. But your question to me sounds like you were lost as to where to start so hopefully this will help you solidify things.
