The classical approach to this kind of problem is a multilevel model . The basic idea is that the parameters of each cluster (machines, in your case) are treated as random variables themselves, coming from one or more higher-order distributions that are common to all the clusters. The practical consequence of using a multilevel model, compared to fitting a separate model for each cluster, is that parameters sharing a common distribution are estimated as being closer together in value. There's a rich frequentist toolbox for multilevel models, but they also work well with a Bayesian approach; the distributions of the random effects work just like prior distributions.
