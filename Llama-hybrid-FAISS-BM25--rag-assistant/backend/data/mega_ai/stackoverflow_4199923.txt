UIView, how to determine when touches entered the view

It appears that all the touch methods of a UIView are only called if the touches began within the bounds of that view. Is there a way to have a view respond to a user who has touched outside the view, but then dragged his fingers into the view? In case it matters, my specific application is for dragging a MKPinAnnotationView (using built-in 4.0 dragging). I want something to happen if the user drags a pin onto another view (which happens to be an AnnotationView as well, but it could be anything). No method for dragging is called until I let go of the pin; and no method no the UIView that's being dragged to seems to be called unless I started by touching from within the view. Because the superview is a MKMapView, it is difficult to just use the touchesMoved event of that and check if the user is in the right location or not. Thanks!
