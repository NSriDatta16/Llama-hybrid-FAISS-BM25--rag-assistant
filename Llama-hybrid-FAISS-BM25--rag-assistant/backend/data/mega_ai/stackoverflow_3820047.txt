How to easily link a document with others

let's say that in order for me to make clear how my program works or even for the own sake of documentation I am writing some text document in word or whatever text editor or online wit google docs, etc. Let's say that at some part of the document I open a new one and extend there the idea. Then later, I go back to the "master" document and add some hyperlink or just put reference (it follows in doc XXXX, page YYYY). I wonder what could be the fastest approach to do this * google docs adding easily hyperlink? but how can I organize docs effectively? * some text editor with this functionality? Thanks for your responses P.D. Are there easier solutions than WIKI's? In terms of easiness of installation and setup
