Post Some Clues! What do you mean by "fail"? Crash? Hang? Jettisoned for memory use? What are the symptoms of the failure? Got backtrace? Do you have anything in your code that behaves different in debug vs. release? Any #ifdef DEBUG type shenanigans? asserts with side effects? Did you mess with the compiler settings? Got C++? Assembly? I see a hint of a clue in the comments; illegal access of a variable. Most likely, this is caused by the optimizer re-using a stack slot more quickly in release than debug. Which, generally, boils down to an over-release issue. Even when building for release, you can still turn on zombie detection. Also, have you done a build and analyze and fixed any problems it indicates?
