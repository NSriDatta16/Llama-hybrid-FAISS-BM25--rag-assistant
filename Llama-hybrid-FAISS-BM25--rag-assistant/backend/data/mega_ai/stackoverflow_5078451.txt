NOTE: References are always scalar as they contain address (kind of to think neatly) When you create a nested data structure just remember that in perl we don't have to worry about how the space is allocated, how much space is allocated. It's pretty neat to handle anonymous storage of it's own. But, Always remember the thumb rules for creating such storage like this, To create an anonymous array, use square brackets instead of parentheses: $ra = [ ]; To create an anonymous hash, use braces instead of square brackets: $rh = { }; And that's all there is. Now, What you wrote was something like this, my %h={}; You are essentially creating a hash and initializing it with a reference which is a scalar. That's why your program complained about this, Just remove that line and rewrite your code like this, #!/usr/bin/perl use strict; use warnings; my $h={"1" => { a => -1, b => -1, c => [ { d => -1, e => -1, }, ], } }; Perl will take care of the rest.. Enjoy Perl :) :)
