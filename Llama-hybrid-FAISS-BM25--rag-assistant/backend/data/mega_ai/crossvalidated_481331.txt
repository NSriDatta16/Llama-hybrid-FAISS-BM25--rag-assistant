Unexpected behaviour of logit regression with glm in R

I recently was puzzled by the behaviour of R's glm when trying to compute a logistic regression data The output tells me that there is apparently no difference in my predictors Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 20.57 1253.73 0.016 0.987 predictorB -20.81 1253.73 -0.017 0.987 predictorC -41.13 1773.04 -0.023 0.981 When I compute glm with repsonse values where not all values are ones or zeros in predictors "A" and "C" respectively, I receive results as I had expected them. data2 |z|) (Intercept) 2.9444 0.3244 9.075 I suspect it has something to do with the link function, but I can't really pinpoint it. Has anyone experienced this and can offer an explanation for the observed behaviour?
