Edit: hmm. I just noticed that the 'embedded' you seem to be describing is not about adding an automation language to an application, but squeezing an application into an embedded platform. As others suggest, unless you really need it, skip embeddable languages and program your application in C. There is nearly no runtime overhead for that, except for what you actually use. In no particular order, Lua, JavaScript and TCL are all quite well suited to embedding. Lua has been the easiest for me to embed. Javascript might be the fastest. All three have good handling for untrusted code, but TCL's is most robust, for example, untrusted code can run untrusted code (if it's trusted to do that much).
