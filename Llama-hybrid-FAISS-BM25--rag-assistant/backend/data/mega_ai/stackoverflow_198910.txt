How can I add an image to my Run for a RichTextBlock?

I wrote a small WPF app where I like to prepend text into a RichTextBox, so that the newest stuff is on top. I wrote this, and it works: /// /// Prepends the text to the rich textbox /// /// The text representing the character information. private void PrependSimpleText(string textoutput) { Run run = new Run(textoutput); Paragraph paragraph = new Paragraph(run); if (this.RichTextBoxOutput.Document.Blocks.Count == 0) { this.RichTextBoxOutput.Document.Blocks.Add(paragraph); } else { this.RichTextBoxOutput.Document.Blocks.InsertBefore(this.RichTextBoxOutput.Document.Blocks.FirstBlock, paragraph); } } Now I would like to make a new version of that function which can add small images as well. I'm at a loss though - is it possible to add images?
