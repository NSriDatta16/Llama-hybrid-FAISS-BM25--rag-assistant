Exponentiated logistic regression coefficient different than odds ratio

As I understand it, the exponentiated beta value from a logistic regression is the odds ratio of that variable for the dependent variable of interest. However, the value does not match the manually calculated odds ratio. My model is predicting stunting (a measure of malnutrition) using, amongst other indicators, insurance. // Odds ratio from LR, being done in stata logit stunting insurance age ... etc. or_insurance = exp(beta_value_insurance) // Odds ratio, manually calculated odds_stunted_insured = num_stunted_ins/num_not_stunted_ins odds_stunted_unins = num_stunted_unins/num_not_stunted_unins odds_ratio = odds_stunted_ins/odds_stunted_unins What is the conceptual reason for these values being different? Controlling for other factors in the regression? Just want to be able to explain the discrepancy.
