Do you know what a web service is? I think you might just mean a web application . And you don't mean management (pretty much a completely useless term; it's used everywhere for everything) you mean you want a drag-and-drop web interface creation/maintenance tool. That might help to get your terminology right, if I'm right in my guesses about what you want. If you're confused about those terms then that implies a certain level of understanding. You may need to know more about computing and modern web technologies before you progress. But happy Googling :)
