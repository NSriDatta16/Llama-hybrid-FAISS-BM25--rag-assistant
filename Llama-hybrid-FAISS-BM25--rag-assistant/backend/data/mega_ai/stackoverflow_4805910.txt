Table width occupies 100% of page, and I need table on the same row with other elements

I can't get over what appears to be a simple CSS formatting problem in Chrome: I want to put a table towards the right, and a label and some buttons toward the left, inside the same paragraph. This works easy enough in other browsers (Firefox, IE7 & 8), but in Chrome the table stretches over the entire page, under the label. HTML: Thing is, I've tried just about any trick I found to get the table limited at 200px: I tried assigning table-layout: fixed , which, in conjunction with width , should have limited my table to 208px; I tried wrapping the table in a div and setting the div inline, to limit the table this way I tried styling the grid with display: inline; and then setting max-width: 208px; (you might know that max-width only applies to inline or block, and table is neither of those.) What's really annoying for me is that if I go in the console and try to get width for the table, it does tell me 208; but when I look in the compiled properties for the table, it displays 0px;
