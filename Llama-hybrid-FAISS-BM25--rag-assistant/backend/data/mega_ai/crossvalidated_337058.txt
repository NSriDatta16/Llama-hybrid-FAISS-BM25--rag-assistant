Information Criterion usage to determine number of PCA factors

I'm reading Ng and Bai 2002: Determining the Number of Factors in Approximate Factor Models and on the top of page 201 they say: Let $\sigma$ by a consistent estimate of $(NT)^{-1}\sum_{N}\sum_{T} E(e_{ij})^2$ and then provide a set of Information Criterion using $\sigma$ and $V(k,F^{k})$. They then define $V(k,F^{k})$ slightly below that as $N^{-1}\sum_{N}\sigma_i$ where $\sigma_i = e_i'*e_i/T$ where $e_i$ are the error vectors associated with column i. My question is what is the difference between $V(k,F^k)$ and $\sigma$? Thanks for your help
