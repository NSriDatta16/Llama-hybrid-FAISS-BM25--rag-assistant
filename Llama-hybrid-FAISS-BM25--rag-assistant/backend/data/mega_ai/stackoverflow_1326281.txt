Using 'metaphors' is a common theme in agile (and pattern) literature. 'Children' (in your question) is an example of a metaphor that is extensively used and for good reasons. So, I'd encourage the use of metaphors, provided they are applicable and not a stretch of the imagination. Metaphors are everywhere in computing. From files to bugs to pointers to streams... you can't avoid them.
