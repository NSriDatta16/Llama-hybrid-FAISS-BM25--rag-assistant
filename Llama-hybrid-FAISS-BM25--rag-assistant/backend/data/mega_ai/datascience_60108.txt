Understanding the ||w|| = 1 constraint for SVMs

Is it correct to say that the reason why ||w|| is set to 1 in the formula for the geometric margin is that it then is the same as the functional margin (i. e. gives the same information) while still being scale invariant? I come to that from this site: Support Vector Machine (SVM) where it says "If ||w||=1, the functional margin is equal to geometric margin. " If not, then why can ||w|| not be set to 0.7 oder 2.53 or 14? I have read various blogs and pdfs on the topic. Some don't adress this at all or just say things along the lines of "this is a mathematical trick" and don't really explain it.
