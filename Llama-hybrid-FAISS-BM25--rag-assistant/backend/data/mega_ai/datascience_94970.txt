Stability of clusters in a unsupervised machine learning

I am new to Unsupervised learning. I am working on a customer segmentation data (with no labels). I have done K-Means and also calculated the silhouette score for the model. Now I want to study, if the model is good or not (similarity or stability for clusters) using Adjusted Rand Index. Can anyone give an idea how to do it, as I have have only the cluster labels which I believe are 'labels'. In the formula of RAND score, we need the "labels_true, labels" what should be the first one. I have checked on the internet, but not much is available. By the way, I am using Python. Thank you.
