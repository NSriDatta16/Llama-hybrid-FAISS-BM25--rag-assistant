Android OpenGL ES missing some components?

I'm trying to run the "HelloTriangle" example, from The OpenGL ES 2.0 Programming Guide , in the Android emulator. I import egl.EGLConfig and opengles.GL10 from javax.microedition.khronos , but the ESContext type and definitions such as GL_COMPILE_STATUS and GL_FRAGMENT_SHADER can't be resolved. I reworked the triangle example somewhat for Android in that I'm using GLSurfaceView . I understand that it is supposed to be used instead of OpenGLContext in the newer versions of the SDK. Am I using a "non-Android" approach to OpenGL ES ? If so, what's the right one?
