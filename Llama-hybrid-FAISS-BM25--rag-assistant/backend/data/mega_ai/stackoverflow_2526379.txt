Yes you can simply detach and attach your database when upgrading from 32-bit to 64-bit Windows. I have done an x86->x64 conversion in the past and did not have any problems. There is no problem because the storage layer is the same for both SQL x86 and x64. Microsoft says here : The SQL Server on-disk storage format is the same in the 64-bit and 32-bit environments. Therefore, attach works across 32-bit and 64-bit environments. A database detached from a server instance running in one environment can be attached on a server instance that runs in another environment. So to answer your question, if you: Created a database on an x64 MS SQL Server Created a database on an x86 MS SQL Server and moved it to the x64 MS SQL Server Both Option #1 and #2 would result in the same end state. There is no such distinction between an x86 database and an x64 database. From 2005 to 2008 there is a compatibility mode that is used. But for x86 to x64 there is no difference.
