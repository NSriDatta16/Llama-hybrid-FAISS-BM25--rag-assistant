I am looking forward to any answers you'll get on this topic, but in the meantime why not just hop over to Amazon (or your local books dealer) and finally buy Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software , Gang of Four Patterns of Enterprise Architecture , Martin Fowler Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software , Eric Evans These book contain the original patterns you have been pointed at in various of your questions and are considered reference works in Design Patterns and Software Architecture.
