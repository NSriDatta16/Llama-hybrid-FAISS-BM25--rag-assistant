The XtraGrid doesn't have any built-in mechanisms to create a data source from a SQL statement. For me, the easiest way to accomplish this is to simply create a static method that builds and returns a DataTable/DataSet from a SQL statement. I can then set the XtraGrid's data source to the results of this method.
