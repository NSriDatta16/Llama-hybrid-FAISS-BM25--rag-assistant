The python NLTK library does natural language parsing, including building parse trees which include whether a word is a verb, noun, tense etc. Perhaps you could take these trees and re-organize them according to some simple rules you come up with and verify. I don't think you would need too many rules before the results of your program are very different from the source document. Some example rules: Replace words with synonyms active voice to passive voice and vice-versa (The hunter saw the deer -> the deer was seen by the hunter) http://www.nltk.org/
