Now() In ODBC SQL Query?

I'm trying to update a database field to the current time, but can't pass "now()". I get the following error: '`now`' is not a recognized built-in function name. The method I'm using to query the database is as follows: Public Sub main() Dim cnn As ADODB.Connection Dim rst As ADODB.Recordset Set cnn = New ADODB.Connection Set rst = New ADODB.Recordset cnn.Open "ConnectionName" rst.ActiveConnection = cnn rst.CursorLocation = adUseServer rst.Source = "Update Table ..." rst.Open Set rst = Nothing Set cnn = Nothing End Sub
