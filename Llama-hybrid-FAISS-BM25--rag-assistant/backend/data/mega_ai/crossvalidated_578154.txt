Sampling a Parameter Space with a Neural Network versus other Methods

I have heard a lot about neural networks as an approach to sampling a large parameter space in aim of finding the space of model parameters that match a dataset. I've done some research online, but almost all articles or writings on neural networks are not welcoming to a person without some experience with it. I would like to know what a neural network is, and more specifically, how it primarily differs from other traditional approaches to sampling a parameter space such as MCMC. What is the largest difference between MCMC and a convolutional neural network? What about the difference between Nested Sampling and a convolutional neural network?
