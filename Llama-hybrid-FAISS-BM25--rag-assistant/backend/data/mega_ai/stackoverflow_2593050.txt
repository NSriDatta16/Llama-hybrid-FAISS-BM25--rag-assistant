Use blob-leasing feature in the Azure cloud app

I want to use blob-leasing mechanism in my Windows Azure cloud app. I am using the StorageClient api released by Azure team for my blob transactions. However, the blob-leasing is not implemented in the StorageClient api and hence I need to implement it on my own. Has anyone done this before and has any pointers on how to do it? Thanks. Kapil
