Cross Correlation Function: How to handle an Auto-correlated response variable

I am attempting to perform a CCF analysis between a predictor time series(P_a_cm) and a response time series (delta_total_cm) which represent annual precipitation and annual water table elevation change (one observation per year), respectively. My task is to asses if water table elevation change is dependent on precipitation inputs AND if precipitation inputs from antecedent years have any effect on a given years water table elevation change. When looking at the the acf/pacf for the predictor I find no auto-correlation and have also determined the time series to be stationary. The response time series on the other hand produces the following acf/pacf plots... My understanding is that these plots are indicating auto-correlation at lag 1 for this time series. I have found plenty of information on prewhitening, however it always assumes there is auto-correlation or a trend in the predictor, which you would account for and then use to filter your response variable. My question is do I need to do anything about the auto-correlation in the response time series or can I safely run the ccf simply using the two original time series? When i do this, it returns... I feel the correlation at lag -1 is likely a result of this auto-correlation. I attempted to apply an AR(1) to the response time series and then filter the predictor using that model, however, it resulted in a CCF that suggested hydrologicly implausible relationships. Any direction would be greatly appreciated.
