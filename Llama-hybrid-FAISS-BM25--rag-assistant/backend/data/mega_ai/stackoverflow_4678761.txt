Detecting Android Malware using Support Vector Machines (SVM)

I'm trying to develop an application capable to detect malicious application for Android platform using Support Vector Machines (SVM). I can get many system information from "logcat" and "strace" tools but I don't now how to manage to detect real malicious applications. Does anyone know how to stablish/record normal behavior use of the device using those tools, I mean, get information from the device and set a behaviour pattern. Best regards
