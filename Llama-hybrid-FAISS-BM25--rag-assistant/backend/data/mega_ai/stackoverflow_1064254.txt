What are some good open source c# examples of quality domain models

I'm a pretty young developer, and still in the emulation phase of my career. I have read a lot about some topics like concurrency, and using unit of work to allow your business layer to control persistence transactions. I have even implemented some painful, but functional code that implements these topics. But I have not really ever seen a real world example of a truly elegant implementation. I don't have a lot of good TDD, pattern focused role models around me, so I'm forced to look at the outside world for guidance. So, I'm looking for some stellar examples of open source enterprise app domain models. Preferably written in c#, but other languages would be fine as well as long as they are good examples of clean elegant domain model solutions. Some of the things I would really like to see are elegant solutions for Concurrency, Business Rules and Object Validation, Transactions / Unit of Work, and semi transparent logging mechanisms. I'm also curious to see what some of the real world best practices are for exception handling in domain model code. I know I could just start tearing into some open source projects at random, and try to decipher the good from the bad, but I was hoping the expert community here would have some good ideas of projects to look at to stream line the effort. Thanks for your time. Edit I'm not really interested in frameworks that make design and construction easier. My choice of framework, or whether to use a framework is a necessary consideration, but is entirely separate from my question here. Unless those frameworks are themselves open source, and very good examples to dig through. What I am looking for is a project that 'got it right', solving a real world problem with code that is flexible, and easily maintainable, so that I can see with my own eyes, and understand an example of how it should be done that is not a trivial 50 line tutorial example.
