Best and shortest books on C++/STL/C#/J2SE to prepare for job inteview/tests

I am a software developer with 10+ years commercial experience, I am comfortable with nearly all of imperative languages. But I realized that most of employers prefer not candidates who is able to deliver good software but those who is trained to answer questions like "what are ten differences between pointers and references in C++" or "what this messy code fragment will print". Last time I have read a book on C++ 15 years ago in secondary school and yes, that was Bjarne Stroustrup. But today I need something quick, without long philosophical explanations about polymorphism etc but with focus to silly interview tests. So, can you recommend any short and effective books to refresh my theoretical knowledge? Thank you.
