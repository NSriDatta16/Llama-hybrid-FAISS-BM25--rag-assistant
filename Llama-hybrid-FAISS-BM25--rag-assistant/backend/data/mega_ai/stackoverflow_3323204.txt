1) I'd be surprised if you found a public SMTP server to do this as it would just be used heavily as a spam relay. 2) A lot of residential ISPs do block SMTP traffic from leaving their network. However, they are doing this by blocking port 25 so if you host your own SMTP server on an alternate port it won't get blocked except in the most extreme cases. 3) see below I see two items you have to address: Getting the message from the sender to you Conrad's suggestion of using a web service is a good one as it gives you more control over the transport of the message to you. You can implement whatever authentication you deem necessary to make sure the person sending the message is legit. You could use SMTP to send the messages through a mail server hosted by you, but would need to focus on knowing who to safely allow to send and who not to so you don't end up as a spam relay. Sending the message from you to the recipient You can still send the message to the final recipient via SMTP to their mail host. I would suggest sending the email with the from as your application (ex: mailagent@myapplication.com) and define the reply-to address for your original sender. If you try using their address in the from, you will get more spam rejections. If I understood your description, the messages will only be being sent to other users of the application? If so, you could take the web service route on both parts of the communication. Sender delivers the message to your centralized server over a web service call, when the recipient user opens the software, it checks with your server to see if there are any messages waiting for them. EDIT: Yes, the part on the destination emails, I could read it both ways, guess I leaned toward the wrong one. You will have to deliver the messages in the end via smtp, I still suggest using your own from and put the sender in the reply-to unless these are corporate customers that you can get to add your smtp server to their SPF records. Also, investigate specific major mail targets like Yahoo! and GMail for how to interact with them such as: http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=81126 http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/mail/postmaster/postmaster-15.html http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/mail/postmaster/bulkv2.html
