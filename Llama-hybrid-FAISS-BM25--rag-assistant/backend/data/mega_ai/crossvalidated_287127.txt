How can I show that Uniform($0,A$) ,as $A \to \infty$, is an improper denisty?

I am very new to Bayesian statistics and I wanted to know how could I show that Uniform($0,A$) ,as $A \to \infty$, is an improper density? I mean the Uniform($0,A$) ,as $A \to \infty$ density is given by $ \lim_{A \to \infty}f(x)=\frac{1}{A} \mathbb{1}_{[0,A]}=0$ and hence it doesnt integrate to 1 and therefore improper based on the definition I found here Does "improper" posterior or prior refer to a density function that does not integrate to 1 or to one that does not integrate to a finite value? Am I wrong?
