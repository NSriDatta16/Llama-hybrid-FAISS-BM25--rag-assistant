You can use various frameworks such as PDO, PEAR::MDB2 or Zend_Db, but to be honest in 12 years of PHP development, I've never had to transition from one type of data storage infrastructure to another. Its exceedingly rare to even go from something quite similar like Sqlite, to MySQL. If you did do more than that, you'd have far larger problems anyway.
