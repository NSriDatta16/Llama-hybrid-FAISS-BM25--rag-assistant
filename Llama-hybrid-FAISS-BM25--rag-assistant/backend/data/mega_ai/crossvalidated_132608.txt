My option is that manual cleaning is a perfectly acceptable part of a machine learning pipeline, so long as it is treated the same as any other pre-processing step (e.g. centering, scaling, PCA, imputation) and tested in your cross-validation. In other words, it's ok for the human to clean test data for which they do not know the labels and then provide that data to the machine for prediction. In this case, your test error is of the human + machine classification system. Of course, in reality, humans tend to peek at the answers when they work with the data.
