Meaning? In logistic regression, testing "linearly related to log odds" results in a perfect 45 deg line, not a scatter plot

Running glm(Cond1 ~ Level, data = Data1, family="binomial") , I'm testing the assumption that B is linearly related to the log odds. I'm getting a straight 45 degree line (not a scatter plot). What does this mean? I'm using the plot code from here: http://www.sthda.com/english/articles/36-classification-methods-essentials/148-logistic-regression-assumptions-and-diagnostics-in-r/ The resulting plots they show are scatterplots. The only difference in the code is the name of my dataset (Data1) in the first line, below. mydata % dplyr::select_if(is.numeric) predictors % mutate(logit = log(probabilities/(1-probabilities))) %>% gather(key = "predictors", value = "predictor.value", -logit) ggplot(mydata, aes(logit, predictor.value))+ geom_point(size = 0.5, alpha = 0.5) + geom_smooth(method = "loess") + theme_bw() + facet_wrap(~predictors, scales = "free_y") > head(Data1) # A tibble: 6 x 2 Cond1 Level 1 No 217. 2 Yes 226. 3 No 317. ...
