How to run with old version of Junit 4 in Eclipse (Galileo)

We need to run unit tests with an older version of JUnit4 (for arcane reasons). Eclipse has a choice between Junit3 and Junit4, but there is no way to add/change the Junit4 version. A temporary work around was to copy the junit plugin from Eclipse Ganymede, but this gets clobbered when Galileo updates itself. It looks as far as the update manager JUnit is part of a larger update. I see no way to manage it via the update manager or elsewere.
