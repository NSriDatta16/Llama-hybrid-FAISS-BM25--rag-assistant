No. Half of the area under a signal-detection curve need not correspond to whatever you believe unacceptably high risk is. Presumably, by "risk" you mean "probability". In this case you want a probabilistic classifier such as a logistic-regression model (but not an SVM, at least without added machinery to produce a probability estimate) so you can estimate the probability of an error for each case. Then you can judge whether the probability is unacceptably high. An alternative way to look at this task is in terms of ordinary classification rather than probabilistic classification, but with an asymmetric loss function. You can use any binary classifier for which you can choose the loss function. Choose the loss function to reflect how bad false alarms are compared to misses in declaring an error.
