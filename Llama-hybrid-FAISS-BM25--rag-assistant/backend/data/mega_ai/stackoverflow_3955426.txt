There are different java libraries for different purposes. Java ME for instance, is designed for cell phones / mobile devices. You'll probably be fine with java SE, unless you need some of the features from EE. Depending on how complex your data storage is going to be, you may not even need a "database." In java, any object which implements the "serializable" interface can be written directly to a file. So, if you're just trying to store things such as user settings, etc, you can create an object to store them, implement Serialiazable, and write it to disc. Only if your application links to code libraries which you don't want packaged in the same directory. You can package it as a self-executing JAR from netbeans, it'll be similar in function to an .exe (Shrug.) If you are careful not to use operating system specific paths, a self-executing jar will work immediately on any operating system with the JVM installed. There may be a couple other quirks, but Java is built to be extremely portable.
