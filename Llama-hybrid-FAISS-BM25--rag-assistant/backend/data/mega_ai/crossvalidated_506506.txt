Is it possible to generate an 1D dimensional output of a 2D convolutional layer in Keras?

I'm trying to apply convolutional neural networks for dealing with a 2D input, which is a 2X300 matrix. It is basically a matrix with 2 lines, where each line is a vector of 300 positions. I would like to apply a kernel of size 2X1 (two lines and one column). The idea is to apply the kernel to each position i of the two vectors. Intuitively, I think that this convolution operation would generate an output of size 1X300. That is, I think that the output will be an unidimensional vector with 300 columns. Am I right? I would like to include a convolutional layer like this: layers.Conv2D(10, kernel_size=(2, 1), activation="relu",name="conv1") That makes sense? Will this layer generate a one-dimensional vector of 300 positions?
