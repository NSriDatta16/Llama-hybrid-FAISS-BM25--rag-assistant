Gaussian processes work well. They'll give you as output not only a curve through your cloud of points, but: it'll give you a curve of the uncertainty of the curve. ie, you'll have an approximate upper and lower bound for the curve in areas where you have more data, the uncertainty will go down; in areas with less data the uncertainty will increase the curve will be more or less confident about trading off bias and variance, depending on how much data there is for some particular region You can look at Figure 2 from "Gaussian Processes for Regression: a Quick Introduction", by Ebden 2008, http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~mebden/reports/GPtutorial.pdf , for example, see below. The shaded pink area represents the uncertainty. The black dots are data points, and the black curve is the curve fit by the Gaussian Process: There's also a recent article in Wired about Ghahramani's work on using GPs in machine learning https://www.wired.com/2017/02/ai-learn-like-humans-little-uncertainty/
