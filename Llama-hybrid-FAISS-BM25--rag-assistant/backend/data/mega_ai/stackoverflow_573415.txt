For a fraction of the effort of installing and maintaining a new file management scheme, I would buy more hard drives. I was at Frys last night and they were selling a 1 TB external drive for $100; it's a USB drive, all you need to do is plug it in. If it gets filled up, just buy another one. Speaking as a developer, I'd be surprised if your shop really wants to hold on to the builds indefinitely -- I suspect the value of the nightly builds would be low after some number of months. This is not an elegant solution but it may be more cost effective.
