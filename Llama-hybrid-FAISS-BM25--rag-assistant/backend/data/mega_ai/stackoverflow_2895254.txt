You're not responding to NSOutlineView's drag-validation message. Your original code implemented tableView:validateDrop:proposedRow:proposedChildIndex: . As I pointed out on that question, that's wrong when your table view is an outline view; NSOutlineView will not send a table-view drag-validation message, only an outline-view drag validation message. You've since changed your drag-validation method to be declared like so: - (NSDragOperation)outlineView:(NSOutlineView*)view validateDrop:(id )info proposedRow:(int)row proposedChildIndex:(NSInteger)index But nothing actually sends such a message. Remember that NSOutlineView rarely deals with row indexes, since those can change as parent rows are expanded and collapsed. It deals instead with “items”, which are generally model objects. Therefore, the correct validation method is: - (NSDragOperation)outlineView:(NSOutlineView*)view validateDrop:(id )info proposedItem:(id)item proposedChildIndex:(NSInteger)index Notice the name of the third component of the selector, and the type and name of the argument that goes with it. With this change applied, your data source validates drops.
