The help page on nnet does cover this fairly well, but here's a brief synopsis: Softmax applies to multinomial responses. You have a binary response which is just a special case of multinomial. Entropy causes nnet() to solve a loss function similar to logistic regression. If you don't specify entropy, then nnet() is doing an odd sort of least squares on binary outcomes. If there are only two classes, entropy and softmax should give the same answer (but you'd have to set your PRNG seeds before being able to confirm this.)
