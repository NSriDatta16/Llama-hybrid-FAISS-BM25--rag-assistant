As an analogous example: The field of medicine is rather broad branching from neurology to oncology. But practitioners will always have a baseline of knowledge, after which they pursue their own specialization. Building that baseline knowledge is very important. Thing such as OOP concepts, MVC, coding best practices, etc. should be clear to you. My advice: Pick a language/platform, and be really good at it. Be a Python wizard or a Java guru. The knowledge you gain from that is transferable to other platforms you will learn. Since you are in the beginning of your career path, progressively master one/two platforms at time then you can start jumping to learn other platforms. Too much fragmentation is also bad in relation to adopting new skills especially if you're new to it. Jumping from one platform to platform garbles one's knowledge forcing you to re-learn or review often. So again, have that baseline knowledge developed. Your skill-set will progressively and surely broaden overtime. Don't rush to eat the whole pie or you'll choke.
