The rationale behind why derivedClass members get initialized is because if derivedClass has any virtual functions that override those declared in baseClass and those members reference data members of derivedClass , the initialization must occur or, when those functions are invoked, the results will be undefined. In general, you won't be using inheritance unless you are trying to have polymorphic classes. If the derived classes couldn't have their own state, then the base class would have to guess all of the possible data needed in derived classes, which would be a brittle, fragile approach to design.
