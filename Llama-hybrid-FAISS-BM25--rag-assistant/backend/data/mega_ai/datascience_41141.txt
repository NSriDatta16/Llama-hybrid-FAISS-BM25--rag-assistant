MATLAB has known for it's memory consumption. So even if you use same data for processing in Python overall system memory utilization will be less in Python. Based on my experience so far using Python helped me dealing more data with better performance. One other hand Python have many libraries/Frameworks out of box to further enhance the overall performance and Machine Learning/ Deep Learning (I am not much sure if similar Libraries & Frameworks are available in Matlab also).
