It sounds like you are asking about machine learning applied to Edge computing and IoT systems. In industrial settings, on-board computing capability has been A fact and requirement for, well, at least over a decade already. Companies who specialize in designing and implementing value adding IoT systems to such settings (e.g networked flow meters in oil and gas fields, networked sensors in chemical manufacturing facilities, etc) have been taking data processed through logic within the on-board computer and transmitting that data (usually intermittently) to the cloud for processing, dashboards and similar. From what I understand though, handling machine learning on-board is a much newer concept but is being done now. As the amount of data being handled by each system and the speed required to ensure synchronized operation of IoT systems increases rapidly, this sort of "Machine learning computing on the edge" capability is getting a lot of attention. Here is an example of a solution released by Google in 2018: https://cloud.google.com/edge-tpu/ I am aware that this doesn't fully meet the requirement of being trained at the edge, it does seem to be an example of the integrated approach you are hinting. Also, IoT technology already feeds data to cloud based Machine learning training efforts. It seems that IoT technology has been compiling and uploading database entries on the cloud for use in training models for some time now.
