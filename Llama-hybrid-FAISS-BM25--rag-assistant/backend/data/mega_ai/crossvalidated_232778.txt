statistical model for correlated error term

If I have a ($p$-dimensional) statistical model, say, $Y_i=X_i+Z_i$ with $i=1,\cdots,n$ observations, where $X_i$ is the true signal and $Z_i$ is the noise term, independent with $X_i$, and $Y_i$ is the observation. If $Z_i$'s are iid normal (mean zero), then the covariance of $Z$ is $I_p$ (well, $\sigma^2 I_p$, assume $\sigma=1$) (and thus $cov(Y)=cov(X)+I_p$). For example, $$I_p=\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 &0 & 0\\0 & 1 & 0& 0\\0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\0&0&0&1\end{bmatrix}.$$ Now, if I want to impose some spatial structure to the $p$-dimensional features $1$ to $p$, say, $X^{(j)}$ is more correlated with the feature (indexed) close to it. For example, $$\Sigma_p=\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0.5 &0.25 & 0\\0.5 & 1 & 0.5& 0.25\\0.25 & 0.5 & 1 & 0.5\\0&0.25&0.5&1\end{bmatrix}.$$ My question is: is there any statistical model that models this kind of error? Is it something like moving average (MA(q))?
