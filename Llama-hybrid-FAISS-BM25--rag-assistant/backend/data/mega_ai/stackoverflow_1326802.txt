I'm surprised that your benchmarking revealed the use of multiple separate expressions to be faster, and I'd be curious to see an example of the regexes you are using. Basic regular expressions (i.e. without advanced features like backtracking) can be compiled to "finite state machines" whose speed is O(n) relative to the length of the string being searched, and unrelated to the length of the pattern. So, running 10 difference regular expressions should on average need 10 times longer than a single regular expression which combines those patterns with "|". (I know this is an old question from march, but I couldn't resist adding my 2 cents :)
