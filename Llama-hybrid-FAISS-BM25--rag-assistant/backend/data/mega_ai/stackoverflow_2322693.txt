How can I embed a webpage within another and isolate CSS

I need to embed one webpage within another, the inner page will be wrapped by a and not contain the , or stuff like that, however, the inner page can contain 's to CSS that I don't want to affect the outer page I currently fetch the HTML with AJAX and insert it into the outer DOM, to workaround the styles conflicting I extract any links prior to embedding into the DOM, fetch that CSS with AJAX, parse the styles and apply them inline using jQuery selectors. That has obvious problems with things like pseudo-selectors, however, the main problem is that styles from the outer page affect the inner page, I cant reasonably reset every possible style, and I need to access the inner pages dom so using an iframe is out of the question. Its a fairly complex setup, but I was wondering if anyone had seen anything along similar lines or had a nicer approach. Cheers Dale
