From the documentation, B is the Pr(x=1) , which is confusing if it is read in terms of a conversion rate rather than a binary covariate in a logistic regression model. It took a minute to click for me as well. If you are running an A/B test, x=1 if the customer is exposed to the treatment and x=0 if the customer is exposed to the baseline. Consider the following model, $y_i \sim Binomial(n,p_i) \\ logit(p_i) = \alpha + \beta x_i$ If you set B=0.5 , you are simply stating that the customer is exposed to the treatment at the same frequency as the baseline, so $x_i=1$ half the time. If you set B=0.25 , then $x_i=1$ 1/4 of the time. library(powerMediation) # B = 0.5 n
