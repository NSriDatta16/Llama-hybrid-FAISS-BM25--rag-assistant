Calculate frequency of 1D time series using autoregressive model parameters

I'm modeling some periodic data with a second-order autoregressive model, as follows: $$ x_3 = a_{1}x_1 + a_{2}x_2 $$ $$ x_4 = a_{1}x_2 + a_{2}x_3 $$ $$ ... $$ $$ x_n = a_{1}x_{n-2} + a_{2}x_{n-1} $$ I'm modeling the raw data here (imagine $x_i$ as a scalar pixel value, say, for $n$ time points) so I'm not worried about error terms, at least not yet. I can set this up as a system of equations and solve for the parameters $a_1$ and $a_2$. Is there any way to determine the frequency of this 1D datasets using the calculated AR parameters, since the system intrinsically models harmonic oscillators? I'm actually trying to avoid using fourier transforms, if possible. Thanks!
