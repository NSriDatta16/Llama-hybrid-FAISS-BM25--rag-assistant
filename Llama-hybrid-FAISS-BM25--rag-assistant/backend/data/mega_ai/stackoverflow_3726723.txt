The best resources you will find are: Module Creator extension Branko's blog post on writing a custom module The official Magento wiki article And of course the great set of articles written by Stack Overflower Alan Storm which will help you understand the complex architecture that you are plugging into with your custom module. Finally, searching Stack Overflow will help a lot! The Magento forums are full of pretty poor advice, be wary of editing core files and other bad practices... HTH, JD
