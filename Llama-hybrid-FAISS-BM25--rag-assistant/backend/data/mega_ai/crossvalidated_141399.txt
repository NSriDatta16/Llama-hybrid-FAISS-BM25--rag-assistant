I'm definitely not an expert on anomaly detection . However, it's an interesting area and here's my two cents. First, considering your note that "Mahalanobis distance could be only applied to normally distributed features". I ran across some research that argues that it is still possible to use that metric in cases of non-normal data. Take a look for yourself at this paper and this technical report . I also hope that you'll find useful the following resources on unsupervised anomaly detection (AD) in the IT network security context , using various approaches and methods: this paper , presenting a geometric framework for unsupervised AD; this paper , which uses density-based and grid-based clustering approach; this presentation slides , which mention using of self-organizing maps for AD. Finally, I suggest you to take a look at following answers of mine, which I believe are relevant to the topic and, thus, might be helpful: answer on clustering approaches , answer on non-distance-based clustering and answer on software options for AD .
