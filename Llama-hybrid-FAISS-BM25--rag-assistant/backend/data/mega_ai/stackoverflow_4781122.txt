I believe you are referring to the AppCache. HTML5Rocks.com has a great tutorial about how to use the AppCache and it is applicable to Safari on the iPad and iPhone devices. Essentially the AppCache will proactively download all the assets defined in the manifest and permanently store the files so that they are available Offline (I say permanently, until the user clears their cache). I am not aware of a 5MB limit for Safari - I know Chrome has a 5Mb limit unless it is an app hosted in the Chrome Webstore, in which case you can store unlimited amounts of data. If you are storing binary data, you can base64 encode the data and store it in a WebSQL database (fully supported on the iPad) which can then automatically grow in size. So in summary, it is best to store the Js, HTML, CSS and basic images in the appcache, and then the large assets for the CMS in WebSQL database (as they might change over time).
