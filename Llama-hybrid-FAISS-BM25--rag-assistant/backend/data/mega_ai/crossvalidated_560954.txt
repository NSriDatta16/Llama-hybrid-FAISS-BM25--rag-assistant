Feature function for logistic regression

In his Natural Language Processing textbook, Eisenstein defines the logistic regression as follows: $$p(y|x,\theta) = \frac{\exp (\theta f(x,y))}{\sum_{y'} \exp (\theta f(x,y'))}$$ Where $\theta$ are the regression parameters and $f(x,y)$ a given feature function. My question concerns the feature function we just defined as a function of $x$ and $y$ . Indeed, I can't grasp why Eisenstein's feature function also takes the label $y$ as an input. From my understanding, in standard regression (e.g. multiple linear regression), the feature function is a way to catch non-linearities in the data by projecting data point $x$ in a well-chosen feature space using the feature function $\phi(x): X \rightarrow{} F$ . But I can't really see when and how having label $y$ is useful.
