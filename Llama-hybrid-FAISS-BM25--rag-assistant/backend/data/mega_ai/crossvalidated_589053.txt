These are good questions you are asking before moving forward with this model, which, in my opinion, has some issues. I'll address each of your questions and that should also address the problems with the model. How do I enter the possible effect of trial number? For this, you can enter trial number as a fixed effects predictor in the model. You should explore the association graphically in order to understand whether there appears to be any association, and if so, if it appears linear or non-linear. If linear, you can simply add it to the model, if non-linear but systematic, you could consider adding a squared or cubed term of it to the model. You could also add it as a factor variable, which does not assume any linearity in the association and instead, treats each instantiation of a new trial number as having it's some average association with the outcome (relative to the holdout group). How can I take into account the fact that the subjects are paired through the trajectories that they perform to explore the object? It is not clear to me that this is something you need to account for in the model. You could create a pairing ID variable that has the same value for each individual in the pair and include it as a random intercept. I would look to see whether there is any appreciable variance in this intercept before deciding whether to include it in your final model. Am I missing something about possible crossed effects? By including object and orientation in the model, you take care of any cross-classification. However, I would advise you to include object and orientation as fixed effect factor predictors. The main reason is that they have very few values ( at least 10-15 values in a variable that you are treating as a random intercept. This is due to the idea that a random intercept is a population parameter with a normal distribution and estimated variance, and accordingly, is supposed to be representative of a larger population of groups, subjects, conditions, etc. This, plus the fact that these models do not behave well when random intercepts have so few groups. There is some great discussion in this earlier CV thread.
