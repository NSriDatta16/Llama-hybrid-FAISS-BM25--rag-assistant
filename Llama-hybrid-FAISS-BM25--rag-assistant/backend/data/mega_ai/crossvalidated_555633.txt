Model Determination using Wald Test for Logit

I am carrying a Logistic regression. I have 13 predictor variables. When I consider the summary of the data using R, I obtain a table of coefficients: Abbrevaited list below Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -8.049903 0.647700 -12.428 NOTE: The factor education shows a large P-value. Q. Is it appropriate to rerun the logistic regression without (education) or the other high P-value variables and report this new model in my report, or as my 'answer'. Or is it better to report the full model? Sorry for such a basic question, I'm not a statistician.
