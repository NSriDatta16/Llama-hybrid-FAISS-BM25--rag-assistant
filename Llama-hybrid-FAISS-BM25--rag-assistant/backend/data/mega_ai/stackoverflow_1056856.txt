It's called pagination. The answer is somewhat long and have been covered in a lot of places. I'd recommend you this one, which seems clean and detailed: http://www.problogdesign.com/wordpress/how-to-ajax-post-pagination-in-mootools/ Googling for it should also give you more examples: http://www.google.com/search?q=php+pagination+ajax Hope that helps! :) Edit: Try this one for PEAR: http://www.alberton.info/pear_pager_tutorial_article_pagination.html Edit2: Sorry, the first one is just pagination. This other one for the AJAX version: http://www.alberton.info/pear_pager_tutorial_javascript_navigation.html Did it help?
