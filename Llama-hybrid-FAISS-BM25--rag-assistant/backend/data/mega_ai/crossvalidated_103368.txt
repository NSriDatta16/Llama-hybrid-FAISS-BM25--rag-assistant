Why is an ARMA model a parsimonous approximation of an AR model?

I am reading a book on time series and I came across the following: "In addition to being a parsimonous approximation to a high-order AR(p) model, ARMA models...". Why is an ARMA model a (parsimonous) approximation to an AR model? Also, somewhat later on I read that the coefficients of an MA model can be estimated by writing the model in an 'AR form'. Could anyone also please explain that statement to me? Thanks in advance.
