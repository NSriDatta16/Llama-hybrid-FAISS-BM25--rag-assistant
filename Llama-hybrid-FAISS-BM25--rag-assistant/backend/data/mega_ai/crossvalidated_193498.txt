Unfortunately, fcop's explanation is quite incorrect. First of all he says "It is known that the Kernel can be written as... where ... is an (implicit and unknown) transformation to a new feature space." It's NOT unknown. This is in fact the space the features are mapped to and this is the space that could be infinite dimensional like in the RBF case. All the kernel does is take the inner product of that transformed feature vector with a transformed feature vector of a training example and applies some function to the result. Thus it implicitly represents this higher dimensional feature vector. Think of writing (x+y)^2 instead of x^2+2xy+y^2 for example. Now think what infinite series is represented implicitly by the exponential function... there you have your infinite feature space. This has absolutely nothing to do with the fact that your training set could be infinitely large. The right way to think about SVMs is that you map your features to a possibly infinite dimensional feature space which happens to be implicitly representable in yet another finite dimensional "Kernel" feature space whose dimension could be as large as the training set size.
