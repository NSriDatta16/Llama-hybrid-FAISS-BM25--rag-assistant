As you are having double-quotes in a double-quoted string, you have to escape the double-quotes inside the string, using a backslash : "A paragraph... this is a link " See Double quoted string in the manual : it states that PHP will interpret the \" sequence as a double-quote (and \n will interpreted as a newline, and there are a couple of other of those sequences)
