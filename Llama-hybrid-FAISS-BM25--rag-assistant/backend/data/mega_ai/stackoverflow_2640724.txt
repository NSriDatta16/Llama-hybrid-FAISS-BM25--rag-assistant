HTML5 on iPhone Safari - data stored by localStorage does not always persist. Why?

I write a simple iPhone web app using HTML5's localStorage. Tests on a 2G device show that data stored using localStorage does not persist after the Safari process is killed although the opened Safari windows are remembered. The data is also lost in a case where I am on a different site on a different Safari window, then I change the window to where the web app in subject is shown. When Safari loads the page it automatically refreshes the page. Then the data is lost. This is a simple test code: alert("1:" + localStorage.getItem("test")); localStorage.setItem("test", "123"); alert("2:" + localStorage.getItem("test")); As far as I understand the data should persist! Can anyone shed some light on this behavior? What should I do to get the persistence to work? Thanks! Tom.
