Unit-testing Spring applications using Scala's Specs

We have a large infrastructure that's highly dependent on Spring Framework. Recently I began writing code in Scala and test it using Specs. This is all great but at some point I need to use Spring-dependent features (Such as a HibernateDaoSupport-based DAO). Has anyone managed to use the SpringJUnit4ClassRunner class to run Specs tests? Does anyone have a different direction as to how to achieve this goal? Thanks
