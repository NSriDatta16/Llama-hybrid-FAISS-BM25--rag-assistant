Here is the description of the mean decrease in accuracy (MDA) from the help manual of randomForest: The first measure is computed from permuting OOB data: For each tree, the prediction error on the out-of-bag portion of the data is recorded (error rate for classification, MSE for regression). Then the same is done after permuting each predictor variable. The difference between the two are then averaged over all trees, and normalized by the standard deviation of the differences. If the standard deviation of the differences is equal to 0 for a variable, the division is not done (but the average is almost always equal to 0 in that case). According to the description, the "accuracy" in MDA actually refers to the accuracy of single tree models, regardless of the fact that we are more concerned with the error rate of the forest . So, "Does this mean that removing Petal.Length from the model would only result in an additional misclassification of 8 or so observations on average?" First, the MDA (scaled by default) as defined above is more like a test statistic: $$ \frac{\text{Mean(Decreases in Accuracy of Trees)}} {\text{StandardDeviation(Decreases in Accuracy of Trees)}} $$ The scale is neither percentage or count of observations. Second, even the unscaled MDA, i.e. $\text{Mean(Decreases in Accuracy of Trees)}$, doesn't tell anything about the accuracy of the forest model (trees as a whole by voting). In summary, the MDA output by randomForest package is neither about error rate nor error counts, but better interpreted as a test statistic on the hypothesis test: $$ H_0: \text{Nodes constructed by predictor } i \text{ is useless in any single trees} $$ versus $$ H_1: \text{Nodes constructed by predictor } i \text{ is useful} $$ As a remark, the MDA procedure described by Soren is different from the implementation of randomForest package. It is closer to what we desire from an MDA: the accuracy decrease of the whole forest model. However, the model will probably be fitted differently without Petal.Length and rely more on other predictors. Thus Soren's MDA would be too pessimistic.
