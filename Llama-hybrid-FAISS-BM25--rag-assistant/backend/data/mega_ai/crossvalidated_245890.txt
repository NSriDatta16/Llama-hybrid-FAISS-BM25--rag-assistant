From what you described, it is hard for me to say it is under-fitting. It is even possible over-fitting. I would suggest to use "learning curve" plot to check the problem. How to know if a learning curve from SVM model suffers from bias or variance? Suppose you verified it is under-fitting. Basis expansion can be used to increase the variance of the model. The basis expansion can be polynomial expansion or spline expansion. Details and examples can be found in Why are there large coefficents for higher-order polynomial
