pairwise distances used as features for classification

I have a feature matrix 977x3 features = rand(977,3); where each row is an observation and each column is a feature. I calculate the pairwise distances between point with dissimilarities = pdist(features); and then I scale it with feature_transf = mdscale(dissimilarities,3); I use the new set of features (feature_transf) for classification. Does it have any sense? I have good classification accuracy training a SVM with 10 fold cross validation. Can you please tell me if it is methodologically incorrect? Thanks, Gabriele
