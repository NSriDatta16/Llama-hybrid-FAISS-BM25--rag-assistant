How do I detect availability of tel: uri scheme in a web app?

I'm looking to use the tel: uri scheme (rfc3966) to make phone numbers linkable on mobile devices in a web application, but I'd prefer to not link them on devices that can't handle the tel: scheme - desktops, or mobile devices without phone functionality (i.e. iPads!) Is there some way to detect this? I'd prefer to avoid user agent sniffing, if possible. The iPhone seems to have a canOpenURL function that apps can use to test this, but I'd like to get the same behaviour from Javascript.
