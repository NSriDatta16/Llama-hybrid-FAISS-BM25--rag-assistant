Right, I found my mistake. I wasn't using the inverse integral of the PDF to calculate the 'weight' of each point. For anyone whos's interested my conditional loop read like: for (i = 0; i Where PDF is my probability density function, inverse is the inverse integral of the PDF. and average and average2 represent and respectively.
