Differences between lsmeans and difflsmeans

I've created an lmer model. The effects of one of my treatments, "Fertilizer" varies depending on whether I use lsmeans or difflsmeans from lmerTest . Which should I trust, lsmeans or difflsmeans ? I have a split plot experiment. Fertilizer is the whole plot, Harvest is the split plot. Within each plot, there are 10 samples (quad). Data collected over 4 years, which I have made ordinal. The response is total biomass, which I have transformed. > model difflsmeans(model, test.eff="Fertilizer") Differences of LSMEANS: Estimate Standard Error DF t-value Lower CI Upper CI p-value Fertilizer none-recommended -0.3 0.0868 16.0 -3.27 -0.4677 -0.0996 0.005 ** Fertilizer none-half -0.2 0.0868 16.0 -2.19 -0.3742 -0.0060 0.044 * Fertilizer none-manure -0.1 0.0868 16.0 -0.84 -0.2572 0.1110 0.412 Fertilizer recommended-half 0.1 0.0868 16.0 1.08 -0.0905 0.2777 0.297 Fertilizer recommended-manure 0.2 0.0868 16.0 2.42 0.0264 0.3946 0.028 * Fertilizer half-manure 0.1 0.0868 16.0 1.35 -0.0671 0.3011 0.197 --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 > lsmeans(model, list(pairwise~Fertilizer)) NOTE: Results may be misleading due to involvement in interactions $`lsmeans of Fertilizer` Fertilizer lsmean SE df lower.CL upper.CL none 4.602075 0.07090356 21.33 4.454764 4.749387 recommended 4.885723 0.07090356 21.33 4.738411 5.033034 half 4.792150 0.07090356 21.33 4.644838 4.939462 manure 4.675189 0.07090356 21.33 4.527877 4.822500 Results are averaged over the levels of: ordYear, Harvest Confidence level used: 0.95 $`pairwise differences of Fertilizer` contrast estimate SE df t.ratio p.value none - recommended -0.28364706 0.1002728 21.33 -2.829 0.0455 none - half -0.19007464 0.1002728 21.33 -1.896 0.2595 none - manure -0.07311311 0.1002728 21.33 -0.729 0.8843 recommended - half 0.09357242 0.1002728 21.33 0.933 0.7875 recommended - manure 0.21053396 0.1002728 21.33 2.100 0.1853 half - manure 0.11696153 0.1002728 21.33 1.166 0.6537 Results are averaged over the levels of: ordYear, Harvest P value adjustment: tukey method for a family of 4 means Thank you
