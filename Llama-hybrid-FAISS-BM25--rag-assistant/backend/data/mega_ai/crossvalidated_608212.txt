You never really "lose a category" in regression against a categorical predictor, you just have to get the comparisons that you want from the model results. In a Cox model it's best to work with the regression coefficients first, then convert to hazard ratios by exponentiating. The regression coefficient for the reference level ("A" here) is 0 in a Cox model. For a comparison against the average among groups, you can find the average of the 3 regression coefficients (0 for "A" and the individual values found for for "B" and "C") and evaluate the differences of each coefficient against that average. For standard errors you would have to use the formula for the variance of a weighted sum of correlated variables along with the variance-covariance matrix of the model coefficient estimates. Instead of doing this by hand, take advantage of the post-modeling tools provided by packages like emmeans . You can then specify the comparisons/contrasts that you desire and display results in either the original coefficient scale or in the hazard-ratio scale. After you fit your data with the coxph() function, the "eff" contrast method in emmeans provides what you want in the hazard-ratio scale: library(survival) cox1 If you remove the type="response" and the $contrasts from that function call, you can get a better idea of what's going on under the hood: in the "contrasts" you get comparisons of each of the original regression coefficients (the "emmeans") against their mean. emmeans(cox1,eff~b) # $emmeans # b emmean SE df asymp.LCL asymp.UCL # A 0.000 0.000 Inf 0.000 0.000 # B 0.223 0.299 Inf -0.363 0.810 # C -0.430 0.386 Inf -1.187 0.327 # # Results are given on the log (not the response) scale. # Confidence level used: 0.95 # # $ contrasts # contrast estimate SE df z.ratio p.value # A effect 0.0689 0.193 Inf 0.357 0.7212 # B effect 0.2922 0.186 Inf 1.567 0.1834 # C effect -0.3611 0.234 Inf -1.545 0.1834 # # Results are given on the log (not the response) scale. # P value adjustment: fdr method for 3 tests
