C#, how to avoid recursion elegantly?

I've got an event-function, where the code inside the function may trigger calling the same function again (because a message loop is used). How can I avoid this or better "detect" this most elegantly? When it comes to multiple thread synchronization one could write: public void Closing(object sender, EventArgs e) { lock(m_Object) { } } But in my case it is the same thread that may call the same function and thus lock fails to work.
