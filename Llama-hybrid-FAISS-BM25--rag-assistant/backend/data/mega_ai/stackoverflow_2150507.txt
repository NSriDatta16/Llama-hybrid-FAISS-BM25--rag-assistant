Is there any simple way to format decimals in T-SQL?

I know it could be done trivially in a non-SQL environment [post-data processing, frontend, what have you], but that's not possible at the moment. Is there a way to take a decimal(5,2) and convert it to a varchar without the trailing zeroes/decimal points? For example: declare @number decimal(5,2) set @number = 123.00 select cast(@number as varchar) as FormattedNumber And the result is '123.00'. Is there a (simple) way to get '123' instead? And likewise, instead of '123.30', '123.3'? Could do it by figuring out whether or not the hundredths/tenths places were 0 and manually trimming characters, but I wanted to know if there was a more elegant solution.
