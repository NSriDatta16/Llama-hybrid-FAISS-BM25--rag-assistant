How to implement question answering program based on Q&A data?

For example I have QA data: Q: Do you like apples? A: Yes. Q: Do you like running? A: Yes. Algorithm should take that input, thesaurus(synonyms, antonyms, etc.), word categorization dictionary(e.g. dbpedia) and produce a program that answers questions. E.g. Q: Do you like fruits? A: Yes. Q: What activities do you prefer? A: Running. Q: Are you a robot? A: I don't know. Does such algorithm exist? Links to papers and code are appreciated. This program is also called chatterbot. First chatterbots were developed in lisp, now cannot be run because they were written for old computer architecture. Now looking into NLP software to do that.
