How can I provide an answer to Neural Network skeptics?

After given several talks on NN's, I always have a skeptic that wants a real measure of how well the model is. How do you know the model is truly accurate? I explain the use of test data etc. to evaluate the total error, however, there is always someone who wants to know about the error associated with each weight? Can anyone enlighten me as to how I can satisfy these types of questions? It has become a real issue.
