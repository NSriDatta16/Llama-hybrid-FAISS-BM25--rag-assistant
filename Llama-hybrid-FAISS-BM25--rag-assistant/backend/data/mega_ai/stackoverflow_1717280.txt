Rather than trying to maintain an impossibly-long list of spider User Agents we look for things that suggest human behaviour. Principle of these is that we split our Session Count into two figures: the number of single-page-sessions, and the number of multi-page-sessions. We drop a session cookie, and use that to determine multi-page sessions. We also drop a persistent "Machine ID" cookie; a returning user (Machine ID cookie found) is treated as a multi-page session even if they only view one page in that session. You may have other characteristics that imply a "human" visitor - referrer is Google, for example (although I believe that the MS Search bot mascarades as a standard UserAgent referred with a realistic keyword to check that the site doesn't show different content [to that given to their Bot], and that behaviour looks a lot like a human!) Of course this is not infalible, and in particular if you have lots of people who arrive and "click off" its not going to be a good statistic for you, nor if you have predominance of people with cookies turned off (in our case they won't be able to use our [shopping cart] site without session-cookies enabled). Taking the data from one of our clients we find that the daily single-session count is all over the place - an order of magnitude different from day to day; however, if we subtract 1,000 from the multi-page session per day we then have a damn-near-linear rate of 4 multi-page-sessions per order placed / two session per basket. I have no real idea what the other 1,000 multi-page sessions per day are!
