Spring Security - Add TAN system

I'm using Spring Security 3.04 to authenticate the users of my system using 3 Roles, while all of them are allowed to access something like a landing page. From this landing page, there should be another system which can only be accessed by one Role and by a TAN-authenticated user. So my question is: What would be the best way to add a third login-attribute to spring security? Or is there a way to store attributes within the security context? Or is there any other way to add a multi-level-authentication to my application using spring security? Thanks in advance for any help! Best regards, Robert
