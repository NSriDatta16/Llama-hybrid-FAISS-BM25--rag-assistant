Mixing unsupervised and supervised learning

Is it a good idea to mix supervised and unsupervised learning together? I'm trying to predict some sales data given some data on hand, so I think a regression is the best way to go. However, I'm also not sure on what is important information or not. So I was thinking that I start off treating this as an unsupervised learning problem (maybe use clustering?) to try and weed out any unnecessary attributes and then treat the remaining data as a regression problem. Or am I approaching this problem completely wrong? I'm pretty new to machine learning, so I'm sorry if this is a strange question to ask.
