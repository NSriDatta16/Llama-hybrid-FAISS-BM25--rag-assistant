MCMC chain getting stuck

I am trying to use a Metropolis-within-Gibbs type algorithm to sample $\theta$ and $x$ from the following model. Starting with Bayes theorem I can write: $$ P(\theta, x | y) = \frac{P(y | x, \theta) P(\theta)}{P(y)} $$ I can easily draw samples from $P(\theta)$ and $P(x | \theta)$, so I factor $P(y | x, \theta)$ into $P(y | x) P(x | \theta)$. Bayes theorem again is now, $$ P(\theta, x | y) = \frac{P(y | x) P(x | \theta) P(\theta)} {P(y)} $$ $P(y | x)$ is multivariate Gaussian. $P(x | \theta)$ is multivariate t. $P(\theta)$ is uniform. My sampling steps: Start with some value of $\theta$, say, $\theta_1$. Gibbs step: Draw a sample $x_1$ from $P(x | \theta_1)$. Plug my $x_1$ into $P(y | x)$ and evaluate (y was observed data). Metropolis step: Accept $\theta$, $x_1$, if $P(y | x_1) > P(y | x_0)$. If not, accept $\theta$, $x_1$ with probability $a = \frac{P(y | x_1)}{P(y | x_0)}$. Go back to step 2, using $\theta_1$ if it was accepted, otherwise, draw a new $\theta$ from the proposal, then go back to step 2. The problem is that $\theta$ gets stuck. Sometimes I will get a draw of $x$ from $P(x | \theta)$, where that $x$ will be nearly identical to y, making result from $P(y | x)$ exceptionally high. After that happens, essentially all my steps are rejected. $a = \frac{P(y | x_1)}{P(y | x_0)}$ for pretty much all subsequent $\theta$ steps is a very small number. Here is why I think this happens: The likelihood $P(y | x)$ is very sharply peaked. On the other hand the distribution $P(x | \theta)$ is very broad in comparison. When $\theta$ changes a small amount, $P(x | \theta)$ is essentially unchanged. Would a different sampling strategy work better in such a situation? Let me know if further info is required.
