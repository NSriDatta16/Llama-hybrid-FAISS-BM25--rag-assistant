The short answer to your question is that yes, when sample sizes are small, Bayesian SEM (BSEM) is preferable to traditional SEM, though only when reasonable priors are used. Recently, it has been pointed out in many places (e.g., McNeish, 2016) that Bayesian methods generally are particularly sensitive to the specification of the prior distribution. I would certainly say that a sample size of $n = 120$ is small by SEM standards, so if you are to use BSEM, make sure you are able to justify your priors, and definitely avoid using the Mplus software defaults (e.g., see Smid & Winter, 2020 for more details). Also, I would suggest conducting a sensitivity analysis to assess the extent to which priors impact your results. References McNeish, Daniel.
