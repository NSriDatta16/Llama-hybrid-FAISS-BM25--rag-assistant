I assume you are going to need some sort of persistent storage to save the moves, so the alternative would be a memcache, or storing the data in files. The former is lightning fast but requires to be set up on the server. The latter has no real advantage over using a database IMO. Any form of storage that takes place only on the users' computers (e.g. storing info in cookies or some other kind of persistent storage, see for example here or here ) I would find too shaky: The playing session would be destroyed if both clients would have to restart their computers, which is not totally out of the question to happen. Without any hard data that the mySQL server is overloaded with this kind of traffic, I would stick with the database. Otherwise, look into memcache .
