Is this really perfect separation in logistic regression, or is something else going on?

I have some data on patients presenting to emergency departments after sustaining self-inflicted gunshot injuries, stored in a data frame ("SIGSW," which is ~16,000 observations of 47 variables) in R. I want to create a model that helps a physician predict, using several objective covariates, the "pretest probability" of the self-shooting being a suicide attempt, or a negligent discharge. The covariates are largely categorical variables, but a few are continuous or binary. My outcome, suicide attempt or not, is coded as a binary/indicator variable, "SI," so I believe a binary logistic regression to be the appropriate tool. In order to construct my model, I intended to individually regress SI on each covariate, and use the p-value from the likelihood ratio test for each model to inform which covariates should be considered for the backward model selection. For each model, SI~SEX, SI~AGE, etc, I receive the following error: >glm(SI ~ SEX, family = binomial, data=SIGSW) Warning messages: 1: glm.fit: algorithm did not converge 2: glm.fit: algorithm did not converge A little Googling revealed that I perhaps need to increase the number of iterations to allow convergence. I did this with the following: >glm(SI ~ SEX, family = binomial, data=SIGSW, control = list(maxit = 50)) Call: glm(formula = SI ~ SEX, family = binomial, data = SIGSW, control = list(maxit = 50)) Coefficients: (Intercept) SEX -3.157e+01 -2.249e-13 Degrees of Freedom: 15986 Total (i.e. Null); 15985 Residual Null Deviance: 0 Residual Deviance: 7.1e-12 AIC: 4 Warning message: glm.fit: fitted probabilities numerically 0 or 1 occurred This warning message, after a little Googling, suggests a "perfect separation," which, as I understand it, means that my predictor is "too good." Seeing as how this happens with all of the predictors, I'm somewhat skeptical that they're all "too good." Am I doing something wrong? Edit: In light of the answers, here is a sample of the data (I only selected a few of the variables for space concerns): SIGSW.AGENYR_C SIGSW.SEX SIGSW.RACE_C SIGSW.SI 1 19 Male White 0 2 13 Male Other 0 3 18 Male Not Stated 0 4 15 Male White 0 5 23 Male White 0 6 11 Male Black 0 7 16 Male Not Stated 1 8 21 Male Not Stated 0 9 14 Male White 0 10 41 Male White 0 And here is the crosstabulation of SEX and SI, showing that SI is coded as an indicator variable, and that there are both men and women with SI, so sex is not a perfect predictor. >table(SIGSW$SEX, SIGSW$SI) 0 1 Unknown 1 3 Male 11729 2121 Female 1676 457 Does the small cell size represent a problem?
