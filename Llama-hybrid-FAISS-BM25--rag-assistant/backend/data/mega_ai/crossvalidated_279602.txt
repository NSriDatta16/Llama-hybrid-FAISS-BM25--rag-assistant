Would the 2 way Chi Square test be appropriate for this scenario; If not, what test is?

The test hypothesis is this: Does a studentâ€™s gender have a greater influence on their choice in whether they study data science as a core topic; than other demographic/variable factors? The sample is of a population with 39 students in the class,and the other demographic/variable factors are: nationality (Australian or other) religion (non-affiliated or religious) how they were paying for university[payment] (government help or savings) if they had moved house to study[moved] (yes or no) if they had chosen data science as an elective or core topic I was considering performing two chi square tests, one for gender and the core/elective topic, and one for core/elective topics and other demographic/variable factors; as shown below: With H0: Gender/demographic factors does have a greater influence/relationship with picking a core topic Ha: Gender/demographic factors does not have a greater influence/relationship with picking a core topic I am to test the hypothesis by viewing the difference between the two table's p-values and to see that if the first table has a smaller p-value than the second's, then we know that gender does have a greater influence. I am sorry, I don't really understand these statistical tests, would really appreciate it if someone can help interpret analysis that can be performed to answer the test hypothesis.
