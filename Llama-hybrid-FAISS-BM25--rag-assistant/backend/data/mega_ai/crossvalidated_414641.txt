Machine Learning Lottery

I have lottery data and I want to use Scikit-Learn to create several different models starting with Regression(One vs All). I know the lottery is random, and impossible to predict, but I want to use machine learning to discover anything interesting about the data. When it comes to Regression, you need independent and dependent variables, an input and the target. Below is the head to my database. I want the date to be for forecasting, and balls 1-3 as independent variables, with the result column which is a string of the previous columns as the target/dependent variable. My question is: could balls 1-3, which are all separate columns, combine to be the target (Results column)? Data Head: b1 b2 b3 Results Date 1984-09-01 9 4 8 948 1984-09-03 1 5 3 153 1984-09-04 8 6 6 866 1984-09-05 5 6 9 569 1984-09-06 2 1 9 219
