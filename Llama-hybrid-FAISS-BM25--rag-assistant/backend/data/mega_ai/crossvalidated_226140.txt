Without repercentaging the P(=y) column to 100%, the average of that column times Price is way underestimating a more appropriate weighted average. This is for the simple reason that the P(=y) column, by itself, does not sum to 100%. By summing P(=y) up, repercentaging each cell, and multiplying that new value by Price, appropriate weighted average can be generated. Per @gung's comment, at 4.023, this new weighted average isn't equal to the raw unweighted average. For me, a more basic question is why you are multiplying price by a partitioned likelihood in the first place.
