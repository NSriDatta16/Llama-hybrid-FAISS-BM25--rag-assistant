Templating, as suggested in other answers, is probably the best answer (I wrote an early, quirky templating module called yaptu , but modern mature ones as suggested in other answers will probably make you happier;-). However, though it's been a long time since I last used it, I fondly recall the Quixote approach, which is roughly a "reverse templating" (embedding HTML generation within Python, rather than viceversa as normal templating does). Maybe you should take a look and see if you like it better;-).
