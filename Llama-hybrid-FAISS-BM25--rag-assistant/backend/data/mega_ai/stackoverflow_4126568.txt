Get variable passed to switch statement

This isn't the exact use scenario but I was wondering if it was possible to get the value passed to the switch statement without having to retype what is in the switch() part. Example : switch(someObject.withSomevalue*(Math.random()*11)) { case 1 : alert("one"); // more cases here default: alert(theNumberThatWasPassed); } If we run the Math.random() again we'll get another random number that very well could meet one of the cases, so calling what aws called in the switch(x) statement isn't an option. I've been just storing it in a variable - x = someObject.withSomevalue*(Math.random()*11) - and then passing it to the switch that way switch(x) , but I was wondering if it's possible to get the value passed to the switch within the switch statement.
