Gaussian distributions are common, but not compulsory. They key is the rationale, which I cannot discern from your question. To answer your question about where to find model-building information, Andrew Gelman and colleagues' book Bayesian Data Analysis 3rd edition is IMHO the gold standard. They outline the principles and analysis (using R and Stan) in Chapter 16, page 405. Gelman himself does the majority of his research in political analysis, he has a blog where these issues are discussed directly http://andrewgelman.com/ , plus there is a Stan-users group available to refine your analysis.
