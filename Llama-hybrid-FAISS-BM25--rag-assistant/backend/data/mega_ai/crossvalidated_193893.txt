It is difficult to say what the best model is, but you can ask whether the current model is adequate. For that you may check if it has residuals that are close to white noise and whether explanatory power can be considered sufficient. What stands out from your model description is that you use quarterly seasonal dummies although your data is weekly. That does not sound like a sensible way of modelling seasonality. Instead you could try including some Fourier terms to account for weekly seasonality, see e.g. Rob J. Hyndman's blog post and related posts. Not really if you use lagged (rather than contemporaneous) effects of investment advertisement. Then your regressor will be predetermined, which is often sufficient in time series models. You may include a transformation of investment in advertisement as another exogenous variable or in place of the level of investment in advertisement. The transformation could be square root or logarithm of the original value, both would yield diminishing effects. If you want to test for diminishing effects, you could include both levels and {square root or logarithm} and test whether the latter is significant.
