After you have given some extra information in comments this is approaching an answerable question. You should really edit that extra information into your question (many will not read comments). And, read How to ask a statistics question . Context is essential in statistics, so what do your two classes represent? How many examples? ... A classification problem with two classes can often be better represented as a logistic regression . Then you get predicted probability for the two classes, and this can later be used to obtain a classification. Frank Harrell has written about that , Choosing between logistic and discriminant , Why isn't Logistic Regression called Logistic Classification? Then the memory problem (but it could well be a fitting/inference problem too: to estimate 10000+ parameters you need a really big sample). Look at the post Principled way of collapsing categorical variables with many levels? and search this site for the tag many-categories Software: glmnet implements lasso for logistic regression (among other things), and uses sparse matrices out of the box. Try it!
