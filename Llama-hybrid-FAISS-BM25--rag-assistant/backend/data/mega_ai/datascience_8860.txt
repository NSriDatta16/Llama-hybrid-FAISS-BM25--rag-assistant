Bagging vs Dropout in Deep Neural Networks

Bagging is the generation of multiple predictors that works as ensamble as a single predictor. Dropout is a technique that teach to a neural networks to average all possible subnetworks. Looking at the most important Kaggle's competitions seem that this two techniques are used together very often. I can't see any theoretical difference besides the actual implementation. Who can explain me why we should use both of them in any real application? and why performance improve when we use both of them?
