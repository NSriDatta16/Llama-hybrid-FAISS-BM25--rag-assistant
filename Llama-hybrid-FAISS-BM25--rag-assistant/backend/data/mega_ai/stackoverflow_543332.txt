I believe another option is the ledmac package. Here is a quote from the documentation: The normal \label, \ref and \label \pageref macros may be used within numbered text, and operate in the familiar fashion. As an example, here is one way of numbering paragraphs in numbered text, and then being able to refer to the paragraph numbers, in addition to line and page numbers. \newcounter{para} \setcounter{para}{0} \newcommand{\newpara}{% \refstepcounter{para}% \noindent\llap{\thepar. }\quad} \newcommand{\oldpara}[1]{% \noindent\llap{\ref{#1}. }\quad} The definitions of \newpara and \oldpara put the numbers in the left margin and the first line of the paragraph is indented. You can now write things like: \linenummargin{right} \beginnumbering \pstart \newpara\label{P1} A paragraph about \ldots \pend In paragraph~\ref{P1} the author \ldots \pstart \oldpara{P1} This has the same \edtext{number}{\Afootnote{\ref{P1} is the paragraph, not line}} as the first paragraph. \pend \endnumbering I've never attempted this myself, however.
