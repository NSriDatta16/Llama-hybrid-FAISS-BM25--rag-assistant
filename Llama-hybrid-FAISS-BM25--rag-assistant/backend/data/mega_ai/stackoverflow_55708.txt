I've always considered source file organization and assigning identifiers to classes and objects to be two separate problems. I tend to keep related classes in groups, but not every group should be a namespace. Namespaces exist (more or less) to solve the problem of name conflictsâ€”in flat-namespace languages like C, you can't walk two feet without tripping over identifiers like mycompany_getcurrentdate or MYCGetCurrentDate , because the risk of a conflict with another function in a third-party (or system) library is that much smaller. If you created a package or namespace for every logical separation, you would get (Java example) class names like java.lang.primitivewrapper.numeric.Integer , which is pretty much overkill.
