Using More than 2 Entity Relationships in Report Builder (SQL Server 2005)

I've created a model using SQL Server Reporting Services. When I try to create a report using the Report Builder, I can drag an entity to the report, followed by a nested sub-entity. I get the two-level grouping as expected. However, I cannot add a third level entity to the relationship, no matter which combination I try. What can I do to enable multi level entity relationships in Report Builder?
