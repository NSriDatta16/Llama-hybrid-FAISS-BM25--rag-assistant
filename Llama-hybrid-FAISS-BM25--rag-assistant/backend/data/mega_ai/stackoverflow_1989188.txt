Window modes like transparent and opaque are notorious for the odd input bugs they inflict. It is definitely a good idea to stay away from it when you can. I haven't used SWFUpload, so I'm not entirely sure how it goes about embedding the SWF file. But regardless of the specifics, in the end I'm sure it's using embed/object tags, and for those, there's the bgcolor parameter that overrides the background color specified inside the SWF file. I would suggest taking a look at this parameter (scroll down) . SWFObject is a common way to dynamically embed SWF files using javascript. In case that's what SWFUpload uses, you should be able to apply the following principle to set the bgcolor parameter: var params = { bgcolor: #ffcc00, }; swfobject.embedSWF("myContent.swf", "myContent", "300", "120", "9.0.0", "expressInstall.swf", {}, params, {}); As I said, I'm not sure what the SWFUpload interface looks like, but the key is to find a way to specify the embed parameters. Hopefully that will at least nudge you in the right direction!
