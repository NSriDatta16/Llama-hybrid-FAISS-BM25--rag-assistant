I am going to answer based purely on ease of programming and encouragement of good design practices. I learned to program using Perl and for many years wrote web applications using CGI, which was never pleasant in the first place. I always found that Perl was tedious to get right and way too easy to get wrong. When I started developing web applications more seriously, I discovered PHP. Going from Perl to PHP was a natural progression because they share many of the same methodologies and syntax. I loved that PHP was so heavily installed and widely used and was much easier to code in than Perl. Except, like Perl, PHP makes it way too easy to do things the wrong way, and ushered in a new era of poorly-written and insecure web applications. Now... Four years ago I discovered Django , which was in its infancy at the time, and it changed my life. I used this as the motivation to learn Python and have not looked back, not once. I use Python for everything now: System programming (server configurations, monitoring, alerting) Network programming (router/switch configuration automation, auditing, syntax checking) Web applications (self-explanatory) Python's ease of use, elegant syntax, and the fact that it encourages best practices by default is what turned me on and kept me interested. Give Python a shot, you won't regret it!
