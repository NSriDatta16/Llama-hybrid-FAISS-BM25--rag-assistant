How do I decide which Neural Network and learning method to use in a particular case?

I am new in neural networks and I need to determine the pattern among a given set of inputs and outputs. So how do I decide which neural network to use for training or even which learning method to use? I have little idea about the pattern or relation between the given input and outputs. Any sort of help will be appreciated. If you want me to read some stuff then it would be great if links are provided. If any more info is needed plz say so. Thanks.
