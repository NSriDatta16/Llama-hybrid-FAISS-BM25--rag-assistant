Orbeon filter problem - separate deployment

I followed the instructions on http://wiki.orbeon.com/forms/doc/developer-guide/xforms-with-java-applications (copied the JAR, configured my web.xml, setup cross context mode in tomcat). Than I created a jsp file with xforms elements, put it in the xforms-jsp directory in my war. When I open the .jsp in a browser, the filter doesn't seem to work, no xforms data (eg. input field) is displayed. I just began developing web apps, so maybe i made a very trivial mistake... Thanks!
