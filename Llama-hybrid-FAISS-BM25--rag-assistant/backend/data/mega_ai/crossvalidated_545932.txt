Please clarify your bootstrap approach. The Efron-Gong optimism bootstrap (i.e., using the bootstrap to estimate bias in a quantity such as $R^2$ or proportion of variance explained by $PC_1$ ) involves estimating parameters in one of many bootstrap samples and applying these parameters to the original whole dataset. In your setting the parameters involve the loadings of $PC_1$ . These loadings are also a function of the pre-analysis standard deviations that you have to estimate to use $PC$ s in the usual way. So you'd also be validating the normalization stage simultaneously with validating the loadings on the standardized quantities. I'm glad you are considering the volatility of $PC$ because most analysts act as if the loadings are estimated without error. By following the full bias-estimating bootstrap procedure (and I hope you provide code that all of us can benefit from) you average over a few hundred bootstrap resamples this quantity: proportion of variance explained in a bootstrap sample minus what that same set of loadings explains in the original sample. Then you subject that average optimism from the original apparent proportion explained to get a bias-corrected estimate of the proportion. This estimates the likely future performance of your original $PC_1$ .
