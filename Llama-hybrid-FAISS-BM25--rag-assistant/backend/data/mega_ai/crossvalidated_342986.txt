Lossless Compression Of Data Tables Leveraging Exploratory Analysis?

Lossless compression of data tables seems a natural application of automated modeling based on exploratory data analysis methods . While such automatically generated models are not reliable for statistical inference, they are able to predict the contents of the data table better than general file compression techniques. The quick and dirty model's information content plus that of residual errors requires far fewer bits than the data tables in their, say, gzipped form. Are there such utilities available for statistical databases?
