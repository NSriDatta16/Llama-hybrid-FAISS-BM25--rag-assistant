My first instict was to suggest a Mosaic plot ; it graphs each sub-category as a rectangle, where one dimension represents the total count for the main category and the other dimension represents the sub-category's proportionate share. There's an R package to draw them , but it's also fairly straightforward to do with lower-level graphing tools. However, mosaic plots (like percentage-based stacked bar graphs) work best if there are only 2 or 3 categories in the dimension in which you want to compare proportions. So they would work well if you wanted to compare differences between topics in the proportion of articles that were in each of three newspapers , but not so much for your intended use, comparing differences between three newspapers in the proportion of coverage for each topic . A subtle but important distinction! For what you want to emphasize, I think the most effective graph is one of the simplest -- a grouped bar graph. More people understand bar graphs than dot charts; at a glance, you can see that you're comparing quantities of different size, and the values you want to compare are side-by-side. However, if you really wanted to emphasize the differences in proportion, you could create a custom grouped bar graph, modified to position each group so that the median value per category is aligned with the axis, instead of the zero values: Difference in proportion of coverage per Newspaper, relative to category median (narrow bars) ____-0.1%____0_____0.1%____0.2%_____ | |********|***** A |~~~~~~~~| |#### | | |****|********** B |~~ | |####| | |***** | C |~~~~~~~|~~~~~ |#######| | |*** | D |~~~~~~~~~~~| |###########|## | 0.2%_____0.1%____0_____ Median proportion of coverage per category, all papers (large bars) Note that the bars in each group are still aligned for easy comparison of size, and that each group's baseline is now positioned to the left of the axis according to that group's median value, while the bars that project to the right of the axis are equivalent to your second bar graph showing the difference between the top two categories. Regardless of whether you use a standard grouped bar graph or an offset-adjusted graph like the above, you could still take an idea from mosaic plots and make the width of each bar proportional to the total article count for that newspaper (so the size of the bar is proportional to the number of articles in that newspaper in that category). Since your test statistic is a property of each comparison , not of individual values, I don't think it's useful to scale every data point according to the significance. Instead, I would have an icon next to each grouping representing significance. For academic publication, the standard * / ** / *** has the benefit of familiarity, but you could get creative if you wanted to show the full continuum of the statistic.
