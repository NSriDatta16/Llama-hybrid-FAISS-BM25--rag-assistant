Optimization efforts are always commendable, but in this specific case I see zero benefit in saving a few queries, and some RAM, for a few seconds. Definitely go with example 1 (or whatever is best from a programming, maintenance and user experience perspective). I don't know about your server setup and all that so judging run times and memory consumption are always subjective, but you seem to be doing pretty well. Look at Wordpress where the average script instance (at least in the backend, haven't measured the frontend) weighs between 6 and 12 MB. Don't worry too much about optimization.
