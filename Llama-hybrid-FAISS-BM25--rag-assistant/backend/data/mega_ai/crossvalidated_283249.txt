Can one tell when propensity scoring will be ineffectual?

I am trying to assess whether it would be useful to master propensity scoring to apply to a certain problem, or whether it would be better to rely on ordinary logistic regression. I want to evaluate the effect of a treatment, X, on an outcome, Y, while taking into account a set of covariates. First I use a set of covariates in a logistic regression to predict X, and I save predicted (fitted) values as PS. Within-sample, PS can explain 7% of the variance in X, with a Concordance of .66. When, out of curiosity, I check the relationship between PS and Y, I find it has an R-squared or pseudo-R-squared of only about .005 and a Concordance of only .57. Corresponding values from attempts to predict Y, based on X and covariates, are not large themselves--usually about .07 and .68. So it's not as if I have enormous statistical connections to work with in the first place. My understanding is that covariates with weak relationships to Y will not, when controlled, yield great adjustments to an X-Y relationship. Does the weak relationship between PS and Y signal that propensity scoring will be less effective than ordinary logistic regression in this situation?
