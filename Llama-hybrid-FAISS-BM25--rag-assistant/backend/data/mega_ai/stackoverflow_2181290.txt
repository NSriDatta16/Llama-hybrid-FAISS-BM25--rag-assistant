PHP Zend Framework - How to Get Request URI Fragment from Request Object?

Say e.g. i have a URI http://127.0.0.1/somecontroller/someaction#12345 that takes me to the someAction() action of the someController controller. From there, i am able to retrieve the Request object via $this->getRequest() . i am also able to retrieve various information regarding the URI from the Request object. But, how can i retrieve the fragment (i.e. the "12345" part after the # in the e.g.)? Neither getRequestUri() nor getParams() turn up the fragment part. Thanks!
