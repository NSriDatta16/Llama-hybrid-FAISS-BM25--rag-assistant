Measuring similarity between two datasets

This is quite straightforward: I have a dataset with 8 features containing cell measurements from a patient. I want to compare two patients to a reference one. To do this I perform UMAP to reduce the 8 features to 2 (also because I cannot perform a feature-wise comparison; I don't think more details are needed here, let me know) and then plot the reference (blue) and on top of it I plot each patient (red). Below you can see the results. Patient A: Patient B: To me, the first patient is more similar to the reference than the one below. I think what I am looking at is the degree of superposition/overlay on the UMAP embedding (see comments). Is there a metric or a way to quantify this? Thank you!!
