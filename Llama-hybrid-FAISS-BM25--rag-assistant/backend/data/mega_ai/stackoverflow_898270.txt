I think I have an idea as to why that internal vs external distinction came up in your previous question. Using MVC for external websites affords you the flexibility needed to support more browsers and makes developing web standards compliant sites easier. MVC requires a little bit more work to do some of the same things as Web Forms, but you have more control over what is output to the client. Using WebForms for internal apps is suggested because you have full control over what browsers are used on your network. Also, internal apps are typically not given the same budgets as external sites. Web Forms allows you to whip together a database grid, paging, sorting, etc in a matter of minutes by dragging and dropping code to an ASPX page. The motivation I believe is purely money and time based. I however do not think that this line in the sand is a good one to make. I know there are some websites that I have worked on with WebForms that required a lot of hair pulling that simply wouldn't have happened if I used MVC. But I also have some sites that didn't need the level of flexibility, so I used WebForms. The biggest advantage that I see with ASP.NET MVC is AJAX. It is easier for me to deal with jQuery AJAX requests when using MVC as opposed to WebForms. I am also a control freak, so using MVC satisfies that aspect as well...
