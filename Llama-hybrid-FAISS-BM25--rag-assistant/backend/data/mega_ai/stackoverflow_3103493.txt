Anti-aliased htmlText in ActionScript?

I basically have the same question as bder on the actionscript.org forums , namely if I can have my text anti-aliased if it is using an embedded font (Myriad Pro) to assign it to the htmlText property of a TextField and styling that with CSS. Everything works fine with the text embedding and styling (the font is the one I want, and all its variations - bold, italic - are shown correctly), except that it looks bad, i.e. not anti-aliased. Of course, I have tried setting the antyAliasType and gridFitType properties to all possible combinations. Any ideas? Oh, and I also tried writing my code exactly like in the example here , but did not work either, not sure why. Thank you.
