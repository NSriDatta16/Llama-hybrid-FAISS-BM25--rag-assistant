Can I get console logs from my iPhone app testers?

I am testing my iPhone app with some people who install it through iTunes together with the mobile provision file that I give them. Apple has good instructions for how to get crash logs from these people, but is it also possible to get console logs from their devices? I do not have physical access to these people, otherwise I could connect their device to my computer and see the console log in Organizer. I would like to give them instructions to get me their console logs, but there doesn't seem to be a way?
