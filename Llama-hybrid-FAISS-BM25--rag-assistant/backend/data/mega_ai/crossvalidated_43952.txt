The coefficient for the lower order term is showing the unique contribution of that variable the prediction of the dependent variable, controlling for all of the other variables in the model. Whether you are entering interaction terms or other lower order main effects, the coefficient for the lower order term will usually change to reflect the fact that other predictors are in the model. An added issue in the model that you present is that you have a large number of predictors and interactions, some of which may attain significance by chance. A common practice in testing interaction terms involves centering the lower order variables around their mean and then computing the cross products based on the centered variables. Centering the variables is intended to reduce the linear association between the lower order terms and their cross products, but the problems you identify are likely to persist in the overall model. Ultimately, you need to test a simpler model in which the main effects and interactions are chosen more selectively. Good resources to read concerning the impact of interaction terms on main effects in regression include: Kromrey, J.D., Foster-Johnson, L. (1998).
