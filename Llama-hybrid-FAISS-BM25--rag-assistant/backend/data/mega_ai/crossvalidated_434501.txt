Before answering your question, I would like to write the purpose of dummy variable. The reason of introducing the dummy variable in any model is to bring numerical value to a category. Any model mainly works on number. Some models implicitly creates this dummy variable. So, you do not have to create dummy variable in some models(For ex: Random Forest) To answer your question: Bringing the dummy variable and assigning value of 0 and 1, simply means that the person is either retired or not (Your first explanation). There is no comparison on pre and post retirement. Comparison is something you imply after seeing the whole data. but dummy variable creation is just ,metaphorically, re-packaging the category variable and converting it to numerical variable.
