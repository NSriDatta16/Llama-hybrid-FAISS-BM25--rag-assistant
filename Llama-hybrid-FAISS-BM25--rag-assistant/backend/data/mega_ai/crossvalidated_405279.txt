In Convolutional networks, how to do input data normalization? is it necessary?

I'm wondering about data normalization in CNN, how can we do it for the input images?, what can it add to the model's performance? and what are the main pre-processing techniques before doing the convolutional layer? Happy to get extra-reading, thanks. UPDATE: I'm looking for how to practically normalize the data inputs, I didn't get it! . Additional reading (explanation, papers) will be so helpful.
