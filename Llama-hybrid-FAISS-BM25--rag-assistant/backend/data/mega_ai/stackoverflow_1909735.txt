C# system tray context menu showing below the icon

I have a Windows Application that I have created that utilizes the system tray to "hold" the application when it is open and running behind the scenes. However, the popup context menu that I created for it (used Infragistics UltraToolbarsManager), the menu appears but below the icon cutting off most of the menu. How do I rectify this problem?
