How do I retrieve element text inside CDATA markup via XPath?

Consider the following xml fragment: How do I retrieve the "SomeText" value via XPath? I'm using Nauman Leghari's (excellent) Visual XPath tool . /Obj/Name returns the element /Obj/Name/text() returns blank I don't think its a problem with the tool (I may be wrong) - I also read XPath can't extract CDATA (See last response in this thread ) - which sounds kinda weird to me.
