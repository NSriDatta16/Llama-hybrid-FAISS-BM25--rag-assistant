How to statistically discover significant process change effectiveness?

I am currently working on a project where I need to assess the effectiveness of changes made in a production process. Our initial success rate was 50%, and after making some alterations, we've observed varying success rates. I want to accurately determine at what point these changes can be considered statistically significant. To achieve this, I plan to use two statistical approaches: Traditional Null Hypothesis Testing: To assess if the improvements are statistically significant. Bayesian Analysis: To update our understanding of the process's effectiveness based on new data. Additionally, my goal is to identify specific change points - success rates at which the p-value becomes significant in the null hypothesis testing and where the Bayesian probability exceeds 50%. I intend to: Generate data reflecting a 50% initial success rate. Apply null hypothesis testing and Bayesian analysis to this data. Evaluate different success rates (e.g., 70%, 80%, 90%) to understand their impact on p-values and Bayesian probabilities. Identify and plot the specific success rates that mark significant changes as per both methods. Could someone guide me on how to implement this approach correctly, particularly in identifying these change points? Also, are there any suggestions for improving this methodology or alternative methods I should consider?
