Java Jnlp CodeSigner Error

I am trying to run a java jnlp application from my computer. Every time I try launch the file I get the error java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: java/security/CodeSigner From searching Google it seems to be a common enough problem and is normally blamed on 'java 6'. I couldn't find a solution that doesn't involve rolling back to an older java version. Does anyone know how fix this without reverting versions?
