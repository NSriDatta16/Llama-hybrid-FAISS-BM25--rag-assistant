XSLT is Turing-complete , see for example here or here , hence it can be done. But I have used XSLT only one or two times and can give no solution. UPDATE I just read a tutorial again and found a solution using the following fact. bitset(x, n) returns true, if the n -th bit of x is set, false otherwise. bitset(x, n) := floor(x / 2^n) mod 2 == 1 The following XSLT Number Bit 3 Bit 2 Bit 1 Bit 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 will turn this XML 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 into a HTML document with a table showing the bits of the numbers. Number | Bit 3 | Bit 2 | Bit 1 | Bit 0 --------------------------------------- 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 2 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 3 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 4 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 5 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 6 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 7 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 8 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 9 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 10 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 11 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 12 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 13 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 14 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 15 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 This is neither elegant nor nice in any way and there are probably much simpler solution, but it works. And given that it is my first contact with XSLT, I am quite satisfied.
