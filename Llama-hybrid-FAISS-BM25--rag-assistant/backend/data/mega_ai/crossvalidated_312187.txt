When the distance metric is not Euclidean, the metric Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) is nonlinear?

As it is commonly known, classic metric MDS (under Euclidean distance metric) is a linear dimension reduction method (equivalent to PCA), and it is also known to us that non-metric MDS is nonlinear, however, how about a metric MDS in which the distance metric is not defined as Euclidean (e.g., cosine distance, Manhattan distance), is it a linear embedding or nonlinear embedding ?
