How to handle highly skewed percentage data

I am trying to make a prediction model (explanation would be nice but mainly predicting as accurately as possible is more important, for now). My independent variables are all percentages (quantity of various ingredients) and my dependent variable is also a percentage (but of a physical response - specifically shrinkage, literally how much the thing shrinks during a process). In other words I'm trying to say - a sample with percentage of ingredients A %, B %, and C %, will shrink X %. I am finding it hard to get a good prediction using this data. I think the cause is due to either the fact that some of the independent variables are highly skewed - e.g. because the quantity is very close to zero. Or that the dependent variable is highly skewed - but at around 12 % due to some physical limit, not because it's rubbing up against 0 % or 100 %. For example, the dependent variable: Random forest, SVM and xgboost all seem to predict almost a single value (i.e. they seem extremely regularised towards the ~ 12 % upper limit). Regularised regression (glmnet) does better, but the residuals are definitely not homoscedastic: a plot of predicted values vs true values is pretty curved. I've tried doing a logit transform and although that has improved the regression a little, it obviously hasn't addressed the skewness. I'm thinking of trying something simple like a Box-Cox transform, but I've no idea whether it's reasonable to do that - nor whether I should do it pre or post logit (or forget logit altogether). I'd really appreciate some advice on that - or any better ideas. Thanks. Edit as requested: A pairs plot (note the data originates from a French colleague so retrait = shrinkage): And a plot of only the variables with which shrinkage has an r > 0.5:
