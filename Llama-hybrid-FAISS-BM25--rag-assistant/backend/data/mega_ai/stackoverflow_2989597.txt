For standard text rendering Silverlight uses ClearType. Unfortunatly, ClearType can not be used then rendering text into WritableBitmap. That is why you see the difference in text quality in your scenario. Btw setting CacheMode to BitmapCache or using pixel shaders will disable ClearType as well (see http://forums.silverlight.net/forums/p/109627/247959.aspx ) Since quality of the text rendered into WritableBitmap can not be improved the only solution I can think of is to reduce text rendering quality of your UI using one of the methods I mentioned above.
