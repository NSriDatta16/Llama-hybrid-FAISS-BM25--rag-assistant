What is the relationship between bayesian and neural networks?

I'm looking for computationally heavy tasks to implement with CUDA and wonder if neural networks or bayesian networks might apply. This is not my question, though, but rather what the relation between the two network types is. They seem very related, especially if you look at bayesian networks with a learning capability (which the article on wikipedia mentions). At a glance, bayesian networks look at bit like a specific type of neural networks. Can anyone sum up their relationship, and if there is any connection beyond the apparent similarity?
