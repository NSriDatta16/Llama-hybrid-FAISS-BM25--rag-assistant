This "reverse position" from the gambler's fallacy was examined in a series of papers looking at binomial prediction under the Bayesian paradigm (see O'Neill and Puza 2005 ; O'Neill 2012 ; O'Neill 2015 ). These papers argue in favour of your view shown in the quoted section in your question --- that observing more tails in a series of coin-flips should shift your belief somewhat towards having more tails in the future. You might also be interested in a related paper looking at the relationship between exchangeability and correlation in a classical or Bayesian context ( O'Neill 2009 ).
