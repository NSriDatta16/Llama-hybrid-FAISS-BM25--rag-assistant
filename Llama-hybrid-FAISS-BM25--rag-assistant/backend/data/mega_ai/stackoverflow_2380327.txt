I honestly think that the several answers presented here are very good. However, to fulfill my requirements I have chosen to use Apache UIMA with ClearTK . It supports several ML Methods and I do not have any licences problem. Plus, I can make wrappers to other ML methodologies, and I take the advantage of the UIMA framework, which is very well organized and fast. Thank you all for your interesting answers.
