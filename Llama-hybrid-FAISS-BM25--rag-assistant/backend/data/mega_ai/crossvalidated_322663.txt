Mixed Model: Am I artificially inflating my data?

I have a question about whether I'm artificially adding degrees of freedom in my mixed model. I am testing whether brain volume predicts my outcome measure. However, I have two measures of brain volume: left hemisphere and right hemisphere. I am not interested in how left and right are different per se, so could average, but I tend not to just throw away information. So I tried the model below. Subjects have one outcome per time point. Volume comes in two hemispheres. My data is structured like this: ID TimePoint Hemisphere Volume OUTCOME A001 1 Left 1234 0.64 A001 1 Right 1365 0.64 A001 2 Left 1456 0.90 A001 2 Right 1356 0.90 A001 3 Left 1456 0.94 A001 3 Right 1345 0.94 A002 1 Left 1567 0.35 A002 1 Right 1200 0.35 A002 2 Left 1233 0.67 A002 2 Right 1245 0.67 ... Volume data is different for each row. OUTCOME data is collected only at time points, so replicated for each hemisphere within a timepoint. using lme4 I do something like: lmer(OUTCOME ~ TimePoint * Hemisphere * Volume + (1 + TimePoint * Hemisphere | ID), data = data) Is this right? Or am I double counting my outcome per hemisphere. Is there a way to account for the dependency in OUTCOME by hemisphere by random effects. Thanks so very much in advance, MixedUp Modelr
