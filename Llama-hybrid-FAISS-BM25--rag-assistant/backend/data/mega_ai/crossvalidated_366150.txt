In Q learning, it is possible to use practically any regression model that can be updated incrementally. In fitted Q learning, any regression model can be used, including tree-based approaches, see e.g. page 70 of this book: https://orbi.uliege.be/bitstream/2268/27963/1/book-FA-RL-DP.pdf However, we can hardly speak about Deep Q learning that relates to deep neural networks by nature, i.e. including automated feature extraction from non-trivial objects (images, texts).
