Is there a difference between a discount factor and reward decay in reinforcement learning?

If I understand correctly, the discount factor should be between 0-1 and is squared at each time step. Is the reward decay the same as the discount factor or is it the rate of decreasing the potential reward for each time step such as the square of the discount factor? When I look this question up only results for either discount factor or reward decay is mentioned but not both and never the difference between.
