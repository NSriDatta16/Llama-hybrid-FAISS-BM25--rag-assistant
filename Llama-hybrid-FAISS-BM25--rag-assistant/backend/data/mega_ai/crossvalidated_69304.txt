How is "Orthogonal distance" computed?

I was reading the vignette of the R package chemometrics ( link ). In the second paragraph (right below the first equation) of Page 12, the author writes: the OD (Orthogonal Distance) is calculated in the original space as the orthogonal distance of an object to the PCA subspace or, in other words, the distance between the object and its orthogonal projection on the PCA subspace. Can someone elaborate upon how exactly the orthogonal distance is calculated (some R code as an illustrative example would be greatly appreciated, if possible!)
