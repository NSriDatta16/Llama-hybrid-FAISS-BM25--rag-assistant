you could hook the network stream and filter for http download requests. you'll need some library to capture network traffic (e.g. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pcap ). Then you'll have to parse the network packets for the appropriate HTTP messages (sorry, I can't give them to you, I don't know them). I don't know if you can actually prevent packets from being sent though. Another (easier) way would be to implement a proxy server (or modify an existing one) to do what you want. Then you just have to connect the IE to your proxy using the proxy server settings. Check for example Privoxy , which already does some kind of filtering.
