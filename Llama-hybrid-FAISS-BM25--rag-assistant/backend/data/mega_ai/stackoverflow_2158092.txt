what can be done to encourage those developers to become excited and enthusiastic about software and software development? Nothing. A passion for software development comes from within, and cannot be created from zero. Feeding an existing passion is easy- resources, training, and a visible appreciation for that passion from management are all it takes. The only exception may be to lead by example. If you're excited, others may follow. UPDATE: As has been said in other answers, it's much better to hire well up front. I'd pass over ten good programmers who just want a paycheck for one good programmer who codes in his/her spare time for fun. ANOTHER UPDATE: This answer has been jumping around with up/downvotes, so let me clarify. The OP's wording specifically asks how to make an existing team excited "about software development". It is my contention that if they are not already interested in their chosen professions, there is not much an employer can do to engender an interest. A disinterested, unmotivated team will make a mess of the most fascinating project. By contrast, a motivated team of professionals that like their jobs can make the best darned calculator program out there, and enjoy every minute of it.
