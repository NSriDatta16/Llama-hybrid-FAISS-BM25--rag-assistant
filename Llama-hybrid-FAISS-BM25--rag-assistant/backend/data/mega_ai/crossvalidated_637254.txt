A logistic regression can do this on its own with the right features, though the decrease in probability seems to be sharp instead of gradual. It really looks like a strict discontinuity at $x=50$ , so an indicator of $x>50$ or not might be your best feature, though it is often poor practice to bin continuous variables like this (though this looks like an extreme case).
