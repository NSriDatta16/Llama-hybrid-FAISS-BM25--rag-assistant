Using Google federated login with Google Apps and ASP.net application

As an organisation, we use Google Apps. We have the paid version (mapped to our domain) etc... We are developing a web based application to manage orders, and other business functionality. I want to be able to use federated login with our google apps accounts- For example, if a user is logged in to their email (gMail) - they should automatically be logged in to our ASP.net application If they're not logged in - the log in form should auth. against our google apps account. How can this be done? Is it possible to be able to "get" the user who is currently logged in using this method etc...?
