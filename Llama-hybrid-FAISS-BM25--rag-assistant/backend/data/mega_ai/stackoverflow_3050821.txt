I've used Mozilla Prism in the past and changed the user agent on each machine to be a unique id (mainly used prism because it is very easy to change the user agent in the config file on install and lock it to no editing for standard users). I just wonder though, couldn't you use the internal IP address as the unique identifier as the IP should be unique to each workstation. If you are using active directory you could probably use ldap from php to check who (which user) is logged in on any particular workstation.
