As someone who has used vi/vim for the better part of two decades, and who still does for many things, I can tell you that once I "got" Eclipse I've never gone back to using vi/vim for non-trivial Java work. While there are still a few things that vi/vim do in a way that I find more natural and productive (probably due to that groove that many years of use have worn in my brain), the refactoring and unit-testing capabilities of contemporary IDEs (including Eclipse, IntelliJ, and NetBeans) more than make up for the loss of ' / ', ' n ', ' N ', ' . ', ' s/// ', and their cousins. (And yes, after an intense cross-platform/cross-language session, I do occasionally find my fingers heading for ' j ' instead of the down-arrow. ;-) I still believe that the command line and shell scripts are excellent tools for some tasks (just as I believe that real books have words on the page, and not pictures of Dick, Jane, and Spot ;-), and I also believe that every real programmer should be proficient in vi or emacs (or TECO , to really be a real programmer ;-). Your question implies that you don't yet know vi/vim that well yet, and I encourage you to pursue your interest. Two good sources are Learning the vi and Vim Editors and VI Editor Pocket Reference . By all means, learn vi/vim and have fun, but I respectfully suggest that they probably won't displace a good IDE as your primary Java programming environment.
