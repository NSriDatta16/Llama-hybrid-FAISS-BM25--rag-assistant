In aggregate, there is neither reason nor guarantee that you will observe the same trend as when you split the comparison by some variable ( product in your case). This phenomenon is called Simpson's paradox . Since you have only mentioned significance , and not the direction of the effects, it could also simply be the case that the trends observed within products cancel each other out when averaged.
