You are misinterpreting the meaning of a p-value. While I preferentially would advocate for a Bayesian method if money is involved, if a behavior is involved then I may take the Frequentist approach. If your p-value is $p Under the three main interpretations of probability your inference would be as follows. Fisherian likelihoodist-- nothing was learned, it is time to go onto finding a different choice because there is no real evidence against the null Frequentist inference--the null is in the acceptance region so it makes no sense to treat option A or option B as different Bayesian inference--without more specific information no calculations can be performed, but knowing that the p-value is less than 45% tells me that there is a slight amount of evidence of one hypothesis over the other. Your decisions though may be different. Frequentist decision theory--You accept the null and behave as if the null is true. This would imply, if you have a default such as B, then you should do B. However, in the absence of additional costs, you shouldn't care if you did A or B. Bayesian decision theory--you should base your acceptance or rejection criterion and the combination of the probabilities and the costs or utility of the choices. Since one option is slightly more probable than the other, if you control for costs, you should choose the one with greater probability of being true. If that choice is costly, you should factor in the cost of a false positive and a false negative. That relative cost should constitute your odds criterion for acceptance. If that criterion is passed, then you do the more costly choice.
