Flash movie does not show all embedded font style

I exported a flash movie from Apple flash CS4 with one font and different styles like bold, bold it, regular and italic. I followed the steps on http://wiki.novemberborn.net/sifr3/How+to+use . The export protocol says all fonts are embedded. But flash player does not show the four font styles - only the style of the first letter! A friend made a test: Embedding with Windows flash CS4 works. Which mistake did I do? (No - I do not want to buy windows!)
