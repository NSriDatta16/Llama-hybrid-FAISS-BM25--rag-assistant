Bayesian Learning: Finding the variance of noise

Suppose $x_i \sim N(10,4)$ - ie, the distribution is known. There is a noisy signal $s_i \sim N(x_i, \sigma_e^2)$ and I want to estimate $\sigma_e$ . I see some pairs ( $s_i, x_i$ ) but they are not 'random' (there is some selection on $s_i$ - say, I see these values mostly for large values of $s_i$ ). What approach would you recommend for estimating $\sigma_e$ ? My first thought was to simply take $\hat\sigma_e = \sqrt{\sum(s_i-x_i)^2/N}$ but I think this would be wrong since my data contains mostly larger $s_i$ ? I next tried to model the distribution of $x_i | s_i$ . The Bayesian posterior distribution is $N((\frac{\sigma_{e}^2}{\sigma_{e}^2+4})10 + (\frac{4}{\sigma_{e}^2+4})s_{i}, \frac{\sigma_{e}^2*4}{\sigma_{e}^2+4})$ where the $4$ and $10$ come from the distribution of $x_i$ above. But I do not know how to proceed. I believe that the difference between the expected value of $x_i|s_i$ and the actual observed value should be informative of $\sigma_e$ somehow, but I am confused since $\sigma_e$ enters both the expected value term and the variance term above. Trying to find the MLE by differentiating the log likelihood above becomes very complicated. Is there something obvious that I am missing? Or any approach that you would recommend to estimate $\sigma_e$ ? Edit: To be clear, I know that there is selection on $s_i$ , but I am sure that there is no selection of $x_i$ or $x_i|s_i$ . So I feel $x_i|s_i$ should be informative about $\sigma_e$ (For instance, if I only see $x_i$ very close to $s_i$ for each $s_i$ , I know that $\sigma_e$ is small; but if I see $x_i|s_i \sim N(10,4)$ (ie, close to the original distribution) I would believe that $\sigma_e$ is large. How can I formalize this intuition to form an estimator? Edit2: Consider $a_i = \frac{x_i-s_i}{10-s_i}$ $E[a_i|s_i] = E[\frac{x_i-s_i}{10-s_i} | s_i]$ $= \frac{E[x_i | s_i] - s_i}{10-s_i}$ From the equation above, I know that $E[x_i | s_i] = (\frac{\sigma_{e}^2}{\sigma_{e}^2+4})10 + (\frac{4}{\sigma_{e}^2+4})s_{i}$ Therefore, $E[a_i|s_i] = \frac{\sigma_{e}^2}{\sigma_{e}^2+4}$ . Is this correct? If yes, can I take the mean of $[a_i|s_i]$ as an estimator of $\frac{\sigma_{e}^2}{\sigma_{e}^2+4}$ ? This should overcome the selection problem, since there is no selection conditional on an $s_i$ . Can I get an estimate of $\sigma_{e}^2$ by making it the subject of the formula in 1. above? Any help, even directional, would be really appreciated. Thanks!
