Everything can be a bean in Spring, it just depends how far you want to go. Some things aren't very useful to be added in spring. For example you might find requests and responses easier to handle outside spring. It depends on your needs. In case everything is handled by spring explicitly making classes singleton is indeed useless and should in my opinion be discouraged.
