how to populate the tables within xmlDataDocument.DataSet

I am working on a C# application that involves using XML schema file as databases for message definitions and XML file as databases for message data. I was following the example I found: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.xml.xmldatadocument.dataset%28v=VS.100%29.aspx I wrote my own xsd and XML file. I used the same approach in the example, read the xsd file and then load the xml file. But I don't have any "Rows" created for my DataTable. I used debugger to step through my codes. When I am get my DataTable use xmlDataDocument.DataSet.Tables["name of the table"], the Rows property of that tables is 0. Does anybody know what might cause the DataSet tables not get populated after I loaded the xmlDataDocument with XML file? Here is a fragment of XSD file: and here is a fragment of the XML file: 16 7 0 NONE 5 It could be the XML and XSD file I created missed something. Please help. Thanks
