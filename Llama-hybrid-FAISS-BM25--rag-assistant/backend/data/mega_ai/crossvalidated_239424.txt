Perhaps an example would help. Suppose you observe a number of people and count how many of them are women. The resulting proportion is what is called a count proportion and takes on values between zero and one but only $n+1$ of them where $n$ is the total number you observed. Suppose you buy a sausage from your local supermarket and observe on the label that it is 80% pork that is an example of a continuous proportion and could take on any value between 0 and 100. The distinction in modelling is that in the first case it is meaningful to predict the probability of a random person being a woman (logistic regression) but in the second case that is not a sensible question and something else (often beta regression) would be preferred.
