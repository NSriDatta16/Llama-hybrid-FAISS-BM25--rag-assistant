Pooled time series regression in R

I've got data on mail volume sent by household for seven age groups, with 12 years of data for each age group. I originally ran a simple regression on each age group individually and realized I needed to dig deeper. My aim now is to pool the data (giving me 84 observations) and try to identify some period effects (or year effects, whichever you prefer). My pooled data are currently organized like this (PPHPY stands for Pieces per Household Per Year): Age Group Year PPHPY 1 2001 127.62 1 2002 144.47 1 2003 111.70 1 2004 95.96 1 2005 96.46 1 2006 139.91 1 2007 85.52 1 2008 75.43 1 2009 109.34 1 2010 53.16 1 2011 64.09 1 2012 50.94 2 2001 176.48 2 2002 172.86 2 2003 137.79 . . . . . . . . . 7 2012 163.39 I first regressed PPHPY on year and year dummies (leaving the intercept as 0 to avoid perfect multicollinearity). This gave me period effects for the aggregated data (ie something like a period effect across all age groups, I think). This looked like the following: > ## Generate YearDummy using factor() > > YearDummy > ## Check to see that YearDummy is indeed a factor variable > > is.factor(YearDummy) [1] TRUE > > ## (...+0) ensures intercept is left out and thus YearDummy1 remains in. ## One or the other must be subtracted out to avoid perfect mutlicollinearity > > LSDVYear summary(LSDVYear) Call: lm(formula = PPHPY ~ YearVar + YearDummy + 0, data = maildatapooled) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -99.658 -39.038 8.814 43.670 82.300 Coefficients: (1 not defined because of singularities) Estimate Std.

This is what I'm not sure how to set up. I was hoping someone might help me devise some code in R that would kick out those period effects for each of the seven age groups using the pooled data, as well as help me understand the problem conceptually. EDIT: I forgot to mention that I see I must include an interaction term involving the time dummies to allow the coefficients to vary across age groups. I'm just having difficulty constructing the proper interaction term and resulting regression equation. EDIT 2: I came up with two models and ran them. I felt like the question had evolved at this point and might merit a new post, which is can be found here .
