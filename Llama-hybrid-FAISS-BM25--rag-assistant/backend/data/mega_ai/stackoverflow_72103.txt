How do I reference a local resource in generated HTML in WinForms WebBrowser control?

I'm using a winforms webbrowser control to display some content in a windows forms app. I'm using the DocumentText property to write the generated HTML. That part is working spectacularly. Now I want to use some images in the markup. (I also would prefer to use linked CSS and JavaScript, however, that can be worked around by just embedding it.) I have been googling over the course of several days and can't seem to find an answer to the title question. I tried using a relative reference: the app exe is in the bin\debug. The images live in the "Images" directory at the root of the project. I've set the images to be copied to the output directory on compile, so they end up in bin\debug\Images*. So I then use a reference like this "Images..." thinking it will be relative to the exe. However, when I look at the image properties in the embedded browser window, I see the image URL to be "about:blankImages/*". Everything seems to be relative to "about:blank" when HTML is written to the control. Lacking a location context, I can't figure out what to use for a relative file resource reference. I poked around the properties of the control to see if there is a way to set something to fix this. I created a blank html page, and pointed the browser at it using the "Navigate()" method, using the full local path to the file. This worked fine with the browser reporting the local "file:///..." path to the blank page. Then I again wrote to the browser, this time using Document.Write(). Again, the browser now reports "about:blank" as the URL. Short of writing the dynamic HTML results to a real file, is there no other way to reference a file resource? I am going to try one last thing: constructing absolute file paths to the images and writing those to the HTML. My HTML is being generated using an XSL transform of a serialized object's XML so I'll need to play with some XSL parameters which will take a little extra time as I'm not that familiar with them.
