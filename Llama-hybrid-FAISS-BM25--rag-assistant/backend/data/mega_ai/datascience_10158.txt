Can FTRL be applied on linear least squares? or is it just for logistic regression models?

I'm exploring follow-the-regularized-leader FTRL proximal gradient descent: paper , reference implementation . Everywhere FTRL is mentioned, the loss surface for the gradient decent is the LogLoss , and the model for prediction is Logistic regression . Can I use the same algorithm for a linear least squares model? I have a problem I want to model with a linear model and define the loss by least squares , and then do FTRL to find the optimal solution - do you see any problem with that? Thanks.
