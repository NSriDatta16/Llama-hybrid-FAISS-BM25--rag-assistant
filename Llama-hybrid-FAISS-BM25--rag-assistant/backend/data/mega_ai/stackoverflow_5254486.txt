i usually place it in the same page that it will be used and keep it on the bottom. you can have it on an external page its up to you. but the page that you will be calling whether its a php or asp etc. needs to be in a seperate file. it wont work if you havae it on the same page. here is an example of what i mean. i place these on the verry bottom of the page right before the body tag so that it will work 100%. $.get("ajax.php", { id: hash }, function(out) { myvariable = out.myoutput; }, "json"); and the call file ajax.php is in a seperate file and does what i need it to do and the output from the php goes to out.myoutput . i can either print this or store it in a variable as i have. let me know if i make sense
