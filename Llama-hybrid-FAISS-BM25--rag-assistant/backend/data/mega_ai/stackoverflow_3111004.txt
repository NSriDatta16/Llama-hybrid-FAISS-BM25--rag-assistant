You're talking about unobstrusive javascript , which is the hype thing right now. "Unobtrusive JavaScript" is an emerging technique in the JavaScript programming language, as used on the World Wide Web. Though the term is not formally defined, its basic principles are generally understood to include: Separation of functionality (the "behavior layer") from a Web page's structure/content and presentation Best practices to avoid the problems of traditional JavaScript programming (such as browser inconsistencies and lack of scalability) Progressive enhancement to support user agents that may not support advanced JavaScript functionality To me this is the best solution for these reasons. About question #2, there are overhead to use selectors, but with proper optimisations you should be ok. If you notice some speed issue, you can call the selectors only when needed and not all the time.
