How to get amount of serialized bytes representing a Java object?

What syntax would I use to get the number of bytes representing a string and compare them to the number of bytes representing an ArrayList holding that string, for example? I am using a multi-agent agent system to send objects via messages and I want to keep track of how much space each message takes up. The method doesn't have to be dead-on accurate, as long as it scales proportionally to the actual size of the object. E.g. a Vector of strings of length 4 will report as smaller than a Vector of strings of length 5.
