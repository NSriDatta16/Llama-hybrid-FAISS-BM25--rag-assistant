What you call "encoding-information" is actually a BOM. I suspect each of those "characters" is getting encoded separately. To write the BOM manually, you have to write it as three bytes , not three characters. I'm not familiar with the .NET I/O classes, but there should be a method available to you that takes a byte or byte[] parameter and writes them directly to the file. By the way, the UTF-8 BOM is optional; in fact, its use is discouraged by the Unicode Consortium. If you don't have a specific reason for using it, save yourself some hassle and leave it out. EDIT: I just remembered you can also write the actual BOM character , '\uFEFF' , and let the encoder handle it: context.Response.Write('\uFEFF');
