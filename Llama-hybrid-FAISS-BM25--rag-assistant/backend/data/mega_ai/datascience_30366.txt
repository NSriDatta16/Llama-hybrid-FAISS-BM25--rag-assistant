Automatically generating images for an art show with deep learning software

My pursuit is to generate something like a grottesque(a kind of painting producing human-animals and plants hybrids). I need to do something like this painting in order to create an art exhibition. I don't need that produced images are ordinate or beautiful, just monstrous images produced automatically by a computer. Can someone help me? And is it possible to do it in a month?
