Can you store facebook users' data and for how long?

Hi I am developing a facebook app that involves the use of the user's email and ID. Storing usersâ€™ info to database is a more efficient approach for the purpose of the app. I am wondering if I am allowed to do this. I have read that facebook does not allow the storage of any kind of user's data for more than 7 days, however officially facebook website does not seem to mention this. Do you have any information about this issue?
