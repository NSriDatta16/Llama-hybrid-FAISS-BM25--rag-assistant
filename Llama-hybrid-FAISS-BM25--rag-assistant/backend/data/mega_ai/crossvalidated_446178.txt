Rows and columns of the one-step transition probability matrix

I am currently studying the textbook Introduction to Modeling and Analysis of Stochastic Systems, Second Edition , by V. G. Kulkarni. In a section on discrete-time Markov chains , the author introduces the one-step transition probability matrix as follows: $$P = \begin{bmatrix} p_{1, 1} & p_{1, 2} & p_{1, 3} & \dots & p_{1, N} \\ p_{2, 1} & p_{2, 2} & p_{2, 3} & \dots & p_{2, N} \\ p_{3, 1} & p_{3, 2} & p_{3, 3} & \dots & p_{3, N} \\ \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ p_{N, 1} & p_{N, 2} & p_{N, 3} & \dots & p_{N, N} \end{bmatrix} \tag{2.4}$$ The matrix $P$ in the equation above is called the one-step transition probability matrix , or transition matrix for short, of the DTMC. Note that the rows correspond to the starting state and the columns correspond to the ending state of a transition. I'm not sure what the author means by the following: ... the rows correspond to the starting state and the columns correspond to the ending state of a transition. I would greatly appreciate it if people would please take the time to clarify this.
