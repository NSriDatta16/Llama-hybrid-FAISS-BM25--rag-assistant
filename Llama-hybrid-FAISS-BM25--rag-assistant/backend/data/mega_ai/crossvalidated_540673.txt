You could pull several time series features from your input and compare to the forecast itself. For example, you could take the weighted average (weighting more recent points more) of your input and make sure the average of the forecast is within some reasonable percentage like 20%. You could also do something similar with a trend line (once again weighting more recent points more by doing WLS or something) and compare that to the coefficient for the trend line in the forecast. Other things could be simple seasonality tests and making sure the forecast is using seasonality and it wasn't optimized (I have no idea what your methods are) to not have seasonality or vice versa. You could take a look at tsfeatures for any other relative features to compare. I would just use several pieces of logic like this to surface potentially bad forecasts based on what 'makes sense' for you.
