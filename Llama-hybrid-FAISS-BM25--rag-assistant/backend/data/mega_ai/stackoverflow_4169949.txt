Organizing ASP.NET resource files in folders based on language

In my application's root App_LocalResources I've created several resource files ( .resx ) to localize my application for multiple languages. For Spanish, I copied over the default resource files and added .es before the .resx so that the full name is myresource.es.resx . When I change the UI culture, the language change works fine. However, when I wanted to organize my Spanish resource files in one folder (tried: es-Es , es and Spanish ) under the App_LocalResources folder, the application stopped recognizing the resource files. Is there a convention of how to organize resources files for each language so that I don't have a single folder with all the resource files?
