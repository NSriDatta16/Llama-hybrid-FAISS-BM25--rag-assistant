Time series data to measure the effect of an intervention on inpatient utilization

I have a general knowledge of regression, but I don't know what is the best approach to analyze these data. The dataset represents quarterly rates of inpatient use for three provider groups prov1 , prov2 and prov3 . The rates were measured on quarterly basis from qrt-4 2005 until qrt-3 2012 . On the 3rd qrt of 2008 an intervention was implemented by provider groups 1 and 2 , provider 3 represents all other providers of a network that did not participate of the intervention; so this is our control group. The purpose of this project is to measure the effect of the intervention between the before and after periods and between the participating and non-participating providers. Here is an example of the data: Qrt-Yr Period Prov1 prov2 Prov3 Q4-2005 Before 103.4 201.1 189.9 Q1-2006 Before 175.4 224.2 184.5 Q2-2006 Before 140.2 237.3 187.7 Q3-2006 Before 196.8 255.6 183.5 Q4-2006 Before 222.1 204.7 187.7 Q1-2007 Before 172.5 212.5 189.7 Q2-2007 Before 172.7 207.9 185.9 Q3-2007 Before 128.8 214.7 192.9 Q4-2007 Before 164.9 197.7 205.5 Q1-2008 Before 172.1 225.9 210.3 Q2-2008 Before 103.9 209.3 203.1 Q3-2008 Before 151.1 223.7 211.4 Q4-2008 After 200.8 234.3 189.6 Q1-2009 After 158.1 185.6 206.8 Q2-2009 After 103.8 218.2 187.9 Q3-2009 After 132.7 204.6 202.5 Q4-2009 After 178.7 218.7 191.3 Q1-2010 After 181.0 223.6 178.4 Q2-2010 After 119.9 203.2 191.3 Q3-2010 After 144.6 228.7 193.8 Q4-2010 After 87.2 161.0 173.1 Q1-2011 After 102.4 178.7 175.8 Q2-2011 After 151.0 173.4 169.9 Q3-2011 After 137.1 233.9 187.5 Q4-2011 After 83.0 226.6 164.3 Q1-2012 After 147.6 193.7 172.0 Q2-2012 After 103.8 163.5 171.7 Q3-2012 After 159.1 180.8 172.5 Q4-2012 After 133.1 155.1 160.7
