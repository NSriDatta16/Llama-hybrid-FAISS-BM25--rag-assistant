Simplest way to send messages between Matlab, VB6 and VB.NET programs

We are upgrading a suite of data acquisition and analysis routines from VB6 programs to a mixture of VB.NET, VB6, and Matlab programs. We want to keep the system modular (separate EXEs) so we can easily create specialized stand-alone analysis programs without having to constantly upgrade one massive application. We have used MBInterProcess to send messages between EXEs when all the programs were written in VB6 and this worked perfectly for us (e.g., to have the data acquisition EXE send the latest file name to a stand-alone data display program). Unfortunately, this ActiveX cannot be used within Matlab or VB.NET to receive messages. We are wondering what is the simplest string message passing system (pipes, registered messages, etc) that we could adopt. Right now we are just polling to see if new file was written in a specific folder, which can't be the best solution. Our ideal solution would not require a huge investment in time learning nuances of Windows (we are biologists, not full-time programmers) and would work in both WinXP and 64-bit versions of Windows. In response to the queries, we have wrapped the entire Matlab session within a VB6 program that has the MBInterProcess ActiveX control. That works but is not a great solution for us since it will probably lock us into WinXP forever (and certainly will prevent us from using the 64-bit version of Matlab). The latest version of Matlab (2009a) can access .NET functions directly, so we assume one solution might be to use the .NET library to implement pipes (or something similar) across programs. We would like to recreate the elegantly simple syntax of the MBInterProcess ActiveX and have a piece of code that listens for a message with that program's top-level Windows name, and then call a specific Matlab m-file, or VB.NET function, with the string data (e.g., file name) as an argument.
