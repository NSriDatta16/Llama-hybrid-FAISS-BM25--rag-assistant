Yield from C# to C++, dealing with containers

Actually, I have a design question here. Its very simple but the point is: I have one C++ class that has a STL vector declared as a private member. But the clients of that class need to iterate over this vector. In C# we have a very handy statement, the Yield, that in cases like that, you write a function returning an IEnumerable and it "yields" you a nice way to iterate over a private container inside that class. I'm just trying to find an elegant solution for C++, instead of using methods like GetValue(int idx). Any suggestions? Example: class Fat { public: Fat(); // some code here ... private: void LoadSectors(SECT startPoint); std::vector sectors; }; class Storage { public: Storage(string CompoundFile); //For example, this method will receive a ref to my fat system and iterate over //the fat array in order to read every sector. LoadStrem(Fat& fat); }; This is far simple example.
