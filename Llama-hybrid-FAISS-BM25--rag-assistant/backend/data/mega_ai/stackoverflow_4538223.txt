Ok, after a while I found some answers and discovered a few things on my own. As for the DragDropEffect enum, it should be used for two reasons: To distinguish if the item is moved or copied in the code. It serves like a flag and should be used most commonly like this: if (e.DragDropEffect == DragDropEffect.Move) { ... } else ... To decorate the mouse cursor based on the enum value. This way it tells the user if he or she is moving or copying the item. As for the drag and drop visualization here's a link to the post containing the reference which is an excellent starting point for drag and drop to build on: WPF Drag & Drop: How to literally drag an element?
