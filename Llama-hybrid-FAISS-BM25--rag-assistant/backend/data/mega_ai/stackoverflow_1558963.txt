XtraGrid doesn't display properly newly added line

I'm using XtraGrid of DevExpress 2.9.5 to display a blotter of dynamic set of lines. The blotter is integrated into another application, this is why it has to be based on UserControl class and also implement a couple of custom interfaces. public partial class BlotterForm : UserControl, ISMMdiEmbeddable, ISMAssociatedMFCWindow { private BindingList fDeals; .... } As the data is binded to control using BindedList, any change should be reflected in the form automatically. And if I try to add new line to fDeals like follows: public void AddDeal() { fDeals.Add(new BlotterTrade(1,2,3)); } ... i can see the line, but it's content is rubbish. I tried to do the same in a small test application. It works ok with only difference that the blotter in test application is based on DevExpress.XtraEditors.XtraForm. To me it looks now that the form of original blotter doesn't overload some method or miss some event. But I cannot find out what exactly is missed. Can somebody tell me what I do wrong or don't do? Thanks.
