As with any other SDK/Language, there are many ways to do this. Here is the first one that I can think of: Get the raw data into Crystal. (Sounds like you already did this) In Crystal, make a new formula, call it "GroupByDate". In the formula editor , enter: datepart("yyyy-mm-dd",{mytable.mydatefield}) Go into the Group Expert . Group your report by GroupByDate. Make a new formula, call it "AddMe". In the formula editor , enter: iif({mytable.foo="bar",1,0) Drag & drop your AddMe formula into the details section. Right-click on it to Insert -> Summary . Set your summary location as the group footer. Preview your report and you should see the total counts in every group footer. To simplify the appearance of the report, you can also suppress the display of the detail and grouper header sections. Again, there are many ways to do this. You can also get creative with a Running Total function. The Crystal Formula Editor has very useful help files. Use the Functions pane to select a function, press F1, and you'll get criteria, examples, etc.
