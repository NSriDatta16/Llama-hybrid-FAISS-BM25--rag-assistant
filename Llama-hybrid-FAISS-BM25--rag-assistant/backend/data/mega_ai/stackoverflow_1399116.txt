I believe that the " parent = 0x0 " piece of the debug output is referring to a parent graphics item (as opposed to a parent QObject, for example). As mentioned in the QGraphicsitem documentation , graphics items can have parent items (which means that transformations applied to the parent will also be applied to the children). Calling addEllipse(...) will create a stand-alone graphics item, with no parent (but will add it to the scene). Regarding your deletion code, what does the QGraphicsItem::scene() return Immeadiately after creating the graphics item with addEllipse() Right before removing the graphics item? If it returns NULL right after creation, then something is going wrong in the creation of the graphics item. If it's later, then something is borked in your map storage & retrieval code. I'm a but confused as to why you're storing pointers to QGraphicsLineItem s, and creating QGraphicsEllipseItem s? I assume this is a typo?
