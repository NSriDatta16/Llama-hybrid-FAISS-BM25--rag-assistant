The answer, of course, is: It depends. In particular, it depends on which file system you use. For example, the ext2 and ext3 file systems have a limits to the number of files per directory. Those file systems would not be able to put all of your pictures in one directory! You might look into something other than a file system. In the company I work for, because we needed to store lots of material, we moved from file-based storage to a database-based storage run on Apache Jackrabbit .
