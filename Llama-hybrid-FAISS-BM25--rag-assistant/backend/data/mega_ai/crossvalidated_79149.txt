How much do self organising maps suffer from local minima problems?

How much do self organising maps suffer from local minima problems? I assume that the original orientation of the grid can have major orientation on the resulting shape of the grid, but does this have large impacts on the fit (e.g. mean square difference from data to assigned grid points), or are the differences fairly small?
