Unable to import xgboost 0.9

When running import xgboost as xgb print(xgb.__version__) I am getting the following error: xgboost.core.XGBoostError: XGBoost Library (libxgboost.dylib) could not be loaded. Likely causes: * OpenMP runtime is not installed (vcomp140.dll or libgomp-1.dll for Windows, libgomp.so for UNIX-like OSes) * You are running 32-bit Python on a 64-bit OS As stated in this other question here I am running 64-bit Python since this: import sys print(sys.maxsize > 2**32) returns True . Finally, to install OpenMP I tried this: brew install libomp but the problem persists.
