You need to do feature extraction or feature engineering to create variables in your training data that "catch" those patterns you boxed in and then have a target variable saying "malice found" or "malice found not found" Take a really simple example: predicting if it is going to rain. You could come up with a reasonably good predictor of rain in the next 30 minutes that checked every 30 minutes if 1. it suddenly got cloudy and 2. barometric pressure dropped.
