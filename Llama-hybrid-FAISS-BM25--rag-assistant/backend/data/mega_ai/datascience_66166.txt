To have intuition, let's make simplify the problem. Let's say that you are using PCA and that you are getting a linear function. If you donÂ´t get any clusters it means that it is not possible to separate them by linear combinations of the features that you have. And since it is a linear function, as you move in this direction there is a change in the variance. t-SNE is similar to PCA but it does nonlinear combinations of features. And the dimensionality reduction that you have maintains the variance in a nonlinear way. So just change the world linear for non-linear in the second paragraph to answer your question. By the way, this doesn't mean that if you make a classification problem with Machine Learning you are going to have bad results. ML can still work in this case.
