How can a Spring Soap interceptor modify the contents of a message?

I'm trying to write an interceptor for a web service that will modify the contents of the Soap message before is sent on to the endpoint. If a client sent a message where the value of some element is 1, I want to be able to alter that element to a 2 so that, when the message arrives at the endpoint, it looks as if the client submitted a 2 instead of a 1. I'm not sure if this is a difficult task which is elluding me, or an easy task which I am making harder than it needs to be. I have stepped through some of the Spring interceptors; but the validation and logging interceptors don't every alter the message that is in transit. The Wss4jSecurityInterceptor does add some properties to the MessageContext; but I haven't been able to leverage anything that it is doing. I have a shell of an interceptor; but nothing that is doing anything of any value. public boolean handleRequest(MessageContext messageContext, Object endpoint) throws Exception { SaajSoapMessage saajSoapMessage = (SaajSoapMessage) messageContext .getRequest(); SOAPMessage soapMessage = saajSoapMessage.getSaajMessage(); SOAPBody soapBody = soapMessage.getSOAPBody(); return true; } I was hoping there was a chance that soembody else had already solved this particular problem. Any insight would be appreciated. Thanks.
