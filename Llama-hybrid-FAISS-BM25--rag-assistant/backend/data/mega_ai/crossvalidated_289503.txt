How is the decision boundary's equation determined?

Machine learning newbie/enthusiast here, following Andrew Ng's course @ Coursera . I'm studying logistic regression. I've understood that, depending on the data, the decision boundary can be described by a simple linear equation (a line) as well as more complex higher-order polynomials (curves, circles, odd shapes). What's not 100% clear to me: how is the decision boundary's equation determined? For example: The decision boundary here is a circle, defined as $ \theta_0 + \theta_1x_1 + \theta_2x_2 + \theta_3x_1^2 + \theta_4x_2^2 = 0 $ Is the logistic regression algorithm capable of generating such a complex formula, or is it something to tweak manually?
