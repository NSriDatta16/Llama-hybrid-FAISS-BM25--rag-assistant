Generating time series with copula

I want to generate univariate time series in R using copulas. Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots X_N,\ldots$ denote random variables such that joint distribution of $X_t$ and $X_{t-1}$ is $C(F(X_t), F(X_{t-1}))$, where $F$ denotes a marginal distribution function, and $C$ a copula. I am a beginner in R, and at present I face some difficulties understanding the syntax. I think I should generate a first observation, then with the first observation use the conditional cdf and generate second observation, and so on. But I don't understand how to construct the conditional distribution (the function ccopula from the copula package is not working properly). I would be glad for any help.
