A classic peak detection approach in signal processing is as follows: Filter the signal to some reasonable reasonable range, depending on sampling rate and signal properties, e.g. for ECG, an IIR bandpass filter @0.5-20Hz, a zero-phase filter will ensure that no phase shift (and associated time lag) is introduced A hilbert transform or a wavelet approach can then be used to emphasize the peaks A static or dynamic threshold can then be applied, where all samples above the threshold are deemed peaks. In the case of a dynamic threshold, it is usually defined as a threshold N standard deviations above or below a moving average estimate of the mean. Another approach that works is to compare a sharply highpass filtered signal against a heavily smoothed (low-pass or median filtered) and apply step 3. Hope this helps.
