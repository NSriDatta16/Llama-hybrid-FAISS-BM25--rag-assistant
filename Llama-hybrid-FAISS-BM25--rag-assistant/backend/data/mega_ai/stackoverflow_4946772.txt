Symbian has a very archaic SDK. Some concepts are from the times when booleans and exceptions were not supported by an average C++ compiler. Therefore it is very cumbersome to work with, especially if you are used to more modern SDKs. Maybe you noticed the TBool typedef, which is used instead of boolean, Descriptors were introduced because there was no standard string in C++ at the time, and as soon as you are doing something non-trivial, you will have to commit to the wonders of symbian garbage collector which is, to put it mildly, archaic and does not mix well with Qt's standard C++ exception handling. The reason why people still code in native Symbian is either 1. they've been doing this for years 2. they're nuts/masochistic/adventurous 3. they need to use some specific functionality, that is not yet implemented/properly released in Qt APIs (e.g. if you need advanced camera functionality).
