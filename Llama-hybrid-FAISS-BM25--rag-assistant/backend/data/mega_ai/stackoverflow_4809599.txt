The Decimal Formater java doc descibe how to handle the Exponent. Scientific Notation Numbers in scientific notation are expressed as the product of a mantissa and a power of ten, for example, 1234 can be expressed as 1.234 x 10^3. The mantissa is often in the range 1.0 The more difficult part is how to switch betwenn normal and Scientific Notation. I have done this by embedding two decimal formater in an choide formatter within an Messageformater: MessageFormat format = new MessageFormat( "{0,choice,0#{0,number,'#,##0.####'}|99999 (This excample is with only 6 decimal places, but you can change it.) The usage of an message format is a bit different to an decimal formater, because the format metthod expect an array of objects. System.out.println(format.format(new Object[] { 123 })); What it prints for (1, 12, 123, ...) is: 1 1.1 12 123 1,234 12,345 123456E0 123456.7E1 123456.78E2 123456.789E3 123456.789E4 123456.789E5 123456.789E6 You need to tune the pattern a bit that it matches your 20 diget requirement, but the way should be clear. Even if I have showed that it worked, I would recommend to implement your own Formater which uses 2 decimal formater and an if condition.
