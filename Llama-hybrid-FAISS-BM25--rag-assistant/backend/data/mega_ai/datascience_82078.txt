Machine learning algorithms for Geometrical objects shapes identification

Are there Machine learning algorithms which will take input dataset of all geometrical objects shapes as images in gif,jpg,tiff formats & output the geometrical shapes names? i.e. Geometrical Objects pattern identification. Examples : Square, Rectangle, Kite, Circle, Sphere, Cone, Rhombus, Ellipse, Cylinder, Pentagon etc These are examples of potential inputs with corresponding labels
