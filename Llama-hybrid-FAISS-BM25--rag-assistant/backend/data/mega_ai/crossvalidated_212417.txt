Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM/GRU) in Matlab?

I wish to explore Gated Recurrent Neural Networks (e.g. LSTM) in Matlab. The closest match I could find for this is the layrecnet . The description for this function is very short and not very clear (i.e. not using a terminology that I am used to). My question therefore is if this function contains a gate (I am 90 % sure that it doesn't), and if it doesn't, if there are any other Matlab implementations that do? I would prefer native (i.e. Neural Network Toolbox) implementations if possible.
