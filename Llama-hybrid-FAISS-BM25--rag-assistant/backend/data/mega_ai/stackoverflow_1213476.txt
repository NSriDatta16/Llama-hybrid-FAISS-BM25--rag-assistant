Looking at the http protocol, POST or GET should be equally easy and fast to parse. I would argue, there is no performance difference. Take a look at the raw HTTP headers http GET GET /index.html?userid=joe&password=guessme HTTP/1.1 Host: www.mysite.com User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 http POST POST /login.jsp HTTP/1.1 Host: www.mysite.com User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 Content-Length: 27 Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded userid=joe&password=guessme From my point of view, performance should not be considered when comparing GET and POST.
