My suggestion would be to be looking at CSS, rather than h1, h2, h3, as those aren't really used in most websites. Large font sizes would probably mean title, more clearly than given tags and keywords. Smaller fonts with large paragraphs of text would most likely be the body, likewise. I don't think there is really a good way to do this, unless you act like you're viewing the page using a webbrowser, rather than just looking at the source (because that's how its intended for people to read. The feasibility of using pictures of a webpage and then using image processing to extract the content, however, is completely unrealistic). I hope this helps you.
