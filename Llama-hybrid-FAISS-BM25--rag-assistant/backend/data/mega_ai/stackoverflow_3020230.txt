If you look at the embed code for a few different YouTube videos, you will see that the only difference is a video ID (the " fYzblEeAt2U " part of a URL like " http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYzblEeAt2U ") Note that this appears twice in the embed code - first in the first param tag, and secondly in the embed tag. So you just need to serve up the standard embedding code, with that ID being replaced by your back-end code, maybe something like this: &hl=en_GB&fs=1&rel=0"> &hl=en_GB&fs=1&rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="385">
