I answered your previous question related to this, but it was not clear from that question that you were trying to cache dynamic content. The cache manifest is for getting static content you want for offline web apps to work. I am not sure you can do what you want. Do you want the app to be able to function offline, or are you just trying to peg something in the cache because it is slow to download? Unless you are actually constructing an offline webapp (which the user will add to as a bookmark or an app in the Spring Board) then your page can (and must necessarily) be evicted from local storage at the browsers discretion, regardless of how loose a cache policy you set on the page.
