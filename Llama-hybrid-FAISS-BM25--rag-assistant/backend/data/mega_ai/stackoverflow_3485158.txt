How to build an available web application

Let's say that we are about to build an web application where high availability is top focus. Our customers are companies, so downtime are equal to loss of revenue for everyone involved. To sum it up, we need to be online at all times to keep everyone happy. So, from a very basic perspective, what techniques should we be looking at to do this? We have pretty much no preferences besides that we will be using PHP to keep developing speed high, so we're totally open for new platforms of data storage and what else is out there to make it happen. Your answer is very appreciated! Thanks a lot!
