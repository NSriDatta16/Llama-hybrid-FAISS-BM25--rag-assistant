OpenCV static linking on 64 bit

I've written a simple application in OpenCV, and compiled it using the following command: g++ -I ./include/opencv -Wall -o imageHash imageHash.h imageHash.cpp -lcv -lhighgui What I'm trying to do next, is the following: use static linking, so I can run this application without the need to install openCV on the traget machine compile the app to a CPU independent form, so I can run this on 32 bit and 64 bit machines as well. How do I modify the compilation command, to achive the following? Thanks, krisy
