Hopefully your friend has graduated by now, but if not, the following might help. You were on the right track in your original post Partitioning variance from logistic regression , using glmer() for mixed-effects logistic regression. I would recommend against: the advisor's "solution", using lm() for logistic regression, and weighting rows equally (you should weight by N_indiv). Generalized linear mixed models are tough. http://glmm.wikidot.com/faq has some good information - including the fact that you need many levels of a random factor in order to estimate its variance component. My code below requires the lme4 package and the data from your link. # Seroprevalance has been rounded, that's not OK # to do logistic regression, (proportion * weight) must equal an integer prev$seroexact
