Start here - I actually think it's among the best Software Dev books that I've read. Expert Spring MVC And Web Flow Learn the new Annotation-based configuration for MVC classes. This is part of Spring 2.5. Using Annotation-based classes is going to make writing Unit tests a heck of a lot easier. Also being able to cut down on the amount of XML is a good thing. Oh yeah Unit Tests - if you're using Spring, you BETTER be Unit Testing. :) Write Unit tests for all of your Web and Service Layer classes. Read up on Domain Driven Design. The fact that you can use Domain Object classes at all levels of a Spring Application means you're going to have a VERY powerful Domain Model. Leverage it. However, when using your Domain Object classes for form population, you will want to take heed of the recent security concerns around the Spring Framework. A discussion on the Server Side reveals the way to close the hole in the comments.
