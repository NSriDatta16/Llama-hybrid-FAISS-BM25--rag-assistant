The question is really asking if you should do Z-score normalization of the columns before applying the SVD. This is because PCA is the above transformation followed by the SVD. Sometimes doing the normalization is quite harmful. If your data is for example (transformed) word counts which are positive, subtracting the mean is definitely harmful. This is because zeros which represent the absence of a word in a document will be mapped to negative numbers with high magnitude. In linear problems the higher magnitude should be used to represent the range where your features are most sensitive. Also dividing by the standard deviation is harmful for this type of data.
