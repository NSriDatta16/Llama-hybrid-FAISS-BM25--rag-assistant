In the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Edition of ECMAScript , using $-prefixed variable names was explicitly discouraged by the spec except in the context of autogenerated code: The dollar sign ( $ ) and the underscore ( _ ) are permitted anywhere in an identifier. The dollar sign is intended for use only in mechanically generated code. However, in the next version (the 5th Edition , which is current), this restriction was dropped, and the above passage replaced with The dollar sign ( $ ) and the underscore ( _ ) are permitted anywhere in an IdentifierName . As such, the $ sign may now be used freely in variable names. Certain frameworks and libraries have their own conventions on the meaning of the symbol, noted in other answers here.
