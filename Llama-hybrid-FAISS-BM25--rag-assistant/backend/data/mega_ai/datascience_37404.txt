There are two parts to the question. To solve the first problem, you can use something called Named Entity Recognition . The problem of finding date is actually a sub problem of the more general NER problem . Nevertheless , you can try the awesome Spacy NER Finder . import spacy nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm') doc = nlp(u'I want to go swimming next Tuesday') for ent in doc.ents: print(ent.text , ent.label_) next Tuesday DATE The code finds all the named entities in the text. You can filter out your relevant DATE entity if you get more than one kind of entity The second problem is a bit simpler, once you have the DATE entity , its only a matter of your Python abilities. You can go by the following: Get the DATE entity Save the current date and day . Determine how many days you need to add to the current date by comparing today's day and the extracted day from the text. Add the no. of days to Today's date to get the desired date
