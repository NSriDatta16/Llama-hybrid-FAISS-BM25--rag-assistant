Java Image Manipulation (Game Programmers)

Please take a look at the user Interface I am given a task of making a hardware GUI interface in java. As you can see the GUI is full of small individual images that need to change color or texts. For example the top UDU image has SPU turning red when the GUI is notified of an alarm going off. What is the best way to add such images to java/Netbeans? The images need to change. Adding an individual image per label is probably the worst way to go about it? I would appreciate any input from Java game programmers/drag and drop developers as they may know better about these stuffs. But everyone is more than welcome to answer.
