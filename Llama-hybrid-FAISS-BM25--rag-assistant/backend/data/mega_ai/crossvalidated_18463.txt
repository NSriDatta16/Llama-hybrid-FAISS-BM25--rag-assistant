This is definitely the machine learning problem (I updated tags in your post). Most probably, this is linear regression . In short, linear regression tries to recover relationship between 1 dependent and 1 or more independent variables. Dependent variable here is consumables usage . For independent variables I suggest time intervals between purchases. You can also add more independent variables, for example, number of people who used consumables at each moment, or anything else that can affect an amount of purchases. You can find nice description of linear regression together with implementation in Python here . In theory, it is also possible that not only time intervals between purchases, but also moments in time themselves influence on the amounts. For example, for some reason in January people may want more paper than, say, in April. In this case you cannot use number of month as independent variable itself due to the nature of linear regression itself (number of the month is just a label, but will be used as amount). So you have 2 ways how to overcome this. First, you can add 12 additional variables , one for each month , and set each variable to 1 if it represents month of purchase and to 0 if it doesn't. Then use same linear regression. Second, you can use use more sophisticated algorithm, such as M5' , which is mix of linear regression and decision trees (you can find detailed description of this algorithm in Data Mining: Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques ).
