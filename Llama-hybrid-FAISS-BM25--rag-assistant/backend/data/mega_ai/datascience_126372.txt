Not understanding how to eval a VAE model?

As I understanding the VAE, it's a model to get the P(x) of x(final job like image generation). When i train it, It input x from dataset to get mu and var from encoder, and to get a sample z from mu and var by z = mu + standard_normal * torch.exp(0.5 * log_var). and get x' by z from decoder. So when i want to use/eval the model I shouldn't have the original x. right? If i already have x, this job is meaningless. then how can i get z if I dont have x (cant get mu and var by encoder)? I googled and look some code on github. normally people eval this model by put x into it. But I don't get it......
