You should combine them with weights equal to their inverse variance $$b' = \frac{b_1*w_1+b_2*w_2}{w_1+w_2}$$ where $w_i=1/u_i^2$ and $u_i$ is the uncertainty on $b_i$. This way, the larger the uncertainty, the smaller the weight in the combination. The variance of the combination is obtained as $$\frac{1}{u'^2}=\frac{1}{u_1^2}+\frac{1}{u_2^2}$$ In the bayesian setting, you can get these formulae by applying $$p(b'|b_1,b_2,u_1,u_2) \propto p(b_2|b',u_2)*p(b'|b_1,u_1)$$ with normal pdfs.
