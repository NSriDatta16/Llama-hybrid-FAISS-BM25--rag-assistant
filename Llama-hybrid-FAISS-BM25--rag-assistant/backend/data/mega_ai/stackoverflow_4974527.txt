Sounds like a pretty tough thing to make, only because there is absolutely no standardization for this information that I know of. Some sites might put it in their keywords, others not. I did some scraping as part of a media criticism class, and I find that pretty much each cms has to be processed individually. Overall, making something that would find the author info on a random web pages sounds very difficult. You might be able to make something specifically for capturing this info from WordPress blogs, since those have so many commonalities. But something designed to just hit up any site and grab specific pieces of info, that's pretty tough. Not trying to discourage you at all, just saying that you've set a pretty high goal, imho.
