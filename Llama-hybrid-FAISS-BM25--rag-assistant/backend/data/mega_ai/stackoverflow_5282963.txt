If you want to play around with machine learning (classifiers and that sort of thing), Bayesian networks , or try your hand at creating your own algorithms but want to use some tools useful for doing that (e.g. ready made optimization and linear algebra tools) then check out dlib . I think its great, but I work on it so I'm biased :)
