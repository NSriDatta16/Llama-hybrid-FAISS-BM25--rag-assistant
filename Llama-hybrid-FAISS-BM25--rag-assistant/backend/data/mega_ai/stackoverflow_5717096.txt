How to create a editable property on a SharePoint 2010 Sandboxed Visual WebPart

I am developing a sandboxed visual webpart using SharePoint 2010 in Visual Studio 2010 with the SharePoint powertools installed. The webpart deploys and works as expected, except that the properties are not editable. I believe that the core problem is that WebPartStorageAttribute is not available in sandbox, but haven't been able to find guidance on how to create a sandboxed webpart with editable properties. Is this even possible? [ToolboxItem(false)] [XmlRoot(Namespace="MyNamespace")] public partial class MyWebPart: System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts.WebPart { const string defaultStartTime = "00:30:00"; private string _startTime = "00:30:00"; [Browsable(true)] [WebBrowsable(true)] [Category("Timer")] [Description("Start time to use if the user has not set a different one.")] [XmlElement(ElementName="StartTime")] [DefaultValue(defaultStartTime)] [FriendlyName("Start Time")] public string StartTime { get { return _startTime; } set { _startTime = value; } } ... Is there something missing in the above code? Is it possible to create an editable sandboxed webpart, and if so, how is it done?
