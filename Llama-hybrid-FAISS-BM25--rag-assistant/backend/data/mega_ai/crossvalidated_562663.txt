I have heard that Evolutionary Algorithms (e.g. Genetic Algorithms, Simulated Annealing, Differential Evolution, etc.) can display considerable advantages compared to Gradient Based Optimization Algorithms (e.g. Gradient Descent) - this is because repeatedly taking derivatives of functions with many variables is usually a lot more "computationally expensive" compared to the operations typically performed by Evolutionary Algorithms (e.g. crossover, mutation) . Evolutionary algorithms proceed by doing random mutation, keeping the best candidates, and mutating them again. This is a slow and noisy process, same as biological evolution that needed millions of years to achieve what it achieved. Gradient descent is more computationally demanding, but by moving along the gradient each step is supposed to go in the "correct direction", hence move faster. If each step is slower, but you need less steps, the you may be faster overall. With evolutionary algorithms you need the computational resources for doing a lot of iterations. Evolutionary algorithms are used for some tasks like architecture search or reinforcement learning, but not for optimization in general because they would be inefficient. This post summarizes the common disadvantages: GA based methods generally require more iterations to reach the minima compared to well-optimized SGD based methods. If the mutation rate is high, learning becomes unpredictable and noisy. If the mutation rate is low, learning becomes slow and can stick in local minima. Bad performance for high dimensional and complex data patterns (this needs further investigation especially with CNN architecture which we have not investigated here). GA is a population-based learning, therefore, we cannot take inspirations from this method to find more about the learning method used by our brains. This also answers your question about robustness, since the algorithm is completely randomized, the results are not necessary robust in terms of their consistency.
