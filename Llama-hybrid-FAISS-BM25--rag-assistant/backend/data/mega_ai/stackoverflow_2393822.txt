Tagging can be very useful in every case. For example, gmail applies tags to all emails. Tags could be predefined (with a fixed meaning), or user generated. Having those predefined tags is important as they work like categories, can be controlled by the store owners, and still don't force you to use a hierarchy. You can emulate a category system with tags by enforcing some specific rules on the type of allowable tags, but you can't go the other way round with hierarchical categories. So, for example, to find all incoming emails on gmail, we can search by the inbox tag. tag:inbox Or to get all unread emails in the inbox, we can search by two tags: tag:inbox && tag:unread It's much better than trying to categorize in possibly this fashion, for example: /Inbox /Inbox/Unread /Inbox/Spam Not that anyone cares about spam (the actual ones), but spam can be unread too. So should we introduce another sub-category called Unread inside Spam , or do some other restructuring within Inbox itself? /Inbox/Spam/Unread Another store-specific example could be to find all SLR cameras on Amazon that uses compact flash for storage, and supports RAW, and JPEG formats, we could theoretically use: tag:camera && tag:SLR && tag:Compact-Flash && tag:RAW-format && tag:JPEG-format Categorization forces you to choose a hierarchy which might mean you have to pick one between two or more perfectly reasonable choices. For example, is an iPod Touch a music player, or a video player, or maybe a portable computer, or all of it?
