appropriate ICC

My apologies this is a rookie question, I am aware of what ICC(Intraclass correlation) is, and that it measures how strongly subjects in the same group resemble each other. However I am not sure how to estimate the ICC for a set of observation like this. Id here represents subject Id, each subject is measured for three different parameters and Average is the average of those three parameters. Id Time y1 y2 y3 Average 1 t1 16.11 14.40 2.49 11.00 1 t2 15.67 14.48 7.00 12.38 2 t3 11.24 17.32 3.68 10.75 3 t1 17.93 11.61 1.62 10.39 3 t2 11.82 14.96 8.08 11.62 4 t3 12.95 14.00 1.59 9.51 5 t1 12.68 10.02 1.59 8.10 5 t1 11.53 14.52 10.20 12.08 6 t2 11.74 11.85 3.26 8.95 Any suggestions or advise is highly appreciated. Thanks.
