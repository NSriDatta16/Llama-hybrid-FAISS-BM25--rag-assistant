The question is very, very broad. Interpreting it as "can I use Javascript on the server": Fundamentally, sure, Javascript is a very powerful language and so you can do development in it server-side just like you can client-side (and if you do client-side scripting as well, you get some definite reuse benefits using Javascript on the server). For Apache systems, there's the v8cgi project (a FastCGI Javascript plug-in with connectors, using Google's freaky-fast V8 engine ). On Microsoft-based systems, IIS supports Javascript ( JScript ) on the server out of the box (I use that all the time), which has access to all of the ActiveX stuff (e.g., for talking to databases, dealing with the file system, etc.). If your server framework is JVM-based, there's Rhino , which is Javascript for the Java platform and has access to all (or nearly all) of the libraries available for Java â€” e.g., a huge ecosystem of libraries and plug-ins. Aside from v8cgi, there are a couple of other projects built on Google's V8 engine. There's a place that does a full stack for you called chromeserver (I don't know what their backend is; I'm not going to infer from the name). Paul mentioned ServerJS and NodeJS . There's the whole CommonJS project. Etc. etc. etc. There's quite a list on Wikipedia . Arguing against, there's a very rich ecosystem built around PHP. Unless you're using something like Rhino for the Java platform or JScript on IIS (because of the ecosystems they leverage), you may find that you don't have nearly that ecosystem available to you when developing in Javascript for the server. I mean, if you're looking for pre-built forum or wiki software (for example), let's just say you can't swing a dead cat without finding one based on PHP, and the same cannot be said of Javascript on the server.
