How to disable task scanning for PHP edition of Netbeans 6.9

Task scanning on very large projects seems to bog down the IDE. I love this editor and it's ability to parse large complex projects such as Magento, but performance can get iffy. According to this answer , it used to be possible to disable the plugin, but it seems that version 6.9 of Netbeans has made that impossible. Any ideas on how to disable? Thanks, JD
