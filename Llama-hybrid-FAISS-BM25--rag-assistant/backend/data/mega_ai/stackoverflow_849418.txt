You can't really hide that it's an Access database. Anyone can open the file in a hex editor (or even just notepad) and see a string like " Standard Jet DB " (Office 2000/XP/2003) or " Standard ACE DB " (Office 2007) staring right at them. Even if they don't know what that means Google will tell them soon enough. You use could a less-common database, but they will have similar weaknesses. If you really want security, you're going to have to encrypt the database file and use an engine that will let you keep a decrypted version in memory (IIRC sqlite supports this, or will soon) or use an engine that supports encryption natively. Even then, you can have problems if the ram is paged to disc or if another process "sniffs" your app's ram. A late update, but my attention was drawn back here today and I wanted to add that just about anything but Access will require you to distribute the engine with the application. You need to also take care that the files for the engine don't give it away as well. Access gets a pass because the engine is already part of windows. You might also try something that's open source, so you can re-compile it into your main application file.
