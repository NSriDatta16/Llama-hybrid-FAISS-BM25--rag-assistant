My only problem with the OP's code is that you're mixing paradigms -- doB shows an error by throwing an exception, while doSomething shows an error by returning a code. Ideally, you would pick one or the other. Of course, in legacy maintenance, you might not have that luxury. If you pick returning error codes, that's OK, but I dislike it because it encourages you to use side channels (like global variables) to communicate state on failure, rather than bundling that state into an exception and letting it bubble up the stack until you can do something about it.
