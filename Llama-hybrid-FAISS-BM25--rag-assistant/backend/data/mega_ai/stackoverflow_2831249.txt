It loops. Since you already set i=0 above, they have omitted that section of the for loop. Also, since you are incrementing the variable at the end, they have omitted that as well. They basically just turned a for loop into a while loop. It would probably be more elegant as: int i = 0; while( i != 10 ) { Console.WriteLine(i); i++; }
