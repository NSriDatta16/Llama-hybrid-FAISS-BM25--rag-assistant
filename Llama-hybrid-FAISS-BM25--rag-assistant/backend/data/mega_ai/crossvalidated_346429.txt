There are three problems with this distribution: the phrase " ... Bayesian prior probability of a distribution, e.g., X, conditioned on another distribution, e.g., Y" for me makes no sense, since your distribution, for your admission, is a distribution for the parameters of the Bernoulli and not the X and Y. the second one is that it has only one parameter ( $y$ ), which is equal to the mode (and not the mean, and this could be another problem) and you have no way to specify the variability of your distribution around the mode. if you are trying to model the bernoulli parameters, I suspect that then you need to specify also a prior over $y$ . $y$ appears in the normalization constant of $p(x|y)$ that (i may be wrong) is hard to compute. And, to answer the question, I don't think it has a name because it is not very useful
