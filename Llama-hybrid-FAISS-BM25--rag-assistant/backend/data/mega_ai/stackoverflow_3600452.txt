How to get Shipping/Billing Address ID of an order outside Magento core API?

I want to get a shipping/billing address id from a just complete order out of Magento. I have tried the following code but it's not worked: Mage::getModel('sales/order')->load($array_data["order_id"])->getShippingAddressId() Does someone have any ideas?
