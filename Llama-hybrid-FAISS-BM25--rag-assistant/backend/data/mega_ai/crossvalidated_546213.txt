Different periodical lag in two time series and different periodical correlation interpretation

I am working on two stock price movements over 2 years, a minute by minute change (over 1m rows). I ran cross correlation after making them stationary. There is a result that I am kind of confused with. r shows two stocks are moderately correlated without any change in the interval. But, when I change the time interval of price change from 'minute by minute' to 10 minute, r gets much higher, showing almost a perfect linear relationship. When I apply lag on one of the two stock price movements in either minute by minute or 10 minute basis, r shows no correlation. What I am stuck in is, the two stock price movements are identical when looked into in a 10 minute interval while quite different in a minute interval. I am guessing that one of stocks moves differently from the other, and then eventually follows and gets identical with the other every 10 minute. If it's true, there must be lag in its movement. It can be inconsistent (inconstant) one because I saw no lagged correlation from lagging one of the two movements as a whole. I would like to know what method I can use to find out whether there is an inconstant or inconsistent lag in one of the movements. Also, I would like to know if there's a way to identify every period where lag exists and how long it is in each lagged period. I first thought of DTW matrix, but it doesn't seem to be a proper one in my case. Simple search terms would help a lot too.
