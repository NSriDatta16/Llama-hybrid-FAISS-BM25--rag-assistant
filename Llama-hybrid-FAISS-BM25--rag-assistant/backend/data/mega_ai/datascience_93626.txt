How can I split hourly time series?

I'm newbie in R and time series analysis. I'm trying to build an Arima model. My dataset has this structure: DATA Ora VALORE 2018-09-01 1 3646742 2018-09-01 2 3273110 2018-09-01 3 3069245 2018-09-01 4 2969621 I've converted this dataset in a hourly time series and split it in a training set and a test set with this code: y Problems: test set contains two observations (instead 1488 = all July and all August 2020); training set contains 17518 observations (instead 16032). Can I solve these problems?
