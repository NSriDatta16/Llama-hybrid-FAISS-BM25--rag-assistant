With a lot of work you could develop a Bayesian adaptive scheme that allows you to dynamically select test points for each subject based on previous responses. Short of that, the experimental design (DOE) literature extensively covers your question. The short answer is that if you are very sure about linearity, you can assign half the values at the lowest point and half at the highest, to get a minimum variance slope estimator. To hedge your linearity bet you can put a few observations in the middle. In DOE there are formal design optimality criteria you can use to select the test points.
