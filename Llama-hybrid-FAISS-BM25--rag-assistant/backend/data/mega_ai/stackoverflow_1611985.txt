It's possible to read file "blindly" using OpenFileDialog . Blindly means you can let the user point the dialog to the file so Silverlight can read its content but it can't tell where the file is located. Example: var fileDialog = new OpenFileDialog(); var dialog = fileDialog.ShowDialog(); if (dialog.HasValue && dialog.Value) { byte[] bytes; using (var fileReader = fileDialog.File.OpenRead()) { bytes = new byte[fileReader.Length]; fileReader.Read(bytes, 0, (int) fileReader.Length); } } The access to the file system is limited for security. Some access (blind as well) can be done using Isolated Storage where you can store data and access later.
