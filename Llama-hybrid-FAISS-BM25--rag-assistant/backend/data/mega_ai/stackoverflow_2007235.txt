What you have called a Factory isn't a Factory at all. It's a Repository. A Factory handles the instansiation of various classes sharing a common Interface or Class Hierarchy based on some set of parameters. A Repository handles the retrieval and management of data. The Repository would definitely have the UpdateCustomer(Customer customer) method in it as well as the GetCustomer(int id) method.
