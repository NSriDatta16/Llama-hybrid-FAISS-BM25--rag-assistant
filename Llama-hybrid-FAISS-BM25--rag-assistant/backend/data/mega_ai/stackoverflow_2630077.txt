Assumptions: 1) You have the source code available in a Solution in the VS2008 IDE How I Debug C# Services: Install the Service using InstallUtil . (You seem like you've already done that) (If Needed) Change the Service path to the MyService.exe that is produced in your Solution's bin folder Put something like the following at the beginning of your Service's OnStart() method: while(true) { System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(500); } Put a breakpoint on System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(500) Build the Solution Start your Service using the Windows Service Utility While your Service is starting, in VS2008 goto Debug -> Attach To Processes... Make sure Show Processes From All Users and Show Processes In All Sessions are checked Find your MyService.exe in the list, and click Attach You should now be at the breakpoint you inserted in the infinite loop Drag the Control (Yellow Arrow) just outside the infinite loop Debug away! Disclaimer: Remember to remove the infinite loop when you want to release a build, or when you simply want to run the service normally.
