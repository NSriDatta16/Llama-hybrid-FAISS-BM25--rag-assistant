If you want to know how one goes from source code to something that actually runs on a target machine, you should get a copy of the famous Red Dragon Book . I've used it for building parsers and lexical analyzers. While it dates back to 1986, and I'm sure there's been progress in the interim, as far as I can tell, it hasn't been surpassed as a text. It appears that Addison-Wesley has done a reprint of its predecessor, the Green Dragon Book, and is passing it off as something recent, so be careful to get the genuine article.
