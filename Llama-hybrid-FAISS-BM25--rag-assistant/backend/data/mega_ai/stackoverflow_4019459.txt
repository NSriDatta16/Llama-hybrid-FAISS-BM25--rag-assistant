Capturing and assembling TCP streams with libnids

I've been writing a simple sniffer tool. I started out with libpcap, but then realized it would be useful to keep track of TCP stream information, so I began reading about and experimenting with libnids. It's a great tool, however it does not create a new record in its internal hash table of streams if it does not witness the TCP handshake (SYN,SYN/ACK,ACK) of a certain stream. As a result I wouldn't be able to see a lot of data unless I started the sniffer before the handshake occurs. The documentation is a bit lacking. Does anyone know if it's possible to get around this limitation?
