iPhone CodeSign failed

So - I am a registered iPhone developer (Having paid my $99/year). I have followed all the steps provided by Apple to get the provisioning and code-signing files. However, when I click 'build', it says: "Application failed codesign verification. The signature was invalid, or it was not signed with an Apple submission certificate. (-19011)" I have re-downloaded all of the certificates and profiles repeatedly, and it still won't work. However, if I click 'build' (and it says codesign failed), but then drag the product .app file to my device in the organizer or click "Run", it will run on my device. Any suggestions?
