What are the best tools for manually annotating textual topic segmentation?

I checked this old question on tools for text corpus annotation and there are many good tools there, however the tools there seem not to cover my problem. I have a linear text segmentation problem, in which a text needs to be segmented in different sections (topics). I'm building a model for it, but I have no training data. Therefore, the team decided to manually label some text, by annotating blocks in the text that represent each section. I tried some NER or POS labelling tools, but they are not very convenient for selecting several lines and paragraphs to annotate a label. Is there a good tool for human annotation of text segmentation?
