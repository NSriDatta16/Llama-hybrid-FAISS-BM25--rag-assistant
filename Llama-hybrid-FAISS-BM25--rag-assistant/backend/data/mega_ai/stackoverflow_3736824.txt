For non-technical stuff, read the Frameworks Design Guidelines. They have lots of good advice. Briefly: Start with a company name. choose stable (version-independent) names. FrobCorp.FrobozzleV2.Utilities is bad. choose names that reflect the code purpose rather than the politics of the organization that produced it. FrobCorp.AdvancedResearchDivision.CambridgeOffice is bad; the AdvancedResearchDivision might be renamed tomorrow and the Cambridge office might be relocated. use PascalCase unless that violates your branding. FrobCorp.jFrobozzle looks terrible, but FrobCorp.Jfrobozzle looks even worse. use plurals when appropriate and so on. There is a lot more good advice in the guidelines that I have not reproduced here. Go read them. However, it sounds like you've got the non-technical stuff down. One of the bits of advice in the guidelines is "do not name a type the same as its namespace". That is good advice not just because doing so is confusing to readers; there is a good technical reason as well. For the technical reasons why naming a type the same as its namespace is a terrible idea, see my articles on the subject: https://web.archive.org/web/20120111133911/http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ericlippert/archive/2010/03/09/do-not-name-a-class-the-same-as-its-namespace-part-one.aspx (At least as of January 2020, this is only available on archive.org.)
