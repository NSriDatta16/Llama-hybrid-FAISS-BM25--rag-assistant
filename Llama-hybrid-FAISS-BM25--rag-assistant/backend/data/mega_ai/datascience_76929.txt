For the love of the flying spaghetti monster, use anaconda to install the needed packages for data science. I have seen both Python and R being used in the data science setting and both needed additional packages to execute any data science capabilities. Conda made it way easier to install them. From my point of view, Python has a better support for all kind of packages. There are simply more ports to Python than to R, but this may change in the future. https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/ conda install scikit-learn
