I would say that it strongly depends on the nature of your labels. Why they overlap? I'm use to work with fish and we are use to get several false-negative data. It's simple, there are not enocuh fish to occupy every suitable place. In that case we usually favour presence data. However, the input variables/features could be not good for an adequate discrimination and that's why they appear overlapped ... (We would need additional info.). You can favour one or more labels penalizing others however that's always at the expense of accuracy. In that case SVMs with case weights may work. Likewise others will if they allow the inclusion of case weights. Good luck!
