How to use HOG for object detection without using SVM?

I am following the tutorial to calculate the HOG feature matrix. However, it does not tell how to find the object using the HOG matrix. For example, I have an image of several pipes stacked together. I have a template image of one pipe. I want to find out the total number of pipes in the original image. I don't have training images to train the SVM. I have just one template image. Using the HOG of the template image I want to find the total number of pipes in the original image. Can it be done? I want to know if it be done without using SVM and true positive images without having to train the SVM model.
