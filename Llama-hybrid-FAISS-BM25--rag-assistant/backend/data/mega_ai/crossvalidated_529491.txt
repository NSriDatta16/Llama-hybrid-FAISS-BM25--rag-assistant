Two sample t test with equal variances hypothesis

Given a trial to test a new drug. There are 20 volunteers with some disease. The volunteers are split into two groups (10 volunteers in each) randomly: the treatment group and the control group. Volunteers in the treatment group receive the new drug, volunteers in the control group receive placebo (pills that looks like a drug but do not have active substance). You conclude that new drug is effective if people who take the drug will recover faster (on average) than people in the control group. If your drug is effective, you will invest in its production, otherwise you will look for another drug. Assume that you obtained the following data (disease duration in days) câ€‹ontrol group treatment group 6 7 7 6 7 6 5 5 7 5 8 6 8 7 7 5 7 5 7 8 Would you invest into production of this drug? For the above problem formulation, I am using 2 sample unpaired t test with equal variance and the following hypothesis: $$H_0: \mu_{X} = \mu_{Y}$$ $$H_1: \mu_{X} > \mu_{Y}$$ where the population parameters $\mu_{X}$ and $\mu_{Y}$ representing average recovery duration for control and treatment group. Thus when the significance level is 0.05, the null hypothesis can be rejected in favor of alternate hypothesis after getting the t-statistic and p value according to the test. Could you please confirm if my approach to the above problem formulation is correct? Also I have taken equal variances as sample sizes are same and are independent and the sample standard deviation is approximately same and the alternative hypothesis as upper one tailed.
