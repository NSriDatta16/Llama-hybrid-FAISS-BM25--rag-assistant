What is the meaning of "The number of units in the LSTM cell"?

From Tensorflow code: Tensorflow. RnnCell. num_units: int, The number of units in the LSTM cell. I can't understand what this means. What are the units of LSTM cell? Input, Output and Forget gates? Does this mean "the number of units in the recurrent projection layer for Deep LSTM"? Then why is it called "number of units in the LSTM cell"? What is an LSTM cell and how is it different from an LSTM block, what is the minimal LSTM unit if not a cell?
