If you are developing an Extension then you can use the tabs API to determine if a window/tab incognito. More information can be found here . If you are just working with a webpage, it is not easy, and it is designed to be that way. However, I have noticed that all attempts to open a database (window.database) fail when in incongnito, this is because when in incognito no trace of data is allowed to be left on the users machine. I haven't tested it but I suspect all calls to localStorage fail too.
