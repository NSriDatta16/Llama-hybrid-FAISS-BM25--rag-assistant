You should create a basecontroller that all your controllers inherit from. then you simply have the logic in one place. i.e.: public abstract class BaseController : ControllerBase you could then use the initialize method in the new BaseContoller to do the common logic. i.e. [edit] - changed to OnActionExecuting, rather than Initialize. This isn't the most elegant of places to do it as we're on the cusp of the view being called. however, it's a starting point. protected override void OnActionExecuting(ActionExecutingContext filterContext) { // you should be able to get session stuff here!! base.OnActionExecuting(filterContext); } and in each controller: public class AnotherNormalController : BaseController
