The public part of the signing certificate is in the SAML message. This is used to check the signature for the token itself, and of course to allow receivers to tell who issued the token and treat it accordingly. The fact that it's in there is part of the XML digital signature specs, it's not really anything SAML specific. Without the certificate how could you tell where the token came from, and how could you validate it? XmlDSig does specify other methods, you can identify the signing key by a subject, serial number, hash etc., but this assumes that the receiving party has the public certificate. For SAML this may not be the case, hence the embedding of the public part of the X509 cert.
