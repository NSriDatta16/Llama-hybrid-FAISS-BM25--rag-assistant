jQuery does not load response

I normally use ASP.NET MVC 2, but there were some problems with it, so I began to work with ASP.NET MVC 2 + jQuery and everything works. But there is one problem, jQuery doesn't load my reponse. On the ASP.NET MVC side I'm redering a partial view and I also get the respone on the client, but nothing is rendered. How can I solve this? Here is the jquery code: function addCredential(state, id) { var daten = getJson(state, id); $.ajax( { type: "POST", url: "/Account/SetCredential/", data: daten, dataType: "json", success: function(partialView) { $('#Credentials').replaceWith(partialView); location.reload(); } }); return true; }; function getJson(state,id) { var username = $('#username').val(); return {"username": username, "credential_id": id , "state": state }; };
