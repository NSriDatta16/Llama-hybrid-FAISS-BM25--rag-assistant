How to make a GUI that works on all window mobile phones?

Up to now I been using the pda emulator in visual studios 2008 (I am using windows mobile 6.1 professional sdk). So I just dragged and dropped most of my GUI components into the form. In one instance I made a panel then in this panel I dynamically generated labels in it with certain location positions. I then put it on my Hp PAQ 110 Classic pda and it looked fine and everything. Then I was looking through the emulators one of them was called professional square. So I decided to run it and when it ran my program it looked like crap. I had missing labels, missing controls and it just looked horrible. I thought maybe it would like do some resizing for me but it seems to either did a shitty job or it does not do it at all. So how do you make a GUI that will work well on all mobile phones(or at least the vast majority of them). Is there like X number of types of mobile phones? Like the emulator emulates a pda and it works on my HP one so I am assuming that all window mobile device pdas have the same screen size. Then the next question is how do you make the controls position properly from one device to another? I heard of people using XML files that have all the location position, sizes and etc that they call up and I guess essentially generate the GUI dynamically based on the information in XML. But I could not find any examples how the XML file would look like, how to detect what phone type it is so that I could call up the right node of the file for that phone. I am not sure if there are any other ways but this seems better then a set of GUI forms for each one. Also would it be recommended to have most things in a panel so that way even if the stuff is bigger you can at least turn auto scrolling on. thanks
