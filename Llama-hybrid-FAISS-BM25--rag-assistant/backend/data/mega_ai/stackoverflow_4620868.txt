In a relational database the Photo/Photo_Album/Album is the normal way to store the data. The principle being that you store a photo (or single entity) only once but use other other mechanisms to provide the end user functionality you require. You don't actually need to create a "copy" in the database of the photo to have different meta-data apply to it. You could have the meta-data (different tags, descriptions ect) in a table related to the Photo_Album table that contains this meta-data instead of keeping it in the Photo table. This way you would have different meta-data for each combination of a Photo and an Album. By using this three (well technically four) table related approach you can have meta-data about just a Photo or just an album or a combination of the two. It all comes down to your end state & potential future requirements, of course but the point of this design pattern is to treat your database as a separate, economical & optimised data storage system. You then use SQL/TSQL and many other "intermediate" mechanisms to provide the interface to your GUI.
