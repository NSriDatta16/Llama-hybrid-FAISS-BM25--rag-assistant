First-order Discrete Markov Chain with time lag

I want to estimate the first-order transition matrix of a sequence in discrete time, e.g. $$ s = 1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0, \dots$$ but states are not evenly spaced in time. So that even if $s_{t=1} = 1$ and $s_{t = 2} = 0$, and $s_{t=3} = 1$ and $s_{t = 4} = 0$, the time lag between $t_{1}$ and $t_{2}$ is one day, whereas the time lag between $t_{3}$ and $t_{4}$ is one week. How can I estimate the correct transition matrix accounting for the time lag between states? References are well accepted.
