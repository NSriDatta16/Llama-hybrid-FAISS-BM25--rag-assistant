Take a look at blueprint-css . Blueprint is a CSS framework which supplies a variety of default styles to you (such as browser reset code). The style sheets in blueprint-css are organized as follows: screen.css - default styles for screens print.css - default styles for printing ie.css - Internet Explorer specific fixes application.css - contains the styles you write. Actually you shouldn't modify the previous three style sheets at all, because these are generated by blueprint-css. You can overwrite all blueprint-css styles in your application.css file. For further details refer to the blueprint-css Git repository.
