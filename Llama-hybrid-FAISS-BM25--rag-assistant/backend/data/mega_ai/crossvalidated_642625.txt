I do not know how typical it is to focus on $R^2$ values in cointegrating regressions and error correction model in general; this must depend on the application. I doubt the first-stage $R^2$ would be of much interest in most applications. For cointegrated series, it will usually be close to 1, so there is not much nuance to look for there. The second-stage $R^2$ is more interesting. If you care about the model's goodness of fit for first-differenced data, it is a sensible (even if biased) metric. Regarding unbiasedness, $R^2$ is upward biased. This is true not only for time series (cointegrated or otherwise) but also for a simple cross section. $R^2_{adjusted}$ is sometimes used and is unbiased under $H_0$ that the slope coefficients are jointly zero, so the true model only contains a constant. However, this is not a very interesting hypothesis, so I am not sure if you should prefer $R^2_{adjusted}$ to the vanilla $R^2$ . Also, the bias disappears asymptotically, so unless your sample is fairly short, your $R^2$ should be fine.
