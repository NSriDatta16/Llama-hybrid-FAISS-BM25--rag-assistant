This can be calculated recursively. A list of length 0 requires on average 0 shuffles. f(0) = 0. A list of length 1 requires on average 0 shuffles. f(1) = 0. A list of length 2 after shuffling has a few possibilities: It is already sorted (50% chance): 0 shuffles. It is not already sorted (50% chance): Shuffling sorts it: 1 shuffle. Shuffling does not help, we need to try again: 1 + f(2) shuffles. This cna be written as: f(2) = ((1/2) * 0) + ((1/2) * (1/2) * 1) + ((1/2) * (1/2) * (1 + f(2)). f(2) = 2/3 You can continue in this way to larger inputs by reducing them to the smaller inputs that you have already solved.
