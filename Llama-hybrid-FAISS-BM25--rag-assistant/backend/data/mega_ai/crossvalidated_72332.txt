Standardization in SPSS

I have a survey based on a Likert-scale (1-5) with around 20 variables and 140 cases. Since some people only cross from 1 to 3 for all questions (variables) and others cross 1-5, I want to standardize the values. So I want to calculate the average of all variables of one person to use the result for the standardization (to have a standard deviation of one and a mean of zero). Does anybody know how this standardization is called and how I can do it in SPSS? Thanks a lot!
