data binding not displaying data using InfoPath form

I have simple workflow where employee can request for product. This product submission was designed in Infopath. Manager then gets to Approve or Reject this Decision. I added tasks to Manager using "Collect Data from User" action in SPD, where I added Reject or Approve Checkboxes. But, I also want to design a form where he can also see who is the requester of Product, Product information which are stored in the List (lets say ListA) that this Workflow runs on. For this, I click on the ManagerApproval.xsn in Forms box in SPD. Then I added new data connections to ListA, and selected option to get required information. Then, I added requesterName, productName etc in the form using queryFields. There are queryFields and dataFields, what is the difference between them ? I then publish the form, but it doesn't display any value only empty text boxes, when Manager is approving the Request. Don't know whats wrong ? Thanks EDIT : Using datafields, I can see the data. But, I see id of the product not the value (eg I see 1,2 not ProdA, ProdB). And, also I see the whole list of products in ListA, I only intend to see values for the current item. There is something like repeating section in Infopath form, when I drag fields into Form. How can I filter it to show values (infact only 1 value - 1 product name, 1 requstername not the whole list from previous requests and already completed) for the current item ? OR Alternatively, is there any way to design Custom Form for Manager Approval using Infopath, so that this form can be called inside Workflow ?
