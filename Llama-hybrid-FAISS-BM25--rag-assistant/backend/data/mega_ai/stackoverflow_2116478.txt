In previous versions of Xcode, there were two split views in the build results window: one for the editor and one for the textual build results. If you’re not using Xcode 3.2, try to drag a split view down from the top of the window. In the current version, there’s only one split view left, which reveals the editor below the graphical build results. The textual results are in expandable bubbles, so I guess that’s not what you’re talking about?
