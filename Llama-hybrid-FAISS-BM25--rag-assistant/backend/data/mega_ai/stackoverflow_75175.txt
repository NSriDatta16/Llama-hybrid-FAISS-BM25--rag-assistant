Create instance of generic type in Java?

Is it possible to create an instance of a generic type in Java? I'm thinking based on what I've seen that the answer is no ( due to type erasure ), but I'd be interested if anyone can see something I'm missing: class SomeContainer { E createContents() { return what??? } } EDIT: It turns out that Super Type Tokens could be used to resolve my issue, but it requires a lot of reflection-based code, as some of the answers below have indicated. I'll leave this open for a little while to see if anyone comes up with anything dramatically different than Ian Robertson's Artima Article .
