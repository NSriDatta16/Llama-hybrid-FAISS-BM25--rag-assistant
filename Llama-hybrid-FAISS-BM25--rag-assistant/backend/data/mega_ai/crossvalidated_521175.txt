Another option, suggested by Robert LaBudde and outlined by Ben Bolker here , is to treat problematic random effects as fixed effects. In the case of Locality it makes sense because differences among localities might reflect ecological patterns or might result from ecological processes. Adding Locality as a fixed factor can be done in two ways: by allowing it to have an interactive effect with food.quantity ( interactive model) or not ( additive model). # Interactive model: unicorns_glmmTMB_fixedloc $sdr$ pdHess ## there is convergence # Additive model: unicorns_glmmTMB_fixedloc_additive $sdr$ pdHess ## there is convergence The two models can then be compared ( with caution ): AICc(unicorns_TMB_fixloc, unicorns_TMB_fixloc_additive) # df AICc # unicorns_TMB_fixloc 17 5792.111 # unicorns_TMB_fixloc_additive 11 5794.318 anova(unicorns_TMB_fixloc, unicorns_TMB_fixloc_additive) # Df AIC BIC logLik deviance Chisq Chi Df Pr(>Chisq) # unicorns_TMB_fixloc_additive 11 5793.8 5840.6 -2885.9 5771.8 # unicorns_TMB_fixloc 17 5790.9 5863.2 -2878.4 5756.9 14.905 6 0.02101 * I think that the outcome of model selection between unicorns_glmmTMB_fixedloc and unicorns_glmmTMB_fixedloc_additive can be considered a proxy of what the model selection outcome would have been between unicorns_glmmTMB and unicorns_glmmTMB_noslope , had unicorns_glmmTMB converged. In this case we are still on the fence (cfr. the significance of the ${\chi}^2$ test versus the small $\Delta$ AIC and $\Delta$ AICc), but in a way that's reassuring: it suggests that by settling for unicorns_glmmTMB_noslope over unicorns_glmmTMB we are missing out on a small amount of information.
