I came up with the following rack-test hack, and slightly cleaner selenium api use, to test Devise remember-me functionality in cucumber/capybara. It just tells the driver to manually erase the session cookie. Not all drivers are supported, I only implemented the two I've used: http://gist.github.com/484787 This assumes cookie storage of the session. Remove @announce tag from the scenario to get rid of the verbosity. Another option, suggested by Matt Wynne in the mailing list discussion , may be looking at other cookie stores, and deleting them by query or file deletion: lifted from agile rails book: config.action_controller.session_store = CGI::Session::PStore (or just :p_store) config.action_controller.session_options[:tmpdir] = "/Users/dave/tmp" config.action_controller.session_options[:prefix] = "myapp_session_" or rake db:sessions:create config.action_controller.session_store = :active_record_store Rails also has a reset session method, but I believe we don't have access to this because we can't hook into the rails session when testing with capybara. Hope this helps, Nick
