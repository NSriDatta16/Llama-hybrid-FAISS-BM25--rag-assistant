Copying live sites to local

Recently I've been getting more and more into web development and as such have a few questions. I have a few websites that are on a production LAMP server and I've been trying to copy them to my local computer running xampp 1.7.1 on XP Pro. The problem I've been having is mostly path issues. I mainly develop for wordpress, joomla, magento, mediawiki. When I copy the site locally I end up having to change config files and/ or database fields to reflect the local path. The problem I always have is anytime I upload files that contain local paths back up to the server I have to change the paths back to the production paths or I get 'object not found' errors. Remembering the correct paths for each install and what files need to have path updates is a real pain. Is there something I'm missing? Is there an easier way to make sure the paths are correct whether I'm on production or development without having to manually change them every time I upload or download the file or database?
