Encoding Angle Data for Neural Network

I am training a neural network (details not important) where the target data is a vector of angles (between 0 and 2*pi). I am looking for advice on how to encode this data. Here is what I am currently trying (with limited success): 1) 1-of-C encoding: I bin the set up possible angles into 1000 or so discrete angles and then indicate a particular angle by putting a 1 at the relevant index. The problem with this, is that the network simply learns to output all 0's (since this is almost exactly correct). 2) Simple scaling: I scaled the networks output range ([0,1]) to [0,2*pi]. The problem here is that angles naturally have a circular topology (i.e. 0.0001 and 2*pi are actually right next to each other). With this type of encoding, that information is lost. Any suggestions would be appreciated!
