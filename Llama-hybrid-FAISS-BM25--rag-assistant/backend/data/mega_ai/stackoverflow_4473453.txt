Rahul- All of these are good answers. The one thing I would mention is that the fundamental difference between selection and extraction has to do with how you are treating the data. Feature Extraction methods are transformative -- that is you are applying a transformation to your data to project it into a new feature space with lower dimension. PCA, and SVD are examples of this. Feature Selection methods choose features from the original set based on some criteria, Information Gain, Correlation and Mutual Information are just criteria that are used to filter out unimportant or redundant features. Embedded or wrapper methods, as they are called, can use specialized classifiers to achieve feature selection and classify the dataset at the same time. A really nice overview of the problem space is given here . Good Luck!
