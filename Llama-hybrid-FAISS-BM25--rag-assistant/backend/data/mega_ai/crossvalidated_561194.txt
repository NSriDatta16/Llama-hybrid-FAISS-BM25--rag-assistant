Comparing logistic regression coefficients between different datasets

I have multiple datasets coming from different distributions but having the same dependent and independent variables. I am running a logistic regression on each of the datasets and I would like to somehow compare the regression coefficients between the models, eg. test if they are the same across all models, since I am using backward elemination the variable kept in the models differ in some cases. Is there a way to do this? I though about using a F-test, but I am not sure if this applicable since the underlying data differs between the models. Thank you in advance!
