The fragmentation of the virtual memory could be a reason. One more possible reason is how memory managers (memory pools) are usually work. Memory manager attempts to reserve a block of memory 2 times more than the previous one. When memory is allocated already quite a lot, this amount will be very large and a memory allocation will fail despite the fact that in reality there is still available memory.
