You just made it less obvious that your form paints very slowly by using the techniques shown in my answer. The tricks don't speed it up, they merely make the ugliness less visible. But they fall flat when you have to paint your form from scratch, which happens when you move another window across it. The painting cannot keep up with the barrage of paint requests that are generated each time the overlapping form moves by one or more pixels. An instant fix is to upgrade your operating system to Vista or Windows 7, windows don't overlap anymore with Aero enabled.
