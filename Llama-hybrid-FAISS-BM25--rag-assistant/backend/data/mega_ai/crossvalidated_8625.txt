Deriving total (within class + between class) scatter matrix

I was fiddling with PCA and LDA methods and I am stuck at a point, I have a feeling that it is so simple that I can't see it. Within-class ($S_W$) and between-class ($S_B$) scatter matrices are defined as: $$ S_W = \sum_{i=1}^C\sum_{t=1}^N(x_t^i - \mu_i)(x_t^i - \mu_i)^T $$ $$ S_B = \sum_{i=1}^CN(\mu_i-\mu)(\mu_i-\mu)^T $$ Total scatter matrix $S_T$ is given as: $$ S_T = \sum_{i=1}^C\sum_{t=1}^N(x_t^i - \mu)(x_t^i - \mu)^T = S_W + S_B $$ where C is number of classes and N is number of samples $x$ are samples, $\mu_i$ is ith class mean, $\mu$ is overall mean. While trying to derive $S_T$ I came up to a point where I had: $$ (x-\mu_i)(\mu_i-\mu)^T + (\mu_i-\mu)(x-\mu_i)^T $$ as a term. This needs to be zero, but why? Indeed: \begin{align} S_T &= \sum_{i=1}^C\sum_{t=1}^N(x_t^i - \mu)(x_t^i - \mu)^T \\ &= \sum_{i=1}^C\sum_{t=1}^N(x_t^i - \mu_i + \mu_i - \mu)(x_t^i - \mu_i + \mu_i - \mu)^T \\ &= S_W + S_B + \sum_{i=1}^C\sum_{t=1}^N\big[(x_t^i - \mu_i)(\mu_i - \mu)^T + (\mu_i - \mu)(x_t^i - \mu_i)^T\big] \end{align}
