I'm not sure how this could be related to this at all. But just one quick hint: if you want to set error reporting to E_ALL but not E_STRICT use: E_ALL & ~E_STRICT instead of: E_ALL | ~E_STRICT It might not make any difference, but that's the proper way to work with bitmasks(for more informations see this ). Also have you checked the contents of the Magento log file? Path: install_dir/var/log/system.log
