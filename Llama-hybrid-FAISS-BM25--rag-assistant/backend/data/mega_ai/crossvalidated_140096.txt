Neural networks: Active input range of activation functions?

I'm playing with the Neural Network toolbox in MATLAB. I've noted that each activation function (aka, transfer function ) has 2 properties: the output range , which, if I understand, is the codomain of the function, and the active input range , which I really don't understand For instance: tansig (hyperbolic tangent sigmoid) has an output range of [-1,1] and an active input range of [-2,2] . logsig (log-sigmoid) has an output range of [0,1] and an active input range of [-4,4] . purelin (linear) has both an output range and an active input range of [-inf,+inf] . ... I'm really confused... So, can you tell me: What is it the active input range of an activation function How can I compute the active input range for a custom activation function? Thank you so much for your time.
