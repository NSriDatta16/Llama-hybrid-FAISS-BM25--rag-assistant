It depends. It's entirely possible that a single year, or even a month's detailed data might be better handled in a database where the schema is optimized for reporting, or even just the indexing scheme is different. It also depends on the type of reporting, if you are comparing current month trends with past months, it's a lot easier to have them in the same database. And if you have daily moving averages, it's a lot easier to do that in a single database than to have to perform that operation over a database boundary. As far as overly normalized - that can mean a lot of things.
