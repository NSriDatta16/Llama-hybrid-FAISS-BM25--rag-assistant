Weka LibSVM one class classifier always predicts one class

I'm trying to use LibSVM classifier in Weka to build a one class SVM classifier. My training file has list of noun words . My test file has many words. My aim is to use the classifier to predict the words which are nouns in test file. My input arff file ( ip.arff )(training file) looks like this: @relation test1 @attribute name string @attribute class {yes} @data 'building',yes 'car',yes ..... and so on My test file( test.arff ) (test file) looks like this: @relation test2 @attribute name string @attribute class {yes} @data 'car',? 'window',? 'running',? ..... and so on Here's what I've done: Since the datatype is string, I used batch Filtering on both input files to generate ipstd.arff and teststd.arff as mentioned in [ http://weka.wikispaces.com/Batch+filtering][1] Next i load and run the classifier with ipstd.arff . (Note: All the words are classified as yes) Next I load the test set teststd.arff and re-evaluate the model. But all the words are classified as nouns('yes') === Predictions on user test set === inst# actual predicted error prediction 1 1:? 1:yes 1 2 1:? 1:yes 1 3 1:? 1:yes 1 and so on My problem is that all words in test file( teststd.arff ) are classified as nouns Can someone tell where I'm going wrong.. What should I do classify noun words in test set with 'yes' and others as outliers. Thanks...
