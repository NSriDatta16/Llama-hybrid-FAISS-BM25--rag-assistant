I think, this is not the problem of sdk. Its a problem of the designer (Flex Burrito). I have exactly the same envoirment, and my version of burrito is 287807. My AdvancedDataGrit does NOT flicker! Do you have some styles applied or something else? After following your steps described in your question, i also have a flickering custom AdvancedDatagrid on my stage. When i click to another component (tab) and go back to the implemented adg, the flickering stops. When i close the Component with the flicker adg in it and open it again, the adg flicker again. With the preversion of the sdk the adg doesn't flicker. I notice also, that the graphic is different. In the preversion, i can see some folderIcons wirh teh expanded or closed arrows. After switching to 19786 the foldericons disapear and the flickering starts. There is something wrong and i would start a thread in adobe bug base. In my opinion, you did nothing wrong. There is no better way and it is equal if i drag the custom ADG or code it in codeview. The result is always a flicker adg in designview. Sorry for the misunderstands and my bad english BR Frank
