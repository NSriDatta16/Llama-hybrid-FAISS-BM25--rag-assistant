When touch is made by user touchesBegan method triggers. You can keep the pointer to the first touch appeared. It will not be changed until the touch ends. EDIT: - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { if ([touches count] == 1) { if (!myTouch) myTouch = [touches anyObject]; //I assume myTouch is set to nil in touchesEnded } else { //perform your logic for this case } } - (void)touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { if ( myTouch && [touches containsObject: myTouch] { //perform your logic myTouch = nil; } } I assume you have a variable UITouch *myTouch in your class that handles touch events.
