I know of one way, there might be others. The probabilistic formulation of PCA, pPCA, is actually a density model-it allows you to estimate $p(x)$. Thus, in a generative approach you can get a predictive distribution via Bayes rule: $p(c|x) \propto p(x|c) p(c)$. Thus, you can do one PCA for each handwritten digit. For a new digit, pick the class for which the reconstruction error of the corresponding PCA (which is proportional to the likelihood) is lowest.
