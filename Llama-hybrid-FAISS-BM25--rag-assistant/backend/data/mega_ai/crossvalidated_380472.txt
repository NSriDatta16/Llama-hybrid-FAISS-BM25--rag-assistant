You've written down the wrong expression for the posterior to do Bayesian regression. Consider the $\vec{x}$ to be fixed by design. Thus, you don't need a prior for the $x$ . Rather, you need to set a prior for A, B, and C. Define $r = y - \hat{y}$ in the usual way. The likelihood, based on the probability model for $\epsilon$ and given A, B, and C would be: $$L(y_i | A, B, C)= \prod_{i=1}^n \phi\left(\left(y_i - A \sin(x_i/B)\right)/C\right)$$ where $\phi$ is the standard normal density.
