mean of repeated measures...spot the (matlab) error

I have a population of 114 subjects. For each subject I have repeated measurements (1 each day) of the variable assessed (activity level). The number of measures varies for each subject (number of assessed days) and the median number of measures for each subject is 4. Data can be downloaded here Can I simply take the average of the measures to continue with my statistical analysis of the population, i.e. each subject will be represented by the average measure across the assessed days. Should I perform a statistical test before doing that? which one? Could you please suggest the workflow? My purpose is to find whether there are differences in the variable measured between group of subjects (lets say first 57 subjects are groupA and last 57 subjects are group B). My attempt (results are obtained using MATLAB, but should be interpretable): I fit a repeated model of the type 't1-t5 ~ Group' meaning that measurements t1-t5 are the responses and the groups is the predictor variable Time = [1 2 3 4 5]' %array contaning the day of assessment rm = fitrm (table,'t1-t5 ~ Group','WithinDesign',Time) %table is a matlab table contaning the data the coefficients of the models are t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 _______ _______ _______ ______ _______ (Intercept) 425.64 412.64 425.64 414.05 443.64 Group_A -52.182 -12.636 -23.182 -47.5 -45.455 I check Mauchly's test for sphericity tbl = mauchly (rm) % if small use the correction when compute p value in ranova tbl = W ChiStat DF pValue _______ _______ __ _______ 0.84303 3.1446 9 0.95828 p value is > than 0.05 so I do not have to correct the repeated ANOVA I run repeated ANOVA ranovatbl = ranova (rm) ranovatbl = SumSq DF MeanSq F pValue pValueGG pValueHF pValueLB __________ __ ______ _______ _______ ________ ________ ________ (Intercept):Time 13611 4 3402.6 0.98232 0.42203 0.41863 0.42203 0.33347 Group:Time 26256 4 6564.1 1.895 0.11938 0.12457 0.11938 0.18386 Error(Time) 2.7711e+05 80 3463.9 It tells me that there are no effect of days in the activity level, and there are no differences between groups.
