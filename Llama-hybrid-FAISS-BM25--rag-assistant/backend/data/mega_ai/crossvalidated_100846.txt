Interpretation model with logarithm and square root

How do I interpret this model: $$ Price = -7.095 - 9.471[\ln(Number Of Different Kinds Of Fruits)] + 53.942 \sqrt{Number Of Customer} + ... $$ Is that: If there are no kinds of fruits nor visitors nor other variables, the expected average price will be -7.095 If the natural logarithm of Number Of Different Kinds Of Fruits increases with one and all other things remain the same, the expected average price will decrease with 9.471 If there is one extra customer and all other variables remain the same, the average expected price will increase with 53.942
