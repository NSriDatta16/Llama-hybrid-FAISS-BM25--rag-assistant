The general rule is, get the code working first, then optimize if needed... In this case, use a normal numpy 2000x2000 array, or 2000x2000x3 for RGB. This will be much easier and faster to work with, is only a small memory requirement, and has many other advantages, for example, you can use the standard image processing tools, etc. Then, if needed, "to persist and exchange these objects", you can just compress them using gzip, pytables, jpeg, or whatever, but there's no need to limit your data manipulation based storage requirements. This way you get both faster processing and better compression .
