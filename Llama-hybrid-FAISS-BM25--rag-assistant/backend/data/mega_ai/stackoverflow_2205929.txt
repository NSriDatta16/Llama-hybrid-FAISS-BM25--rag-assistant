Classification of objects in general is very often done using trees. And very often, a graph would be much more suitable than a tree, however a tree offers two big advantages over a graph: It can be represented as a (nested) list. For example, it is much easier to show a big tree on paper (with titles, subtitles, paragraphs and nested lists) or on a computer screen than a graph. You can point to an item in the tree using a simple path string (or a stack), for example "http/StackOverflow.com/Users/Dimitri C", something which is much harder to do in a graph.
