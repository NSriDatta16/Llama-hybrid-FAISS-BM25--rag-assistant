The top-down methods implemented in the hts package were designed for hierarchical time series. If you want to define your own top-down method for some non-hierarchical time series, go right ahead. It's not wrong, it just hasn't been implemented in the hts package because there are much better solutions to the problem. The best approach currently available is to use weighted least squares as explained in http://robjhyndman.com/working-papers/hgts/ . This is the default in the hts package.
