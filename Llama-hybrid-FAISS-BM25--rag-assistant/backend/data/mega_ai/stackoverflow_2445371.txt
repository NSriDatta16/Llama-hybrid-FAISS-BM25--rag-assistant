It depends on what you call a "flowchart". If the flowchart is the simple kind, ie. a directed graph where no node points upward (to a node that could have possibly been visited previously), then what you've described is a tree whose embedding in the plane is trivial. If however your flowchart has loops (cycles) then it is simple to construct a counterexample, a graph that is not not embeddable in the plane. For a contrived example (as no restrictions were stated) consider the complete graph K5, in which every node is connected to every other. This graph is not planar. As for drawing graphs, I'd like to recommend the excellent tool GraphViz which draws (among other things) beautiful flowcharts with automatic layout. You can choose a rendering engine that tries to preserve some order in your graph and there exists an explicit option for hierarchical graphs.
