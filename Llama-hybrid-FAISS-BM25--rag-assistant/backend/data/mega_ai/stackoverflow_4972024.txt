if the form is small, you may not even need a db, you could just use SharedPreferences http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/data-storage.html#pref , unless you have multiple rows of the user answering again and again then this might not be the best solution here's some network check code if you need it ConnectivityManager manager =(ConnectivityManager)activityOrContext.getSystemService(Context.CONNECTIVITY_SERVICE); NetworkInfo info = manager.getActiveNetworkInfo(); if(info==null || !info.isConnected()){ return false;// network not active } not sure if you need this, you may already know how to do this or have it figured out
