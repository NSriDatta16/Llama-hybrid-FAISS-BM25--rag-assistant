tr1's unordered_set (also available in boost) is probably what you are looking for. You don't specify whether or not you want a sequence container or not, and you don't specify what you are using to give O(1) lookup (ie. vectors have O(1) lookup on index, unordered_set mentioned above has O(1) average case lookup based on the element itself).
