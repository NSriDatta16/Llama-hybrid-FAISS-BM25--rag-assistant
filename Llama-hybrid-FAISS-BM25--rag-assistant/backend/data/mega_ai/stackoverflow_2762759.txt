I've been using jQuery UI's drag & drop features and I'm pretty happy with them. Overall, they seem very well-rounded â€“ for example, if you drag toward the top of the viewport, the page automatically scrolls up, just like users expect. If you're already using jQuery (but not Scriptaculous), why add the weight of an additional JS framework? Bytes do count, and the more you can slim down your client-side script, the faster your app will run.
