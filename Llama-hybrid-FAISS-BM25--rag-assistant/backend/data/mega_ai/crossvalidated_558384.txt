Can time series forecasting be done without splitting the data into train/test sets?

The data is of monthly average rainfall for a specific region for the past 13 years (156 data points). What is the best way of splitting it into train/test sets? I thought of selecting first 12 years as training set and 13th year as the test set. but was wondering whether there can be a better approach?
