How to plot multiple loess curves in a xyplot panel data?

Imagine the following simplified longitudinal data with 4 individuals and 3 variables (y1, y2, y3) measured at 50 occasions : dat It is easy to plot at the same time the raw time series with this code : xyplot(y1+y2+y3~time|subject,dat,type='l') which result is : I would like to plot exactly the same, but with loess curves instead of lines. And here is my problem! The following code : xyplot(y1+y2+y3~time|subject,dat, panel=function(x,y) {panel.loess(x,y,span=0.2) }) doesn't work because it considers y1+y2+y3 as a single variable, thus plotting only one loess curve by panel. How is it possible to plot each loess curve in each panel? PS. I don't want to use type="smooth" because I need to specify the span of the loess.
