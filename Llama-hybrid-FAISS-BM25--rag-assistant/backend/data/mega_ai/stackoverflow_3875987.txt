Under java you can maintain a 2d array(spreadsheet). I wrote a program which basically defines a 2 d array with 3 coloumns of data, and 3 coloumns for looking up the data. the three coloumns are testID, SubtestID and Mode. This allows me to basically look up a value by testid and mode or any combination, or I can also reference by static placement. The table is loaded into memory at startup and referenced by the program. It is infinately expandable and new values can be added as needed. If you are interested, I can post a code source example tonight. Another idea may be to maintain a database in your program. Databases are designed to organize large amounts of data.
