I was advised that I can run a binary logistic regression to get the probability and then run a ROC curve using the probability as the test variable. The whole process goes like this, 1) Analyse 2) Regression 3) Binary logistic, put in the state variable as the dependent variable, subsequently enter the variables you wish to combine into the covariates, then click on "save" and check the box "probabilities". This process will compute a new variable in your SPSS database, termed "PRE_1". 4) Run the ROC curve using "PRE_1" as test variable. 5) Obtain the result.
