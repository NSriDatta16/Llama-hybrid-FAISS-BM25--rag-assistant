I think feature selection should precede model building (logistic regression in your case). The goal of the feature selection is to simplify data and reduce dimensionality in order to ease model building and parameter calculation (So don't have to include irrelevant variables in your model and you don't have to calculate their corresponding parameters when applying regression)
