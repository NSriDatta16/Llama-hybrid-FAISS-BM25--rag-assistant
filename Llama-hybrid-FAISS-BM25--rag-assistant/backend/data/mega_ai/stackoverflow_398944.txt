the lead pm suggested that the exact functionality desired exists in several proprietary projects (several of which are open source - bugtracker, bugzilla, etc.), but the tech pm and dev wouldn't listen. If this is true, tell the lead pm to be more assertive; then tell him/her to install bugzilla and be done with it. If the tech pm and dev weren't listening because of stubbornness, they need a little chat... Either way, I'd say you have a problem with your organization... How many thousands of dollars were lost because of a case "not developed here"? However, given that it reached the point of implementation, there are problems further upstream than the development level... As far as discussing the db schema with everybody, I'd say no. Everyone who can positively contribute should be involved after the application requirements have been gathered.
