How does a neural network get its output?

I want to create my own neural network but I'm not grasping the concept of how the neural network gets trained/gets to an output. Say you have the following example: link to example As you can see in the var trainingdata there is exact data on what you want the neural network (hamster) to output. If the machine finishes training that data, why is it that if you input: [0, 1] it returns: Sit Neuron: 0.014995911436294706% Run Neuron: 99.39201708556335% Jump Neuron: 1.2615268528823826% To my understanding it should return the following: Sit Neuron: 0% Run Neuron: 100% Jump Neuron: 0% Because the machine can literally compare the input [0, 1] with the trainingdata, which contains the exact output. Why is it that the machine still considers the jump and sit to be valid?
