Find class probabilities in matlab PNN and make ROC plot

I have a Probablistic Neural Network classification experiment set up in MATLAB. I can get the classes for unseen data using the sim command. Is there any way I can get the probabilities for the classes that the classifier calculates? Also, is there any direct way to plot the Reciever Operating Characterstic curve and calculate the Area Under the ROC for my classifier?
