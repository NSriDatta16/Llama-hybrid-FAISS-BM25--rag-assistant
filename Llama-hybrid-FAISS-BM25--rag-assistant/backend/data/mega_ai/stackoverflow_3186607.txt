iOS App Size - [ Configuration / Resources Local Data / Cloud ]

I have recently started working in iOS Development, I have noticed the app size kept on increasing as the project proceeds. There's a risk of crossing threshold of 150MB within couple of months, Apple then restricts downloading the app from Mobile Data. It will reduce the consumer base and discourage users to download it. Does anyone have suggestions / tips how to control it.
