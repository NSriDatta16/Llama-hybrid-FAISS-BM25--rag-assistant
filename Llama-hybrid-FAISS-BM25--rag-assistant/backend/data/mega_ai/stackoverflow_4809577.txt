Correlation of Two Variables in a Time Series in Python?

If I have two different data sets that are in a time series, is there a simple way to find the correlation between the two sets in python? For example with: # [ (dateTimeObject, y, z) ... ] x = [ (8:00am, 12, 8), (8:10am, 15, 10) .... ] How might I get the correlation of y and z in Python?
