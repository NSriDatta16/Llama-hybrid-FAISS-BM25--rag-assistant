LINQ query question, needs joins

Not entirely sure of a good title for this, feel free to edit it to a good one I have an images object, which contains a list of organs which it is related to. I want to query a list of images and find which ones have all of the organs in a list of organs. Here is the method signature public static IEnumerable WithOrgans(this IEnumerable qry, IEnumerable organs) Not really sure how to construct the linq for this, would appreciate some ideas, I haven't done linq in a while so am quite rusty! UPDATE Ok, so this is some sample data dictionary.Add(7, new Image { id = 7, organs = new List { organA, organB }}); dictionary.Add(8, new Image { id = 8, organs = new List { organA }}); dictionary.Add(9, new Image { id = 9, organs = new List { organC }});
