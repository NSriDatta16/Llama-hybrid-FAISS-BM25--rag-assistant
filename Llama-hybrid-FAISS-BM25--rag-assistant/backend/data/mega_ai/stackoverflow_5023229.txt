I'm not quite sure how you expect this to work so I don't know what you are looking for but this is the correct way and by design. There are a lot of modeling cases. Wish I saved the link I found with the perfect example where the removal of an object from a collection simply means a relationship is missing and not that a row needs to be deleted. The only elegance I would add is something like: c.Policies.AddRange(_policyRep.GetByIDs(selectedvals[i]));
