Can anyone help me with drag and drop functionality of files using javascript supported by all versions of IE?

I have text box. When I drag and drop a file into it, the path, or content of the file should be displayed. The major concern being it's compatibility with all versions of IE. I am a beginner in JavaScript programming. Can anyone suggest any idea or some tricks to get through?
