What prior distributions are used in mcmcsamp() from lme4?

The mcmcsamp() function generates simulations from the posterior distributions of a Bayesian mixed model fitted with the lmer() function. What are the prior distributions? Does there exist a book or an article providing a mathematical study of the Bayesian mixed model with these priors?
