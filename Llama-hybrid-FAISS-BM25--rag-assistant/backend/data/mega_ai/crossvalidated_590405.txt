What is the correct statistical test to compare data points from a time series

I have the following dataset, comprising of two variables - condition (either recession or normal) and unemployment (a number). I need to test if the unemployment rate is higher during a recession. What is the right statistical test for me to use please? I think it is ANOVA but wanted to check.
