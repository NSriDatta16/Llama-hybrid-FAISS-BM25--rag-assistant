You could have an additional $n$ binary inputs which indicates whether each object is present or not. Alternatively, you could have an architecture which can take in a variable number of inputs and produce a variable number of outputs. For example, given inputs $x_i$ , embed them to $z_i = f(x_i)$ , then let $z = \sum_i z_i$ , and have output $y_i = g(x_i, z)$ , where $f$ and $g$ are both neural networks. This scheme doesn't rely on there being any fixed number of objects.
