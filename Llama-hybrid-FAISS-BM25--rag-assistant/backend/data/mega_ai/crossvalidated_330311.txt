Though $I^2$ is commonly reported as an absolute measure of heterogeneity, as you describe, Borenstein et al. (2017) caution against this. It is a proportion (i.e., relative), and only in strict circumstances--when sampling variability is mostly constant--does it become an reasonable approximation of absolute heterogeneity. To your questions: $Q$ is $\chi^2$ distributed, and its expected value under $H_0$ is $df$. Thus, the difference between $Q$ and $df$ is taken as the amount of variability (i.e., true heterogeneity) on top of what is expected if the null is true (i.e., just sampling error). By dividing the difference by $Q$, you get a proportion of variability above the null value over total variability. Because $df$ is what we would expect if it was all sampling error. And if $Q$ = $df$, $I^2$ would = 0. And re: "isn't the observed variance in each study's effect size going to be due to true study-specific differences and random error?", not if you're working under a fixed-effects meta-analysis (i.e., where all observed effects come from the same population, and the only thing separating them is sampling error). Bonus: if by "small-sample power" you mean low $k$ (i.e., # of studies), then yes, you may run into some problems with the $Q$ test. Namely if you fail to reject $H_0$ for $Q$, then $\tau^2$ (i.e., variance of effect sizes) will be held to 0, and you will also have an $I^2$ of 0. Unfortunately, the other statistical means of evaluating heterogeneity described by Borenstein et al. (2017) are prediction/credibility intervals, but those still require an estimate of $\tau$. What to do in such a case? If you believe a priori that there is no heterogeneity in your sample of effects, then you should be fine fitting a fixed-effects meta-analysis model, and making conclusions about the average effect in your sample. If, alternatively, you believe a priori that there is heterogeneity in your sample, then you will have to wait until the corpus of effects is large enough to provide sufficient power to reject $H_0$ for $Q$, and estimate $\tau^2$, so that you can make claims about the broader population(s) of effects. But in the mean time, you can settle for interpreting the fixed-effects model, and running with the more limited conclusions it affords. References Borenstein, M., Higgins, J., Hedges, L.
