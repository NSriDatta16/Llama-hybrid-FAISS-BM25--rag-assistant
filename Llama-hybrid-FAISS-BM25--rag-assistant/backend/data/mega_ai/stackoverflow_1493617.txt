Looking for a Java User Agent String Parser

Does anyone know of a great library in java for parsing user agent strings? We have written a custom one, but this seems like a common problem for many people. I would guess there is a good library available somewhere. For example, the user agent string... "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US) AppleWebKit/532.0 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/3.0.195.21 Safari/532.0" ... cryptically announces the arrival of a Windows Vista PC using Chrome on our site. I've seen libraries in python and ruby. Anything in java out there?
