Better approach would definitely be supervised learning model. There are two alternatives for you to go: (1) What you could try is to use a transformer model that was trained on another sentiment case, like movie or restaurant reviews . First, you could try how this model works for your use-case and then use it to label your unlabeled data. (2) Or you could label some tweets yourself (like 100-200) and then finetune another sentiment transformer model on this data. Then you need to label a lot less data then if you start from scratch.
