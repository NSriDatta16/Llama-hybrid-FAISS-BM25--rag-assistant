How to do DragAcceptFiles in C#?

I'm looking for the least painful way (that is, with the least code) to implement DragAcceptFiles on the main window of a C# project. I've been searching on the net, and it looks like I'll have to DllImport DragAcceptFiles, and override WndProc to catch and handle WM_DROPFILES messages. Doesn't the .net-framework provide this somewhere? Isn't there a proper way to add message handlers to a form other than overriding WndProc and have it do an extra if on almost all other messages that come through?
