If you don't have lots of clients, then it's fine. You won't spend a lot of time for just a bunch of users. You may want to try using hashtable (or a dictionary, associative array). There are countless free/open implementations in ANSI-C, or you can just roll your own. You just need some unique and constant identifier per User, which is going to be your key. If you want to have a bidirectional relationship (bijective map) you can just have another hashtable where you store the users by file descriptor. Operations on a hashtable are O(1) average. The hashtable itself uses O(N) space, where N is a big number (but not too large). Don't worry about that either. Take a look at this one . You may also be interested in this question .
