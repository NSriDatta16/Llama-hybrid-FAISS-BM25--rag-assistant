If you you don't want to use the CacheManager then use a database or a local (non-SD) file (local files get deleted on a complete uninstall) and register to receive the 'ACTION_DEVICE_STORAGE_LOW' and 'ACTION_DEVICE_STORAGE_OK' broadcast actions. Then you'll know when your application is taking up too much space according to the device and when you need to start deleting pictures. Your application size will still grow, but you will be able to manage the growth and shrinkage.
