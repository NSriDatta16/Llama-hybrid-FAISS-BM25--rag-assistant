Dashboard with re-arrangeable dashboard elements in Silverlight?

I need to create a dashboard with re-arrangeable/re-positionable dashboard elements (similar to iGoogle) using Silverlight. The dashboard elements are typically tables of data. The user should be able to dynamically add and remove dashboard elements. The user should also be able to use drag and drop to reposition the dashboard elements. I've been looking around for Silverlight controls which I can reuse but haven't found any yet. Any ideas? Or do I have to roll my own?
