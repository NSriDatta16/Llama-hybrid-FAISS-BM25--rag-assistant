This one line of code has the expected ; before and unary minus errors for xcode iphone. It just one line! Ahhh!

Alright. So I asked a question here but I feared that I anwsered it myself and closed the dicussion. No Idea if I did that. That question is available here; Is it me or xcode... Somethings wrong with my braces and it just causes errors! Please help! iPhone SDK + Urban Push let me go ahead with my code that gives the expected ; and unary minus (which goes away if -(VOID) is removed but then that causes another error) its here if you need the full code its at the earlier link //Register for notifications; [[UIApplication sharedApplication] registerForRemoteNotificationTypes:(UIRemoteNotificationTypeBadge |UIRemoteNotificationTypeSound |UIRemoteNotificationTypeAlert)]; ; - (void)application:(UIApplication *)app didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:(NSData *)deviceToken { //ERROR HERE Wrong type argument to unary minus and semi colon b4 And I cant close the method after Register because then the lower references of DeviceToken have no organized structure
