Generally stored procedures are intended for complex processing in the database. There are debates raging about their benefits. I never saw that SELECTs in a stored procedure was a bad thing but I wouldn't expect that every single SQL statement that has to be written goes into a stored procedure either. It should be reserved for those processing that involve multiple statements and will have to be performed repeatedly. Jeff has a rant about them here . To answer your direct question for specific examples, I have found that I avoid them because of the portability issue. I attempt to do all my processing application side. At the same time I do not have to worry about network bandwidth in my application so each situation is different.
