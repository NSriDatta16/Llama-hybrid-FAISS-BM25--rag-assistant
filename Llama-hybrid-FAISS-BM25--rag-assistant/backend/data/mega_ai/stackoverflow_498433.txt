Resolving "only static const integral data members can be initialized within a class" compilation error

The following for creating a Global Object is resulting in compilation errors. #include "stdafx.h" #include using namespace System; using namespace std; #pragma hdrstop class Tester; void input(); class Tester { static int number = 5; public: Tester(){}; ~Tester(){}; void setNumber(int newNumber) { number = newNumber; } int getNumber() { return number; } } Tester testerObject; void main(void) { cout > newNumber; cout Here are the compile errors: 1>------ Build started: Project: test, Configuration: Debug Win32 ------ 1>Compiling... 1>test.cpp 1>.\test.cpp(15) : error C2864: 'Tester::number' : only static const integral data members can be initialized within a class 1>.\test.cpp(33) : error C2146: syntax error : missing ';' before identifier 'testerObject' 1>.\test.cpp(33) : error C4430: missing type specifier - int assumed. Note: C++ does not support default-int 1>.\test.cpp(49) : error C2039: 'getNumber' : is not a member of 'System::Int32' 1> c:\windows\microsoft.net\framework\v2.0.50727\mscorlib.dll : see declaration of 'System::Int32' 1>.\test.cpp(55) : error C2039: 'setNumber' : is not a member of 'System::Int32' 1> c:\windows\microsoft.net\framework\v2.0.50727\mscorlib.dll : see declaration of 'System::Int32' 1>.\test.cpp(57) : error C2039: 'getNumber' : is not a member of 'System::Int32' 1> c:\windows\microsoft.net\framework\v2.0.50727\mscorlib.dll : see declaration of 'System::Int32' 1>Build log was saved at "file://c:\Users\Owner\Documents\Visual Studio 2008\Projects\test\test\Debug\BuildLog.htm" 1>test - 6 error(s), 0 warning(s) ========== Build: 0 succeeded, 1 failed, 0 up-to-date, 0 skipped ========== How do I create a Global Class Object correctly like I've attempted here. And how do I fix that "only static const integral data members can be initialized within a class" And basically how do I fix the rest of the errors so I can get this to compile? I like declaring Global Class Objects at file scope (I like declaring all globals at file scope) because when I have to create separate source files and do "extern" and everything it becomes extremely complicated and never works for me. Although, I do want to figure out how to do that eventually... it seems every tutorial I look at won't compile though and unless it compiles I have no idea how to recreate it! If I can just get this to compile...then I can successfully learn how to do this. So if someone could rewrite the above to where it literally copies & pastes into Visual C++ Express 2008 and works I will finally be able to figure out how to recreate it. I'm extremely excited on seeing the fix for this! It is just I can't get Global Objects to work right! Any other information on declaring Global Class Objects...or anything for that matter is welcome!
