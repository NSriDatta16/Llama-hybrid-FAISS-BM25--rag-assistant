MCMC chain stuck in adaptive phase?

I'm using R,OpenBUGS and R2OpenBUGS package on Linux Mint and i'm fitting a bayesian multinomial logistic model. After dribbling a lot of usual errors on my way to get my model running, i came upon an error i can't get the grasp of how to solve it. So after "model is syntactically correct,data loaded, model compiled,initial values generated, model initialized" messages, i get "inference can not be made when sampler is in adaptive phase". Does anyone know what exactly this message mean and how could i solve it? Thanks
