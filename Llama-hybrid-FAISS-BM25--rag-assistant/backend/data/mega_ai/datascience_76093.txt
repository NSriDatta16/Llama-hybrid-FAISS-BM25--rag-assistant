Here are a few ideas to start with: A simple model would be to use multiple linear regression (MLR), or a Random Forest If you want to evaluate only based on if an ingredient is used, your input dataset could look like this: Butter Flour Eggs ... Test Smell Look Texture 1 0 1 1 5 2 4 If you want to predict on how much of each ingredient (some is better, too much is not good) your dataset could look like this: Butter Flour Eggs ... Test Smell Look Texture 1.5 3.0 2 1 5 2 4 You can get some other ideas from this website: https://machinelearningmastery.com/multi-output-regression-models-with-python/
