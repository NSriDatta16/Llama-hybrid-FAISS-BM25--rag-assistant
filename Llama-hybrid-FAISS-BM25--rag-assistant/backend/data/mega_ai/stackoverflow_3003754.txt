There are two simple ways to get the PID of some process you've just spawned. One would be to modify the program being spawned (the subprocess) to have it write its PID to a file. You'd then read it therefrom with something like: $CUSTBIN/testarg.sh TSTARGSPID=$(cat /var/run/custbin.testarg.pid) Another more elegant method would be: $CUSTBIN/testarg.sh & TSTARGSPID=$! wait # Do stuff with PID and output files
