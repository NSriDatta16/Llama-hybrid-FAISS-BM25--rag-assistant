Are you sure you're using the correct proxy as system properties? Also if you are using 1.5 or 1.6 you could pass a java.net.Proxy instance to the openConnection() method. This is more elegant imo: //Proxy instance, proxy ip = 10.0.0.1 with port 8080 Proxy proxy = new Proxy(Proxy.Type.HTTP, new InetSocketAddress("10.0.0.1", 8080)); conn = new URL(urlString).openConnection(proxy);
