When i pulled it up in IE8 (see comment on main question to see if this applies for you) it stopped because of an error: Webpage error details User Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 5.2; Trident/4.0; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.4506.2152; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; InfoPath.2) Timestamp: Thu, 30 Jul 2009 22:04:50 UTC Message: HTML Parsing Error: Unable to modify the parent container element before the child element is closed (KB927917) Line: 0 Char: 0 Code: 0 URI: http://www.martani.net/ Making sure that all errors are fixed, will definitely make it more friendly for all browsers, i know IE is the pickiest of them all so something that firefox, chrome, etc. wont stop for IE will. Javascript is somewhere probably trying to alter the page as its loading, meaning that you probably have some in-line javascript code that is being loaded before something else has loaded all the way to be modified. If you place all the javascript within the head tags it is my understanding that it will execute AFTER the page has been fully loaded meaning that this will probably solve your issue. The lack of detail within the error message is probably caused by javascript having an issue right as it starts to execute hence line 0 char 0 code 0. Hopefully that will be a little more helpful, good luck the IE god's hate us all! ;)
