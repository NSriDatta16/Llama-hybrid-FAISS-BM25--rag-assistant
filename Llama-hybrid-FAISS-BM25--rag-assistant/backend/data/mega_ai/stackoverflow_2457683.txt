Might try removing margins and padding on the H1 h1 { margin:0; padding:0 } I would encourage you to explore you dom (via firebug or any equivalent) and see which styles are being applied to the H1 . You may need a more specified selector to apply the aforementioned rules to a particular h1 element only.
