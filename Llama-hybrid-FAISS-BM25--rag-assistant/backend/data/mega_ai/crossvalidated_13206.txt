How to determine the "health" of a population, considering its size

I am interested in the unhealthy people across 10 different populations. Here is the raw data: Popn Unhealthy Size Percentage ---- ---------- ------- ------------ A 170 1000 17.0% B 2 2 100.0% C 12 25 52.0% D 7 20 35.0% E 4 13 30.8% F 13 54 24.1% G 11 23 47.8% H 14 42 33.3% I 1 3 33.3% J 9 32 28.1% ---------- ------- 244 1214 Average: 40.1% Standard Deviation: 23.4% My problem is I do not know how to best sort this data without being skewed by the outliers at A and B. If I sort the rows by the number of unhealthy people then A comes out on top because it has way more people in it, and always provides the largest number, but its percentage is a quite healthy looking 17%. If I sort by percentage of healthy people per population size then B comes out on top because it has 100%; however B is only made up of two people. It doesn't strike me that two people is statistically relevant enough to warrant more concern than, say, the 52% of unhealthy people in population C. Is there something I can calculate for each population which will help?
