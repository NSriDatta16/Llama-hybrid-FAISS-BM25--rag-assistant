Generate series with multiple seasonality

I have to simulate time series with multiple seasonality and I don't understand how I can do it. In particular I have to simulate: A series with two deterministic seasonality (each with a different period) + AR error A series with two stochastic seasonality (each with a different period) + AR error Can anyone help me?
