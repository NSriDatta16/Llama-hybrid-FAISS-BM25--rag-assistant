HTML: "Please wait" loading page with redirect, cross browser, standards compliant

I have the common problem of implementing a "Please wait, processing your request" page in HTML to show to the user while a long running task is processing. Specifically, I am creating an order and billing a credit card. Currently I am first loading PleaseWait.html showing a message and a spinner, which straight away redirects to Process.html, which does the processing. Once Process.html has finished, it redirects to Complete.html. I am trying to do this completely cross browser and following all the recommendations. This means the following techniques should be avoided: Javascript redirect, as the user could have disabled scripting META Refresh, as this is discouraged / deprecated, and I think some browsers also allow the user to disable it Sending an HTTP 301 response, as this causes the browser (at least, IE) to not render the Please Wait page at all using a hidden iframe to hold Process.html, as again I believe this will require javascript to detect when the processing has completed So my question is... how the hell do I accomplish this? Bonus points (well, kudos at least) if the solution enables my animated GIF to continue to animate during the entire processing stage. I mention this because it seems that in IE, when PleaseWait.html redirects Process.html, all animations are stopped, which means that my spinner currently only spins for half a second or so, then stops while the Process.html is loaded page does its thing.
