The most common method to forecast intermittent demands is crostons-method , but count-data methods are also used. In contrast, arima and exponential-smoothing work less well. A textbook on intermittent demand forecasting, especially in the context of inventory control, is Boylan & Syntetos (2021), Intermittent Demand Forecasting: Context, Methods and Applications . Note that intermittent time series typically follow asymmetric noise distributions. Therefore, the Mean Absolute Error or Deviation may be optimized by a biased forecast . If you are aiming for an unbiased mean point forecast, it's probably better to use the Mean Squared Error.
