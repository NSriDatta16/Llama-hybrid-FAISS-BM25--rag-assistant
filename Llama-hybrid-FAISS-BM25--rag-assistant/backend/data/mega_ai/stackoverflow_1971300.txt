SQL Server CE 3.5 Merge Replication

I am working on an application that will connect to SQL Server 2005 when users are in the office, or it will connect to SQL Server CE 3.5 when users are on a laptop and out of the office. I have been reading up on Merge Replication to keep the two in sync, but am having a hard time finding anthing from start to finish (all the documentation I have found seems to be fragmented). Basically, I'm looking for some documention that has the whole process to set this up step-by-step. Does anyone know of a good resource? Has anyone done this before that can offer any guidance? Also, since users will either be on a laptop or pc, would it be easier to use SQL Server Express instead of SQL Server CE for this type of thing when they are on their laptop? Pros, cons? Thanks.
