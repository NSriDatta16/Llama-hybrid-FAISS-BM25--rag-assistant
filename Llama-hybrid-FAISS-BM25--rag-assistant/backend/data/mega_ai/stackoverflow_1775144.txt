Not exactly an answer, but at least some starting points: You could try looking into the code of the current Compare Viewer using the Plug-in Spy (directly available with eclipse3.5) (source: eclipse.org ) ( ALT + SHIFT + F1 ) Most of the eclipse sources are also available here . The org.eclipse.compare.CompareUI is a start, for example. Once you have a basic understanding of how the Compare mechanism works as a plugin, you can write an fragment (also illustrated here ) to extend the current compare plugin.
