You are going to have issues with performing PCA with such amounts of missing data. The analysis is either going to exclude cases with missing values, or some type of imputation will need to be performed. Say you have 100 rows, with Var3 which has only 20 rows (i.e. only 20% of rows have values) you may have issues with accurate imputation, which of course will then create issues for the validity of the PCA results.
