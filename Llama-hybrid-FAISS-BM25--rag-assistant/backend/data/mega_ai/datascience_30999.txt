Text + scalar features in one model

I have a set of features including text field(3-10 sentences) and about 10 scalar fields. I need to predict another scalar field (between 0 and 1). I have this field in my training/validation data. It's my first experience with a text feature. What is the correct way of creating a model? Should I treat text field as embedding, flatten them to 1 dimension matrix of X size and combine with other features? Thanks.
