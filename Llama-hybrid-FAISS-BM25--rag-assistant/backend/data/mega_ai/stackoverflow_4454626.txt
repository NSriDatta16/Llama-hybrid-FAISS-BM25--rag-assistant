Build a subset of OpenCV only (in particular for Android)

Since the OpenCV libraries according to http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/Android do not run on my Android phone (HTC Wildfire) -- crash when loading the libs -- I want to reduce the modules being compiled and linked into the resulting .so-library. Does anyone know how to prevent 'make' from compiling some particular modules in OpenCV? I found the files CMakeLists.txt useful (located in every folder) that let me remove some folders from compilation but then I get stuck into dependency problems. Is it the right way to use CMakeLists.txt to exclude some folders? In my particular case I need the cvMatchTemplate and some color conversion methods of OpenCV only. Thanks for any hint!
