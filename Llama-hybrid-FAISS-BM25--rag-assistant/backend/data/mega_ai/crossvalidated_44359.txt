R: mlogit error on data - "system is exactly singular"

So I have data from a randomized blind trial of 1mg of nicotine gum on dual n-back working memory scores; I analyzed them as usual with a t-test and found a small increase in means but a large increase in standard deviations on a f-test! Strange. I also have data for each day on mood/productivity that day on a 1-5 scale. I wondered: is nicotine following an inverse U-curve, where it causes higher scores on the worser days (1-3) and lower scores on the better days (3-5)? I look around and it seems I want a multinomial logistic regression comparing the placebo & active days. I enter the data & load mlogit : nicotine as.vector -> solve -> solve.default The error also happens even with the simplest call I can think of: mlogit(score ~ active, Nicotine) Error in solve.default(H, g[!fixed]) : Lapack routine dgesv: system is exactly singular Calls: mlogit ... mlogit.optim -> as.vector -> solve -> solve.default Reading the documentation for mlogit didn't much help, and look at the other questions having the same error, they're different enough I can't tell whether they apply or not. Thank you for your assistance.
