Why is the sum of squared differences from the sample mean smaller than the sum of squared differences from the true mean?

So the description I read is: It is important to note that the formulas for calculating the variance and the standard deviation differ depending on whether you are working with a distribution of scores taken from a sample or from a population. The reason these two formulas are different is quite complex and requires more space than allowed in a short book like this. I provide an overly brief explanation here and then encourage you to find a more thorough explanation in a traditional statistics textbook. Briefly, when we do not know the population mean, we must use the sample mean as an estimate. But the sample mean will probably differ from the population mean. Whenever we use a number other than the actual mean to calculate the variance, we will end up with a larger variance, and therefore a larger standard deviation, than if we had used the actual mean. This will be true regardless of whether the number we use in our formula is smaller or larger than our actual mean. Because the sample mean usually differs from the population mean, the variance and standard deviation that we calculate using the sample mean will probably be smaller than it would have been had we used the population mean. Therefore, when we use the sample mean to generate an estimate of the population variance or standard deviation, we will actually underestimate the size of the true variance in the population because if we had used the population mean in place of the sample mean, we would have created a larger sum of squared deviations, and a larger variance and standard deviation. To adjust for this underestimation, we use n - 1 in the denominator of our sample formulas. Smaller denominators produce larger overall variance and standard deviation statistics, which will be more accurate estimates of the population parameters. I understood none of this as it seems contradictory. It says that when using a number other than the actual mean (to me, e.g. the sample mean) will be different then the population mean causing a larger variance. In the middle it says the variance and sample mean will be smaller if the population mean had been used... Can you please explain which it is exactly and why so?
