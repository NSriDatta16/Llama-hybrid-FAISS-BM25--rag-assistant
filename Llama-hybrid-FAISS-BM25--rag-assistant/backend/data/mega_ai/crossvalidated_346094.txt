One generic solution would consist in running a significant amount of simulations and calculate the resulting averages and standard deviations of your experiments. Example with R code and three rectified normal distributions. sim 0, x, 0))) # rectify sim$final Obviously, you will need to run this simulation a couple of times to get a reliable estimation of average/standard deviation.
