Spatial Index for Rectangles With Fast Insert

I'm looking for a data structure that provides indexing for Rectangles. I need the insert algorithm to be as fast as possible since the rectangles will be moving around the screen (think of dragging a rectangle with your mouse to a new position). I've looked into R-Trees, R+Trees, kD-Trees, Quad-Trees and B-Trees but from my understanding insert's are usually slow. I'd prefer to have inserts at sub-linear time complexity so maybe someone can prove me wrong about either of the listed data structures. I should be able to query the data structure for what rectangles are at point(x, y) or what rectangles intersect rectangle(x, y, width, height). EDIT: The reason I want insert so fast is because if you think of a rectangle being moved around the screen, they're going to have to be removed and then re-inserted. Thanks!
