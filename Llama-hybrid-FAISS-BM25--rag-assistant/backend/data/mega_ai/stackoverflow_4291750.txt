Chris, i'm sorry but their is not calendar control in the SDK at this time (as per http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff402549(VS.92).aspx section Unsupported Controls). You gonna have to build one yourself edit: regarding adding an event in the phone calendar from within you app, this is not possible (yet ?), as per http://fragiledevelopment.wordpress.com/2010/06/10/licking-windows-phone-7/ (part about launcher and choosers)
