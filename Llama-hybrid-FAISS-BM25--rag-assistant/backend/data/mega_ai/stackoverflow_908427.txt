Why use #' with lambda?

Why should I use #' together with lambda? It is usually written that way, so I guess it is good form. But these lines seem equal to me: > (mapcar #'(lambda (x) (+ x 1)) '(1 2 3)) (2 3 4) > (mapcar (lambda (x) (+ x 1)) '(1 2 3)) (2 3 4) Anyone care to enlighten a beginner about the difference?
