I also wish to highlight that you will not always find statistically significant results, even with nearly infinite data. Statistically significant results only represent what are likely to be true differences, regardless of size. If this difference does not exist, then the number of cases does not matter. Consider two samples of 10 million trees that are, on average, the exact same height. Having an overall sample of 20 million trees will never result in the difference being statistically significant. It is always important to assess the size of the effect when results are statistically significant. The results are important/meaningful within the context of what you are exploring. The importance will always depend. 1% difference may be very unimportant when considering shoe size, but be very meaningful when it represents odds of dying from a disease in a population of 10 billion.
