Sentence recognition

I would like my Java program to take science text book questions such as, How far can a cyclist travel in 4.0 h if his average speed is 11.5 km/h? as a string and then I would like the program to recognize every number and unit mentioned in the question, e.g. in the example above it will be 4.0 h and 11.5 km/h. Is it possible to use regex for this purpose? Many thanks
