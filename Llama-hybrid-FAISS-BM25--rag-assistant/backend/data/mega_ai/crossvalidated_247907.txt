What is the difference between manifold learning and non-linear dimensionality reduction?

What is the difference between manifold learning and non-linear dimensionality reduction ? I have seen these two terms being used interchangeably. For example: http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~kilian/research/manifold/manifold.html : Manifold Learning (often also referred to as non-linear dimensionality reduction) pursuits the goal to embed data that originally lies in a high dimensional space in a lower dimensional space, while preserving characteristic properties. http://www.stat.washington.edu/courses/stat539/spring14/Resources/tutorial_nonlin-dim-red.pdf : In this tutorial ‘manifold learning’ and ‘dimensionality reduction’ are used interchangeably. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3337666/ : Dimensionality reduction methods are a class of algorithms that use mathematically defined manifolds for statistical sampling of multidimensional classes to generate a discrimination rule of guaranteed statistical accuracy. However, http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/manifold.html is more nuanced: Manifold learning is an approach to non-linear dimensionality reduction. One first difference I can see is that a manifold can be linear, therefore one should compare non-linear manifold learning and non-linear dimensionality reduction.
