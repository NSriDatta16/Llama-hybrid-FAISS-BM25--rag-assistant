You can't use foreach in workflows built with Sharepoint Designer (as far as I know). To do what you require would involve developing a custom workflow in Visual Studio. I've had to go down this route myself recently and it wasn't as bad as I expected. There are some great walkthrough videos of this process at Robert Shelton's blog which helped me to get started. If your MOSS 2007 development environment is 64-bit (like mine is), then you may well run into problems trying to create and debug workflows with Visual Studio 2008. In which case I would recommend WSPBuilder to help you package up your workflows for easy deployment into Sharepoint. There is a good post here on using WSP Builder Hope this helps.
