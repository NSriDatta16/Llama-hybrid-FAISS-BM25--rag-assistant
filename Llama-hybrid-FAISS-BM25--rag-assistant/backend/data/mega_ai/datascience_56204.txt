Which method of NLP is this?

I have been searching for 2 weeks and I got no where so far. There is a list of diseases Diabetes Heart Transplant Fingertip amputation Injury by sharp tools . . . and My dataset is a list of medical text reports. the training dataset has diseases that can be generated from each record example that I made This patient has suffered a cut while using his Carving Chisel and led to losing the fingertip therefore we had to operate to sew the tip..... from this report we get these diseases 1- Injury by sharp tools 2- Fingertip amputation 3- Sewing injury another report results may have 3 or less or more diseases I have searched a lot I found many examples about NLP classification where a text will be classified into Sports, Politics, Culture, Science, etc. I found NER where person names, locations, dates, etc can be extracted from a text. But did not find anything for a single text could have multiple values (similar to my dataset) I dont know where to start. Could anyone please help me finding what is the name of this method of extracting list of issues from a text? Edit What else do I need to exclude the negations, if the report says "This patient has stomach problem but not diabetes " How can I make AI understand there is a negation ( NOT ) before diabetes so it should not be included? So the result will be stomach problem as diabetes should be excluded because of the negation word
