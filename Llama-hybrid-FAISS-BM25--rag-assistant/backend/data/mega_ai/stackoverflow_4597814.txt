You can't add instance variables in categories. However, you can add storage for your attribute to an object using associative references . Note that if you need to add more than one attribute, rather than adding an associative reference for each, you're probably better off adding a single reference to (say) an NSMutableDictionary, CFMutableDictionaryRef, or NSMapTable and using that for all of your attributes.
