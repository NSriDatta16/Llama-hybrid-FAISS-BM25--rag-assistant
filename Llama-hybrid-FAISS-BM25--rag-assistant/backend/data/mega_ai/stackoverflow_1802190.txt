If you use Robert Harder's Base64 utility , then you can do: InputStream is = new Base64.InputStream(cph); Or with sun's JRE, you can do: InputStream is = new com.sun.xml.internal.messaging.saaj.packaging.mime.util.BASE64DecoderStream(cph) However don't rely on that class continuing to be a part of the JRE, or even continuing to do what it seems to do today. Sun say not to use it. There are other Stack Overflow questions about Base64 decoding, such as this one.
