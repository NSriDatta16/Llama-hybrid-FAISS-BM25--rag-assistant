How to late bind a CLR 4.0 assembly from a 3.5 project?

The title is self-explanatory of what I want to accomplish. I have a COM-visible component built in 3.5 and my new projects are 4.0. Code very similar to the one below is what I want to run from the 3.5 component. Assembly a = Assembly.LoadFrom(@"C:\MyCLR4.exe"); Type t = a.GetType("MyCLR4Class"); object o = Activator.CreateInstance(t); Ultimately I'm getting the error "This assembly is built by a runtime newer than the currently loaded runtime and cannot be loaded" I'm pretty discouraged by what I've found elsewhere. All I need is a workaround to accomplish this. Thanks!
