I think I understand the question. Of course if you use an external build system like maven or ant, then we are decoupling the build process from the IDE. (But in some cases the IDE does integrate pretty closely with the build tool.) But if you want to continue building using eclipse and to generate an ant file one fine day, then there is a tool for that. Its called EBuild . It leverages all the classpath information that eclipse already has and builds an generic ant file out of it.
