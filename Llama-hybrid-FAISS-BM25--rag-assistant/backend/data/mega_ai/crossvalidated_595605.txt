How to build an acquisition models?

I have historical transaction data for a B2B business. I want to prepare acquisition models where the model will predict the potential buyers who haven't purchased from the business yet. In addition to the transaction data, I have customer data where I have the details about the different businesses in the region (Their Sales, Profitability, Size, Location, and Industry) from an external source. How do I translate this business problem into a data science problem? What should be my approach in building these models? Are there any resources available for similar problems? I really appreciate any help you can provide.
