Random Forest is more of a black box algorithm which gives you a lot of flexibility but lacks on the interpretation side, unlike decision trees which are easy to interpret. I think visualization of random forest doesn't make much sense because generally you have more than 500 trees in a random forest, I guess the plot will be highly cluttered. Other than this you might find following helpful Best way to present a random forest in a publication?
