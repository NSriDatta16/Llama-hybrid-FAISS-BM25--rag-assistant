This question is challenging to answer with the information we have right now... for instance, what are you calling 'overhead'? Is it only TCP ACK packets, or all packet overhead (for instance ethernet, IP and tcp headers) for anything other than your data payload? How many connections per minute? What is the average data transfer, per connection? If there are many very short-lived connections, your overhead requirements go up (due to 3-way handshake, and connection close requirements)... you could also have high overhead if the clients don't read much data, but many clients keep the connections open for days at a time. Honestly, you're 50x better off modeling this in a lab and making some assumptions about hit rate per minute and concurrent clients... that will give you some ballpark numbers. Play around with limiting the bandwidth afforded to the application to the maximum your budget would allow... then start backing off... you can throttle bandwidth by using wanem on a dual-port linux machine. Getting lab results like this is far better than theoretical calculations. HTH, \mike (who spends all day testing network gear)
