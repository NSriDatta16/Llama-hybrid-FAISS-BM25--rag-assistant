You can't frequently run all your tests, because they're too slow. This is an inevitable consequence of your project getting bigger, and won't go away. Sure, you may be able to run the tests in parallel and get a nice speedup, but the problem will just come back later, and it'll never be as it was when your project was small. For productivity, you need to be able to code, and run relevant unit tests and get results within a few seconds. If you have a hierarchy of tests, you can do this effectively: run the tests for the module you're working on frequently, the tests for the component you're working on occasionally, and the project-wide tests infrequently (perhaps before you're thinking of checking it in). You may have integration tests, or full system tests which you may run overnight: this strategy is an extension of that idea. All you need to do to set this up is to organize your code and tests to support the hierarchy.
