Which statistical test would be most appropriate for this data?

I conducted an experiment in an evolutionary program called AVIDA-ED contrasting the adaptive evolution in different world sizes (30x30,40x40,50x50). I performed 10 repetitions of each world size and recorded 4 variables being: Organisms (# organisms in world),Viable (how many organisms are viable), Fitness (average fitness of all organisms, the focus variable as it represents the reproductive quality), and Energy (the rate of acquirement an organisms learns to express a particular energy). My alternative hypothesis is that adaptive evolution will occur at a higher rate in a large world (50) than a small world (30). Providing Fitness, Viability, and Energy = adaptive evolution, would a comparison of data from each world size using t-tests in R be appropriate? If not, which statistical tests would be advisable for this set of data to compare Fitness and Viable values and to visualize the data? From looking at the data, it is already able to be assumed that the larger world allows higher rates of all variables but I'd like to be able to represent that statistically. I'm very new to R so sorry for the cluelessness. Dataset: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/a549abfaf949c08172b8c03642c2776f
