In addition to the other things mentioned, you should learn about asynchronous message queues. They can elegantly solve the problems of data sharing and event handling. This approach works well when you have concurrent state machines that need to communicate with each other. I'm not aware of any message passing frameworks tailored to work only at the thread level. I've only seen home-brewed solutions. Please comment if you know of any existing ones. EDIT: One could use the lock-free queues from Intel's TBB , either as-is, or as the basis for a more general message-passing queue.
