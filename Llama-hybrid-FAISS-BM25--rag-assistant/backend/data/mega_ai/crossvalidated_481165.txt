Decile Analysis for model comparison

I am working on a simple classification problem (bank marketing response data) and trying various evaluation methods for multiple models to compare and understand the output. And I was trying to do a decile analyses to compare logistic and random forest models and had one thing I wasn't completely sure. From the logistic regression model output, we get the class probability of a customer to respond to a marketing communication. Model output from random forest also provides some probabilities and those are basically mean of predicted outcome (probability of trees predicting 'response' for each customer). And my question would be; How would interpret those probabilities? (Could it be used as a measure of how confidently the model predicts? etc.) Are those two probabilities comparable in the first place?
