It's not absolutely necessary to know how to use C++ templates. You can do most things without them. They are however a fantastic feature. Since you roll your own templates, anyone new is going to have to come up to speed with them just like the rest of your code which is going to be the bigger chunk of the learning. I encourage people to learn to use some of the features of the STL . I have used this library in production code and it does save time and simplify things quite a bit. I also roll my own when the need arises. I've also heard good things about the boost library. If I need to write portable code then I'll generally stick away from templates because many compilers still don't support them properly. If you need a portable STL then STLPort is the most portable.
