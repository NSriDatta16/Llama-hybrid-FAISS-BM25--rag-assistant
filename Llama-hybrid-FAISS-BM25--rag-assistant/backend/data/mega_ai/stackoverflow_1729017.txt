Not sure but maybe this is causes by a browser-bug? Since you're getting an empty post to the server the jquery post method works properly but it seems like the json-conversion doesn't work in some cases. You should have a look it the IIS log files for the USER-AGENT that posts these empty values. Of course it is also possible that somebody is doing a manual POST to your server... looking for vulnerabilities to exploit.
