Correct interpretation of estimates in poisson regression output

I am learning to use and validate the Poisson regression model and interpret the results. I am using some data on grassland plant diversity in response to fertilizer and light. The experimental design is fully crossed; there were a total of32 plots, 8 received fertilizer and light(F+L+), 8 received fertilizer and no light (F+L-), 8 received no fertilizer and light (F-L+), and 8 received no fertilizer and no light(F-L-). The number of species was counted in each plot. In these grassland systems, there is typically a loss of species diversity in response to fertilization, which may be due to light competition. My goal is to estimate whether the loss of species can be prevented by restoring light to these areas. Here is an example of the data: structure(list(Fertilizer = structure(c(1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L), .Label = c("F-", "F+" ), class = "factor"), Light = structure(c(1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L), .Label = c("L-", "L+"), class = "factor"), FL = structure(c(1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 3L, 3L, 3L, 3L, 3L, 3L, 3L, 3L, 4L, 4L, 4L, 4L, 4L, 4L, 4L, 4L), .Label = c("F-L-", "F-L+", "F+L-", "F+L+"), class = "factor"), LF = structure(c(1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 3L, 3L, 3L, 3L, 3L, 3L, 3L, 3L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 4L, 4L, 4L, 4L, 4L, 4L, 4L, 4L), .Label = c("L-F-", "L-F+", "L+F-", "L+F+"), class = "factor"), Diversity = c(6L, 7L, 10L, 9L, 5L, 9L, 7L, 6L, 10L, 9L, 9L, 11L, 9L, 9L, 7L, 7L, 4L, 4L, 6L, 4L, 5L, 5L, 4L, 4L, 7L, 8L, 9L, 9L, 10L, 10L, 10L, 7L)), class = "data.frame", row.names = c(NA, -32L)) I fit a Poisson distribution model as follows: PlantMod Which gives the following output: > summary(PlantMod) Call: glm(formula = Diversity ~ FL, family = poisson(link = log), data = plants) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -0.92920 -0.24454 0.04186 0.38080 0.91640 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 1.9981 0.1302 15.348 I want to make sure I am interpreting the estimate results correctly, I haven't been able to find good examples using crossed designs like this. Here are a few specific questions I have: R chose (F-L-) as the baseline/reference group and gave an estimate of 1.9981. Is the exponential of this exp(1.9981) interpreted as the average effect on Y ( Diversity ), when the other estimators are at X=0? Does it matter which group is used as a baseline (is it related to the question you are trying to answer)? From what I understand, the slopes can be interpreted as the average effect of the respective estimator on the fitted values for diversity (which incorporates all Y-values, or Diversity values, across all treatment groups). For example the estimated slope for the F-L+ group is 0.1851; since this is reported on the link scale, you could calculate 1-exp(0.1851)=-0.203 , and conclude that the model would predict a 20.3% decrease in diversity in F-L+ plots when compared to F-L- plots? I am not sure how to interpret the p-values in this case. Only (F-L-) and (F+L-) had significant p-values. Is this saying that the average of the (F-L+) and (F+L+) groups (which had the insignificant p-values) are not significantly different in diversity than the (F-L-) group, or that those groups didn't have a significant effect on the outcome of the actual response (Y or Diversity)? advice on how to validate this model (if I used the best link function, and when I might consider switching to a different distribution, such as quasi-Poisson or whatever else) would also be greatly appreciated.
