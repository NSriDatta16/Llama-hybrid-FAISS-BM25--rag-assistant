You can estimate the marginal means (for regular regression) or marginal probabilities (for logistic regression) at any specific value of the moderating variable that you want. It is common on psychological scales that measure latent constructs to do this at a standard deviation below and a standard deviation above the mean on the continuous moderator. But, for something like cigarettes smoked, there may be specific values that are useful (one per day, however many are in a pack, however many are in two packs, etc.)
