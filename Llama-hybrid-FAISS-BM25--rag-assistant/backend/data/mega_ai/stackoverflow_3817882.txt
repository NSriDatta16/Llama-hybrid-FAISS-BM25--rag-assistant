Magento already provides email alerts for when a product changes price or changes stock status (see System>Config>Catalog>Product Alerts ). If you have a look at the code in Mage_ProductAlert , you should be able to extend it to cover the case of a new product. I would guess that you'd want to offer customers the option to subscribe to alerts related to a category? So, add a new model for productalert/category and extend the AddController with a categoryAction() EDIT -- Actually, one "low-touch" option would be to use something like Feedburner to take the existing RSS category feed and send emails. When you plug the feed into Feedburner, it will give you a link that users can click to subscribe to the email version of RSS. It takes them away from your site, but does achieve the requirement without custom coding.
