Model selection based on "generalization set"

I'm working on a very general problem in machine learning where I have to choose from different models or from updates which would lead to different models. A first idea was to define a "generalization set" disjoint from the training, test and possible development set and choose the best model on the "generalization set". It has some resemblance with meta-learning or population-based optimization methods but has its own overfitting problems. Does someone know about research involving such a "generalization set" or similar approaches?
