I love Python and Django, and use both to develop the our core webapps. That said, it's hard to make a business case for switching at this point. Specifically: Any new platform is risky compared to staying with the tried and true You'll have the developer fragmentation you mentioned It's far easier to find PHP programmers than python programmers Moreover, as other posters have mention, if the issue is more with spaghetti code than PHP itself, there are plenty of nice PHP frameworks that could be used to refactor the code. That said, if this developer is excited about python, stopping them outright is probably demoralizing. My suggestion would be to encourage them to develop in python, but not the mission critical parts of the app. Instead they could write some utility scripts, some small internal application that needs doing, etc. In conclusion: I don't recommend switching from PHP, but I do recommend accommodating the developer's interest in some way at work.
