Can I show an alert from Global.asax on a page that's experiencing a SQL Timeout?

In Global.asax, is there a way to handle SQL Timeouts elegantly, and display a message on the requesting page explaining the error? I know Global.asax has the Application_Error and Error events, but I'm not sure which (if any) I could use to accomplish this. Related, can I access the page instance which raised the error that Global.asax is handling? Thanks!
