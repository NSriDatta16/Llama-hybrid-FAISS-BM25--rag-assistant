I have contacted an engineer at Apple's support and he told me that simultaneous AVCaptureVideoDataOutput + AVCaptureMovieFileOutput use is not supported. I don't know if they will support it in the future, but he used the word "not supported at this time". I encourage you to fill a bug report / feature request on this, as I did (bugreport.apple.com), as they measure how hard people want something and we perhaps can see this in a near future.
