Flash as3 spinning wheel

I am trying to create a spinning wheel with text on it. I have created the wheel and it is populating perfectly based on the colors that I supply to it. Now I am trying to add text to each of the parts of the wheel but am running into some problems. I cannot seem to get the text to display properly within each of the colors. I was hoping someone could help me get this to work properly. The place where I am trying to get the text to work is in the _drawSlice function. I am trying to figure out the logic to get it to work properly. Any help is appreciated. Here is my code: package { import flash.display.MovieClip; import flash.display.Sprite; import flash.text.TextFormat; import flash.text.TextField; import flash.display.BitmapData; import flash.display.Bitmap; public class PieChart extends MovieClip{ //settings private var _radius:Number = new Number(100); //storage private var slices:Array = new Array(); private var _startAngle:Number = new Number(0); public function PieChart() { this._setup(_radius); for(var i:int=0;i 0) { // draw a line from the center to the start of the curve ax = Math.cos(_startAngle/180*Math.PI)*radius; ay = Math.sin(-_startAngle/180*Math.PI)*radius; sprite.graphics.lineTo(ax, ay); // Loop for drawing curve segments for (var i:int = 0; i }
