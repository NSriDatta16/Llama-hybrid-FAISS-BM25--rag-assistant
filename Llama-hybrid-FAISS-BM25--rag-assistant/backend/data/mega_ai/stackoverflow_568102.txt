Conjecture: when learning your first lisp, don't learn one you'll end up using for end development. Lemma: learn Arc. It's all of the "hard to grok" things in lisp - closures, macros, continuations, with none of Clojure's Java interop complexity, CL's namespace confusion, or Scheme's name fragmentation. If you're dedicated, you can learn all of these things in a weekend. If you're sharp and dedicated, in a night. And it'll make learning all the other lisps a lot easier.
