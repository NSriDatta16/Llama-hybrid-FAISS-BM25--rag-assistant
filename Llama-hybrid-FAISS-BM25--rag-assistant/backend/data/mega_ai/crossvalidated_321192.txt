Try to rethink the question you need to answer. Multinomial logistic regression would answer a question such as -- Does the borrower of a loan end up repaying on time, getting an extension, or defaulting? Does a respondent prefer broccoli, anchovies, artichokes, or pineapple as a single pizza topping? Does an experimental treatment make the patient turn red, blue, or orange? In these examples, each case fits into one and only one category along the outcome variable. This is not true of your situation.
