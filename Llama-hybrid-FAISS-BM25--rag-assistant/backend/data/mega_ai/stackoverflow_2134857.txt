No, something like the following would be better: Company Slogan h1 { text-indent: -90000px; background: transparent url(/img/logo.png) no-repeat left top; width: 172px; height: 80px; } h1 a { display: block; width: 172px; height: 80px; } The h1 is only used once, for the company itself. Then you replace that logo text with an image using CSS. This way you keep the markup within your CSS.
