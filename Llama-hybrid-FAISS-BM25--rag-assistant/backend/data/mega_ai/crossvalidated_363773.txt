One possible way where your colleague's approach might perform better would be if the two "components" had very different drivers. For instance, I suspect that there are strong multiple-seasonalities for sessions, with people accessing the site differently over the day and between workdays and weekends. However, there might be much less seasonality for the conversion rate. This might be driven much more by things like whether a given session results in a basket that is large enough for, say, shipping costs to be waived. So, yes, it might indeed be possible to forecast both separate components very well, so that the final product is a better forecast than a "direct" approach. As a matter of fact, when two different approaches to forecasting are in play, it is often best to combine the two, e.g., by calculating the average of the two forecasts. (With the added complexity that you now need to maintain both algorithms. This may or may not be worth an increase in accuracy.) You could compare the forecast accuracy of your and your colleague's approach (or the average) by using a holdout sample.
