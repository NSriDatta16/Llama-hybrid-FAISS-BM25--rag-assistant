Catching mouse move

Situation : I'm currently working a project where the aim is to develop a VS-like IDE, where users can drap/drop new controls to a design surface, and modify properties of these controls. So i implemented IDesignerHost, IServiceContainer, IContainer, IComponentChangeService, and some others useful interface, made to design that. Everything works fine, i've my toolbox, my design surface, and my propertyGrid working just fine. Problem is : Attached to the drag'n'droped controls is a label, which has to follow the control while the user move it with his mouse . I tried to use the LocationChanged event of the controls, to move the label when the control move. But this event occurs only one time, after the control has moved so the label doesn't move while the control move . I'm not able to find a way for make this work. Does anyone have any good ideas please ? Thank you Edit : I use a custom class, implementing IDesignerHost. Controls on this design surface doesn't fire events Mouse----- (e.g. : MouseDown, MouseMove).
