The first principle is "State the query accurately". The second principle is "state the query simply and obviously" (which is where you usually make choices). The third is "state the query so it will process efficiently". If its a dbms with a good query processor, equivalent query designs should should result in query plans that are the same (or at least equally efficient). My greatest frustration upon using MySQL for the first time was how conscious I had to be to anticipate the optimizer. After long experience with Oracle, SQL Server, Informix, and other dbms products, I very seldom expected to concern myself with such issues. It's better now with newer versions of MySQL, but it's still something I end up needing to pay attention to more often than with the others.
