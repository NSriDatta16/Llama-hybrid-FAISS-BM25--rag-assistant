@PeterEllis has made some good suggestions. I like his idea of using Poisson regression (which I suspect should be supplemented by an offset ), and his point that ordinal logistic regression is more appropriate than multinomial. However, I want to suggest that you look seriously at survival analysis . As best I can follow your study, and what you hope to find out, survival analysis is appropriate, most likely the Cox Proportional Hazards model. In particular, the fact that you explicitly state that your window of 3 days is arbitrary, and the fact that it appears very often a second event does not occur within that interval, imply that results from other analyses may be badly biased.
