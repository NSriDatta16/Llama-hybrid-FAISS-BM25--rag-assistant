I look at how much time I have left, and if I feel I am pressed, I don't venture outside of my area of expertise. I am all for doing it correctly and elegantly, but the reality is that the majority of the time the deadline takes precedence, and I know if I stay within my comfortzone when pressed, I will most likely make fewer errors which means I save the QA people time in testing things. That all being said, I have been known on more than one occasion to push the limits of how much can be done. If you aren't working an immense amount of overtime already, you can always make extra the time necessary for going the harder route. Yeah doing this can cause a little more work for extra people but sometimes that's the difference between having the best application or having the first loser. My other advice is don't try and do both options. If you create a basic version stick with it and move on. If you try and do both, you're really wasting time in the end.
