Does "text selection mode" work the same for all views & devices

The documentation for WebView.emulateShiftHeld() says: Use this method to put the WebView into text selection mode. Do not rely on this functionality; it will be deprecated in the future. What does "put the WebView into text selection mode " mean? To clarify: Does "text selection mode" work the same for WebView as in other views ? Does "text selection mode" work the same on the emulator as in other, real , devices? On the emulator, for example, I tie the function to a menu item, and when I select that item (on the emulator), and start dragging the mouse over some text, I have 2 fat cursors ("handles"?) marking the beginning the start & end of the selection. When I click the end "hand", I receive a pop-up balloon saying "Text copied to clipboard".
