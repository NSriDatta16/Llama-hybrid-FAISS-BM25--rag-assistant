LINQ way of transforming "TheQuickBrownFox" into "The quick brown fox"

I am trying to transform a string made of words starting with an uppercase letter. I want to separate each word with a space and keep only the first uppercase letter. All other letters should be lowercase. For example, "TheQuickBrownFox" would become "The quick brown fox". Obviously, I could use a simple foreach and build a string by checking each character, but I am trying to do it using LINQ. Would you know how to solve this elegantly using LINQ? Thank you for your help.
