This isn't exactly an answer to your question, but when you mentioned that VS is creating a bunch of goo it made me think that you are probably using drag/drop functionality to accomplish this task. This is partially why, as you already pointed out, you can't figure out what's going on. This codegen by studio is making it more complicated for you. If I'd suggest considering removing this autogenerated dataset and creating your own typed data set to replace it if you are early on in your project. If you are in the position where you can make this change to a more sane typed dataset it will help position you to not get into situations like you are in now. Moreover, if you have the time, you might consider a design that doesn't use datasets at all, but that is certainly much more to take on. Most folks are using an ORM solution such as NHibernate or something similiar to do the kinds of things we used to use DataSets for. Obviously, if there are time or external factors that make it so you must use DataSets, then forget this ORM consideration--but do think about removing the autogenerated dataset and making a typed dataset instead. It will be much easier on you.
