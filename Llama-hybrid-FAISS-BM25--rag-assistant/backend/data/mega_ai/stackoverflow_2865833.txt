Remove the space between the 'p' and '.title' in your selector: $container.find("p.title").css('color','red'); (if that's your question) Update: Your jquery selector will still work fine even if the DOM element you are trying to access is generated by Javascript. You can test this in the javascript console (e.g. Firebug) of your browser. You just have to make sure your code is executed after the code that generates the title element. However, do you really need to use Javascript here? If you just want to set paragraphs with class 'title' to red, just add some css: p.title { color: red; }
