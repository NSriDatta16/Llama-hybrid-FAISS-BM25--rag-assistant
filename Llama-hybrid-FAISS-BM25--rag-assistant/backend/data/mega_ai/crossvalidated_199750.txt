If you are truly interested in all-or-nothing classification you can fool the proportion classified correctly with a variety of bogus models. If you are interested in prediction instead, and use proper accuracy scoring rules, you'll see that what outperforms other methods in a variety of situations is additive models that allow predictors to act nonlinearly (e.g., regression splines). You could call this class of models generalized additive models (GAMs, which is strictly speaking for the nonparametric case) or additive smooth models. The reason that additive models, or linear models for that case, can outperform other methods in many situations is that they are effectively Bayesian with a prior distribution that places weight on additive effects and places little weight on non-additive (interactive; synergistic) effects. Use of prior information can really boost mean squared error (and other measures) of predictive accuracy. We find in many situations that the dominant effects are additive, and complex interactive effects (of the type featured by random forests, SVMs, recursive partitioning, and other approaches) are not very predictive.
