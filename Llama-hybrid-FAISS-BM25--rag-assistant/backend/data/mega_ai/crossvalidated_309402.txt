How to find the optimal number of clusters for spectral clustering using similarity matrix in scikit learn

What is the best way of finding out the optimal number of clusters, given that I just have a similarity matrix? Is it possible to do it all in Scikit-learn without any extra implementation? My suggestion? PCA it! Please correct, Thank you!
