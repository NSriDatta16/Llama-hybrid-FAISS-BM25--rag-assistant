I don't think it's necessarily the case that the above code will even compile. Surely the implementor of std::vector is at liberty to require an assignment operator to be available, from const A& ? And having just tried it, it doesn't compile on Visual Studio C++ 2008 Service Pack 1: binary '=' : no operator found which takes a right-hand operand of type 'const A' (or there is no acceptable conversion) My guess is that, on the guidance of Herb Sutter, the container classes in VC++ make every effort to impose the standard requirements on their type parameters, specifically to make it hard to use auto_ptr with them. They may have overstepped the boundaries set by the standard of course, but I seem to remember it mandating true assignment as well as true copy construction. It does compile in g++ 3.4.5, however.
