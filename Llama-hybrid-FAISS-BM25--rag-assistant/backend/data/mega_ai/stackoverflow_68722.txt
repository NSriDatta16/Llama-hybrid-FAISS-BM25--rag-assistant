In Windows Forms, set the control's AllowDrop property, then listen for DragEnter event and DragDrop event. When the DragEnter event fires, set the argument's AllowedEffect to something other than none (e.g. e.Effect = DragDropEffects.Move ). When the DragDrop event fires, you'll get a list of strings. Each string is the full path to the file being dropped.
