3 categorical IV and 1 categorical DV -- what test to use?

Here's my setup: Independent Variables (IV): (A) Task -- values 0 - 6 (order doesn't matter) (B) Viewpoint -- values 0 - 26 (order doesn't matter) (C) Input-device -- values {touchscreen, mouse, trackpad} Dependent Variable (DV): (1) Types of drawing -- values {arrow, circle, outline, arrow+circle, arrow+outline, circle+outline, arrow+circle+outline, sketch, words, ...} I want to see if task, viewpoint, or input-device affects the type of drawing my participants did. What statistical test should I use for this? Since this is all categorical (nominal) data, I was thinking to use the Chi-Squared test, but I have too many independent variables, right? All the websites I have found mention using Chi-Squared with only 1 independent variable. I can't use a "Factorial logistic regression" either because the dependent variable is not dichotomous. Any ideas? EDIT: Actually, I think my dependent variable is the number of each of type of drawing drawn. E.g., for Task 0, Viewpoint 1, mouse, across all users who did this task (it's between-subjects on Task), there was 3 arrows, 5 circles, etc. This is still a categorical DV, right?
