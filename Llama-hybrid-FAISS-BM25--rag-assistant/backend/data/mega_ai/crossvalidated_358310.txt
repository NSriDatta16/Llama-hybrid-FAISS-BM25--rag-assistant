How to apply reinforcement learning to combinatorial puzzles?

I want to apply machine learning to a problem I have. It's essentially a kind of combinatorial puzzle where you want to get a high score like in "2048", except that unlike 2048, it is deterministic, you can reverse moves (so you don't 'die', you just get stuck in local minima when the grid is filled), and the number of possible moves in each 'turn' is large. I was wondering what kind of reinforcement learning would be a good choice for it? I've heard that with Q-learning you need a small space of possible actions to get good performance. I thought an AlphaZero-type algorithm might be good since it's been applied to games with very large action spaces (e.g. Go), but it seems to be used in two-player games and I don't know if you can use it on "single-player" puzzles. Btw I'm also pretty new to ML so any advice would be appreciated.
