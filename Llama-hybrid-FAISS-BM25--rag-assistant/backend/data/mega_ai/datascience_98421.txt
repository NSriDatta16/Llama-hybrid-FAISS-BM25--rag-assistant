Very low error during training of a RNN for forecasting but high test error

I use a Recurrent Neural Network for time series forecasting of electrical load data from a cooling device based on past values of the load time series and temperature values. I first normalize the data before the training. So the time series has very low values after the normalization (between 0 and 1). Because of this the training error (root mean squared error) for the training and evaluation set is quite low (smaller than 0,05). However when using the test data, the root mean squared error is extremely high (13754.9). I use 2 previous days as input and as output is one day ahead (with a time resolution of 15 minutes). Now I basically have 2 questions: As I normalize the data before training, the general error is consequently quite small during training. Can this be a disandvantage for the optimizer "adam" because I can imagine that so small values might somehow "mislead" the optimizer. Do you have any suggestion how I can improve the results? So I have a extremely low error on the training and validation set (due to the small values) but an extremely high error on the test set. Here you can see the error plot of the training for the training and validation data set: Here you can see the actual and forecasted values of the test data set: Reminder : Does nobody have any suggestions? Are my questions unclear or do you need further information? I'd appreciate every comment and will be quite thankful for your help.
