STL trend of time series using R

I am new to R and to time series analysis. I am trying to find the trend of a long (40 years) daily temperature time series and tried to different approximations. First one is just a simple linear regression and second one is Seasonal Decomposition of Time Series by Loess. In the latter it appears that the seasonal component is greater than the trend. But, how do I quantify the trend? I would like just a number telling how strong is that trend. Call: stl(x = tsdata, s.window = "periodic") Time.series components: seasonal trend remainder Min. :-8.482470191 Min. :20.76670 Min. :-11.863290365 1st Qu.:-5.799037090 1st Qu.:22.17939 1st Qu.: -1.661246674 Median :-0.756729578 Median :22.56694 Median : 0.026579468 Mean :-0.005442784 Mean :22.53063 Mean : -0.003716813 3rd Qu.:5.695720249 3rd Qu.:22.91756 3rd Qu.: 1.700826647 Max. :9.919315613 Max. :24.98834 Max. : 12.305103891 IQR: STL.seasonal STL.trend STL.remainder data 11.4948 0.7382 3.3621 10.8051 % 106.4 6.8 31.1 100.0 Weights: all == 1 Other components: List of 5 $ win : Named num [1:3] 153411 549 365 $ deg : Named int [1:3] 0 1 1 $ jump : Named num [1:3] 15342 55 37 $ inner: int 2 $ outer: int 0
