This depends on the methodology. If you are doing iterations then keep testing and production accounts separate, promoting the release only after it makes through the testing. Important: you might want to start developing against azure fabric as soon as possible (or at least to use azure storage account in the cloud), since Dev and real fabrics are too different at this point. There are a few quirks that can make your life harder if you fully rely on the dev fabric and storage . If you are into rapid development (i.e.: deploying stable features as soon as they are stable and pass unit tests), then there is no explicit need for a single testing account (although some developers or prototypes might need separate accounts on per case basis). Note, that you might want to automate the deployment process somehow in this case (15 mins to deploy is long) by either using powershell scripts or some sort of the deployment manager that merely uploads binaries to the new AppDomain.
