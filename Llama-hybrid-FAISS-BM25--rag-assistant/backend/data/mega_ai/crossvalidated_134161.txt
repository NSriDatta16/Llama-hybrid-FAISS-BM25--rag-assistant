In fact in linear regression it's already assumed that the predictor variable (IV) has no error. If not for that, you'd have errors-in-variables regression (though it has various other names). OLS is biased in this case. So there's no opportunity for efficiency when you impose a condition that's already assumed. There is some opportunity for some efficiency gain because the $t$'s are equispaced. However, if you need to refit these models each time a new data point arrives, then there are larger opportunities for gain. A warning, too, about fitting regression to time series; it must be done with care .
