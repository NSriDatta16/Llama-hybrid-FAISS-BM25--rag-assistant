You don't just copy your images in both folders. The hdpi folder should have larger (higher dpi) images than the mdpi folder. For instance, menu icons should be 72x72 pixels in the hdpi folder, and only 48x48px in the mdpi folder. If you only have 1 image in the mdpi folder, and the user has a high res device, then it will load that 1 image but upscale it. However, that doesn't look the best. It's a good practice to have multiple versions of each image for high, medium, and low res devices.
