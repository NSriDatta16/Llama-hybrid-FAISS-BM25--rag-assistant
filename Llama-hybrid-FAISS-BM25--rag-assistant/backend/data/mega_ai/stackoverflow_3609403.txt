Note that PHP runs on the server side and generates HTML / Javascript. Javascript runs on the client side. What you would have to do to show a progress bar like that is to output snippets that update your DIV element. If you put the line document.getElementById("counter").innerHTML = " "; (notice the quotes) into the loop, and output buffering is turned off, and the counter HTML element was output before, you will get some sort of progress bar. However, depending on what you want kind of action you are running behind that progress bar, an Ajax driven progress indicator may be much, much more elegant.
