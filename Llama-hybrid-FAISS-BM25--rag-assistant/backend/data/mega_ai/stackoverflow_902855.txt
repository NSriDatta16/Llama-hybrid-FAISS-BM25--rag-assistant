Jeremy Frey misses one of the biggest reasons for using an IOC container: it makes your code easier to mock and test. Encouraging the use of interfaces has lots of other nice benefits: better layering, easier to dynamically generate proxies for things like declarative transactions, aspect-oriented programming and remoting. If you think IOC is only good for replacing calls to "new", you don't get it.
