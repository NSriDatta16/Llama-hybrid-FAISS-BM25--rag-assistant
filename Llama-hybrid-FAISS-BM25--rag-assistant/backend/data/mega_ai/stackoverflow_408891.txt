A picture is not worth a thousand words. Some pictures might be worth a thousand words. Most of them are not. This trite old aphorism is mostly untrue and is a pathetic excuse for many a lazy manager who did not want to read carefully created reports and documentation to say "I need you to show me in a diagram." My wife studied for a linguistics major and saw several fascinating proofs against the conventional wisdom on pictures and logos: they do not break across language and cultural barriers, they usually do not communicate anywhere near as much information as correct text, they simply are no substitute for real communication. In particular, labeled bubbles connected with lines are useless if the lines are unlabeled and unexplained, and/or if every line has a different meaning instead of signifying the same relationship (unless distinguished from each other in some way). If your lines sometimes signify relationships and sometimes indicate actions and sometimes indicate the passage of time, you're really hosed. Every good programmer knows you use the tool suited for the job at hand, right? Not all systems are best specified and documented in pictures. Graphical specification languages that can be automatically turned into provably-correct, executable code or whatever are a spectacular idea, if such things exist. Use them when appropriate, not for everything under the sun. Entity-Relationship diagrams are great. But not everything can be summed up in a picture. Note: a table may be worth its weight in gold. But a table is not the same thing as a picture . And again, a well-crafted short prose paragraph may be far more suitable for the job at hand.
