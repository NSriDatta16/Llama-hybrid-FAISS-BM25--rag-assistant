Don't forget to look into what part of the system is improperly storing unreasonable amounts of data in the session to actually fix the problem. Clearing sessions sooner is only a temporary fix. Session files should always remain small. Odds are, some script is storing an inappropriately large amount of data in the session for "efficiency" and causing the problem. It is almost assuredly objects being stored in the session causing this problem. A common pattern in Magento is to have object data chained like this: $product-> 'attr1' => 'somevalue', ... 'categories' => array( 'products' => array( ), ), Dropping an object into the session can include this gigantic chains of objects unintentionally, storing lots of extraneous data. If possible, store only string/numeric data in the session, such as arrays of IDs for products, rather than the products themselves.
