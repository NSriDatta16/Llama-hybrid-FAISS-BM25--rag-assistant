Find the number of differences between two lists

I want to compare two lists with the same number of elements, and find the number of differences between them. Right now, I have this code (which works): public static int CountDifferences (this IList list1, IList list2) { if (list1.Count != list2.Count) throw new ArgumentException ("Lists must have the same number of elements", "list2"); int count = 0; for (int i = 0; i .Default.Equals (list1[i], list2[i])) count++; } return count; } This feels messy to me, and it seems like there must be a more elegant way to achieve it. Is there a way, perhaps, to combine the two lists into a single list of tuples, then simple examine each element of the new list to see if both elements are equal?
