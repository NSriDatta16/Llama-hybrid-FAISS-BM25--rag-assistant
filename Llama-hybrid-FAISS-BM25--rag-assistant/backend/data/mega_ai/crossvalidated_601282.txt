The different numbers of cases under different treatments isn't a problem on its own. Although there's a long historical preference in ANOVA for having equal numbers of cases in each treatment, a proper regression model will handle different numbers of cases. The bigger problem is that you can't distinguish certain types of effects. For example, you can't distinguish differences between locations X and Y from differences between the calendar year 2014 versus years 2015-2016. One way to deal with this is to model all of the data together and then do post-modeling comparisons of specific situations. That uses all of the data to build the model, but restricts subsequent analysis to comparisons that make sense given the limits of your experimental design. Code each combination of location/treatment/year in a single 9-level categorical predictor: treatments B, C, D at X in 2014; treatments A, B, C at Y in 2015; treatments A, B, C at Y in 2016. You presumably will be using a Poisson or negative binomial model for the count data, and you should also be controlling for week within the year by including that in your model (for example, with a flexible regression spline). You might consider an interaction between your 9-level categorical predictor and your modeling of week within the year. After you have fit the model, don't pay much attention to the individual coefficient values. Instead, use post-modeling tools like those provided by the R emmeans package to evaluate combinations of coefficients that provide useful information. For example, did the overall 2015 and 2016 estimates of treatment effects at location Y differ? What is the difference between treatments B and C, combining both locations? Between D and B/C at location X? Between A and B/C at location Y?
