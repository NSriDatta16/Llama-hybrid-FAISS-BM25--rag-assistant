Can I unit test the DOM?

We have a Ruby on Rails app that uses some javascript in the views. Since we have good test coverage on the rest of the app, we want to continue that here. The js we use manipulates the DOM to show/hide divs and perform incremental searching for a combobox selecting from a table. Does anyone know of ways to test DOM manipulation? Frank
