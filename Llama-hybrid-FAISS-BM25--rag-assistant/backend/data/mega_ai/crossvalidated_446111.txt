Is confidence interval determined before observing data?

My professor is comparing the frequentist confidence interval and the bayesian credible interval. He claims that a confidence interval is determined prior to observing the data, while the credible interval is determined after having observed the data. I do not understand at all how a confidence interval could be determined prior to observing the data when a confidence interval is literally a function of the data. Is it possible that he meant something else by this wording?
