Unfortunately, it usually takes a disaster or two before this stuff gets the attention it deserves. It really depends what your management is like, but I've had luck with good old honest-to-goodness fearmongering. If you go through a couple of disaster scenarios, and point out someone 's going to get blamed if they occur, that can be enough to make their arsecovering instincts kick in and finally pay attention :)
