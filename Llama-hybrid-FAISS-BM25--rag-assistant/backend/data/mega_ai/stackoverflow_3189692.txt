I am attempting to use google app engine (python) to save a url with # character

My class looks like this: class Post(db.Model): link = db.LinkProperty() I am getting the url parameter and populating the class like this: newpost = Post( link = cgi.escape(self.request.get('link'))) newpost.put() If I send a regular link it works fine. If I send a link like this (with a hash): http://www.url.com#paragraph2 , it chokes. Has anyone dealt with this before? Any recommendations would be appreciated.
