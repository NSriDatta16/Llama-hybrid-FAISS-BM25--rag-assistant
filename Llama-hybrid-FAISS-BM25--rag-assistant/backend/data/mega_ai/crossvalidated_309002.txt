Training a Convolution Neural Network with Statistical Data (Features Extracted from the Medical Image)

I'm currently working on a project to classify the medical images as normal and abnormal using convolution neural network with input as feature data (Statistical feature values extracted from medical images). Everywhere i see input as an image resized to the size of the network and hence can anyone guide with this and that'll be a great help. Thanks.
