A flag works for the OnLoad event of the windows form / web form / mobile form. In a single select Listview, not multi-select, the following code is simple to implement, and prevents multiple firing of the event. As the ListView de-selects the first item, the second item it what you need and the collection should only ever contain one item. The same below was used in a mobile application, therefore some of the collection names might be different as it is using the compact framework, however the same principles apply. Note: Make sure OnLoad and populate of the listview you set the first item to be selected. // ################ CODE STARTS HERE ################ //Flag to create at the form level System.Boolean lsvLoadFlag = true; //Make sure to set the flag to true at the begin of the form load and after private void frmMain_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) { //Prevent the listview from firing crazy in a single click NOT multislect environment lsvLoadFlag = true; //DO SOME CODE.... //Enable the listview to process events lsvLoadFlag = false; } //Populate First then this line of code lsvMain.Items[0].Selected = true; //SelectedIndexChanged Event private void lsvMain_SelectedIndexChanged(object sender, EventArgs e) { ListViewItem lvi = null; if (!lsvLoadFlag) { if (this.lsvMain.SelectedIndices != null) { if (this.lsvMain.SelectedIndices.Count == 1) { lvi = this.lsvMain.Items[this.lsvMain.SelectedIndices[0]]; } } } } ################ CODE END HERE ################ Ideally, this code should be put into a UserControl for easy re-use and distrbution in a single select ListView. This code would not be much use in a multi-select, as the event works as it should for that behavior.
