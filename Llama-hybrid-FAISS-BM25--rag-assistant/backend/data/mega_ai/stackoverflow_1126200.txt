You basically already have an example right there. Just add something like: set reviewed=no "C:\Program Files\VisualSVN Server\bin\svnlook.exe" log -t %2 %1 | FindStr "reviewed by" && set reviewed=yes if "%reviewed%"=="no" GOTO NOTREVIEWED However. Reviewing a change is easiest when the change has already been committed. Also, as already mentioned by Neil, you don't want to discourage regular bite size commits. Reviewing huge blobs of change doesn't work well. If you really want to make sure that every change is reviewed, you should use the concept of feature branches . Make a branch for each change, and allow frequent small commits without reviews there. When the change is ready, the reviewer can examine it commit by commit and merge the changes into trunk.
