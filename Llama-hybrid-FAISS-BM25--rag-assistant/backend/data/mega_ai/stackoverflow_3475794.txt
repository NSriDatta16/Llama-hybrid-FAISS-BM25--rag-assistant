Rotating an image in canvas and keeping it draggable

I have an image that I draw on a canvas. When the mouse clicks and drags, I get the mouse coordinates and use them to set the position X and Y of the image. After that's been done, I redraw the canvas. That works like a charm and I can move the image over the canvas. But now I make 2 buttons, so I can rotate the image left and right. When I rotate the image, it now moves relative to the angle I have rotated. So when I rotate the image 180 degrees and drag the image up, it goes down! I don't know why this happens or how I can compensate for it. :( Well, I understand I may be a bit vague so here is a demo of the problem.
