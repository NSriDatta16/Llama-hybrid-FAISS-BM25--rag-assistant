In this case you may be better off using logistic regression rather than correlations for evaluating the relations between your continuous predictor variables and outcome. That will allow you to examine how all of the predictor variables together are related to admission success, and makes it possible to examine how interactions among the predictors might also be related to outcome. Your search for "which parameter ... has the biggest influence on y in order to have 1," while understandable, may be dangerous. In general, trying to find a single predictor variable throws away the useful information from the other variables and can lead to severe problems with reliability. In particular, if some of your predictors are correlated then the particular one most highly related to outcome in your present data sample may not be so closely related when you try to apply your model to new cases. This Cross Validated page discusses the problems with model selection in logistic regression, and contains links to similar discussion in other contexts.
