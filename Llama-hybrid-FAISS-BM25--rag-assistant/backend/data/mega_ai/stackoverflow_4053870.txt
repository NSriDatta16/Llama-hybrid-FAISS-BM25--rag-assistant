IPhone SDK File Will Not be Included

I have am trying to include a JSON parsing library into my app and I downloaded a JSON library from github, so I dragged the JSON directory into my Classes Folder in XCode and I can open up JSON.h fine and see all of its contents. But when I import it into my implementation file with this code: #import "JSON/JSON.h" I get a compile error saying JSON/JSON.h: No such file or directory But I can see the file in my file browser in xcode! This is the first time I've included another file like this :) Any advice would help! Do I need to perhaps include it in my header file also?
