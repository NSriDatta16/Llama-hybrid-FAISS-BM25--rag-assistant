How do i cast A to object to class A when B can typcast to A?

Basically i want to do this. aa causes a bad cast exception. NOTE: o can be ANYTHING. It may not be B, it can be C, D, E, F etc. But this should work as long as o is a class that can typecast into A (B is such a class. It uses an implicit operator overload) var b = (B)"sz"; var a = (A)b; object o = b; var aa = (A)o;
