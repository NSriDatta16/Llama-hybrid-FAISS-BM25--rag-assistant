Kaiser-Guttman Criterion in R

I've been using some packages in R for MCA/PCA-like analysis, yet I can't seem to find a package (or a function) within a package which allows me to implement the Kaiser-Guttman Criterion for specifying all the eigenvalues greater than 1. Would anybody know a command in R for doing so, and the relevant packages? There is a command at the very bottom of this page, but the authors do not specify the package used in R. https://www.geo.fu-berlin.de/en/v/soga/Geodata-analysis/Principal-Component-Analysis/principal-components-basics/Choose-principal-components/index.html Would be good to hear everyone's thoughts.
