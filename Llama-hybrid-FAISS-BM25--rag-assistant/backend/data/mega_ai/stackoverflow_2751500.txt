If I correctly understand your question, your problem is very easy. Open Spy++ from the Visual Studio Tools menu. Then press Ctrl + F to receive a dialog for finding windows. Drag & drop the "Finder tool" on the control inside the dialog box from which you want to read the text; look at properties of the window, the field "Control ID" is what you need. If you have a handle of the Dialog Window (HWND hDlg) you should use the GetDlgItemText function (see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms645489(VS.85).aspx ) UINT GetDlgItemText(HWND hDlg, int nIDDlgItem, LPTSTR lpString, int nMaxCount ); to read the text. As a nIDDlgItem parameter you should place the identifier of the control. It is the value which you have found using Spy++.
