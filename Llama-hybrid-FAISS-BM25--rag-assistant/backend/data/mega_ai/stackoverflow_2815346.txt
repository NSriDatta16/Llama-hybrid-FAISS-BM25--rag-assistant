The kernel will get the packet then pass it through a list of filters (for example, there's usually a filter for IPsec, a firewall and so on) and once it's gone through all of these filters, it passes the packet on to the application. libpcap is another filter, but it simply adds the packet to an internal database for processing, rather than inspecting the packet, modifying or whatever else the other filters will do. For what you want to do, the simplest solution would be to use a firewall.
