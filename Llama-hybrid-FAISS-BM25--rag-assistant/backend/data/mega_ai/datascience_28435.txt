The primary use of CV is for tuning the model. You use the average CV value to see how your model might behave on new data. Once you’ve settled for the best hyper parameters, your retrain on the whole train data. Then people noticed that you can also use the models trained on each fold, by averaging their predictions on the test set. That’s the second way of using CV. The best approach depend son the data. Sometimes retraining on the full set is better than averaging fold predictions, sometimes the converse is true.
