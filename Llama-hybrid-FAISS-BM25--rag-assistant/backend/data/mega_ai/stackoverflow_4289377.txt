Embeddable FileSystem?

Do you know some library/framework/embeddedEngine for storing data in one binary file? Something like file system in one file. It also must support tools for fragmentating data after removing/updating. Prefer languages C++ or C#. Platform Windows. Thank you for any advice!!!
