RMSE is low but the prediction result is inaccurate?

I trained models with different models such as Feedforward neural network , Support vector machine , XGBoost . The RMSE for my train and test dataset looks great but the problems show up once I plot the actual values versus predicted values . Like for instance, the plot below is for the XGBoost model: imagine the RMSE that I received from the model is 0.01 which means somehow overfitting while the plot does not seem to be overfitted.
