Ruby and Rails (Ruby on Rails) have great support for RESTful service. In fact Rails supports and encourages design and develop in RESTful manner. Thanks to ruby's strong DSL feature, writing REST service is very straightforward and easy. Since you have python experience, learning ruby might be easy. Refer to this guide to have an impression how rest urls (called routes in rails) are defined. Other Ruby web frameworks such as Sinatra also do a good job on this. BTW, the best things is that both ruby and rails are open source, and the ruby community is awesome and very active.
