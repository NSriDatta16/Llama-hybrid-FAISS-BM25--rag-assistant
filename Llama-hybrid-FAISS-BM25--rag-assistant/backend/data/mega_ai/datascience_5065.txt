Data Scientists code every day. However, just because you don't have background doesn't mean you can't pick it up! The level of programming you need to know to start doing Data Science isn't very high, but you will at least need: the logical mindset to phrase the solution to your problem in procedural code to know the programming language, functions, and libraries needed in this field. 1st point is the most difficult of the two. Hopefully, you have taken enough math and physics by now to wire your mind to think programmatically. If so then yes, you absolutely can learn a language! There are guides out there that teach out the syntax and functions. For example: R - Pluralsight General Python - http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python DataSci Python - https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic-gettingStarted/details/getting-started-with-python Personally, I would recommend Python first. To me the language places more emphasis on readability and cleanliness, making it a great first language. It's also a general-purpose language so it's good to know. I did start with R though and it's also good but is more function-over-form IMO. Try both out and see which feels best first, since you'll likely have to pick up both if you delve into this field anyway.
