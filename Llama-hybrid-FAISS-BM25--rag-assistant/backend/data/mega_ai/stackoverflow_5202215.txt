Instead of using URLConnection in java, if you use HttpURLConnection you should beable to access the requested web page from java. Try the following code: HttpURLConnection httpcon = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection(); httpcon.addRequestProperty("User-Agent", "Mozilla/4.76"); Normal java using urlConnection wont be accepted to access the internet. To access the browser it will need to perform a search without theexception HTTP response code : 403 for URL EDIT (@Mordechai): No need to do the casting, just add the user agent.
