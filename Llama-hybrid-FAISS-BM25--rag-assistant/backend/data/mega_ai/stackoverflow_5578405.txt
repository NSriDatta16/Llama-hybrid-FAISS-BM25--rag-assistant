Cannot save metaboxes position in a WordPress plugin

I'm developing a WordPress plugin that presents a kind of dashboard, full of custom metaboxes. I was able to get the open/hide/close and drag handles working properly; however these screen customization are not saved: when I reload the page, everything goes to default config (actually, all metaboxes opened and sorted following the add_meta_box order in code). I added this nonce code to my admin page, but nothing changes: Did I perhaps forgot something else?
