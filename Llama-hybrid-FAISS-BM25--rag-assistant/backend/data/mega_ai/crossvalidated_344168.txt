OLS difference between individual level and aggregate level estimates

I am new here, so please accept my apologies if this does not belong here. My question essentially concerns what appears to me a special case of the ecological fallacy. Consider a simple model that could be estimated via OLS: $$ y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \epsilon_i $$ Now imagine, I were to have a further variable that partitions my observations into $M$ groups. Assume for simplicity that each group has the same size. For each group $m$, I now take the averages of $x$ and $y$, i.e $\bar{x}_m$ and $\bar{y}_m$. I then run the regression: $$ \bar{y}_m = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 \bar{x}_m + \epsilon_m $$ Here is my question: Under what conditions do the estimates of $\alpha_1$ and $\beta_1$ differ? Many thanks for your help!
