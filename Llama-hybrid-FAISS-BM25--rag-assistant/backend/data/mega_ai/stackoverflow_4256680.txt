Click hyperlink in jtable?

How can I enable hyperlink for every record in the JTable ? What I want to do is such that a user can click on the hyperlink which will then display the information they can edit/update. Alternatively how can I enable in place editing of the table data? Another question is i am currently using the following way to display different screen. But this is not an elegant way i understand we should use cardlayout but how exactly to go about it? mainPanel.setVisible(false); createBlogEntryPanel.setVisible(true); setComponent(createBlogEntryPanel);
