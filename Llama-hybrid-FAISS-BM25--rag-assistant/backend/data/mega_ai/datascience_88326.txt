How to access GPT-3, BERT or alike?

I am interested in accessing NLP models mentioned in scientific papers, to replicate some results and experiment. But I only see waiting lists https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/ and licenses granted in large commercial deals https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21451283/microsoft-openai-gpt-3-exclusive-license-ai-language-research . How can a researcher not affiliated to a university or (large) tech company obtain access so to replicate experiments of scientific papers ? Which alternatives would you suggest to leverage on pre-trained data sets ?
