My guess is the issue is a combination of whiten=True and the largest value equal to the largest possible value of a float64 . From scikit-learn's PCA docs : When True (False by default) the components_ vectors are multiplied by the square root of n_samplesâ€¦ That creates an overflow issue which results in the ValueError exception.
