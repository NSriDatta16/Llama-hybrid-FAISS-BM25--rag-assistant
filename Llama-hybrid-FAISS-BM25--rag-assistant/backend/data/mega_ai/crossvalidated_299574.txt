How to untransform/interpret results after a Lambert W transformation?

Suppose I have some heavy-tailed data that I want to transform so it's roughly normal in order to perform a t-test. Shapiro-Wilk normality test data: NAPChange W = 0.72716, p-value Then, I use the LambertW R package to transform the data so that it is closer to a normal distribution (as per this post ): mod.Lh |t|) mu 0.0057600 0.0028504 2.0208 0.0433 * sigma 0.0383100 0.0031284 12.2459 Now that the data is roughly normal, I can finally perform a t-test. HOWEVER, how can I interpret/quantify the results after such a transformation? Is there a way to revert the results to their original form (i.e. untransform results)?
