If you want the ability to query historical data easily then I would duplicate. Either copy via a trigger to a historical table or if the system has downtime create a table with an ID and timestamped unique constraint and during that down time using a scheduled batch process to move old data out. This older data would live elsewhere, could be compressed, and/or moved off the main disk to tape backup for instance. On the other hand, as you suggest in your question, you could go down the road of individually versioning each field - and only those that changed - which would require less storage, but reconstructing the data at a given point then in time is more involved to the point I would probably would not use SQL, but instead rely in a programming language.
