Logistic Regression with Tensorflow

Is this the correct Estimator for Logistic Regression in TF 1.10? There used to be a function called: LogisticRegressor which is deprecated In README.md file it says: LogisticRegressor: Not supported. Instead, use binary_classification_head with a custom model_fn, or with DNNEstimator When I look into documentation in tensorflow.org I see an example on Census data : "We will train a logistic regression model that, given an individual's information, outputs a number between 0 and 1â€”this can be interpreted as the probability that the individual has an annual income of over 50,000 dollars." Which is using: model = tf.estimator.LinearClassifier( model_dir=tempfile.mkdtemp(), feature_columns=base_columns + crossed_columns, optimizer=tf.train.FtrlOptimizer(learning_rate=0.1)) Questions: 1) Is there any sample with Logistic Regression for new TF estimator API. 2) Which one would be a good dataset to do Logistic Regression?
