Link to sql works with stored procedures and the designer will auto create a class for the return type. You could use dynamic sql in your sp and return linq to sql classes. You could create a stored procedure like below: CREATE PROCEDURE spGetFiles ( @TableName ) AS EXEC('SELECT * FROM " + @TableName) Then in the Visual Studio O/R designer, select the SP from the server explorer and drag it into the designer window in the same way that you add tables. A method with the same name as your SP will be created on your data context class and a class called something like spGetFilesReturnType will be created (i may have got this naming slightly wrong but you get the idea). You then just call the datacontext method with the table name as a string parameter and collections of spGetFilesReturnType objects will be returned.
