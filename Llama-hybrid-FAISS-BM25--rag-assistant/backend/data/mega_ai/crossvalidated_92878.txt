Binary logistic regression

im new to binary logistic regression. I don't know whether the test is giving me real results based on my data set. My dependent variable will be the presence of STEC in fecal samples (Presence= Yes, Absence = No) . I have 9 independent variables: Season: Winter = 0, summer = 1 Geographic location: Urban = 0, rural = 1 Production systems: Backyard/extensive = 0, Intensive/semi-intensive = 1 Age: 12 months = 1 lactation: dry cow = 0, lactating cow = 1 Antibiotics treatment: No= 0, Yes = 1 Parity number: no parity= 0, parity number >1 = 1 Feed: Forages = 0, others = 1 Health status: Disease = 0, healthy = 1 Is it possible to include all these predictors? should I use blocks? im a bit confused Can you help me please?
