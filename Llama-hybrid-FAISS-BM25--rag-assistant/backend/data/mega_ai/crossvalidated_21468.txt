A few things that might help (a bit). You could calculate the coefficient of variation for each attribute. This would allow you to at least quantify what you are saying when you say (for example) "the error in Attribute B is higher than the error of the other attributes". You could use analysis of variance to quantify how much of the variation is between attributes, and how much is between your two measuring systems. You could model the system2 measurements on the system1 measurements and hence get a quantification of the relationship between the two (crudely speaking, it would come up with something like "system 2 on average returns 10% higher estimates than system 1"). None of these completely fix your problem but they give you some different angles to look at it.
