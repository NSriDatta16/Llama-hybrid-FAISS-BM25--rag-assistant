Leverage browser caching with web.config in .net?

Some of sites are on shared hosting (Windows 2003 Server), so I have no way to access server configuration. I read everywhere about leverage browser caching, expecially for static files (jpg, css, js, etc.) but... how to do this in my case? The hosting has .NET installed, could a web.config file help in some way? If yes, how?
