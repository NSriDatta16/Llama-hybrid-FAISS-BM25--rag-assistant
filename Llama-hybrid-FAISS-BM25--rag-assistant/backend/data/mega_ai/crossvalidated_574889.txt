Theoretically, no. You can see this in terms of smoothly adjusting $C$ - at some point $x_i$ may be on the margin but with $\alpha_i = 0$ . Practically, yes. In particular, note that stopping conditions for the optimization allow for some $\epsilon$ , generally in terms of the objective, so you could certainly have a "small enough" value for $\alpha_i$ for these points. Practically speaking though, when you actually solve the optimization problem, you will see that not all non-bound SVs ( $0 ) actually aren't classified as $\pm 1$ , but rather are close to this value. This is why e.g., libSVM calculates the bias term, $b$ , by averaging over the classification values for these points (see e.g. 4.1.5 in the libSVM paper )
