Detecting drag drop to HTML textbox?

I have a normal search box on my webpage. It is filled with text: Search this website This text is removed when you click into the box to type your search query: onfocus="if(this.value=='Search this website') { this.value=''}; But how can I detect when someone drags text from the page onto the search box, as I often do myself? onfocus is not triggered and the previous text remains.
