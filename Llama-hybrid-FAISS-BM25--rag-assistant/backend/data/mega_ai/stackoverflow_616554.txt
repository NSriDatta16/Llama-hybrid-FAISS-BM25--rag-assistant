Is reflection really THAT slow that I shouldn't use it when it makes sense to?

Possible Duplicate: How costly is .NET reflection? The "elegant" solution to a problem I am having is to use attributes to associate a class and its properties with another's. The problem is, to convert it to the other, I'd have to use reflection. I am considering it for a server-side app that will be hosted on the cloud. I've heard many rumblings of "reflection is slow, don't use it," how slow is slow? Is it so CPU intensive that it'll multiply my CPU time so much that I'll literally be paying for my decision to use reflection at the bottom of my architecture on the cloud?
