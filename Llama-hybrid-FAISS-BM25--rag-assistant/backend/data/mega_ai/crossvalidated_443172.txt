What is Time Lag in Recurrent Neural Network? Why is it a Problem?

I was reading a paper on LSTM's and this term "time lag" is coming quite frequently, but there is no any definition of it mentioned anywhere in the paper. It also states that LSTM really helps to solve long time lag problems. So, what does this time lag term mean? And why is it a problem in RNNs?Thanks! Link to the paper : LSTM paper
