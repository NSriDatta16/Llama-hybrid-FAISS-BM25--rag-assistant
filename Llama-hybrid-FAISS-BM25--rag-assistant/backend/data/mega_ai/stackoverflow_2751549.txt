C++: GUI libraries for embedding into an interpreter

I've got my interpreter up and running - quite bug-free and stable for now - now I want to add some visual options to my language to play around. What is a good GUI library easy to use and mainly easy to embed and "link" to my programming language? What general rules do I have to follow? I'm currently on XP with Microsoft Visual Studio 2010.
