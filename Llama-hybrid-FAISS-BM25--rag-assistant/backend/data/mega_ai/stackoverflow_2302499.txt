I suggest you take a look at the Fortress Programming Language . This is an actual programming language, and not pseudocode, but it was designed to be as close to executable pseudocode as possible. In particular, for designing the syntax, they read and analyzed hundreds of CS and math papers, courses, books and journals to find common usage patterns for pseudocode and other computational/mathematical notations. You can leverage all that research by just looking at Fortress source code and abstracting out the things you don't need, since your target audience is human, whereas Fortress's is a compiler. Here is an actual example of running Fortress code from the NAS (NASA Advanced Supercomputing) Conjugate Gradient Parallel Benchmark . For a fun experience, compare the specification of the benchmark with the implementation in Fortress and notice how there is almost a 1:1 correspondence. Also compare the implementation in a couple of other languages, like C or Fortran, and notice how they have absolutely nothing to do with the specification (and are also often an order of magnitude longer than the spec). I must stress: this is not pseudocode, this is actual working Fortress code!
