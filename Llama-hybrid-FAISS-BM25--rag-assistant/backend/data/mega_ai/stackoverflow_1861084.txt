The bad news is that the accordion plugin is currently broken (as of 1.7.2, which you can see from ticket #4653 ). The good news is that it's fixed, and you can already grab the latest version here - but beware, it isn't a stable release yet! If you use the 1.8.1 code, the navigation feature works again. Setting navigation: true will direct accordion to automatically open the correct panel when you browse to a url that matches your navigation fragment (so that your example would work: services.html#branding ). I think you also want to add the missing identifier to your branding anchor tag, like this: Branding Finally, you may want to use the technique described here to update your page's url to reflect which accordion panel has been clicked without reloading your page.
