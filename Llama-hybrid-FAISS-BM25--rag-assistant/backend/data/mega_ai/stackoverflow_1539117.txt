Coloring of User Types in Visual Studio 2008 and the future 2010

I really have an issue with Visual Studio's support for coloring User Types in VB.NET, I'm an C# developer that have been forced to code in Vb.NET by political rules in my organization, and I really misses the support for coloring user types in Vb.NET, I had hoped that this would be solved in Visual Studio 2010 and well in the beta they have added Vb.NET User Type coloring, but the coloring is the same for all user types I cant't have one color for interfaces and one for classes and so on. Are there anyone that know any addin that can solve this for me nicely because it seems that Microsoft aren't helping me here :P.
