I think you're best bet would be to start with a rigid A.I. algorithm i.e. an opponent that always does the same thing in a given situation. To have true "A.I." You would need implement a machine learning algorithm that keeps track of previous inputs and if it was the right decision, so that it can get better. This is done with something along the lines of a Neural Network .
