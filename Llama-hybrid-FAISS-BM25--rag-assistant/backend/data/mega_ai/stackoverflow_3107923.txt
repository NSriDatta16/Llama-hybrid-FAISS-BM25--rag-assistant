problem installing adhoc app with itunes 9.2

I just installed itunes 9.2. Then tried doing something I've done thousands of times before: installing an add hoc build. I deleted the old version of the app and dragged the new version onto the app section of itunes. I get a message that the profile with the same name already exists (I select replace). Nothing happens- the app is not installed and does not show up in the app list. Any ideas? The only difference is iTunes 9.2
