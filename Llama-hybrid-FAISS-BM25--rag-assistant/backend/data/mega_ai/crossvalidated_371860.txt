Prove that given kernel is valid and find the relevant mapping

Understanding Machine Learning: From Theory to Algorithms , Section 16.6, Question 4 is For $x>z$ , I formulate my kernel matrix as $K = [x \quad z;z \quad z]$ which gives the cofactors as $x, z(x-z) > 0$ and thus positive definite. I apply a similar rationale for the $x case. I'm struggling with finding the mapping $\psi$ . Any pointers on how to go about it?
