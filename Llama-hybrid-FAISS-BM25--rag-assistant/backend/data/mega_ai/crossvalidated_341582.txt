When explaining to beginners I think it helps to take a specific example... Imagine you've got a random sample of 9 measurements from some population. The mean of the sample is 60. Can we be sure that the average of the whole population is also 60? Obviously not because small samples will vary, so the estimate of 60 is likely to be inaccurate. To find out how much samples like this will vary, we can run some experiments - using a method called bootstrapping. The first number in the sample is 74 and the second is 65, so let's imagine a big "pretend" population comprising one ninth 74's, one ninth 65's, and so on. The easiest way to take a random sample from this population is to take a number at random from the sample of nine, then replace it so you have the original sample of nine again and choose another one at random, and so on until you have a "resample" of 9. When I did this, 74 did not appear at all but some of the other numbers appeared twice, and the mean was 54.4. (This is set up on the spreadsheet at http://woodm.myweb.port.ac.uk/SL/resample.xlsx - click on the bootstrap tab at the bottom of the screen.) When I took 1000 resamples in this way their means varied from 44 to 80, with 95% between 48 and 72. Which suggests that there is an error of up to 16-20 units (44 is 16 below the pretend population mean of 60, 80 is 20 units above) in using samples of size 9 to estimate the population mean. and that we can be 95% confident that the error will be 12 or less. So we can be 95% confident that the population mean will be somewhere between 48 and 72. There are a number of assumptions glossed over here, the obvious one being the assumption that the sample gives a useful picture of the population - experience shows this generally works well provided the sample is reasonably large (9 is a bit small but makes it easier to see what's going on). The spreadsheet at http://woodm.myweb.port.ac.uk/SL/resample.xlsx enables you to see individual resamples, plot histograms of 1000 resamples, experiment with larger samples, etc. There's a more detailed explanation in the article at https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.06214 .
