Stepwise Logistic regression - drop variables / transform variables

I have two questions I hope you could help me with. I am doing a stepwise logistic regression. I have a variable that includes information other variables include already. For example "price_missing" ($1$ means price missing) and "price" ($0$ means price). Would it be a normal process to drop these variables before doing a regression? It seems to make the model worse. Some of the data is skewed. Would it make sense to do a transformation of the variable before doing a stepwise logit regression?
