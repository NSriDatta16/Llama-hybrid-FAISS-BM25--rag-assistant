Mean # tosses to reject null hypothesis

If I keep flipping a biased coin, my confidence that the coin is not fair will build (on average) with each toss. If I continue this process indefinitely, I will end up concluding that the coin is not fair. (i.e. reject the null $H_0:(p=0.5$), at a 1% sig level) What is an appropriate test to use that describes this process? (namely, a process where my confidence in the null changes over time). I do not know how biased it is, so I can't just decide in advance that eg 30 trials is enough. (And if such a test exists, could we compute the mean number of trials needed, to reject at 5% sig?)
