There's nothing wrong with the code... except that it was invalid. You had a incorrectly closed tag, and other oddities inside the code that once cleaned up resolved the problem. I think. Unless it isn't what you was asking about. HTML: Untitled Document One Two Three Four CSS: body { font-size: 12px; } li{ border:1px solid #444444; background-color:#AAAAAA; padding:10px; margin:10px; } jQuery: $("#k1").sortable({ revert: '100' }); $('.gt').draggable({ connectToSortable: '#k1', revert: 'invalid', revertDuration: 100 }); Edit : Sorry, I misread the question. The code was slightly confusing, and I missed the problem. The solution is a little bit of a kludge, but I think it will work. var original = $('#k1'); original.sortable({ revert: 100 }); $('.gt').draggable({ connectToSortable: original, revert: 'valid', revertDuration: 100, stop: function(event, ui) { original.sortable("option", "revert", 100); } }); Basically it re-set the revert option on the k1 div after .gt is dropped.
