Text wrapping around an image (or any element)

Is there a way with CSS to wrap text on both sides of an element (an image for example). I am trying to have an image positioned in the middle of a paragraph and would like text to flow over it. Please see the image for an example. Positioning an element typically takes it out of the document flow; so that doesn't work.
