Deep Learning approach for Signature extraction from emails

Deep Learning (DL) is now days are used in various fields. I may like to know any idea/approach on usin DL for Signature extraction from emails. There are some papers which uses ML like http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/jietang/publications/f142-tang.pdf http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~vitor/papers/sigFilePaper_finalversion.pdf there are few more . There are some open source libraries in Python like talon which uses NLP (Regular expressions and other techniques) and uses ML algorithms ( SVM ) for the same. I have done a little research but I am not getting any resource or any idea on how to proceed with DL for this task. I thought of using seq2seq models but I am not sure it can be of much help for this task. I am not sure whether summarization techniques can be useful. Any idea or resources for the same can be helpful.
