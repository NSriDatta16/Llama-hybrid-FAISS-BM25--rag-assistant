We do that. That's because we support scenarios where users connect to the db using programs other than the intended software (like, SQL Management studio, osql and Excel). When you directly connect to a database which is no more than data storage, you can mess everything up as there's no rules that would stop you. These rules only exist inside the program that uses this database, and if you don't use that program, you can use you I-can-write-to-this-table permissions to do stupid (or fun) things. When you only have permissions to execute stored procedures, you can't. I personally think it's a better approach.
