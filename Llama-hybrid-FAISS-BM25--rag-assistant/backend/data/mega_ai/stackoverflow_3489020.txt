Usually your model is 'dumb' in that it doesn't contain any logic, just properties and state. So the unit tests are centered around testing your repository and services which interact and use the domain objects and (if you use them) summary model objects. You can also test the controllers which call these services for complete coverage. It all depends on how much of the project you would like to see tested. Testing the views is slightly harder, for .NET web-based projects you can use frameworks like Selenium and Watin which integrate into unit testing frameworks.
