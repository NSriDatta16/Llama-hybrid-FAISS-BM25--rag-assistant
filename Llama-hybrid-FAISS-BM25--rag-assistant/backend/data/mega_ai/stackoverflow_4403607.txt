Byron, I feel your pain. I struggled with an upgrade from 1.3 to 1.4 a month ago. Try the technique mentioned here: http://www.webshopapps.com/blog/2010/02/upgrading-magento-to-version-1-4-keeping-it-simple/ In the end it worked for me. The thing that is sort of counter intuitive is the deletion of the database . I kept trying to skip that step, and that's what stymied me for a while. You have to delete the database and reload the data (it does something to the key constraints). In the end I was able to upgrade to 1.4 without manually moving anything.
