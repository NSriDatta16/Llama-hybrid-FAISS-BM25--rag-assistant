When do coefficients estimated by logistic and logit-linear regression differ?

When modelling continuous proportions (e.g. proportional vegetation cover at survey quadrats, or proportion of time engaged in an activity), logistic regression is considered inappropriate (e.g. Warton & Hui (2011) The arcsine is asinine: the analysis of proportions in ecology ). Rather, OLS regression after logit-transforming the proportions, or perhaps beta regression, are more appropriate. Under what conditions do the coefficient estimates of logit-linear regression and logistic regression differ when using R's lm and glm ? Take the following simulated dataset, where we can assume that p are our raw data (i.e. continuous proportions, rather than representing ${n_{successes}\over n_{trials}}$): set.seed(1) x Fitting a logit-linear model, we obtain: summary(lm(logit.p ~ x)) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = logit.p ~ x) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -0.64702 -0.13747 -0.00345 0.15077 0.73148 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) ## (Intercept) 0.868148 0.006579 131.9 Logistic regression yields: summary(glm(p ~ x, family=binomial)) ## ## Call: ## glm(formula = p ~ x, family = binomial) ## ## Deviance Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -0.32099 -0.05475 0.00066 0.05948 0.36307 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) ## (Intercept) 0.86242 0.07684 11.22 Will the logistic regression coefficient estimates always be unbiased with respect to the logit-linear model's estimates?
