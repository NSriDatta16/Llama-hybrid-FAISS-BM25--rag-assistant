You can do this, waaay to easier to what you are currently doing. For the data scraping, use whatever makes you happy. In my case I will use Uipath or just python, depending on the complexity. But this is up to you, you just want some dataset in a format that suits you. Once you have your data, you want to visualize that. This is a classical data science task. I am from the python army so I will suggest going to python. If you are good with Java the transition will be like slicing hot butter. There are some good libraries that will help you greatly. Here I suggest some packages that I have used in the past and they will help you greatly. Folium Geoplot Intro to folium (again) In my case, I will probably stick to Foliumm since there is plenty of code to re-use on the internet and it is a piece of cake. This is my personal opinion on what I will do. There might be other tools and languages...
