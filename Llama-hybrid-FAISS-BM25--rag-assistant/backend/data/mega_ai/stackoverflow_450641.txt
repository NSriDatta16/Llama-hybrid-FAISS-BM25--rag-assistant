Your query looks fine. Is there a chance that something else has a lock on a record that you need? Are the tables especially big? I doubt that data is the problem as there are not that many hotels... I've run in to similar issues with MySQL. After spending over a year tuning, patching, and thinking I'm a SQL dummy, I switched to SQL Server Express. The exact same queries with the exact same data would run 2-5 orders of magnitude faster in SQL Server Express. MySQL seemed to have an especially difficult time with moderately complex queries (5+ tables). I think the MySQL optimizer became retarded after SUN bought the organization...
