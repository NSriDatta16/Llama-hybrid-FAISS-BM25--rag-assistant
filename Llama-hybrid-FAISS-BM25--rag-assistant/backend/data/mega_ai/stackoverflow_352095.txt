A few years are I was working with another student on our placement year. We worked for a very large manufacturing company. One of his projects was to create a classic VB app to interface with multiple cameras on a production line and analyse the data in real time. In classic VB this was a shambles - it took on average 1.5 minutes to process a single frame from a single camera (7 cameras at 24 fps) there was no that he could optimise it. He eventually took the plunge in to Delphi and re-written that app and works fantastically. I've recently been in contact with a few friends who still work there and his app is been running smoothly for 3 years now.
