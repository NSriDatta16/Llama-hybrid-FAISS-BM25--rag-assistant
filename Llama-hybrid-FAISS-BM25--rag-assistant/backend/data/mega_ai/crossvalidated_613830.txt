Why is the quotient distribution of two probability distributions angular?

Background I am working with posterior probability distributions for parameters obtained from a Bayesian binomial generalised linear model with a logit link function. The parameters returned by the model are the log-odds intercept ( a ) and slope ( b , also known as the logistic rate k ). The logistic equation for these models can thus be written as $f(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{kx + a}}$ or $f(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{k(x + µ)}}$ where µ = $\frac{a}{k}$ is the inflection point of the sigmoid. I prefer the second form because µ is often more meaningful than a . Specific problem Rather than just working with central tendencies, I would like to estimate the entire probability distribution of µ to calculate probability intervals etc. I tried doing this by dividing the posterior a by the posterior k . However, the result is a strange angular distribution, the mean of which is not at all similar to the quotient of the means of a and k . Here is a MRE in R: a I know for a fact that the mean of µ estimated as the quotient of the means of a and k is correct while the mean of µ estimated as the mean of the quotient of a and k is incorrect, since inserting the former into $f(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{k(x + µ)}}$ corresponds with the model prediction in probability space ( p ) derived from the posteriors a and k . Question Why is the quotient of two posteriors angular and leads to wrong inference? How can the mean of a quotient distribution be different to the quotient of the means of the dividend and divisor distributions? Would specifying µ rather than a as a parameter in the model make any difference?
