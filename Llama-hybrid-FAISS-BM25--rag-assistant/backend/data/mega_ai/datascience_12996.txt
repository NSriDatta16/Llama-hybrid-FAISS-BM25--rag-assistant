Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs) are: Connectionist: RBMs are PGMs and neural networks ( source ) Bayesian: Bayes Networks are bayesian ( Wikipedia article ) Symbolist: Markov Logic Networks ( source ) Analogizers and Evolutionaries: According to Domingos , they are also in Markov Logic Networks. So the answer is that you can't simply categorize such a general technique as probabilistic graphical models in a single one of those categories.
