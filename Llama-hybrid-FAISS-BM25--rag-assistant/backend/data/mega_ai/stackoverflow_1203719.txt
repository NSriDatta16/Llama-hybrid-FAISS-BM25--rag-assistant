Membership products data schema

I'm trying to model my organization's membership products for accepting and recording membership purchases in our business database. Someday we hope the purchases will be made online and automatically put into the business database. The problem is that our membership products are all over the place. We have 4 types of organizations that can join our organization. There is a separate price schedule for each organization type. Attributes of the organization determine the price they will pay from the schedule (if their revenue is between $2mil and $5mil they pay $2000, for example). The attributes that are used in each price schedule are different. For example, businesses pay according to their annual revenue while schools pay according to their full-time equivalent student enrollment - which we calculate by having school members provide us their full-time and part-time student enrollment #s). To make it more complicated, there are discount programs (for example, 15 months for the price of 12 for early renewals, discount for under-resourced schools, etc...). Then, members have the option to buy multiple terms at a time and we sometimes allow people to buy pro-rated partial terms (month is the smallest unit.) And then on top of that, I'm now supposed to make the product and transaction data schema generic enough that it can be the data source of record for all purchases - for example, event registrations and program enrollments in addition to membership purchases. Help!! I've been told this is standard commerce data schema stuff, but every sample data schema I've been able to find on line couldn't do the above, at least as far as I can tell. Has anybody seen a schema that could do this sort of thing? If you have, could you share it with me? Any other leads would be greatly appreciated as well. Thanks!
