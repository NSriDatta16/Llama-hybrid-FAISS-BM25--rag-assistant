Parameters are not random variables but fixed unknowns (at least in the likelihood approach to inference) calibrating the distribution of the observables/observations. Outside a Bayesian setup , it is thus incorrect to talk of a probability distribution on the parameters. The MLE is the numerical value of the parameters that makes the actual observations the most likely to have occurred $$p(x|\hat\theta) = \max_\theta p(x|\theta)$$ The quantity $p(x|θ)$ in the above thus reads as the probability of observing the realisation $x$ of the random variable $X$ when the parameter value (indexing its distribution) is equal to $θ$ in a discrete setting and the density of $X$ at the value $x$ when the parameter value is equal to $θ$ in a continuous setting. (I would even avoid the term given since this could be interpreted as a conditional probability or density, which does not make sense if $\theta$ is not a random variable, i.e., outside a Bayesian framework .) To quote the very originator of the notion of likelihood , R.A. Fisher in ‘On the mathematical foundations of theoretical statistics’ (1922): I suggest that we may speak without confusion of the likelihood of one value of p being thrice the likelihood of another (…) likelihood is not here used loosely as a synonym of probability, but simply to express the relative frequencies with which such values of the hypothetical quantity p would in fact yield the observed sample. Note the stress made in the discussed Wikipedia page The fact that the likelihood function can be defined in a way that includes contributions that are not commensurate (the density and the probability mass) arises from the way in which the likelihood function is defined up to a constant of proportionality, where this "constant" can change with the observation $x$ , but not with the parameter $\theta$ . which reinforces the point that the likelihood function is not a probability density function (for its argument $\theta$ ) and can take numerical values above $1$ (or any other bound).
