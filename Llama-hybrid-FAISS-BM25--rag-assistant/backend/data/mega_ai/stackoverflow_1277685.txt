organize project and specify directory for object files in Makefile

Here are my two questions: I am now learning to manage my code with CVS, and I just want to make a repository for my C++ files, Makefile and bash and python scripts only, not the object files and executables. So I made several subdirectories under my project directory: src, bin, scripts, results and data. I put C++ files and Makefile under ~/myproject/src, Bash and Python scripts under ~/myproject/scripts and object and executables under ~/myproject/bin. I am hoping only the files under src and scripts will be updated via CVS. I wonder how you organize your projects? Just hope to follow some good habits. Since I put my C++ files and Makefile into ~/myproject/src and object and executable files into ~/myproject/bin, I have to specify the directories in Makefile. Here is what I am doing Makefile: ... BIN_DIR=/home/myproject/bin/ all: $(BIN_DIR)myexecutable TAGS TAGS: *.cc *.h etags --members --declarations -l c++ *.cc *.h $(BIN_DIR)myexecutable: $(BIN_DIR)myobject.o $(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) -o $@ $^ $(LDFLAGS) Makefile.depend: *.h *.cc Makefile $(CXX) -M $(CXXFLAGS) *.cc > Makefile.depend clean: \rm -f $(BIN_DIR)myexecutable $(BIN_DIR)*.o Makefile.depend TAGS` However this will give error make: *** No rule to make target /home/myproject/bin/myobject.o', needed by /home/myproject/bin/myexecutable'. How to specify a different directory for object and executable files from C++ files in Makefile?
