SQL Server and Oracle joins tutorials

Question 1: I am learning SQL Server and Oracle joins (inner joins, outer joins...) and case statements syntax. Though I can google for the info, but would like to ask for some sites, links, and materials that fully explain the joins and case statments. Question 2: I am running a simple statment below which gives the output as follow: select '''' + name + '''' + ',' as Emp_Names from dbo.employee Emp_Names 'Jason', 'Robert', 'Celia', 'Linda', 'David', 'James', 'Alison', 'Chris', 'Mary', Is there a way in SQL that can show my desired output as: Emp_Names 'Jason', 'Robert','Celia','Linda','David','James','Alison','Chris','Mary', i can press a Delete and End together to get there but only for a handful records but not for a hundred records...
