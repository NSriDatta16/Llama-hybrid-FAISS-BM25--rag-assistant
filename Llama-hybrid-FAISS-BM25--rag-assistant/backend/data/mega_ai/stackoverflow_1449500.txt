Get Daylight Saving Transition Dates For Time Zones in Java

I'd like to know the simplest way, in Java, to get a list of dates in the future where daylight savings time will change. One rather inellegant way to do this would be to simply iterate over a bunch of years' worth of days, testing them against TimeZone.inDaylightTime(). This will work, and I'm not worried about efficiency since this will only need to run every time my app starts, but I wonder if there's a simpler way. If you're wondering why I'm doing this, it's because I have a javascript app which needs to handle third-party data containing UTC timestamps. I want a reliable way to translate from GMT to EST on the client side. See Javascript -- Unix Time to Specific Time Zone I've written some javascript which will do it, but I want to get precise transition dates from the server.
