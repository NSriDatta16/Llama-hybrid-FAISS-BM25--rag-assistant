Comparing estimators in Cauchy distribution

Given $n$ observations with a Cauchy distribution (location=t,scale=1), I would like to compare estimators such as the mean and median by simulating sample means and mean square errors. This is an exercise given by my book. The exercise says I may assume t=0. Why is this? I thought I would try $n=10$ first so I typed in x=rcauchy(10,location=0,scale=1) and then median(x). Is this the right way to go about it? Also, what is the code for mean square error and coverage probabilities? Note: Advised to come here from Stack Overflow.
