A Rating Formula that Combines Two Metrics

If I have two metrics, - number of reviews and the rating out of 5, and I want to combine them into a single meaningful rating that can rank a list, how can I do that? For example, let's say I have the following: BeachName-#Reviews-Rating Pantai Kaneko Beach-10-4.9 (meaning 10 reviews with a rating of 4.9) Pantai Kelating Beach-517-4.4 Pantai Pusat Beach-913-4.5 Pantai Abian Kepas Beach-156-4.4 Pantai Antap Beach-177-4.6 Pantai Manyar Beach-141-4.3 Pantai Pernama Beach-840-4.3 Pantai Saba Beach-102-4.4 Pantai Masceti Beach-1155-4.4 Pantai Cucukan Beach-1-4 Emerald Dive Spot-2-5 USAT Liberty Shipwreck-896-4.7 Pantai Nusantara Beach-62-4.1 Menjangan Island-137-4.6 I don't have more than grade 5 maths. What Excel formula could I use to combine these two numbers to rank this list by popularity. I want to do more than say this beach has the most reviews....I would like to adjust that by the review out of five to try and get a better ranking.
