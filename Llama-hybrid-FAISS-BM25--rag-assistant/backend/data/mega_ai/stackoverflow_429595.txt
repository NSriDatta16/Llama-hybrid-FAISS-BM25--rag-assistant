Instead of catching NO_DATA_FOUND , how about SELECTing the number of matching entries into a variable, say l_count , and proceeding if this count works out to be zero? Something like the following: DECLARE l_selected APEX_APPLICATION_GLOBAL.VC_ARR2; l_count INTEGER; ...snip... BEGIN -- get the list ids l_selected := APEX_UTIL.STRING_TO_TABLE(:P4_SELECT_LIST); -- process each in a nice loop FOR i IN 1..l_selected.count LOOP -- do some data checking stuff... -- here we will count duplicate entries, so we can noop if duplicate is found SELECT COUNT(*) INTO l_count FROM org_county_accountable WHERE organization_id = :P4_ID AND county_id = v_county_id; IF l_count = 0 THEN -- here we have code we only want to execute if there are no dupes already -- if not a duplicate record, proceed... END IF; END LOOP; END;
