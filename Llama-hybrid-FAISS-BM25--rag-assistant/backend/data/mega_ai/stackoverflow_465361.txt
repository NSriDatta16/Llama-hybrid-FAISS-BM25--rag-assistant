I thought I could avoid it, but it seems I have to do something like this: from processing import connection connection.Listener.fileno = lambda self: self._listener._socket.fileno() import select l = connection.Listener('/tmp/x', 'AF_UNIX') r, w, e = select.select((l, ), (), ()) if l in r: print "Accepting..." c = l.accept() # ... I am aware that this breaks the law of demeter and introduces some evil monkey-patching, but it seems this would be the most easy-to-port way of accomplishing this. If anyone has a more elegant solution I would be happy to hear it :)
