The prediction at the average of the covariates is different from the average of the predictions

I read in Stata manual : "The prediction at the average of the covariates is different from the average of the predictions" after a logistic regression. If I compute predictions for a linear regression (with command Predict that uses own values of covariates for each individual) and I find the mean "a" of my predictors. Then I compute predictions in holding values of my covariates at their means and I find the mean "b" of my predictors. Have "a" and "b" the same value?
