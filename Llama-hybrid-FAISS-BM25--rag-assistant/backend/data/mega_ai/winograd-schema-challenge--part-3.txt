ing to learn commonsense reasoning. The general language model GPT-3 achieved a score of 88.3% without specific fine-tuning in 2020. A more challenging, adversarial "Winogrande" dataset of 44,000 problems was designed in 2019. This dataset consists of fill-in-the-blank style sentences, as opposed to the pronoun format of previous datasets. A version of the Winograd schema challenge is one part of the GLUE (General Language Understanding Evaluation) benchmark collection of challenges in automated natural-language understanding.
