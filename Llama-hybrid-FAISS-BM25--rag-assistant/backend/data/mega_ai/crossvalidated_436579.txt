On the one hand, you should not be deleting anything. Information is power. On the other hand, I am highly skeptical about your ability to perform missing data imputation for the missing river-days. It is not clear how different rivers are related, and missing data imputation adds value only if different variables (rivers) are highly co-dependent. What you can do, however, is writing a parametric model for all the rivers. In this model different rivers are allowed to be correlated, any particular river is described by, say, an ARIMA process with unique parameters. Then, you can estimate the model using the version of Full Information Maximum Likelihood (FIML) for time series. You would need to look up a standard reference on FIML and read it carefully. In a nutshell, FIML does the following. The log-likelihood function has only terms corresponding to non-missing values. All non-missing values are used in at least one term (of the log-likelihood). Suppose, in time series $X_j$ , values $X_j(t)$ and $X_j(t+3)$ are marked but values $X_j(t+1)$ and $X_j(t+2)$ are missing. Then the log-likelihood function contains term $$ ... + \log(f_{M,3}(X(t+3) | X(t))) + ... $$ where $f_{M,3}(X(t+3) | X(t))$ is the model-implied conditional density of $X_j(t+3)$ given $X_j(t)$ . You see that we are skipping missing cells $X_j(t+1)$ and $X_j(t+2)$ .
