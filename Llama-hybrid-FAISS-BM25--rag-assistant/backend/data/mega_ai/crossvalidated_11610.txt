I'm focussing on your second last para and the fact that you haven't taken a stats class, and assuming you're mainly interested in saying something about the average runtime of your code? The following is the simplest possible approach - I suspect that this is something you already know but it's not entirely clear to me from your post whether that's the case or not: Run the code $N$ times and average the runtimes over those $N$ runs. The Central Limit Theorem then implies that the sample mean you calculated came from a normal distribution (that is, unless the distribution of runtimes is rather strange then the sample means of collections of runtimes will be approximately normally distributed). From there you can use standard confidence bounds on normally distributed data to say the sort of things you'd like to about the runtime ( example ).
