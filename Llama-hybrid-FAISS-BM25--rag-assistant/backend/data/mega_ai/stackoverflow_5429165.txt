CSS Divs overlapping absolute

Here's my CSS: http://pastebin.com/UZdSssK8 Here's my HTML: http://pastebin.com/vJcB9nLu Whenever I drag my Firefox window down smaller, #centre starts overlapping with div.left. #centre should be slightly off centred to the left. I want it to be able to fluidly move, but never overlap ANY text on the left hand side. Thanks
