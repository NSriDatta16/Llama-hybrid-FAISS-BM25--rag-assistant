Should I use internal or public visibility by default?

I'm a pretty new C# and .NET developer. I recently created an MMC snapin using C# and was gratified by how easy it was to do, especially after hearing a lot of horror stories by some other developers in my organisation about how hard it is to do in C++. I pretty much went through the whole project at some point and made every instance of the "public" keyword to "internal", except as required by the runtime in order to run the snapin. What is your feeling on this, should you generally make classes and methods public or internal?
