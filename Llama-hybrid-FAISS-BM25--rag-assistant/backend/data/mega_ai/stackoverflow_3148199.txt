The question like this is too broad to answer meaningfully. Qt4 and JavaFX have different goals. Qt4 is for writing cross-platform desktop applications JavaFX is for writing rich Internet applications Qt4 allows for better desktop integration (drag&drop, playing nice with the configuration systems of different platforms, native look & feel, ...), so if you want a nice desktop app, use Qt4. OTOH, Qt4 cannot be used for an Internet application (web app), so if that's what you want, use JavaFX. JavaFX can also be used for desktop apps, but it requires more compromises than a dedicated desktop GUI toolkit like Qt4. So what are your requirements? Edit: Based on your comments: Standalone desktop apps are not JavaFX's main goal, but if it works for you, I see no reason to change it. You can write great applications using JavaFX, especially because you have access to all the stuff the JDK offers. As to system integration: While QT4 is better in this respect, Java already offers a lot (such as Swing an JDK 6's new system integration features). So if you don't intend to write something highly integrated (such as a Windows shell extension), JavaFx will be fine.
