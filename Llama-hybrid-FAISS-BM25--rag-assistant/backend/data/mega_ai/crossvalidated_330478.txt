The levels of the categorical predictor variable in this example are being evaluated as treatment contrasts, the default in R. Thus the "Intercept" is the value of lifeExpF for the reference level of Group , evidently oecd . The other coefficients represent the differences in lifeExpF from that reference level for the other 2 levels. You need to pay attention to how categorical variables are evaluated as not all statistical software may use the same defaults.
