How to compute effect sizes of single predictor in a logistical regression?

I have a logistic regression, with a binary response, a continuous predictor, and a categorical one. Is there any way to calculate the effect size of each of those predictors, similar to partial eta-squared in linear models? Here's an simulated example (in R): continuous = rnorm(1000, 0, 1) categorical = sample(c("A","B"), 1000, replace=TRUE) response = continuous + rnorm(1000, 0, 0.1) - ifelse(categorical=="A", -0.3, 0.3) > 0 library(car) model = glm(response ~ continuous + categorical, family=binomial) How would I get the effect size of continuous and categorical, individually? I saw that we can calculate odds ratio from the coefficients of a logistic equation, but I am not sure if they would be independent of each other as the partial eta squared.
