Although I think @DR's answer is spot-on, and @Ritsaert's is helpful, here's another option. Your label components will have a 'TAG' property - you can use this for your own purposes and in your case I'd just set the TAG property at the same time as you set the Caption. The advantage behind this is that you can format your caption to contain more than a simple number (if you wish), and also you are just summing up tags (which are already integers and don't need you to do the extra work behind a StrToIntDef call). Really, you're following @DR's point about keeping values out of the GUI (in a sense), you're using a storage field in each label instead. eg; when setting a score;- Label1.Caption:=Format('%d point',[FScore]); Label1.Tag:=FScore; and when summing them;- FSum:=Label1.Tag + Label2.Tag + Label3.Tag (etc)
