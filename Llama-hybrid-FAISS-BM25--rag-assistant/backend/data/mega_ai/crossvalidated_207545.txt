Naive question about Bayesian multivariate logistic regression

I am stuck on what's probably a trivial question. I am reading a paper about multivariate logistic regression , and they say: let y_i = (y_i1,...,y_ip) = vector of binary responses let X_i be a (p x q) matrix of predictors then (z_i1, ... ,z_ip)' ~ multivariate logistic(X_i * beta, E) I am stuck because I don't understand how to make the predictors into a matrix of these dimensions. For example, suppose p = 3 and q = 5. My data will look something like: (1 1 0) (1 1 1) .... and for each measurement I will have a row of 5 predictors, something like (X1 X2 X3 X4 X5). I don't understand how I can fashion this row into a 3 x 5 matrix. Could someone please help?
