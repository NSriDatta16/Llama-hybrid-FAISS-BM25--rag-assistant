InnoDB row size large as compared to MyIsam

I have a table with for columns, a smallint, an integer and two floats. Expected memory for each row is 14bytes (2+4+2*4). I have around 700,000 rows in my table. I've set no primary keys and indices. While the MyIsam type takes around 10MB (average of 15b for each row), the InnoDB type takes more than 30Mb (average of 44b). What am I missing here? Would InnoDB have so much of overhead for each row, or are the table status number not to be trusted. I need to store data which will run into GBs, so need to decide on the storage type by weighing different parameters.
