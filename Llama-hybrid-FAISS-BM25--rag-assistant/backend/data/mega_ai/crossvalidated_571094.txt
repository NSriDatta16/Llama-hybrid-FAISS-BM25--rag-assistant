Prediction interval: but instead, the probability that the next datum is above a fixed threshold?

I've been struggling with this problem, and I think I must be missing some important conceptual step. Imagine we observe $\theta_1 \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$ , with unknown $\mu$ and known $\sigma^2$ (for simplicity). We will draw a second datum, $\theta_2 \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$ (for now, unobserved). (Point of clarificationâ€” $\theta$ is just a random variable here, not a stand-in for the parameter $\mu$ , it might have been more clear if I wrote $X_1,X_2 \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$ .) It is straightforward to compute a "prediction interval" for $\theta_2$ . By definition, this is a frequentist procedure that guarantees that $\theta_2$ is captured by the interval the correct proportion of the time. Note that $\theta_2 - \theta_1 \sim N(0, 2\sigma^2)$ . Thus, $P(\theta_2 > \theta_1 - z_\alpha(\sqrt{2} \sigma) )= \alpha $ (where $z_\alpha$ is the z-score, e.g. $z_{.10} = 1.28$ gives a 90% one-sided prediction interval). (See Wikipedia for details). However, I am interested in a slightly different property. For some fixed threshold $T$ , I want to estimate the probability that $\theta_2 > T$ . That is, rather than a procedure that creates an interval with "90% coverage", I want a procedure that estimates the probability that the next datum will fall within a fixed interval, $\theta_2 \in [T, \infty]$ . Presumably, the "guarantee" I want is that the average probability of this estimate matches the true probability, $P(\theta_2 > T)$ . I'm stumped! Given that $\theta_2 - \theta_1 \sim N(0, 2\sigma^2)$ , my instinct is just to compute $P(Z > (T - \theta_1)/(\sqrt{2}\sigma))$ , where $Z \sim N(0,1)$ (i.e. just use the normal CDF). But under simulation, that isn't right. I assume the issue is that $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2 - \theta_1$ aren't independent? But it feels like this problem is doable, and I can't figure it out.
