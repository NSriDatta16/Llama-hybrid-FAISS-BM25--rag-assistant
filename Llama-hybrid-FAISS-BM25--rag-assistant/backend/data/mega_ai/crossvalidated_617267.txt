Precision matrix and conditional uncorrelatedness

Let $\mathbf{u}_t = (u_{1t},u_{2t},\ldots,u_{pt})^{\prime}$ be a $p \times 1$ (stationary) random vector, and let $\mathbf{\Sigma}_{u}$ be the covariance matrix of $\mathbf{u}_t$ . Further, denote the precision matrix $\boldsymbol{\Omega}_u=\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_u^{-1}$ . Then there is an interesting reslut linking the precision matrix $\boldsymbol{\Omega}_u$ and the conditional uncorrelatedness which may be stated in the following paragraph: ``the sparsity of $\boldsymbol{\Omega}_u=\left(\omega_{u, i j}\right)_{p \times p}$ encodes the conditional uncorrelatedness (or conditional independence in the case of Gaussian distribution) relationships between all variables in the $p$ dimensional vector $\mathbf{u}_t$ . More specifically, for $p$ nodes $U_1, \ldots, U_p$ , each corresponding to one element of $\mathbf{u}_t, U_i$ and $U_j$ are connected if and only if $\omega_{u, i j} \neq 0$ , meaning that $u_{i t}$ and $u_{j t}$ are uncorrelated conditioning on all the other dimensions $\left\{u_{k t}\right\}_{k \neq i, j}$ .'' My question is: is there a proof for this interesting result? I just verifed this when $p=3$ , but how about in a more general case?
