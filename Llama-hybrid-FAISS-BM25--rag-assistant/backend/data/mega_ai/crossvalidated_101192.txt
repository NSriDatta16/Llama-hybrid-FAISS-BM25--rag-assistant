Correlation in Time Series

I have two time series $P_i$ and $T_i$ where $i = 0...t$ Now the correlation between the time series ${\rm corr}(P,T)\sim.95$, but the correlation between the derivative of the time series ${\rm corr}(dP, dT)\sim.5$ where $dP = P_i - P_{i-1}$ for all $i$. I'm trying to interpret this but can't come up with any explanations. How can the time series be correlated but the running differences not be?
