To give you any specific advice, we'd need to see a specific query. In general, the rules are simple: Select only what you need (no extra columns, no extra rows), including when JOIN ing Create an INDEX on columns (or combinations of columns) that you're likely to use often, especially those you're using to filter results. Optimizing a specific query will often involve subtle changes to grouping, joins, conditions, fields, and ultimately every part of the query, but of course that sort of attention requires having a specific query to work with.
