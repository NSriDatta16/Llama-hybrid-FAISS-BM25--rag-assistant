You can write code to analyze this. But this is very much data specific. In some cases like k-mrans, you already get cluster averages. So you can easily compare the averages. If you don't have major correlations in your data, then histograms can be insightful. Make stacked histograms, colored per cluster, to see if there is a different distribution in each attribute. Etc. There are so many ways to do this, and they are not specific to clustering.
