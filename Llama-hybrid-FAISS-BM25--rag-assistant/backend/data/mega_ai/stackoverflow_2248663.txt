Share a LotusScript library between databases

Is it possible to create a LotusScript library in one database and then access it from another database? Without simply copying the library into each database that needs to use it. What I would like to achieve is a single location where I can update the library and not have to manually copy it over to each database that is using it. I can't use a design template as the databases that use this script library all use different design templates. I guess another solution would be to create an agent to copy the library out to all databases whenever it is updated. So if anyone has done anything like that before then I would also like to here about it.
