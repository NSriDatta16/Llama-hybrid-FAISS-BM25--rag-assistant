Using eigenvectors can be very insight-producing, but you have to compute eigenvectors of the right matrix. PCA is based on eigenvectors of the covariance matrix. Factor analysis is based on eigenvectors of the correlation matrix. I think it is likely that you want factor analysis. (consistent with previous responder advising you to use correlations) In either case, what you do with the eigenvectors and why are basically the same. A previous responder described that well, for PCA.
