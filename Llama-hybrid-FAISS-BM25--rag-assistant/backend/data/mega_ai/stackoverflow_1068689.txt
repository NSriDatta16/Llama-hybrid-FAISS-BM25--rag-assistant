More than one URIResolver on a TransformerFactory?

I have an XSLT Transformer in Java (actually its Apache FOP rendering to PDF) where I have already set a custom URIResolver (for 'servlet-context:' URIs). Now I need to use another URIResolver in addition (a CatalogResolver for caching DTDs). Do I need to write my own URIResolver now that calls either of the two or is there a better way to do this?
