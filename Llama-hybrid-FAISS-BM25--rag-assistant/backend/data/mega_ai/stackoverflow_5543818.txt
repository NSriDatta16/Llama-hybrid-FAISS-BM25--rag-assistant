I use Welford's Method , which gives more accurate results. This link points to John D. Cook's overview . Here's a paragraph from it that summarizes why it is a preferred approach: This better way of computing variance goes back to a 1962 paper by B. P. Welford and is presented in Donald Knuthâ€™s Art of Computer Programming, Vol 2, page 232, 3rd edition. Although this solution has been known for decades, not enough people know about it. Most people are probably unaware that computing sample variance can be difficult until the first time they compute a standard deviation and get an exception for taking the square root of a negative number.
