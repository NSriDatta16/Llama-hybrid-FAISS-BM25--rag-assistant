I'm not sure if explaining VAE on concrete examples is a good idea (can you do it with a deep net? the point of these models is to stack multiple layers so they would be able to approximate complex functions). That being said, there are simpler models that work in similar way that use variational inference - for example EM algorithm. Some concrete examples can be found in Variational Inference tutorial that was written by David Blei. You can go from this to VAE just like you'd go from linear regression to Multilayer Perceptron regressor. in EM there is a closed-form solution for what to do in next iteration (like closed-form solution for least squares linear regression) note that your update based on ELBO (a proxy for likelihood) can't be done in one step (similarly you can't get closed-form solution for MLP reg) and you need to fall back to gradient descent or similar algorithms.
