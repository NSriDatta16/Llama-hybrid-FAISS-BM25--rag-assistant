Ljung-Box always significant for ARIMA models - what now?

Sorry in advance if this is too basic of a question - I've been struggling with this data set for almost a month and feel like I'm going in circles, and the more I Google the more confused I get. I have a time series of hourly activity levels (mean of 7 persons) for a period of about 2 months (1704 observations). There is obviously a strong "seasonal" component (freq=24) to this time series, with activity showing regular fluctuations between night and day. I am ultimately hoping to compare my activity time series to three other time series of environmental variables, to see how weather, temperature, etc affect people's activity on an hourly scale, following the methods in this paper . I'm not planning on doing forecasting, just wanting to know if these explanatory variables are affecting activity, and if so, how. The paper linked above did their analysis in a few steps, if I understand correctly: Use stl to assess trend and seasonality. Fit time series to ARIMA model. Transform data into series of independent, identically distributed random variables Choose best-fitting model by AIC Use residuals for cross-correlating variables. Okay. Here are my questions: I can do step 1, but don't know how to relate that to step 2. Am I using the remainder from stl analysis for ARIMA modeling? If not, what's the point of step 1? I understand how to choose some candidate models for ARIMA based on ACF, PACF, and auto.arima. But I can't get past the diagnostics. My Ljung-Box values are ALWAYS significant for ALL lags. Okay, so that means my residuals are correlated (I think). And since I want to use the residuals for cross-correlation, I assume that's bad. But no matter which models I try (I've tried maybe 6-10, is that enough?) I can't get good Ljung-Box p-values. The best fitting ARIMA so far (by AIC) is (1,0,2)x(1,1,2)24. Does this mean my time series doesn't fit an ARIMA model? How can I get iid residuals if I can't even get it to fit a model? Arrrghh. So to be more succinct, my main question is: why do I always have these significant Ljung-Box values, and what can I do to fit a better model to get iid residuals?
