Last Observation Carried Forward (na.locf) on Panel (cross section) Time Series

Is there a way to use na.locf functions to fill in NA values in a cross section (panel) time series data. I have a panel dataset setup similarly to years of data, setup similarly to the following: library(zoo) #actual [r] code and data! library(plm) data(Produc) a The data has suppression (ie missing values not released by the government data agency) and I'd like to just pull next observations to fill in NA values. b[[2,4]] Using the na.locf function will fill the NA's but nothing will stop it from pulling data incorrectly to fill in a city's last year with the next city's first year data.I am beginning to think that I need to split the dataframe into individual city frames.
