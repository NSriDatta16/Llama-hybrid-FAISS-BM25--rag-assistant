if an RNN was trained on $y=10x^3+5x+1$ will it work with for example $y = 2x^3 + x -5$ as well?

If we trained an RNN type of neural network (RNN, LSTM, GRU, etc) on a set of datapoints that were generated for example from a function such as $y = 10x^3 + 5x + 1$ , and then tried to use datapoints generated from a similar function such as $y = 2x^3 + x - 5$ , would that still work? or are these considered to completely different functions? Should the multiplicants be the same everywhere?
