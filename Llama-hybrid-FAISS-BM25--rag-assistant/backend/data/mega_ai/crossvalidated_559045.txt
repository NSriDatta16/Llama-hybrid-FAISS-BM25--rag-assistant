Your idea does work. This can be viewed as a type of Monte Carlo simulation where you randomly pick a set of points from the target distribution and regress to them, and you get a distribution of MSE. you can then check if the MSE you get for the real target distribution is significantly lower than from a randomly assigned distribution. The common way of doing it is called "permutation feature importance" where you shuffle a feature instead of the target, and it's used mainly for nonlinear estimators like trees, random forests, etc. It would be better though to actually randomly assign targets from the distribution of targets and not just permuting them. But I'm not sure why you would do this instead of just checking that the regression coefficients you get are significantly greater than zero for linear regression.
