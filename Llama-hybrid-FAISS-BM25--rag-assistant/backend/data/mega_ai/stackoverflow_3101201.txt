Well, if you store the average value somewhere; it will only be accurate as of the last time you calculated it. (i.e. you have 5 reviews; then store the averages somewhere. You get 5 more new reviews, and then your saved average is incorrect). My opinion is that this sort of logic is perfectly suited to a middle-tier. Calculating an average shouldn't be very resource intensive, and really shouldn't impact performance. If you really want to store it in the database; I would probably store them in their own table, and update those values via triggers. However, this could be even more resource intensive than calculating it in the middle-tier.
