Yes, that is easily possible, if your code is running in the application's process. You can do that with a DLL. You would simply use GetWindowLongPtr with GWLP_WNDPROC to get the application's window function, and use SetWindowLongPtr to set your own. In your window function you check for the message that you would like to alter, and call the application's window function with the altered values. In case of any other message, you will have to call it straight. Use CallWindowProc to call the window funcion, because the default windows function is not a pointer. Another way would be to use the CallWndProc hook function. Call SetWindowsHookEx with WH_CALLWNDPROC to have it installed. Haven't tried this one yet though, but you won't need to have to be in the process's space, IIRC.
