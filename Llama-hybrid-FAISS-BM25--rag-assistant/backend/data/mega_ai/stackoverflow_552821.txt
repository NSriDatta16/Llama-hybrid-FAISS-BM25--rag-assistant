You need to use some unmanaged APIs. Specifically, DeviceIoControl using a 'control code' of IOCT_DISK_GET_STORAGEID . This will, in turn, return a STORAGE_IDENTIFICATION structure. Here's where it gets a bit tricky, as STORAGE_IDENTIFICATION uses a property (dwSerialNumOffset) to specify the (memory) offset from the beginning of the structure, which would be difficult to translate into interop calls. Edit: Found a VB.NET implementation on the MSDN forums
