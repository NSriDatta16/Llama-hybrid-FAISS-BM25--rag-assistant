Calendar Visualization

I have a two column table consisting of: date , user_id . I'd like to visualize a grid with date along the x axis, and user_id along the y . If date , user_id exists, I'd like to show a grid with a color, say green. If date , user_id does not exist, I'd like to show a grid in white. Bonus points if date , user_id shows up multiple points resulting in a darker green color. What tool, preferably free and online, is best suited to visualize these data in the manner I've described? Follow up question: which other tools are good at visualizing time series data of user events as a calendar? Something like: https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/calendar
