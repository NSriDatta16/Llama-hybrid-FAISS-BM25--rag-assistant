Can TBATS be used in the case of deterministic seasonality?

I have a monthly dataset which consist of 176 points. I validated that it is stationary by adf.test and it has deterministic seasonality by ch.test . The test results, time series plot, ACF and PACF plots are shown below: Warning in adf.test(ts) : p-value smaller than printed p-value Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test data: ts Dickey-Fuller = -5.1491, Lag order = 5, p-value = 0.01 alternative hypothesis: stationary Canova and Hansen test for seasonal stability data: ts statistic pvalue Jan 0.1378 0.4886 Feb 0.3668 0.092 .

Also, I drew the following plots and I saw that it has seasonal pattern. ts_model |t|) (Intercept) 44.480 5.887 7.556 2.83e-12 *** season(ts)February -21.467 8.325 -2.579 0.01080 * season(ts)March -11.967 8.325 -1.437 0.15250 season(ts)April -19.173 8.325 -2.303 0.02253 * season(ts)May -10.547 8.325 -1.267 0.20700 season(ts)June -9.027 8.325 -1.084 0.27983 season(ts)July -40.373 8.325 -4.850 2.87e-06 *** season(ts)August -38.323 8.472 -4.523 1.17e-05 *** season(ts)September -27.951 8.472 -3.299 0.00119 ** season(ts)October -13.680 8.472 -1.615 0.10831 season(ts)November -11.009 8.472 -1.299 0.19565 season(ts)December 6.241 8.472 0.737 0.46236 How can I use the linear model above for time series analysis. As you see there is deterministic seasonality but according to regression results, some parameters are insignificant. To be honest, I get very confused about this topic time to time. In the case of deterministic seasonality, how should we determine the model if the data is stationary? As far as I understand so far, this can be done by adding xreg to the auto.arima function. auto.arima function gave me ARIMA(0,0,0) as a best model. Can I apply TBATS in this case?
