Usually one chooses the null hypothesis to be what one tries to reject. In this case I would do: H_0: mu 0.035 as this formulates your hypothesis to testing whether or not the debt ratio of Ohio banks are identical to that of the federal banks. In your answer to the second question you are dividing alpha (your significance level) by two in your critical value. This implies that you are conducting a two-tailed test. As you are only interested in testing if the debt ratio for Ohio banks is higher than that of Federal banks, not either higher or lower, you have to conduct a one-tailed test. More specifically a upper-tail test. Also, it looks like you calculated the average of the Ohio banks debt ratios wrong. The sum of the rates divided by 7 is 6, not 5.8.
