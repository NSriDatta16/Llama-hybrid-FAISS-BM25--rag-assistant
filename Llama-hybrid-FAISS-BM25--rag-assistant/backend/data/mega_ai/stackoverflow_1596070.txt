Calling methods from the view controller from any class in the project

I'm a beginner with Objective C and iPhone development. It's there any way to call methods from the view controller from any class in my project ? I began writting a small openGL game, beginning from the EAGLview generated by the default opengl project that Xcode allows me to create. The game so far works well, but I would like to call methods from the ViewController from my game class, for example, call some methods which use the GameKit framework that I wrote in my ViewController. It's there any way to make It happen ?, or I'm doing it wrong and there is a different aproach which I should use ?
