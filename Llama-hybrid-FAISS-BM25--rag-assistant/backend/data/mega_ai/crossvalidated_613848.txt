Tongue slightly in cheek - the root cause of the class imbalance problem is calling it the class imbalance problem, which implies that the class imbalance causes a problem. This is very rarely the case (and when it does happen the only solution is likely to be to collect more data). The real problem is practitioners (and algorithm developers) not paying attention to the requirements of the application. In most cases it is a cost-sensitive learning problem in disguise (where the degree of imbalance is completely irrelevant to the solution, it depends only on the misclassification costs) or a problem of a difference in the distribution of patterns in the training set and in the test set or operational conditions (for which the degree of imbalance is again essentially irrelevant - the solution is the same as for balanced datasets). We should stop talking about class imbalance being a problem as it obscures the real problems (e.g. cost-sensitive learning) and prevents people from addressing them.
