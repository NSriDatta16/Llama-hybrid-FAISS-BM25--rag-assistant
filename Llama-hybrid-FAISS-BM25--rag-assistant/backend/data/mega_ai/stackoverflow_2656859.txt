You can implement your own membership provider (as you mentioned) if you wish to have your own storage. One advantage is that you can administer memberships through IIS' .NET users configuration tool. The biggest advantage is what the others stated already; why reinvent the wheel? If you implement your own custom login UI using MVC you could reuse also when switching for a different membership provider.
