How to Gibbs sample proportional to a probability

I am reading this tutorial on Hierarchical Chinese Restaurant Process. On pdf page 141 (slide title: MCMC Problem Specification for N-grams) it says: $$F(s_{1,k})=\frac{\alpha^{S'_1+s_{1,k}}}{(\alpha)_{S'_1+S_2+s_{1,k}}}S^{s_{1,k}+s_{2,k}}_{r_k,0}S^{t_{1,k}+t_{2,k}+t_{3,k}}_{s_{1,k},0}.$$ Gibbs by sampling $s_{1,k}$ proportional to this for all $$1\leq s_{1,k}\leq t_{1,k}+t_{2,k}+t_{3,k}.$$ Please: ignore the terms definition as it is not critical for understanding the question. The key is that we can compute all these quantities and $s_{1,k}$ is a count, so we can easily use all values in that inequality range. My question basically is about how this sampling is done? This is my guess: do we take all possible values in the range specified by the inequality and plug them into the equation and compute it to get a corresponding probability (it's not a true probability but the normalizer seems to be the same for all quantities, hence we can turn the computed F to probability once we had all the computed values) for each sampled value? Then use the cumulative probability to sample from these? For example, for $$1\leq s_{1,k}\leq 3$$ do we consider $F(s_{1,k}=1),F(s_{1,k}=2),F(s_{1,k}=3)$ and then define a cumulative probability $(F(s_{1,k}=1), F(s_{1,k}=1)+F(s_{1,k}=2), 1)$ and then generate a random number and based on the interval it falls into, we decide which sampled value for $s_{1,k}$ to take?
