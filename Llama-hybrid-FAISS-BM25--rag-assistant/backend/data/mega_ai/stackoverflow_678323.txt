Scriptaculous Ajax.InPlaceEditor does not work with HTML

I'm using the Scriptaculous Ajax.InPlaceEditor to edit data from my database. Actually, it works perfectly at first, when there is no data in the database ; Here is what I have in my navigator source code : New text to edit here I can create a new record, automaticly add some HTML to change design, and change again and again with no problem thanks to the Ajax.InPlaceEditor. At this time, here is how looks the source code : item1 item2 Ok, this is just perfect. And this is perfect too in the database... But if I reload the full page, then the initial value of the editable paragraph is now HTML coming straight from the database, and here is what I have in the source code : item1 item2 As you can see, the is mysterously missing, and the paragraph is not editable any more... Rich noticed that the paragraph was actually self closing... I also tried to manually set HTML text into the database, and the result is the same : is missing... Would you have any idea of what's going on, and how to fix it ? Thank you so much..
