Preparing Data for Convolutional Neural Network Training

I am working on a project that involves creating a set of n heat maps that will become the training data for a CNN to perform a binary classification. As of now, I have 1,000 heat maps with 649 in the majority class and 351 in the minority class (I can make more heat maps if needed). My question is this: how are images prepped for CNN training? Are all of the images compiled into one data set? If so, any ideas on how to accomplish this in R? I'm going for conceptual understanding here. I understand what the CNN does I'm just not sure how to set-up the training data. Any guidance is appreciated!
