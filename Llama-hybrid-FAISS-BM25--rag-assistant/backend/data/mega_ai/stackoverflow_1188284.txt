.NET: Large revision numbers in AssemblyVersionAttribute

We have the convention of versioning our builds as [major].[minor].[micro].[revision], e.g. 2.1.2.33546. Our build-script automatically updates an AssemblyInfo.cs file containing [assembly: AssemblyVersion("x.y.z.w")] in order to embed the version-number in the assembly. But our Subversion-repository just reached revision #65535, which broke our build. It turns out that each number in the version-number has a maximum value of 65534 (probably due to a Windows-restriction). Have you encountered this problem? Any good solutions/workarounds? We like the scheme of embedding the revision-number and we obviously can't just reset our Subversion-server :-)
