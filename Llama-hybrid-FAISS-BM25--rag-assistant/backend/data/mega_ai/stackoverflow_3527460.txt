Vector operations by time intervals , in R ??, aggregate

I have a time series (zoo with index type chron) and I need to calculate cummax(mydata)-mydata on every day separately, in a new zoo object. I've tried this: aggregate(mydata, as.date, cummax) but aggregate can only produce a single scalar result for each subset instead of a vector. I've read that maybe tapply , lapply , plyr , cut , or rollapply could do it, but I couldn't get them to work.
