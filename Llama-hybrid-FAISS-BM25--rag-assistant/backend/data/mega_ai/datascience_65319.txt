It all depends how you frame your problem. Whats complex? more parameters, more time complexity, more exotic looking etc... Here are 2 cool ideas how to measure similarity: Mahalanobis distance measure of the distance between a point P and a distribution D. Cool but more importantly its robust because you are using parameters of your distribution to measure the distance. Neural networks . If we relax the definition of "measuring distance between data" then Check siamesse networks. The gist of it is, can you group similiar sequences of data together. Why I like it? cause of o ne-shot learning
