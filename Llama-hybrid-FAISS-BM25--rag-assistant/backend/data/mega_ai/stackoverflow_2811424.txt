It was used to insert user submitted data directly into mysql queries without having to escape it. It's now depreceated and should be leaved to 'Off' until PHP removes it, I prefer handling string escaping by mysqelf or by th DB abstraction layer than relying on php directive for this. The point is that GET/POST/COOKIE vars are not only for DB storage, and I've seen too much emails or displayed text showing \' characters because of this.
