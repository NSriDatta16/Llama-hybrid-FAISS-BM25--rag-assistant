Rstan Stan model for a simple mixture of normals

This blog post from Rbloggers describes how to code a simple three-part normal mixture model with known mixing coefficients, means and standard deviations. While it describes the procedures in some detail for many of the Bayesian sampling tools available in R, the author reported that s/he was unable to sample from this model using rstan . Is it possible to construct this model in rstan ? And if so, how? The model is a mixture of normals with known means and standard deviations: $$p(y)= 0.3\mathcal{N}(-3,2)+0.4\mathcal{N}(2,1)+0.3\mathcal{N}(10,4)$$
