You can't rely on a certain framerate. Android is a using multitasking operating system. If there are some threads running in the background that do some heavy lifting, you might not be able to reach the framerate you want. Even if you're the only active process, the framerate depends on your GPU and CPU, and the clock of each. Maybe the user has a hacked ROM that changes the clock to a custom value. Some phones might be locked to a certain framerate. The HTC EVO was locked to 30fps for the longest time, until custom ROMs came out that removed that limitation. Newer EVO ROMs also removed that limitation. I don't know what you're trying to do, but your best bet is to measure the time after each frame and use that delta for your animations. If you're trying to display the FPS, then use a smoothed average.
