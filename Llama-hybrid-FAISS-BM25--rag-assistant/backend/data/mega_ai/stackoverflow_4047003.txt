Which event are you using to determine when the value of the cell changes? If you use UltraGrid.AfterCellUpdate , it will fire when the cell value is set programmatically, either with the Value property or the SetValue method. The "something" you're curious about in the 2 parameter overload is a boolean value which indicates whether the value change should go onto the undo stack. If you pass in True, the user can perform an undo on the grid and it will undo your programmatic change. If you just set the Value property, it does not get added to the undo stack.
