Rails logging best practices

Often I find myself inserting logging statements like this into my code: logger.info("orphaned_annotations: ".upcase + orphaned_annotations.to_s) logger.info("orphaned_anchors: ".upcase + orphaned_anchors.to_s) It seems like this would be a pretty common use-case -- is there an easier way to get this kind of functionality?
