Can we run ANOVA for estimates?

So , I am currently working as an Intern for Government Statistical Organization that does sample surveys & presents estimates on various aspects. My work is to present some statistical analysis using data from the published reports . Can I run ANOVA to check for difference between means for different groups in this scenario? Your answer will greatly solve my doubt .
