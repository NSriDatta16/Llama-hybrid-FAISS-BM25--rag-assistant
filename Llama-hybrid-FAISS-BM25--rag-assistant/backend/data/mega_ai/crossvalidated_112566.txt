How to compute this conditional probability in Bayesian Networks?

I met a problem related to conditional probability from the article "Bayesian Networks without Tears"( download ) on page 3. According to the Figure 2, the author says $$P(fo=yes|lo=true, hb=false)=0.5$$ While I don't know how to calculate it and obtain the correct result. I attached the screenshot of Figure 2. from the article. I tried it as following $$P(fo|lo, \bar{hb})=\frac{P(lo, \bar{hb}|fo)\cdot P(fo)}{P(lo, \bar{hb})}=\frac{P(lo|fo)\cdot P(\bar{hb}|fo)\cdot P(fo)}{P(lo, \bar{hb})}$$ And $P(lo|fo)=0.6,\ P(fo)=0.15$, but how to know other 3 terms? Thank you! P.S. According to some reference it has $$P(\mathbf{X})=\prod_{i=1}^{n}P(X_i|parents(X_i))$$ Thus $$P(fo|lo, \bar{hb})=\frac{P(lo, \bar{hb}, fo)}{P(lo, \bar{hb})}=\frac{P(fo)\cdot P(lo|fo)\cdot P(\bar{hb}|do)}{\sum_{{fo}^{'}}P(lo, \bar{hb}, {fo}^{'})}$$ $$=\frac{.15\times.6\times.3}{.15\times.6\times.3+.85\times.05\times.3}=0.6792453$$ While it is not equal to the author's result (i.e. 0.5)? What is wrong in my solution?
