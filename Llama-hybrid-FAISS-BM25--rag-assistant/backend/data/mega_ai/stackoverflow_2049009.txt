You have several options. Either: ghc-pkg hide monads-fd . This will cause GHC and GHCi to ignore the presence of the monads-fd by default until you later ghc-pkg expose monads-fd , but software installed by Cabal will still be able to build against it. Use the {-# LANGUAGE PackageImports #-} pragma, and change your import statement to import "mtl" Control.Monad.State . Use Cabal to build your project, and specify mtl in the Build-depends line. The first is best for casual hacking, and the last is best for production builds. These all assume you want the mtl module and not the monads-fd module; otherwise swap them.
