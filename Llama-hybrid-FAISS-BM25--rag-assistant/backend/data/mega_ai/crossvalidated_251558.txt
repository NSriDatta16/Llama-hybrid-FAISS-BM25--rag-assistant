You have a large $N$ but small $P$ problem, which means you have many data but not too many features. Linear regression can work well on such data set and done in reasonable amount of time. To understand if linear model fits your data well, I would suggest to use a sample of data to fit model and exam the performance. After that, use more samples and observe what will happen on training and testing performance. This is essentially investigating "learning curve". Check my detailed answer in this post to know if you are over fitting or under fitting. How to know if a learning curve from SVM model suffers from bias or variance? With the information you provided, here are things may happen in your data Linear model has high bias, if you have over 1 million rows, it is very possible you have a "under-fitting" model. Where the model is "stable" but have not very good performance. As discussed in the comments, it also matters a lot on how you do the categorical feature coding. If you have 74 categorical features, each one has say 20 unique values, then the design matrix can be reasonable large and you may have $P>N$ problem or over fitting. But if all of these features are binary abd most values are 0 then it is ok to use linear model.
