Interpreting conditional probability fallacy, probability of having a girl

Given the great answer https://math.stackexchange.com/a/1801261/984376 I do understand P(second child =girl|First child = girl) =0.5 and P(both girls|at least one girl)=1/3. Let's say for a given part of the population I knew that the first child is a girl and let's say that we could bet x dollar on the next child being a boy, the payout should be 2x. Would people A) win on average some money if they would bet that for this population the second child is a boy (due to P(both girls|at least one girl)=1/3 B) would a bet not make any sense due to P(second child =girl|First child = girl) =0.5? Additional question C) Under which scenario could I make money by making use of P(both girls|at least one girl)=1/3
