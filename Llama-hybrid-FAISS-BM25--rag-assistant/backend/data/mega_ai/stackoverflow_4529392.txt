Confused with the Isolated Storage with Multiple Assemblies Access

I googled and searched a lot, but I got no luck. I have a WindowsFormsApplication.exe and ConsoleApplication.exe. I want both of them to access to the same IsolatedStorage, is it possible? I tried using this in ConsoleApplication.exe: IsolatedStorageFile isoStore = IsolatedStorageFile.GetMachineStoreForApplication(); but I got: IsolatedStorageException: Unable to determine application identity of the caller. How can I fix this? Or can I use this way? P.S.: This is NOT a ClickOnce app.
