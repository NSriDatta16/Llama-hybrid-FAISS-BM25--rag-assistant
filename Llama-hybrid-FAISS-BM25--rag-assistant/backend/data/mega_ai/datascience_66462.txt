Previous work Replication and Research ethics Ask Question

I am very much concerned about biding by research ethics in my work, especially issues to do with plagiarism. I come across a recent research paper in my field of study that applies state-of-the-art tools (deep learning architectures) in their work using a publically available dataset. I am impressed by their work and feel I should apply the same methodology they used but using my dataset (private). Would this be considered a plagiarised version of their work?
