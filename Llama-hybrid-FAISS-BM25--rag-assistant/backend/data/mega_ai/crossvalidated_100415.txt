How to test if time series are not cointegrated?

Is there a test whose null hypothesis is that time series are cointegrated? There are lots of tests whose null is no cointegration. How can I calculate a p-value for the null that two series are cointegrated? I assume a p-value of 0.95 for a null of no-cointegration is not the same as a p-value of 0.05 for a null of cointegration.
