How to incorporate weight into linear regression in SPSS

I would like to know the proper procedure to execute weighted linear regression analysis. I have come across different tutorials about weighing in SPSS, but can't distinguish which is appropriate. This is a grouped analysis, Var1 and Var2 are group average and "Frequency" is the number of group members. Var1 Var2 Frequency 3.4 5.6 67 5.6 2.5 96 3.2 6.3 23 Method 1: "Data" > "weight cases by" > "Frequency" variable > then just run the linear regression Method 2: "Analyze" > "Regression" > "Linear" > in the "WLS Weight" slot select "Frequency" variable. Is method 1 or method 2 correct? Method 1 seems strange as the results have boosted degree of freedom (probably related to the frequency), the beta's are the same between these two methods, except degree of freedom and p-value (method 1 much lower). Or is there another, more correct, way to do weighted linear regression in SPSS?
