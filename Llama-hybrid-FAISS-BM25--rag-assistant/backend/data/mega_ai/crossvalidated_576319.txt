The 3 RTM are selected since they are often uncorrelated with each other, but you are free to redefine them or supplement them as you choose. Average revenue is a different metric than total revenue, although they are correlated so it might make sense to create a flag in your analysis for 'new heavy spenders' . While total revenue might be translated by average revenue * frequency, that is not always true if frequency is measured by multiple items which are often grouped together in an invoice. Sometimes businesses also include # of items as a separate variable. All of these metrics are better off being scaled to within a timeframe, lets say the last year or 2 years, since you don't want to give equal weight to customers who have spent heavily a long time ago, but aren't spending anything now. So, if you are averaging, consider an exponentially smoothed average which would give greater weight to the most recent spending. But, on the other hand, if you have a 'Win Back' program, that is, trying to capture higher spend customers (or frequent) who are bought in the past, but now may be inactive, you could give greater weight to the older transactions.
