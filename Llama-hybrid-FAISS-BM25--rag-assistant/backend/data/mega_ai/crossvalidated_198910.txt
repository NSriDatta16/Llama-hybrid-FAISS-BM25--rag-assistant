How to calculate threshold value in supervised principal component analysis?

How to calculate the threshold value for selecting the number of features using supervised principal component analysis? I have a $152\times 27578$ data matrix and I want to apply SPCA to reduce the matrix size. Can any one tell me how to calculate that? I got this paper but I am unable to understand how they are calculating $\theta$ value (threshold value): Bair et al. 2004, Prediction by supervised principal components .
