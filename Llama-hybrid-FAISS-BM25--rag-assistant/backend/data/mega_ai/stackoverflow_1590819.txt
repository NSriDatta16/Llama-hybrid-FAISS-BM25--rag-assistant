DB design for synced desktop application

I'm building a desktop application that will run on multiple laptops. It will need to sync up to a central database whenever the user is back in the office and has access again. My biggest problem to overcome is how to design the database so that it is easily synced with the central database server. One of the major hurdles is trying to determine how to handle keys such that they don't duplicate across the multiple laptop databases that'll be in use. For example, say Laptop 1 enters a new customer called "Customer A" - using a unique id, it might be assigned a customer ID of 20. Laptop 2 enters "Customer C" - it could also assign the ID of 20 to that customer. When it comes time to sync, both customer A & C would end up on the server with a duplicate ID. Has anyone worked with an app similar to this that has an elegant solution?
