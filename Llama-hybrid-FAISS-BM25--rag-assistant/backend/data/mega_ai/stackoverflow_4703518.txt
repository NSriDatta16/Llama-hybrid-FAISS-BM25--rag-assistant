PHP with SQL Injection

Ok, starting fresh > For our first assignment in a System Security class, we have to hack into the professors "cheaply organized" sql database. I know the only user is "admin" and picking a random password, the select statement generated in the php is: select user_id from user where user_username = 'admin' AND user_password = md5('noob') Now, I go for the basic starting point of trying to hack the crappy login with "admin'--" select user_id from user where user_username = 'admin'--' AND user_password = md5('noob') but the actual value being pushed to the database is select user_id from user where user_username = 'admin\'--' AND user_password = md5('noob') which doesn't help. The server uses POST to get the values from the form. I've already bypassed any value processing on my side of the send by disabling javascript. There does not appear to be anything in the php that modifies the input in any way.
