What are you seeing? What does HttpCacheWrapper do with the HttpRuntime.Cache it gets passed? I suspect that what you're seeing instead is a cache policy that holds onto things too long for the rate that things are being cached. As Raymond Chen has said, "incorrect cache policy is indistinguishable from a memory leak." The way I would isolate this is to try to test with just one repo using the policy you have. See if your performance problems appear. If not, then go ahead and create the 2nd repo and closely monitor memory usage.
