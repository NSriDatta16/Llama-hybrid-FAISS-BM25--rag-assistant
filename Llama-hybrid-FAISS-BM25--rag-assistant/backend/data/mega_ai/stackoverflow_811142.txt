Reuse a client class in WCF after it is faulted

I use WCF for a client server system. When I add a service reference to IService on the server, a proxy class ServiceClient is generated. My code looks like the following: ServiceClient client = new ServiceClient(); try { client.Operation1(); } catch(Exception ex) { // Handle Exception } try { client.Operation2(); } catch(Exception ex) { // Handle Exception } The problem is that if there is a communication exception in the first call, the client's state changes to Faulted, and I don't know how to reopen it to make the second call. Is there a way to reopen it? or should I create a new one and replace the instance (It doesn't seem like an elegant way)?
