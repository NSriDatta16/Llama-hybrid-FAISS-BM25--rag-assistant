How do we come up with the SVM Kernel giving $n+d\choose d$ feature space?

I was going through the CS229 notes on SVM and Kernel tricks and I came across the following line. More generally the kernel $K(x,z)=(xTz+c)^d$ corresponds to a feature mapping to an $n+d\choose d$ feature space, corresponding to all monomials that are up to order d. Despite working in this $O(n^d)$ dimensional space, computing $K(x,z)$ is of order $O(n)$ . Firstly, How exactly does it translate into $n+d\choose d$ feature space? Consider I have $n = 3$ and $d = 2$ , i.e, $x = [x1, x2, x3], z = [z1, z2, z3]$ so, a feature map for $K(x,z) = (xTz + c)^2$ would look something like this: $$\phi(x) = [x_1^2, x_1x_2, x_1x_3, x_2x_1, x_2^2, x_2x_3, x_3x_1, x_3x_2, x_3^2, \sqrt{2c}x_1, \sqrt{2c}x_2, \sqrt{2c}x_3, c]$$ which makes a total of 13 features. But $3+2\choose 2$ gives me 10. It does not make sense to me. Secondly, Despite working in this $O(n^d)$ dimensional space Why does it say $n^d$ dimensional space whereas we had feature mapped to 13 dimensions? Are we then only considering the monomials $x_{i1}x_{i2}...x_{ip}$ which make up order d = 2? (i.e, $x_1^2$ or $x_1x_2$ etc). If that is the case, then what is this all about? the kernel $K(x,z)=(xTz+c)^d$ corresponds to a feature mapping to an $n+d\choose d$ feature space This seems confusing to me. Any kind of help would be appreciated. Thanks. Edit: Here is the link to the pdf.
