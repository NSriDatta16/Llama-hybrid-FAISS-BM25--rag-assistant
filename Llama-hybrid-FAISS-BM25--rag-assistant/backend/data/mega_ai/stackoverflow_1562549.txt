Well you've got to decide on some other choice here because the functionality you are asking for overlaps, and you can't ask the app to magically know which the user wants to do. What I mean by this is that when you touch and drag within a scroll view, it's going to try to scroll itself, rather than drag the entire scroll view around. As for rotation and zooming - that gets more complicated, because you start dealing with vector math and the like. You can check out my question on rotation here . The link I gave you has the code to get both rotation and zooming to work.
