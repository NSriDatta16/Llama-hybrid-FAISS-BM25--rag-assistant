Exponential distributions are rescaled $\chi^2(2)$ distributions. Let's assume the scaling has been reversed (which is done via a constant multiplication) and all means are equal to $2$. One solution starts by generating a scaled $\chi^2(1)$ variate $A$ from two independent $\chi^2(2)$ variates $U$ and $V$ via $$A = U\left(\cos(2\pi\exp(-V/2))\right)^2.$$ This is equivalent to the Box-Mueller transform , which is a well-known way of generating a pair of (independent) standard normal variates from two independent uniform variates. One of those normals, when squared, equals $A$ and therefore has a $\chi^2(1)$ distribution. The rest is easy given two more independent exponential variates $W$ and $Y$: $W+A$ has a $\chi^2(3)$ distribution and $Y$ independently has a $\chi^2(2)$ distribution, whence (practically from the definition of $F$ as a ratio of scaled $\chi^2$ variables) $$F=\frac{(W+A)/3}{Y/2} = \frac{2}{3}\frac{W+U\cos^2(2\pi e^{-V/2})}{Y}$$ does the trick. Note that only four of the five exponential variables are needed. Here is R code comparing $100,000$ realizations of $F$ to corresponding quantiles of the $F(3,2)$ distribution: n The probability plot shows a close correspondence: As a double-check, we can verify that a , y , and x average close to their expectations of $1$, $2$, and $3$ respectively: > mean(a) [1] 0.9948789 > mean(x) [1] 3.003484 > mean(y) [1] 1.986864 Finally, probability plots confirm that a , y , and x appear to have $\chi^2$ distributions with the desired degrees of freedom (and correct scales): pp By construction x and y are independent, so there's no need to test this.
