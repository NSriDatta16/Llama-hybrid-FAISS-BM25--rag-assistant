How to find the various matrix sizes in designing a CNN

I am trying to understand CNN especially the maths and working mechanism using Matlab as the coding language. I have few confusion regarding the concept and the associated programming and will be immensely grateful for an intuitive answer. Below is the structure of my CNN for 5 classes. I could calculate only the output structure of the first Conv layer and stuck on determining the number of parameters i.e., number of neurons? The output for the first convolution layer that I could calculate: In the first layer an input of size [50 50 2] is convolved with a set of M_1 5-dimensional filters applied over all the input channels. The first 2 D convolutional layer is composed of M_1 = 20 filters of size [5x5x 1] having the step size (stride) for traversing the input vertically and horizontally as 1 creating a feature map of size {(h-f_h+1) x (w - f_w +1)x 1x M_1} = (50-5+1)x(50-5+1)x20 = [46x46x 20] So we have 20 channels.
