I'm curious what sort of system you're planning on using this for. Is it for a small-scale chat system between users on a tiny project, or are you envisioning a BIG system? The biggest problem with online IM systems is reliability â€” take facebook, for example. Their chat system is notoriously buggy, and it's maintained by a large fleet of professional developers with tons of resources at their disposal. You might want to start by looking at the XMPP organization's list of XMPP clients; there's a section for web clients . If there are any which are open-source, you could probably work with that some. Again, it's hard to say without knowing exactly what the system is intended to do. One possibility could be using Google Apps for your Domain if it's an internal sort of thing. If worse comes to worse, and you have a LOT of time on your hands, maybe you could write your own implementation of the LibPurple library for web use (google it; I don't have enough reputation points yet to post a second hyperlink). Hope that gives some ideas of where to start. I've never done this before, just giving some hopefully helpful tips. Good luck!
