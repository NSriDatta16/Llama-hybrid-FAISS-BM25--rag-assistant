How are bayesian instrumental variables calculated?

So with regular frequentist statistics, I know that you can just regress on the first stage of two-stage least squares, get the predicted values, then plug them into the second stage. How does this work with Bayesian IVs? The predicted values for the first stage are going to not be point estimates, but will be posterior densities that incorporate uncertainty.
