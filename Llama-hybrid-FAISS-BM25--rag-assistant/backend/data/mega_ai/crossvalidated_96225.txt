Neural Network: What if there are multiple right answers for a given set of inputs?

For a given input into the input nodes, there are multiple correct values for the output nodes. In the training set, there are times when the inputs result in a certain output, and other times when the inputs result in a completely different (but equally valid) output. Will a neural network still be able to "figure out" a pattern? From what I know about backpropagation, it seems like the different right answers would prevent it from functioning properly. If that's so, are there any solutions? I don't need the neural network to predict all possible correct solutions, but I do need it to output a correct solution.
