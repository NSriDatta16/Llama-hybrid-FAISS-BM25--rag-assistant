PHP mysql_query, integer returned instead of resource

Before anyone jumps on me, I have found a similar issue here , but unfortunately their answer does not seem to apply to my problem. I have created a function called sqlReturn() in order to more easily produce an error (with standard output) should a query go wrong. The code is below: function sqlResult($query) { return mysql_query($query) or die("SQL Query: " . $query . " SQL Error: " . mysql_error()); } As you can see, it just outputs an error in the way I like, and it saves me a bit of effort in coding along the way. However, while this has been working in most cases (eg. situations where I use SELECT or INSERT), it is throwing the following error: PHP Warning: mysql_fetch_array() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /var/www/login/login_submit.php on line 42 It is returning 1 instead of a resource. If, instead of calling that function (which is in a separate php file), I simply use the line of code in the same file without a return statement (ie. $sqlResult = mysql_query($sqlQuery) or ... etc.), it returns a resource as normal. In case it's relevant, my SQL query is also below: $sqlQuery = "SELECT userID, username, password, access_level FROM users WHERE username = '{$username}' AND (password = '{$password_sha1}' OR password = '{$password_sha256}')"; Any input on this would be appreciated. Thanks, Paragon
