It is not obvious to me that you need anything more than support for Blobs or Clobs to implement simple XML storage and retrieval. You'd only need special XML support if you needed to perform queries against the data contained in the XML. What you are talking about is an "XML enabled" RDBMS. Depending on your actual requirements, you may also want to look into native XML databases (NXDs). There is even a standard Java API (XQJ) for querying NXDs, though not all vendors support it.
