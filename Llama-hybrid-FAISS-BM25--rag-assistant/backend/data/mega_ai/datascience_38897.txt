What are the differences between Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Supervised Learning?

What is the difference between Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Supervised Learning? Does RL hava more difficulty in finding a stable solution? Does Q-learning have more difficulty in finding a stable solution? Does getting stuck in a local minimum happen more in supervised learning? Is this figure correct saying that Supervised Learning is part of RL?
