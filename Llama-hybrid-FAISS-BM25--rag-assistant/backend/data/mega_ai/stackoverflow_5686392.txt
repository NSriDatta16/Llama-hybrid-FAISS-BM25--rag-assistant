"The session framework lets you store and retrieve arbitrary data on a per-site-visitor basis", so if you're fine with that (the stored dictionary based information is available only for the specific user of that session, as long as you don't access the selected session backend otherwise) it's perfectly ok. The only pitfalls I see could be introduced when using a cache-based session backend (cache invalidation, persistence of data, distribution of to-be-cached-data to multiple servers, things like that), specifically when the storage of data is different from your main storage (database) - say with memcached or file based caching.
