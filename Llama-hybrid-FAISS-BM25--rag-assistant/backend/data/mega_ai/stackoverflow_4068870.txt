solr spellchecker

I have implemented the solr spellchecker based on the fieldType given here : http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SpellCheckingAnalysis The spellchecking is to be done for vendor names where suggestions should be given related to the search term entered. I have used copyField for the vendorName field of the above type i.e. textSpell I am getting weird collated results for some of my queries. e.g. 1) maccys does not give me any results where as maccy's gives me the desired result i.e. macy's. I compared the text analysis (admin tool) done for maccys & maccy's using both text & textSpell fieldtypes and both give macy as the endresult. So why is there no result returned from the spellchecker? 2) khols gives me 'shoes' the collated result where as the correct result 'kohls' is the third suggestion after (shoes & shops). The onlyMorePopular flag is false and accuracy is the default of 0.5 Thanks in advance for any help. I am slightly lost in terms of debugging any further.
