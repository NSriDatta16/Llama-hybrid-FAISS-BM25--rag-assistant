It can. What you're asking sounds like memoization -- you store previous results to speed computations later. So, for example, if you compute 9!, you can store the values for 1! .. 9!, and if you're asked for 8! later you can just return the stored value. Similarly, if asked for 10!, you can compute 10Ã—9! quickly. The thing is that factorial( n ) grows so quickly, for large values of n you can end up using a lot of storage, so the space-time trade may not be worthwhile. Another function that can use memoization effectively is computing Fibonacci numbers.
