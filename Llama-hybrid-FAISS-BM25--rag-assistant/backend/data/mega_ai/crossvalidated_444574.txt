Yes. I would suggest looking for discrete state space Markov chains. The following course covers the topic (with much more detail than needed for your question): http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~rrw1/markov/index.html But essentially, you need to set up your transition matrix. You can then calculate one of several things: 1) Average time to hit failure state. 2) N-step transition probability to failure state.
