To understand why the solutions are not as good as you imagine, make a heatmap plot of the following: For the two clusters you generate, determine the pdf (probability density function) each. Now plot a heatmap of pdf1(x,y)-pdf2(x,y). Assuming a red-white-blue heatmap, red areas are more likely to belong to one clusters blue areas to the other. That is the "real" ground truth that you are working with: lots of points in "white" that cannot be clearly assigned to either cluster. You then can also do the same for the clustering result of EM. If visual contrast is not good enough, use log(pdf1(x)/pdf2(x)) instead. This is similar to the following image from Wikipedia : Except that you want to look at the differences between the shaded intensities (the filled ellipses, not the individual points, redness minus yellowness). Also, the Wikipedia situation has well separated clusters, but in your case they overlap badly, which makes them pretty much inseparable. The visualization above aims at visualizing the lack of separability... On the analytical side, compare the average squared difference between the two clusters to the average squared difference within each cluster. If the first is not substantially larger than the second, the clusters can likely not be separated well!
