What are useful parameters to store when tracking page views?

I want to implement a simple in-house table that tracks user page views on my website. Without targeting some specific hypothesis, what is useful data to store? Eventually I'll use it to build graphs or decision trees to better learn about our user base. This is static (no javascript). Things I can think of: URL accessed HTTP refer[r]er HTTP Accept Language Browser-agent Session id User id (if logged in) Time visited
