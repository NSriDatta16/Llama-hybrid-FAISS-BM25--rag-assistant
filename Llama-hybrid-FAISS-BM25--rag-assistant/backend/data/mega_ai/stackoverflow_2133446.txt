I like to put the dealloc implementation right below the initializers. That way, when I add a new instance variable, I remember to release it right after I init it. Also, I find it really helpful to use the #pragma mark directive to make it easier to browse the file. So I "group" the init and dealloc methods together under a heading called "initializers". When browsing the file, having those headings makes it much easier to find what you're looking for without being distracted by the dealloc method. It might be boring code, but man is it important.
