Gaps in time series and time series validity

After doing some reading on CrossValidated, I understood that we can use "imputation" techniques to fill in the gaps (if they are random). But I am not clear on following questions: How many consecutive gaps may make data set invalid for forecasting? How many total gaps in data set makes it as invalid. For example I have hourly data for week, which means 188 total points in my data set Case 1: assume if we are missing 3 consecutive days of data is missing, can we still consider that data set as valid data set? Case 2: assume overall 80 data points are missing out of 188 points, can we still consider data set as valid? I am using HoltWinters implementation in java for forecasting. Any help would be appreciated.
