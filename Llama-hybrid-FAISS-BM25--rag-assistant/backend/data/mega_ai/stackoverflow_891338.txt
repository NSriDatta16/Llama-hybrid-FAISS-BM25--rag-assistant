I'm thinking that a brush of a given width and height that, as it's dragged across an area of the screen, grabs the section beneath it and analyzes it, setting non-text color to yellow and leaving text color alone, then placing the updated section back onto the screen. It should be relatively quick and easy to do this, though you do have to hit each pixel (and use some sort of threshold to determine what's text and what isn't, as you mentioned).
