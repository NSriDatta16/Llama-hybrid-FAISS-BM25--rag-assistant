HTTP Header - ntCoent-Length

I get the following HTTP response headers in a particular response. All looks okay. However I have noticed that the content-length appears twice... Content-Length: 2424 ntCoent-Length: 2424 Is there a particular reason why the content-length is returned a second time as ntCoent-Length? HTTP/1.0 200 OK Date: Wed, 26 May 2010 09:38:19 GMT Server: Apache P3P: CP="NOI DSP COR CURa ADMa TA1a OUR BUS IND UNI COM NAV INT" Accept-Charset: iso-8859-1, unicode-1-1;q=0.8 Expires: Sun, 15 Jul 1990 00:00:00 GMT Pragma: no-cache Cache-Control: no-cache Content-Language: en ntCoent-Length: 2424 Connection: close Content-Type: text/html;charset=iso-8859-1 Content-Length: 2424
