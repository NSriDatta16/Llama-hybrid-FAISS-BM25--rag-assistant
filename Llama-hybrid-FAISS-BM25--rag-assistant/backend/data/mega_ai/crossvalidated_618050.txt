Sample size for a survey with randomly assigned questions

This may seen like a dumb question for someone familiar on how to structure survey sample sizes, but I have a hard time finding the literature to back this up. I have a survey that cover's 3 countries, US, UK and Canada, which has the following flow: Out of a list of 100+ items, person is showed a sample of 20 to be selected Out of the selected items, 2-3 are selected for further elaboration For each of further elaboration, respondent is shown 17 items and is asked to select 3 Think of this as: Q1: How important it is for you go to the supermarket? Q2: Out of this 20 items (random out of a list of 100+ items), which ones have one bought last time you went? Q3: For this item 1 that you selected, which of this 17 reasons led you to buy it? Repeat Q3 for 2-3 items As you can see, there is a funnel of questions and potential items selected to a respondent. Essentially there are >5k items combinations that can be shown to a participant. From that survey, we aim at achieving two goals: Measure average "score" values that come out from stage 1 above Compare populations (Male vs Female, 25y, etc.) for the 5k item combination Given all that the question is: What should be our sample size and how should we assign the questions? Problem is, when I look at comparing populations we are normally talking about hypothesis tests, that can have as little as 30 data points, but when talking about to represent these populations then there is a lot more data that is needed. I don't think anyone we will have a clear answer on this, but given this situation, what are the considerations and the approach I should take to find the ideal sample size?
