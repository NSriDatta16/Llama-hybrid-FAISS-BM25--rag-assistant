What's the conditional variance of the chain X -> Y -> Z?

If I have a cascade of 3 random variables, represented as a Bayesian Graph: $X\rightarrow Y \rightarrow Z$ , is there a simple formula for $\sigma_{X|Z}$ ? Further, assume all the variables are normal, so as part of the graph specification I have $\sigma_{Z|Y}$ and $\sigma_{Y|X}$ , could $\sigma_{X|Z}$ be represented in terms of these, and if so, is the assumption of normality important?
