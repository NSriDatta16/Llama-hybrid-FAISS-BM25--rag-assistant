In real databases, for large tables the simpler the key the better. It makes scans and joins much faster and consumes less RAM. An artificial numeric key may be faster and more scalable than non-numeric and/or composite one. In your case, definitely go for normalization. Not only it will be faster (fewer rows), but also better at representing the domain and less fragile (no need to worry about keeping multiple rows for one student in sync).
