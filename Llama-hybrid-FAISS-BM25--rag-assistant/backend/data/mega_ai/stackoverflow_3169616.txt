How to follow this Xcode tutorial?

I'm using Xcode version 3.2.2 but the tutorial at this site was made for an older version of Xcode. I tried to follow this tutorial but like the tutorial says steps 12-18 don't make sense for newer versions of Xcode. I can't drag .h files into the .xib window in Interface Builder. How would steps 12-18 be different? Learn Cocoa II
