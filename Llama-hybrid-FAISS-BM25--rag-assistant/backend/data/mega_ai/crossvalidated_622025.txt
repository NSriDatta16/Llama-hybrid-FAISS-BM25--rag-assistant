Modern graduate-level machine learning books

I'm looking for a modern machine learning book with graduate-level treatment of more recent topics such as diffusion and generative models, transformers etc. I have a hard copy of Deep Learning by Goodfellow and Bengio; while I liked the book and read it extensively when it was published, it is a bit dated now. I'm considering Probabilistic Machine Learning: Advanced Topics by Kevin Patrick Murphy. But maybe there are better alternatives. I need this for my comprehensive Phd examination. Any suggestions are very appreciated.
