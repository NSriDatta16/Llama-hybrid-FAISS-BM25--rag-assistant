Changing pitch in an iOS audio player—like Alvin and the Chipmunks

I found this code fragment in StackOverflow. I think this is what I want to use. But I cannot get it to change the pitch—as I expected it to. I figured changing the 44100.0 up/down would affect the pitch. But I'm getting no change, regardless of the setValue. NSMutableDictionary *settings = [[NSMutableArray alloc] init]; [settings setValue: [NSNumber numberWithFloat:44100.0] forKey:AVSampleRate]; Clearly I'm missing something. Any additional fragments available to give this some more context?
