There is Deepkit . It's a open-source devtool for machine learning. It tracks experiments, versions code, has a model debugger, infrastructure and project management. It satisfies most of your wishes, is open-source, and crossplatform. You can use it completely offline, self-host a server, or use the cloud server to store your experiment data.
