counting overlapping bitwise columns in mysql

I have a table in which there is a bitwise column representing a list of statuses that can be attached to an entry. Each entry can have multiple statuses selected (hence the use of the bitwise logic). What I'd like to do is pull a query that will tell me how many entires there are for each status (i.e. how many times each bit is turned on). The difficulty I have is that there is of course overlap so a GROUP BY or a DISTINCT is not going to cut it (as far as I can see). As an example let's just have two values, 1 and 2. and the following data Id | Status 1 | 1 2 | 1 3 | 2 4 | 3 Now, I want to count how many entries there are for each bit so I'd like something that counts that 3 value into both the 1 and 2 totals, outputting something like this: Bit | Count 1 | 3 2 | 2 The closest I can get so far seems to be pulling out the distinct values and then adding those with multiple entries into their corresponding counts using PHP. Obviously, I'd like to do something a bit more elegant. Any ideas?
