+1 to @Daniel Vassallo's answer, and also these tips: Microsoft uses square brackets to delimit identifiers, whereas MySQL uses back-ticks. Both databases can be put into a mode to use ANSI SQL standard identifier delimiters, which are double-quotes. In MySQL, don't delimit data type names (e.g. [int] ). IDENTITY is specific to Microsoft (and Sybase, fwiw). In MySQL, use AUTO_INCREMENT. You can also use SERIAL which is shorthand for BIGINT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT. There's no support for a CLUSTERED keyword in MySQL. The primary key is always a clustered index in MySQL's InnoDB storage engine (which you should use unless you have a good reason not to). Also you don't need to declare ASC or DESC for indexes in MySQL.
