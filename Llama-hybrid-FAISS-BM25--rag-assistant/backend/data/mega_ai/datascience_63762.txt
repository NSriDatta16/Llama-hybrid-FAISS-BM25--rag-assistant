SHAP value can explain right?

I face a problem with using SHAP value to interpret the Tree-based model. ( https://github.com/slundberg/shapsd ) First, I have input around 30 features and I have 2 features that have high positive correlation between them. After that, I train the XGBoost model(python) and look at SHAP values of 2 features the SHAP values have negative correlation. Could you all explain to me, why the output SHAP values between 2 features don't have the correlation the same as input correlation? and I can trust that output of SHAP or not? ========================= The correlation between input: 0.91788 The correlation between SHAP values: -0.661088 2 features are 1) Pupulation in province and 2) Number of family in province. Model Performance Train AUC: 0.73 Test AUC: 0.71 Scatter plot Input scatter plot (x: Number of family in province, y: Pupulation in province) SHAP values output scatter plot (x: Number of family in province, y: Pupulation in province)
