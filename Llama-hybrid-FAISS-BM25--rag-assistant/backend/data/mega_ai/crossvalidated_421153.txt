Are Bayesian Networks parametric or non-parametric models?

After searching Wikipedia, I found that there are both parametric Bayesian models and non-parametric Bayesian models. What about Bayesian Networks? When building up a Bayesian Network model, I don't need to give much prior information. Does that mean Bayesian Networks are non-parametric models?
