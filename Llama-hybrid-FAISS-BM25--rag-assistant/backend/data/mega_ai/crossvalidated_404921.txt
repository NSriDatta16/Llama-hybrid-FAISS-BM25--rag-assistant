Adding on Izy's answer , when presenting the data, you may show the medians for each group and organize them in ascending order. The medians should behave like the mean ranks used by the test, and are easier to be understood. You may also use superscripts in a similar way as they are used in Tukey's test to mark homogeneous subsets. Using the medians will also help understanding where are the large differences between groups. You should also report the effect sizes , that will be a better measure of the magnitude of the differences.
