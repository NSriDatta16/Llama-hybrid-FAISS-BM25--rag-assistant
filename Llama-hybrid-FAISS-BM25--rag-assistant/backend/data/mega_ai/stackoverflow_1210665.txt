I am not a lawyer, but I have been looking into this. As an author of software, be it a patch or a new bit of functionality you hold full copyright to your source code. You can decide how to license it or who to license it to. When someone contributes source to your project you should at least get an email from them saying what terms their code is licensed under. For example, if you have an MIT project, and someone contributes a patch that is GPL, you are in a pretty big pickle. To accept it you would have to re-license your project under the GPL. So, first things first: Get something in writing from the contributor that explains what license his contribution is covered under. Lots of open source projects would like the leverage to change open source licenses, say for example you want to re-license under GPLv3. You will have to contact every contributor to do that, some of them may be unreachable, and again you will be in a bit of a pickle. To combat that many large open source projects have a JCA (Joint Copyright Assignment), which in tech speak mean: "All your contributions belong to us" (See for example suns contributor agreement: http://www.openoffice.org/licenses/sca.pdf ) When a JCA is in place your source can have the simple copyright: "Copyright (C) 2009 Yan Cheng Cheok yccheok@yahoo.com" because you are the copyright holder. If there is no JCA in place I think stuff is a little messy, you need to amend the files and place the right contributor names on the right files. Or better still only maintain a single License.txt and have all the acknowledgments in one spot. So to avoid all this hassle the easiest thing is to: Get a JCA in place The year on the copyright doc does not mean it expires in the subsequent year.
