Linq to Sql for counting and averaging a set of data (no grouping)

I would like to execute a Linq to Sql statement that captures the count and average in a (filtered) set of data. What I have works, but it requires two queries to the database when it should be possible in one query. Interestingly enough, I can get one query to be emitted when I use a group by clause. For example: select count(*), avg(duration) from events My linq looks like this: var x = from e in db.events select e; x = from i in x where i.NAME == "foo" select i; return new { count = x.Count(), avgDuration = x.Average(e => e.Duration) }; With that code I get two queries: SELECT AVG([t0].[DURATION]) AS [value] FROM [dbo].[EVENTS] AS [t0] and SELECT COUNT(*) AS [value] FROM [dbo].[EVENTS] AS [t0] Is there another way?
