Does Android (Cupcake) already use Skyhook Wireless for localization?

I have just been integrating the Skyhook Wireless technology into my Android application. This is the localization framework that gives a better localization by looking for wifi hotspots. As a result the position is better, at least indoors when it can find a hotspot. On the downside the library is around 300kb of size on the device. Now in Cupcake when I look at "Security & location" settings, there is an option named "Use wireless networks". This seems to be exactly the same as Skyhooks technology. However, I cant find any useful information about what kind of localization this is and weather it makes sense to drop the 300 kb library. Is Skyhook already integrated into Cupcake?
