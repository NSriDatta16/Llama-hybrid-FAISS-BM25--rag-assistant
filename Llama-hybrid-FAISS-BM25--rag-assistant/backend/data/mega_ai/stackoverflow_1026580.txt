Check out the boost serialization library. This will allow you to dump your files to xml which you can then diff for each version. In order to create your test cases, if you're not already doing so, use gcov to work out the coverage though your functions. This will at least ensure that you've got all statements covered in your function. Unit Testing When we're testing legacy code that is missing fixtures, we sometimes use a middle ground approach. What we have is a slightly modified version of our application, which performs the usual tasks, but can also perform tests on functions. It's not unit testing in the strict sense as you have to assume that the rest of the library is correct, however, it does allow you at least to do more testing than may be possible with regression/system tests.
