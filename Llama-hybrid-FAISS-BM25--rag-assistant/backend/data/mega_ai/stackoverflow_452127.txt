Well, code can get pretty hard to understand and maintain just due to sheer volume if it gets large enough (see most Java code). If all else (performance, etc.) is equal and the difference in length between the simple and complex algorithm is really drastic, I'd always go with the complex but concise and elegant algorithm over the simple but verbose one. Assuming both algorithms are proven to be correct, the one with less if statements and less code overall is less likely to have subtle implementation bugs and therefore less likely to ever require maintenance. If I were a maintainer, I'd much rather spend my time learning a new algorithm than learning how someone implemented some ridiculously long but boring algorithm.
