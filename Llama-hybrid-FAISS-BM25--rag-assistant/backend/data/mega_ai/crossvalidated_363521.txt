Reinforcement learning, how can I get the entropy of an distribution?

I read a paper Multi-Agent Actor-Critic for Mixed Cooperative-Competitive Environments , and I found the approximate policy is learned by maximizing the log probability of agent $j$â€™s actions, with an entropy regularizer In general, what is entropy regularizer in reinforcement learning?
