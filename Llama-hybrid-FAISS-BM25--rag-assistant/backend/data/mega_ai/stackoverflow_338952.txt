The big question is: Where are you calling NSAppleEventManager's -setEventHandler:...? You need to call this before your app finishes launching if you want to catch a URL that started your app. If your app delegate is created in your MainMenu.nib, then either its -init or -awakeFromNib methods will work, but, for example, -applicationDidFinishLaunching: won't. Also, make sure that the selector you provide to -setEventHandler: is exactly the same as your method name, paying particular attention to capitalization and the proper number of colons. Obviously, if you posted your app delegate's relevant code, it would be quite helpful.
