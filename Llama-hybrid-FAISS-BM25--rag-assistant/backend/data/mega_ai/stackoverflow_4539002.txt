Backbutton webbrowser + expired content = refresh

I have the following in my .Net code: Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.NoCache) When the users use the back button of Internet Explorer, they get a content expired warning. They need to hit F5 to reload the page. Can I make adjustments so there is no caching, but with an automatic refresh so the warning isn't displayed? Regards, M.
