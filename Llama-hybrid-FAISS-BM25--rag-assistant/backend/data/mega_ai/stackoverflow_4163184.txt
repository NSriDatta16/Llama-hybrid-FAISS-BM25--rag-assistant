SqlConnections are implemented in .net using a connection pool. You do not need to worry about the management of the connections themselves. The only requirement on you is that adfter you open them you call .close. .net will manage the rest for you in an efficient way. If you wanted to run multiple queries simultaneously then you can call the sqlcommand wtih begin invoke and end invoke. By using both of these you cna work at a level that does not require you to mange the threads whilst gettting a multi threaded behaviour. However you shuold read up on ADO.Net because a lot of what you are talking about is unnecessary when you kow how it works. as for dataset or datareader that depends on your problem, Dataset is a very heavy object though, datareaders are lightweight and fast that allow you to populate a collection fairly easily. I prefer using linq2sql though or entity framework. ADO.Net is kinda fragile because you ahve to do a lot of casting on data adn manual mapping onto objects that is prone to errors at run time rather than compile time.
