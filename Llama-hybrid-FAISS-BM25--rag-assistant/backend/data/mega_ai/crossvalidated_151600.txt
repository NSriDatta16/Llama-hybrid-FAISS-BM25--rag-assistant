Logistic regression w/ categorical predictors, and all residuals must be nonnegative

Has anyone written a package for R that can do a logistic regression over categorical variables (like glm ) but with the constraint, and I do realize this is weird, that all the residuals must be nonnegative? (In response space, not link space. In other words, the predicted probability in each cell must come out less than or equal to the observed probability in that cell.) Alternatively, is there a straightforward way to transform a glm problem so that it will come out with nonnegative residuals? I know I can probably persuade optim to do what I want but if a shortcut exists that sure would be nice.
