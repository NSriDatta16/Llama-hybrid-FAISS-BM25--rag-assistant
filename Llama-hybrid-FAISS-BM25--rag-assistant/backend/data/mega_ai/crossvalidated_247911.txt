Non-linear dimensionality reduction occurs when method used for reduction assumes that manifold on which latent variables are lying is, well... non-linear. So for linear methods manifold is a n-dimensional plane, i.e. affine surface, for non-linear methods it's not. "Manifold learning" term usually means geometrical/topological methods that learn non-linear manifold. So we can think about manifold learning as a subset of non-linear dimensionality reduction methods.
