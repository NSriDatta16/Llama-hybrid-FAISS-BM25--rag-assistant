What kind of Mac driver should I need to build in order to intercept the file system?

In the Windows world I can create a file system filter (upper or lower) in order to hook my driver to action when a file is changed (for example auditing or creating virtual drives). Do you know which is the similar model in a Mac? the I/O Kit talks about driver development but does not specify the storage model or file system. Is there another kit?
