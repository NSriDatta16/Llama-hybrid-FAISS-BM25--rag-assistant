Supervised, semi-supervised, or unsupervised? Confused

BACKGROUND: Consider the problem in cybersecruity that consists of classifying domain names as either malicious or legitimate based on various features such as the URL string, the name of the registrant, the HTML content, the IP address, etc. Without the use of machine learning, this would typically be done by a simple lookup to a black list of domains that have been manually reported as harboring malware. Any new domain which hasn't been seen before is then, by default, considered as legitimate. (This would be the case for the overwhelming majority of domains unless, say, one of them is reported as malicious, at which point it will be moved to the black list.) In addition to the fact that this approach is expensive in terms of human involvement and has no predictive power, it also leads to false negatives from new domains that are malicious and haven't been blacklisted yet false negatives from old domains that are malicious but managed to evade detection through human error false positives from old domains that are legitimate but were wrongly blacklisted through human error QUESTION: Can machine learning be of any use here? I.e., can it outperform the accuracy of manual black lists and at the same use them as training targets? At first glance, one should use the the black lists to train a classifier in a supervised fashion. This could presumably automate the classification such that (1) above is mitigated. It is however much less obvious how that it can mitigate (2) and (3). The alternative is to use a full-fledged unsupervised technique such as k-means. But then again, it seems that not exploiting the human labels provided by the black lists is a waste of precious information. K-means is furthermore prone to capture clusters that have little to do with maliciousness. So which method would be the most robust? Should this be a supervised or unsupervised problem? As for semi-supervised, what would that mean exactly in this case?
