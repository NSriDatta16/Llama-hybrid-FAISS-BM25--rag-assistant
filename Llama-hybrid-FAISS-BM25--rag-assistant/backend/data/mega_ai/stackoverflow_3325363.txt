I believe Python is more of a very practical, pragmatic language. Concepts which offer value to the developer are put in, without too much consideration about theological concepts like "proper OO design" and stuff. It's a language for people who have real work to do. I think Python is suitable for all kinds of environments, though Desktop is a bit difficult due to the lack of a single framework. For all applications it's handy to use a framework, like NumPy for computational stuff, Twisted or Django for web stuff, and WxWidgets or other for Desktop stuff.
