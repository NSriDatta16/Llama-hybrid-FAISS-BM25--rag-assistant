I don't know for C but I do it every day in Objective-C, where I have comments such as: /// This method perform the following operations: - (void) myMethodWith: (id) anObjectArgument { /// - do op1 [self op1]; /// - do op2 op2(anObjectArgument); } which renders as: This method performs the following operations: do op1 do op2 Edit: following comment by Dana the Sane, concerning my understanding of Doxygen documentation and why it is not in contradiction with my experience. As far as I understand and interpret the Doxygen documentation, this is not in contradiction with the quote provided by Aaron Saarela . At the begining of the link he provides, there is a paragraph about in-body documentation: For each code item there are two (or in some cases three) types of descriptions, which together form the documentation: a brief description and detailed description, both are optional. For methods and functions there is also a third type of description, the so called "in body" description, which consists of the concatenation of all comment blocks found within the body of the method or function. This means that is it OK to put Doxygen documentation in a function or method body. This is what I described on top of my answer. In my opinion, the paragraph quoted by Aaron refers to documentation which is usually put in front of function or method declaration or implementaiton. This is the one that describes parameters, return values and so on. That heading documentation cannot be put inside the body of a function or method. But detailed documentation concerning each step of an algorithm inside a body is perfectly handled by Doxygen.
