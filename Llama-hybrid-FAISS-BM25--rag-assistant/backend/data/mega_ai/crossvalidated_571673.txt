Should I change the dataset to one with less zeros on the independent variable?

I'm running a spatial econometrics model and one of my explanatory variables is sewage coverage, which is 0 for 42% of the cities in the country of analysis. I've been told to reduce the focus of the study to a richer part of the country, where sewage coverage would have less zeros and therefore reduce bias in the estimators. Is it really a problem?
