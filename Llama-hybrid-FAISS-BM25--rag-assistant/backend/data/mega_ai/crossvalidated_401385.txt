the softmax function is also used in discrete choice modelling, it is same as the logit model, if u assume there is a utility function associated with each class, and the utility function equals to the output of neural network + an error term following the Gumbel distribution, the probability of belonging to a class equals to the softmax function with neural network as input. See: https://eml.berkeley.edu/reprints/mcfadden/zarembka.pdf there is alternatives to the logit model, such as the probit model, where the error term is assumed to follow standard normal distribution, which is a better assumption. however, the likelihood would be intractable and is computational expensive to solve, therefore not commonly used in neural network
