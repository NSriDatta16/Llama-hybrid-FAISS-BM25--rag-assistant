I would assume that navigator.language returns it's interface language (I assume is GB English), not one that it wants documents in. User-agent string too report which version of firefox was downloaded. Accept-language is what destination server should check. I consider this behavior of his quite correct (assuming that it's interface (menus and such) are really in GB english).
