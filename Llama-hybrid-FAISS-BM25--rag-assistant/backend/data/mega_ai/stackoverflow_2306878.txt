I think you shouldn't worry about that yet, if you don't know for what scale you will have to optimize your application anyway. Solution 1) sounds not very nice. If you want to go with something like that you should really go with a non relational database like CouchDB (I just found a nice tutorial for it today) since it stores JSON right away (and you can sort and select it with Views defined in JavaScript). It is not only for sites that have millions of users (though it indeed scales very easily). You should just try it yourself not regarding all the "buzz" and anti-"buzz" around it and just see if it might be useful for your application or not. And maybe you should just go with the RDBMS. They are still extremely fast (well maybe you will get in trouble if you have like Facebook 50TB of Inbox data to organize and search) and you will be surprised what a properly defined index can do for the performance. And there is a lot of RDBMS knowledge and good tools so that it is quite easy to use. In a well designed application you should imho easily be able to switch the underlying database implementation anyway.
