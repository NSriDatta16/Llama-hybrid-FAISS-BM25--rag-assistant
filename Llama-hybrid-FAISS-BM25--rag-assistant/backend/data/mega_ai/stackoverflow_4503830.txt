How do I calculate the averages of all the columns?

I am working on a table with over 100 columns, many of them are boolean in case this is relevant, as I need to use avg(variable_name::int) to take each boolean column average. Now, I want to take the average of all columns at the same time. How do I do that ? Thank you very much. I'll try to be more clear: I want all the averages of all variables from A to ZZ. Some of them are integers, some are booleans, that's the sole reason why I mencioned the booleans. PK A **** GZ *** ZZ -------------------------- 1 T **** F *** T 2 T **** F *** T 3 F **** T *** T 4 F **** F *** F 5 T **** F *** T
