Identifiability in a nonlinear regression problem

Suppose I'm working with the following model $y_i = \alpha(1-\exp(-\beta t_i))+\gamma(1-\exp(-\delta t_i)) + \varepsilon_i$. The $\varepsilon_i$ are i.i.d. gaussian with zero mean and I'm trying to find best fit values of $\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta$. For concreteness, say this is a model for the total amount of some bacterial species with two subspecies who grow in time according to the first and second terms on the RHS, but we only measure the total population. Note: this is not the actual setting, but suffices for the question. The model is not identifiable in the usual sense since I can always just swap $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ for example and get exactly the same density/likelihood. As you might expect, if I run an MCMC on this I end up with horribly wide posteriors, and any nonlinear least squares approach is incredibly sensitive to initial guesses -- we have a big plateau in the likelihood function. Better experimental design is not an option at this stage -- obviously measuring the subspecies separately would be the best option. Is there anything I can do with this problem, or is better experimental design the only option?
