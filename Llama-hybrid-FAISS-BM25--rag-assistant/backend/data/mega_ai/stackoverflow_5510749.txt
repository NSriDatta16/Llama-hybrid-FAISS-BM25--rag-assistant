i looked into xslt and dont really see any reason to why it would be used in small or big applications. pretty much of what it is doing can be done with css, javascript/jquery or server side. Well, firstly, most of the people using XSLT are indeed using it server side. Client-side XSLT has never really taken off - for some of the reasons, see my paper at XML Prague 2011 (last week) - the main reason is that it's never been available on EVERY browser. I'm hoping to change the situation with a new product Saxon-CE, but I don't want to turn this into an advertisement. Secondly, the point about XSLT isn't that it can do things that other technologies can't do, it's that it does what it does much more effectively. If you need to transform XML documents into other XML documents or into HTML, XSLT is by far the most effective way of doing it, once you have got up the learning curve. It's true that with the advent of jQuery, doing this in Javascript isn't quite the nightmare it once was, but the declarative rule-based approach of XSLT has many benefits especially when you have to handle change and variety which always exists in both small and large projects.
