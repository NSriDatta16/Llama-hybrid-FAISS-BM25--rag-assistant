I see many amazing answers, and I don't know how an humble self made classification may be received, but I don't know any all-comprensive book of all statistics to show the summary of, and I do think that, as @mkt brillantly commented, a classification of a study field can be useful. So, here is my shot: descriptive statistics simple inference simple hypothesis testing plotting/data visualization sampling design experimental design survey design multivariate statistics (unsipervised) clustering component analysis latent variables models linear models (which are actually multivariate as well) ordinary least squares generalized linear models logit model other linear models Cox model quantile regression multivariate inference multiple hypothesis testing adjusted hypothesis testing models for structured data mixed effects models spacial models time series models non linear extensions generalized additive models bayesian statistics (actually bayesian methods exist for many things I already listed) non parametric regression and classification many machine learning methods fit here Of course this is over-simplicistic, it is only meant to get some idea straight to someone who barely knows the field, each of us here surely knows that there are a lot of methods in between the categories up here, many others I didn't list because they are less famous or because I simply forgot. Hope you like it.
