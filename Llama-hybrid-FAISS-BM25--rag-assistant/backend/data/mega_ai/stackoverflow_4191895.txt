The general purpose i've found with using {$var} is that it tells PHP to explicitly reference what is inside as a variable. It's most used when doing something like $qry = "UPDATE table SET field = '{$var['myvar']}'"; or $qry = "UPDATE table SET field = '{$var->property}'"; Without the {} around my variable inside the string, it wouldn't know when the variable began and ended and usually causes PHP to throw an error.
