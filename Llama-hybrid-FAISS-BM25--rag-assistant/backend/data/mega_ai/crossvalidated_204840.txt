Possible machine learning methodology to implement both continuous features and features with descrete values in the same model

I would like to implement a machine learning procedure, in order to predict a categorical binary outcome. However, my main concern, is the different "nature" of my features: while a proportion of my features have discrete binary values, such as "yes" or "no", the others are essentially continuous numeric variables. Thus, as im mainly working in R, is there a package or methodology that can handle both "types" of features into training a classifier ? or i have to separare my data set into two datasets, each comprised of the different type of features ?
