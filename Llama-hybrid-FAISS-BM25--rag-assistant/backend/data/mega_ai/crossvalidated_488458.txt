Counterintuitive coefficients in elastic net logistic regression

In a model run of elastic net logistic regression, I encountered a very counterintuitive coefficient. I have looked into the data, model and script, but, I still cannot seem to wrap my head around the counter-intuitiveness I see regarding the dependent and independent variable. Initially, the V7 should be negative, as it is significantly lower in the dependent variable where the outcome is 1 compared to the outcome of 0, see graph. Further, the descriptive statistics are: Value 0 Value 1 count 749304.000000 402.000000 mean 2.762876 1.618396 std 3.672386 2.488794 min 0.000000 0.000000 25% 0.306000 0.001500 50% 1.662000 0.638250 75% 3.901500 2.338500 max 223.084500 17.217000 But, I end up with coefficients that show the following, here, one should keep an eye on variable number 7 (V7), which I am talking about. (Intercept) -3.096141e+01 V1 1.436113e-03 V2 -1.774919e-01 V3 -5.586214e-04 V4 -1.763915e-03 V5 6.817795e-03 V6 3.986299e-02 **V7 3.085392e-02** V8 -1.117509e-02 V9 6.917977e-02 Why do I see that coefficient V7 is positive when it clearly is smaller in cases of 1 than cases of 0 in the dependent variable? Do I misinterpret the results of my elastic net regression? I doubt it, as the other variables are intuitively correct? The script is below: library(readr) library(caret) library(tidyverse) library(glmnet) library(ROCR) library(pROC) library(doParallel) registerDoParallel(4, cores = 4) set.seed(123) df % createDataPartition(p = 0.8, list = FALSE) train
