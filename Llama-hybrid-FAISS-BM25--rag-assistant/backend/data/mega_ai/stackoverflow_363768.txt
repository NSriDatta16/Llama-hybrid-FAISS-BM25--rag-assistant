Disable DTD warning for Ant scripts in Eclipse?

I'm using Eclipse Ganymede . Everything works fine, but I have an anal-retentive yearning for a warning-free Problems tab. Right now it (correctly) complains about my Ant scripts: "No grammar constraints (DTD or XML schema) detected for the document." Is there any way to turn that off for just those files? Ideally I'd like it to still warn me if my other schema-constrained files were missing the schema declarations.
