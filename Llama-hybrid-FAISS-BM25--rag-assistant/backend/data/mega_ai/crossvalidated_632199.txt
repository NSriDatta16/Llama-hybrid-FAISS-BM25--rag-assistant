Clarification. " $U(-1, 1)$ " in your question should be understood as $P(Z = \pm 1) = \frac{1}{2}$ , instead of the continuous uniform random variable (but please note that the notation " $U(-1, 1)$ " is typically reserved for the continuous uniform random variable whose range is $(-1, 1)$ , so do not use it for the Rademacher variable). This interpretation is based on the fact that $ZX$ cannot be $N(0, 1)$ if $Z$ is the continuous $U(-1, 1)$ random variable, see Addendum for the proof. Given that, your provided answer works: for $X + ZX = 0$ implies $X = 0$ or $Z = -1$ . On the other hand $P(X = 0) = 0$ , which implies that \begin{align*} P(X + ZX = 0) &= P(X = 0) + P(Z = -1) - P(X = 0, Z = -1) \\ &= 0 + P(Z = -1) - 0 = \frac{1}{2}. \end{align*} Here is another way of showing $(X, ZX)$ is non-Gaussian using proof by contradiction. If $(X, ZX)$ was Gaussian, then because $X$ and $ZX$ are uncorrelated (as a result of $\operatorname{Cov}(X, ZX) = E[X^2Z] = E[X^2]E[Z] = 0$ ), they must be independent (this is due to that for a Gaussian vector, uncorrelation between components is equivalent to their independence). This would imply that $X^2$ and $(ZX)^2$ are independent too, hence $$E[X^2 (ZX)^2] = E[X^2]E[(ZX)^2].$$ However, $E[X^2(ZX)^2] = E[X^4]E[Z^2] = 3 \times 1 = 3$ , while $E[X^2]E[(ZX)^2] = 1 \times 1 = 1$ , contradiction. Addendum Note that if $Z \sim U(-1, 1)$ (continuous), then $E(Z^2) = \frac{1}{3}$ , this implies that $$\operatorname{Var}(ZX) = E(Z^2X^2) = E[Z^2]E[X^2] = \frac{1}{3} \neq 1, $$ hence $ZX$ is not $N(0, 1)$ . In fact, $ZX$ cannot be normally distributed: suppose $ZX \sim N(0, \frac{1}{3})$ (for its variance has to be $\frac{1}{3}$ , as shown in the preceding paragraph), then on one hand, based on $\sqrt{3}ZX \sim N(0, 1)$ , we have $E[(ZX)^4] = \frac{1}{9}E[(\sqrt{3}ZX)^4)] = \frac{3}{9} = \frac{1}{3}$ . On the other hand, by the independence of $Z^4$ and $X^4$ and $E[Z^4] = \int_{-1}^1z^4\frac{1}{2}dz = \int_0^1z^4dz = \frac{1}{5}$ , we have $E[(ZX)^4] = E[Z^4]E[X^4] = \frac{3}{5}$ . This contradiction shows that $ZX \not\sim N(0, \frac{1}{3})$ either.
