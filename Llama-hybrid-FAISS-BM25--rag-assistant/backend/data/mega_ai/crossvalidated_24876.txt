What is the best training method for 15-30k records with 5-12 features to classify data into 2 groups?

I don't know if this is a suitable question here. I have data from 2 groups, neutral and positive. Here how the data looks like A 02.840 00.960 00.950 00.995 00.995 00.602 1 B 04.730 01.000 01.000 00.999 01.000 01.000 1 C NULL 00.970 00.005 00.078 00.987 00.000 0 D NULL 01.000 01.000 00.010 00.675 00.451 1 E 00.530 01.000 00.022 00.231 00.443 00.000 0 The first column is the record name/ID and the last column is its class/group. The six columns in the middle are the features which some of them might be NULL. With the knowledge that I studied years ago, I'm gonna try ANN and SVM first. But I'm not sure if I am on the right track. So I wonder if anyone here can guide me.
