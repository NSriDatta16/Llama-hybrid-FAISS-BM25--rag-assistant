The presence of so many drop targets seems to make the performance so slow. If possible, try setting the table as a single drop target and calculate the target table cell based on the position data in the drop event. Unfortunately, you will also lose the ability to apply styles to individual cells on dragOver and dragOut events. Edit: Another suggestion is to disable droppable on all tds and upon mouseover of a tr, enable the droppables of tds present in the specific tr (and disable them back upon mouseout of tr). Sounds like a hack, but worth a try.
