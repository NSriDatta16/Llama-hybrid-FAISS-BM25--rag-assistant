You are casting a FARPROC (function pointer with no args) to a function pointer with args. Normally this is a hugely dumb thing to do that will probably result in stack corruption. Now it turns out that GetProcAddress() doesn't really return a FARPROC and you do actually know what you're doing -- but the compiler doesn't know that and it feels obliged to warn you. The only way you can silence it is using a #pragma or a compiler switch to turn off the warning. It is ugly and messy, but that is Windows programming for you. :-)
