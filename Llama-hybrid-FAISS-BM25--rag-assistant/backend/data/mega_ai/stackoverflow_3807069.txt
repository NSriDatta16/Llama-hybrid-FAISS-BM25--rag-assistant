.NET/Security: Limiting runtime-loaded assemblies from accessing certain APIs

In a shell application, I need to be able to load and execute other .NET assemblies at runtime, but without giving them full trust. Essentially, I want to limit them (the loaded assemblies) from touching any system resources (threading, networking, etc), with the only exception being isolated storage. However, assemblies which are from "me" need to be executed with full trust. I've been considering Code Access Security, but I'm not quite sure it's what I should use. How would you go about this?
