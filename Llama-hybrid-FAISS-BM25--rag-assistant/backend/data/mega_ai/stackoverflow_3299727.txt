You can't use the classes from a parent project. Content is not inherited, only configuration (the pom). In a parent / child relationship, the parent project usually has packaging pom, as it specifies configuration, but has no content. What you can do is add a dependency in the child project MY_App MY_PARENT 1.0-SNAPSHOT war but packaging a war inside a war is not really elegant. The proper thing to do this in maven would be to have three modules common war1 war2 where common has packaging jar and includes all java classes used by both other projects and both war1 and war2 reference common as dependency.
