Are there programming languages designed to use only speech for input?

I am interested in developing a domain-specific language which could be driven only by speech input. Are there examples of programming languages designed specifically for speech-only input? We can assume some form of feedback and storage (for humans), probably a screen although I'd also be interested in languages which have no feedback. I'd be interested in both formal grammars and natural language input.
