I was about to ask 'have you tried this in Safari?', since Chrome and Safari both use the webkit engine. Take a look at the .js file. function showToolTip(e,text){ /* blah blah*/ var st = Math.max(document.body.scrollTop,document.documentElement.scrollTop); if(navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase().indexOf('safari')>=0)st=0; /**** THIS ****/ var leftPos = e.clientX - 100; /*etc.*/ } It has a fix applied specifically to Safari, using the userAgent string. Chrome sends 'Safari' in the user agent string, too, so it will apply that to Chrome also. This is generally considered a poor practice. In general, I'd say the scripts from dhtmlgoodies are very outdated. Is this fix still needed for newer webkit renderers? Who knows. You might try commenting it out and seeing if that fixes it.
