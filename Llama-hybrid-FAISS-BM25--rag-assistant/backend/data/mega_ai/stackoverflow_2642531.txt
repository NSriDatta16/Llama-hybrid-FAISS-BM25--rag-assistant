Try: $agent = getenv("HTTP_USER_AGENT"); if (preg_match("/MSIE/i", $agent)) { $result = "You are using Microsoft Internet Explorer"; } else if (preg_match("/Mozilla/i", $agent)) { $result = "You are using Mozilla firefox"; } else { $result = "you are using $agent"; } echo $result; Two things: You had a semi-colon at the end of your if clauses. That means the subsequent opening brace was a local block that is always executed. That caused a problem because later you had an else statement that wasn't attached to an if statement; and Doing "$agent" is unnecessary and not recommended. Simply pass in $agent .
