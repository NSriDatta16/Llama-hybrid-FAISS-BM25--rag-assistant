Data Science Conferences w/ Poster Sessions?

I am in search of some data science conferences (for 2017) that have a mix of big name speakers and poster sessions. Ideally, I would like to be able to present a poster that doesn't necessarily have to be a research paper, but simply the development of a tool and its use. Please provide the name and link. Thank you!
