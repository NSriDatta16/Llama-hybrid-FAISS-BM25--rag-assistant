Does the .net framework limit how much memory can be used by a single process (on a 32 bit system)? If so I can see why, but what doesn't make sense is that the application is only using 1.6GB and there is still ~1GB left to the system.

My first guess was that some fragmentation is going on, but I dropped everything except the code below, and it still happens. I don't think this little snippet could create a lot of fragmentation, but I'm probably wrong. List blah = new List (); for (int i = 0; i
