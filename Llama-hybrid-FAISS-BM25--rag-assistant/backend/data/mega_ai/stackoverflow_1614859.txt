New Java applet plugin not being used?

I am deploying a signed & trusted applet. We need to run the applet in a separate JVM & increase the heap size. Setting separate_jvm & java_arguments works on our local boxes. Curiously we have clients that though they are using 1.6.0_15 don't seem to be running the new plugin architecture. When I check their Java config, "use next-generation plugin" is checked & IE7's option "use Java 1.6.0_15 for applet plugin" is also checked. Nothing seems obviously wrong. The Java console also reports the correct version, but neither separate_jvm nor java_arguments are respected. Just as a sanity check we wrapped the applet in a JNLP & set up our web page to serve the applet with a jnlp_href . The applet tag had a bogus code parameter to ensure the JVM was actually running the JNLP. The Java console complains that it cannot find the bogus class when it should be properly loading the JNLP. Are there security settings or something else that might cause what I'm seeing?
