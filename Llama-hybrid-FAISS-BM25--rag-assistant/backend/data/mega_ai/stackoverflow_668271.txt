Solution Folders and Toolbox Items incompatible?

In Visual Studio 2005, I've recently reorganized a solution with over 30 projects into 5 solution folders. However, since I've done that, all the custom controls and user controls from my assemblies have disappeared from the WinForms Toolbox. Has anyone experienced this? Are there workarounds? Is this fixed in Visual 2008? I've tried to reset the toolbox, but it still does not populate the toolbox properly.
