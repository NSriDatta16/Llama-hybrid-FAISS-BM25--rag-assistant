I recently answered in Why does topology rarely come up outside of topology? that pure mathematics (topology) can be useful in data science. I believe that mixed skills are required for data science: programming (computer science, algorithmics), practicing (statistics, signal processing), theorizing (logic, mathematics). You can get a metromap of data science skills , which are numerous. metro map of data scientist skills I believe that it can be better to learn first what is more difficult, and what you cannot easily learn by yourself or with online lecture. A little bit of math seems interesting, it can give you (if properly chosen) fuel for the future, by learning abstractions you rarely learn elsewhere.
