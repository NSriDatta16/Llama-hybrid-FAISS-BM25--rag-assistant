Determine Mobile Internet Explorer version

I need to determine the version of Mobile Internet Explorer on a Windows Mobile 6.1 device. So that I can report the same user-agent string as is being used by Mobile Internet Explorer. The user-agent string format has recently been changed to include version information. My application is running on the Windows Mobile device creating a browser shell using the WebBrowser control. The ObtainUserAgentString() API is not returning the same value as Mobile Internet Explorer is using. When I try to get the version information from "IExplore.exe", GetFileVersionInfoSize() is returning 0, with a GetLastError() of 0x716. Most likely because IE Mobile is XIP. Is there another way to determine the Mobile Internet Explorer version?
