Keeping DRY between Javascript and CSS

Say you've got a menu that toggles open and closed with a button. My standard way of going about this would be to write the CSS for a closed menu, and write Javascript that specifies (or animates to) an open menu state. Lately I've gotten into Active.js, a client-side MVC framework. It provides for view classes with builders for making DOM fragments, and those fragments can be given methods that handle things like animation and DOM state. Something feels wonky about describing the initial state in CSS, and then describing alternate states in JavaScript. Without animation, it would be sensible to just do it all in CSS and just use javascript to add or remove DOM classes. My other idea is to describe all of the states (folded, unfolded, red, green) of a DOM object in JSON (rather than CSS) and give my ActionView object methods for animating between those states. Is anybody doing this? Other ideas?
