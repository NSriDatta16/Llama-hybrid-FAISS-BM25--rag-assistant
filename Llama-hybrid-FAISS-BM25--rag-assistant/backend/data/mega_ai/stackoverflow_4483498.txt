Library for Bayesian Networks

Hello fellow Number crunchers As the headline suggests, I am looking for a library for learning and inference of Bayesian Networks. I have already found some, but I am hoping for a recommendation. Requirements in a quick overview: preferably written in Java or Python configuration (also of the network itself) is a) possible and b) possible via code (and not solely via a GUI). source code available project is still maintained the more powerful, the better Which one do you recommend ?
