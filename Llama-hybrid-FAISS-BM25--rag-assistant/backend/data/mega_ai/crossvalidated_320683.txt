Measuring the aggregate ... "we" vs "I"

I am involved with a project measuring organizational behavior. My colleagues are split in terms of measures reading "we feel..." vs "I feel..." as the subject of the measurement. Personally, I think we should focus on the "I" to avoid error associated with people mindreading, so to speak. We use multilevel modeling so this just seems to make most sense. (Others may aggregate to means and other descriptive without hlm, however). What are opinions on this issue? Best practices for measurement of a cluster... do we want individual perceptions or individual perceptions of what most people within the cluster think? References appreciated.
