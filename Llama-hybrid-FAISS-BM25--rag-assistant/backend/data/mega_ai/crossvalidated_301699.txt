I'm not sure why you want to divide it into "top 10" and "other" but, if you do, then logistic regression is correct. But your dependent variable will not be "record" but, rather, "top 10" which will be coded "1" and "0" or something similar. Then there will be only one estimated probability and it will be binomial logistic regression. If you wanted to predict actual rank (1st, 2nd, 3rd .... ) then it would be interesting. You might try an ordinal logistic regression, but it's a lot of categories since there are so many teams in the NBA. You might try an OLS regression for that problem.
