Multiple Datasources in DataGrid (ASP.NET)

I wonder if we can implement and fetch data from different datasources into a DataGrid. Let's say for example i have a 3 stored procedures: What I did is drag 3 datasources and configured it in each stored procedures. 1st stored procedures : returns @id and @name 2nd stored procedures : returns @name, @server and @location 3rd stored procedures : returns @age and @years and I want only to show @id from 1st SPROC, @server from 2nd SRPOC and @age from 3rd SPROC, and bind it to one DataGrid. Thanks.
