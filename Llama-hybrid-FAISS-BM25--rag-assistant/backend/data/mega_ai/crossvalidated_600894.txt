The simple approach that you mention can be a great place to start. Another good place to start is with a simple barplot (or dotplot) of the data that may show major differences or that even if there is a statistically significant difference, there is no practical difference. Sometimes in these comparisons the differences in shape end up being more interesting than the difference in mean/median. You are correct to be concerned if the differences are not all equal. A couple of other approaches to try (both will probably need some self study on your part if you are not already familiar with them). First, proportional odds logistic regression. This is used for ordered categorical data where there is a definite order (A > B > ... > F), but the differences between groups is not necessarily the same. Grade, as an ordered category, would be the response and group would be the predictor variable. Second, Interval Censoring methods (this usually is covered as part of survival analysis, failure time analysis, or reliability). This would assume that each grade represents a range of scores (or percentage of max score), e.g. A means the student earned more than 94%, A- 90%-94%, B+ 87%-90%, ..., F Both techniques have similarities under the hood and in some cases are used as approximations for each other.
