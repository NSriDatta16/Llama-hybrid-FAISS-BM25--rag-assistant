In Standard Monte Carlo integration, as you correctly state, you draw samples from a distribution and approximate some expectation using the sample average rather than calculating a difficult or intractable integral. So you are exploiting the Strong Law of Large Numbers to do this: \begin{equation} \mathbb{E}_{\pi} [t(\boldsymbol{\theta})] = \int t(\boldsymbol{\theta}) \pi(\boldsymbol{\theta})d\boldsymbol{\theta} \approx \sum_{i=1}^n t(\boldsymbol{\theta}_i) \end{equation} where each $\boldsymbol{\theta}_i \sim \pi$, provided $n$ is suitably large. The problem is that in some cases you can't actually draw samples from $\pi$ directly - if you only know $c\pi$ for example, where $c$ is some unknown constant. This often happens in Bayesian Inference problems, where we have $posterior \propto likelihood \times prior$. Here one approach is to use some sort of re-sampling method, whereby we draw samples from some distribution $q$, and then adjust them in some way to make inferences about $\pi$. In rejection sampling, for example, some samples from $q$ are rejected, so that those remaining resemble a data set that would be likely under $\pi$. In importance sampling, the samples from $q$ are weighted based on their importance in inferring information about $\pi$. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is another re-sampling technique, but this time samples are dependent on each other in some way. This can help or hinder inference, but crucially in high-dimensional problems MCMC methods can often be much more efficient than rejection sampling or importance sampling, so have become popular here.
