Most of jQuery UI uses the same general format for destroying the bindings and setup done, or altering options post setup. jQuery UI/Draggable Destroying a draggable: $("#bubble1").draggable('destroy'); Changing an Option: $("#bubble1").draggable('option', 'scope', 'someNewValue'); Not really sure where your question was headed, I would think if you create a new bubble - you just setup the new bubble as a dropbabble, and change options on the old ones. As far as performance goes, I would think think any performance hits from "double binding" can be avoided if you destroy the old instance first, then set it back up, or just change an option in the draggable.
