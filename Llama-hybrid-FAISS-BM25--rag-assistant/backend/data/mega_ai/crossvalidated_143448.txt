Stein's Paradox and credibility theory

Stein's paradox says that The ordinary decision rule for estimating the mean of a multivariate Gaussian distribution is inadmissible under mean squared error risk in dimension at least 3 ( Wikipedia ) I am curious if there is a relationship between this and credibility theory (See also credibility theory for dummies ). They seem to me to be the same thing, just stated differently. For instance, suppose we have the batting averages of 18 baseball players for their first 45 times at bat during a season Efron,Morris . Both Credibility Theory and Stein's Paradox suggest that using these batting averages to project their end of season batting averages is not optimal; there is a better way to do this which uses the average of the 18 batting averages computed at the beginning of the season.
