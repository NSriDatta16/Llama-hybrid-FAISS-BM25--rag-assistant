Standardised beta coefficients vs standardised input

I am running a logistic regression and I both standardise and normalise my input to ensure that all the independent variables are homogenised. My friend is telling me that I need to activate the standardised beta coefficients in my regression code (STB in proc logistic, as shown below). Is there really a difference when I have already ensured that my independent variables are on common scale? I will be re-calibrating my beta coefficients to [0,1] scale where they add up to 1 to act as a score card but I am curious about standardised beta coefficients. Example code DATA baseball; SET sashelp.baseball; IF logsalary > 6.5 THEN flag = 1; ELSE flag = 0; RUN; PROC STDIZE DATA = BASEBALL METHOD = RANGE OUT = BASEBALL_S ; VAR CR:; RUN; PROC LOGISTIC DATA = baseball_s OUTEST=result; MODEL FLAG (event='1')= CR: /expb stb SELECTION=none rsquare OUTROC=roc ; RUN;
