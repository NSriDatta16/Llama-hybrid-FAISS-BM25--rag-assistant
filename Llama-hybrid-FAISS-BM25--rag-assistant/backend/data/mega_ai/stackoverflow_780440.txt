The best thing you can do for yourself is to use something better than Make. SCons is my tool of choice on POSIX systems. Boost also has a build tool that is very flexible, but I had a hard time wrapping my head around it. Oh, and if you want to use make, go ahead and build recursive makefiles. It really isn't that big a deal. I worked on a gigantic project using tons of recursive makefiles over the last three years, and it worked just fine.
