Is a count variable with a large, but finite, number of possible values categorical or continuous?

I have data containing some continuous and some categorical variables. I want to do logistic regression on them. I am getting confused over the distinction between categorical and continuous variables. I know that a categorical variable "is a variable that can take on one of a limited, and usually fixed, number of possible values. Still, I am having trouble distinguishing some of these variables". If I understand correctly the answers given here , non numerical data cannot be continuous, but are some numerical variables categorical? For instance, one of the variables is "number of days during which have done something". This variable has many possible outputs (from number of days = 1 to 10,000). The number of possible values is limited, yet very big. Is it a categorical or a continuous variable?
