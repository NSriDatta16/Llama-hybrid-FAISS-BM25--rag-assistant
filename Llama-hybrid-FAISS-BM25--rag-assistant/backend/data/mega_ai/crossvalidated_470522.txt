How to interpret brms output for binary logistic regression

So I have a binary response variable: $SP(0=\text{seronegative}, 1=\text{seropositive}, SP = \text{disease state})$ and I have just been playing around with my variables to understand what the output means. Here, I have so far, $Age (1=\text{Juvenile}, 2=\text{Sub Adult}, 3=\text{Adult})$ and $Sex (0=\text{Female}, 1=\text{Male})$ and I am slightly confused by the output as I don't see $Age\;1$ or $Female$ ? Are the results interpreted in this or how do I interpret this output? Thanks for helping! prior
