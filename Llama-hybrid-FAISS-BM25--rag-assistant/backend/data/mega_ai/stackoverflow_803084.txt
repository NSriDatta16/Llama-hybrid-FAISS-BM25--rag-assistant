Can i schedule a job in SQL Server 2000 MSDE?

We are currently evaluation our hosting options and the cheapest suitable option we've found only has SQL Server 2000 MSDE as the db server. Does this have the ability to schedule jobs using SQL Agent? If not, can I use a windows scheduled job to run scripts for me?
