I agree that this has little to do with linear regression. It has to do with all statistics. Where you gather and don't gather the data can also bias your results. There is a legitimate question to me if you can generalize from most results (something that much of the statistical literature pays little attention to), serious issues with data errors that I don't think gets adequate attention. Response rates on surveys for example are very low now (25 percent) -what about the 75 percent that do not respond. But what concerns me the most are the many articles/books that argue that there are flaws in various methods, most of which analyst are probably not aware of - does this invalidate past or present findings (how would I even know if I made one of these mistakes). At times the issues raised, such as if outliers invalidate key methods or whether analyst even understand the methods they use, worry me so much I have considered stop running statistics. One article that looked at the interpretation of logistic regression in elite medical journals found so many errors that I was stunned. I read a book once that argued essentially that much of the regression/ANOVA analysis done was entirely invalid given the impact of outliers (from a reputable source to). I read a multi-level analysis once that argued that for all grouped data all the linear models run had wrong SE.... :) I have read so many accounts of possible problems with statistical methods that (as essentially a non-academic analyst) it is pretty demoralizing.
