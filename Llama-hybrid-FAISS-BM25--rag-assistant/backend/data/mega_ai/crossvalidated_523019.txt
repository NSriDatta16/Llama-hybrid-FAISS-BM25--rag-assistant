Stationary distribution of a Markov chain with a random transition matrix

Consider a Markov chain $\{X_t\}$ on a finite state $\mathcal{S} = \{1,\dots, S\}$ space whose transition matrix $P$ is populated by elements of the form $$ p_{ij} = P(X_{t+1} = j | X_t = i)$$ and we know that the $S$ vector $p_i = (p_{i,1},\dots, p_{i,S})$ follows a Dirichlet distribution with concentration parameter $(\alpha_{i1},\dots,\alpha_{iS})$ , and this is true for $i \in \mathcal{S}$ . Does the notion of an associated stationary distribution make sense in this context? And if so, can it be described in terms of a Dirichlet distribution?
