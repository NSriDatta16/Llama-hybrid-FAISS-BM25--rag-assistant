How to write ar & ma terms in dynamic regression/arimax in terms of actual predictors?

I have done Arimax with response series Y as sales/demand & a set of input series on time series data at monthly level. The estimates from the arimax model is as shown below. I want to now write identify the demand function in the below format only using predictors/input series and not using any of the ar or ma terms of the errors. Sales=D(intercept,inventory_x,mrp_x,discount_x,discountLagx,promo_x) My entire objective is to identify the correct demand function. Questions Please explain how to write demand function without ar & ma terms of error? I believe just ignoring the estimates of ar & ma terms of error is not correct. Is this true? Please illustrate the calculation behind forecast() function in arimax Is there a better technique for identifying demand function other than arimax?
