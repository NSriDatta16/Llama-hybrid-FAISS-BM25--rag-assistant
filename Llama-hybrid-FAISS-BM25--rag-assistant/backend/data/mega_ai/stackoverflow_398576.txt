I very much enjoy writing grails application for two reasons: I don't have to use Java I can use Java I think after having become familiar with grails one gets his things done very quickly and elegantly. So much for the plus side. The minus side is performance, which hits me on two aspects: deployment and testdriven development. I haven't managed to run more than 3 grails applications on a single (rented) server, because I quickly hit the memory and performance limits. There are simply too much frameworks included. Plus, the testrunner of grails isn't worth that name. When I run unit tests, they should be done in an instant, not in 10 to 20s. So I find myself all the time writing business logic in plain java, because I can test it much faster. But I guess that this can be addressed with a better integration into the IDE (eclipse).
