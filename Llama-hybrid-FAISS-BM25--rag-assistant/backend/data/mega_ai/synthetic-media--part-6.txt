 an AI-generated stream of death metal which remains ongoing with no pauses. Musical artists and their respective brands may also conceivably be generated from scratch, including AI-generated music, videos, interviews, and promotional material. Conversely, existing music can be completely altered at will, such as changing lyrics, singers, instrumentation, and composition. In 2018, using a process by WaveNet for timbre musical transfer, researchers were able to shift entire genres from one to another. Through the use of artificial intelligence, old bands and artists may be "revived" to release new material without pause, which may even include "live" concerts and promotional images. Neural network-powered photo manipulation also has the potential to support problematic behavior of various state actors, not just totalitarian and absolutist regimes. A sufficiently technically competent government or community may use synthetic media to engage in a rewrite of history using various synthetic technologies, fabricating history and personalities as well as changing ways of thinking â€“ a form of potential epistemicide. Even in otherwise rational and democratic societies, certain social and political groups may use synthetic media to craft cultural, political, and scientific filter-bubbles that greatly reduce or even altogether undermine the ability of the public to agree on basic objective facts. Conversely, the existence of synthetic media may be used to discredit factual news sources and scientific facts as "potentially fabricated."
