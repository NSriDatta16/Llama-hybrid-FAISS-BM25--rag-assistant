Your concerns are justified - the two samples might come from populations with different mean. To be on the safe side, you can generate two artificial samples by resampling just one of the groups, and add the constant to one of the artificial samples. Do this separately for each of the original groups, and average the power. This should give reasonable results provided your sample sizes are not small.
