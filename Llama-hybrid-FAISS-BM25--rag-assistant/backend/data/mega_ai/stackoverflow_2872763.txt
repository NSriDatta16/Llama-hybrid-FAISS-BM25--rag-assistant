Method 2 all the way. i always work with these simple rules: 1.) Source code should be CLEAR, EASY-TO-UNDERSTAND and DUMMY-PROOF. -A good product is not built by single person. Simple, intuitive and easy-to-follow formatting will make everyones life happier. 2.) If there will be no performance difference in final product, stick to rule #1 -It makes no sense for developer to spend braincells on something that doesn't benefit end-customer. 3.) Elegant design will always works fine, so rule #2 always hold true. -Same rule applies to God, take a mirror and look on yourself :)
