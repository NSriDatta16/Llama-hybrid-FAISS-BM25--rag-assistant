Is `TweedieRegressor` a completely general GLM solution?

I consider sklearn 's TweedieRegressor a general solution for all types of regression, as it is a GLM model. If I understand well, that means any regression type can be obtained by appropriately parametrizing TweedieRegressor . Logistic regression is a special case of GLM. I guess, to have logistic regression there should be a logit value (or something like that) for the link parameter, but there is no such possibility. Can TweedieRegressor be parametrized to do logistic regression? If yes, how? If not, why not?
