Managing two instances of the same GAE application

I have an GAE app, and I deploy it on 2 different domains, and they use separate datastores. However, right now it is done by having two identical folders with different app.yaml configurations. If I make changes I need to copy all files again. Is there an elegant solution for that, like having two app.yaml files in the same folder?
