Swapping in a View Controller without using a UITabBar or Nav Controller

I have a segmented control in a View controller. I want to load a different view into the middle when segments are tapped. Effectively making it a tab bar controller. (Q: why not just use a tab bar controller, A: I already have one) Here are my requirements: I want to use view controllers everywhere. One 'super view controller' to manage the segmented control. Two 'sub view controllers' to display the content when the segmented control is tapped. I want view did load / unload and other messages to come the the sub view controllers that you would expect. I want a neat, elegant solution. Minimal hacking. My current implementation fails on point 2: - (IBAction)valueChanged:(id)sender { switch (self.segmentedControl.selectedSegmentIndex) { case 0: { ThirdVC* vc = [[ThirdVC alloc] initWithNibName:@"ThirdVC" bundle:nil]; [self.centerView addSubview:vc.view]; } break; ... etc
