Part of the problem is that you're taking a sentence from Gelman and Hill out of context. Here's a Google books screenshot: Note that the heading says "Interpreting Poisson regression coefficients" (emphasis added). Poisson regression uses a logarithmic link, in contrast to logistic regression, which uses a logit (log-odds) link. The interpretation of exponentiated coefficients as multiplicative effects only works for a log-scale coefficients (or, at the risk of muddying the waters slightly, for logit-scale coefficients if the baseline risk is very low ...) Everyone would like to be able to quote effects of treatments on probabilities in a simple, universal scale-independent way, but this is basically impossible: this is why there are so many tutorials on interpreting odds and log-odds circulating in the wild, and why epidemiologists spend so much time arguing about relative risk vs. odds ratios vs ...
