Do some searches on Stack Overflow and on Google--there are others who have asked the same question. Some considerations: Visual Studio takes longer to compile solutions with many projects, than single large projects. Don't divide your solution up too finely. Microsoft's Composite Application Guidance has an interesting way of dividing up projects. There's an Infrastructure project, a bootstrapper project, and then projects for each "module" of code. Currently I'm working on a project that divides the projects up just like your example: infrastructure, business logic, GUI, and unit tests. I prefer to organize files by purpose, not type. For example, I create folders called "Communication" and "Interop" rather than "Events" and "Interfaces".
