I think the importance of the concept "Turing Complete" is in the the ability to identify a computing machine (not necessarily a mechanical/electrical "computer") that can have its processes be deconstructed into "simple" instructions, composed of simpler and simpler instructions, that a Universal machine could interpret and then execute. I highly recommend The Annotated Turing @Mark i think what you are explaining is a mix between the description of the Universal Turing Machine and Turing Complete. Something that is Turing Complete, in a practical sense, would be a machine/process/computation able to be written and represented as a program, to be executed by a Universal Machine (a desktop computer). Though it doesn't take consideration for time or storage, as mentioned by others.
