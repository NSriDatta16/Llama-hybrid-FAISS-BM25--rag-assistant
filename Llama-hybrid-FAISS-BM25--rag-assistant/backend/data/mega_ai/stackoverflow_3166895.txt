I have been using python-libpcap http://sourceforge.net/projects/pylibpcap/ If I am not mistaken, it is just a wrapper to the C libpcap. It doesn't feel very Pythonic, but it gets the job done. Edit: However, this will just let you separate the packets. There isn't much parsing of the headers. I failed to find any sort of good module that did this for me, so I wrote my own script to parse them. Message me if you would like for me to send it to you.
