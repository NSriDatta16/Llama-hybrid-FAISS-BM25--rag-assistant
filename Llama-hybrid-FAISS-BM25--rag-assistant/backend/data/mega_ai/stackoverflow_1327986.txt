Dynamic URL management with javascript

I have a search page which allows users to further filter thier results based on criteria within a certain set. You start a search by searching for all items within a "tag". The URL created for this would look like search/index?tag=TagA On the page there are a list of tags that are also in this result set. What I want is so in this list of tags the URL's generated are TagB It's not good enough just to append onto the URL as there will be other parameters added such as page numbers and other search criteria (I have not included them for brevity) I'm aware I could probably hack this on the server side but nothing feels very elegant and I was wondering if there was a neat solution for this. This is all done in ASP MVC and as such I have a nice simple partial view to list these tags: 0){ %> Any ideas?
