If you are connected to the SQLLite with CoreData it does not take kindly to having the storage ripped out from underneath it and replaced. As you have a database then why not make use of the database features. To the user it is read only. To your app it can be updated. Make a HTTP request and download the updated data rows from the webserver in a suitably machine readable format, and update the data tables with that. You might even be able to just serve delta's of the data depending on what you are holding.
