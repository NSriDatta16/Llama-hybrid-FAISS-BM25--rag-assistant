document.onmousemove / onmmouseup prevent selecting text in IE input or textarea

whenever i alter the onmousemove or onmouseup attributes of the document, for example: document.onmousemove = myOnMouseMove; document.onmouseup = myOnMouseUp; It prevents me from selecting text in any input type='text' or textarea elements in internet explorer (have tried in ie7 and ie8, fine in firefox). If I remove either of these it allows me to select text again, but i really need both to make my home made drag and drop functionality work elsewhere on the page. Is there some way i can retain the default functionality of the onmouseXXX functions and attach my function onto the end? Or is there a better way to be doing this? I also have the same problem using the onkeyup attribute of a textarea forcing the flashing text cursor to the end of the text. Thanks
