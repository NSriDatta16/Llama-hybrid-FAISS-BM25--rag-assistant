$div.children( ('p:eq(0)').substring(0,100)); Look at that line. It's taking the first 100 characters of "p:eq(0)" and using that as a selector for the children. The first 100 characters will just be itself, so no trunction. thephpdeveloper is right, you want the innerHTML. Except, if the paragraph has HTML as contents you don't want to split a tag. So use text instead. var truncatedText = $div.children('p').eq(0).text().substring(0, 100); $div.empty().append(jQuery(" ").text(truncatedText)); Also, why do all your variables start with $? That's normally reserved for important system-level variables.
