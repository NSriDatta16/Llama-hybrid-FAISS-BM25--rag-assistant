What's a good machine for iPhone development?

I'm going to be working on some iPhone apps so I've been given a golden ticket to buy a Mac. However the golden ticket isn't worth that much, and I'm thinking iMac. Now, Macs are great, I love 'em and use 'em at home, but I know that the iMac is geared more towards the average consumer than the professional. Is an iMac going to be powerful enough to do iPhone development on? If it helps any, the only thing I envision doing on the Mac is running XCode and maybe a web browser. Is there anybody out there doing iPhone development and having trouble running the required tools on their machine? If so, what do you have?
