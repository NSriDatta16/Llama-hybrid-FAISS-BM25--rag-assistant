You can implement an event handler for the textbox's KeyPress and/or KeyUp/KeyDown events. In your event handler of the KeyPress event, if you set the Handled property on the event args to true , then the event will not be passed on to the textbox. If you don't set it to true , it will be. (Edited to clarify the second paragraph).
