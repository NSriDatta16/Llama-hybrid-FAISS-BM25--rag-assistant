Nontechnically, prediction (eg to predict) is the process of transforming an object. The transformer often depends on summaries of information. These summaries, or estimates, might be compression. So, it seems that estimation might be compression, but prediction is not. I say might because you can describe a dataset by the dataset itself - that’s still an estimate, but not a compression. Usually, estimates are compressions. Technically, a prediction is an estimate of a random variable. To get that estimate requires estimation. I don’t think though that this is the definition that the author is using.
