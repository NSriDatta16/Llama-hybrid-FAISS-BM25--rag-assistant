You have to test the drag type in the dragover / dragenter event. In Firefox a file will have type application/x-moz-file so you can do some variation of this : function checkDrag(event) { return event.dataTransfer.types.contains("application/x-moz-file"); } I'm not sure what the equivalent types are for other browsers.
