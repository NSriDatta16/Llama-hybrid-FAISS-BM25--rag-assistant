From my current perspective (after 8 months of development with about 10 developers on average) I would advise against using MSTest for the following reasons The framework in itself is quite slow. I don't mean the test code that you write - that's under your control. I mean the framework running those tests is slow, whether it's running a test suite, single tests etc. The need to keep a Test-Metadata file which always leads to complications when several developers are working on it (recreating e.g. the metadata etc.). Every other test suite doesn't need a metadata file. It is kind of nice to organize your tests but you can achieve the same through namespaces, classes and method names. Doing Continuous Integration, if you want to run unit tests on your build machine you will need to install Visual Studio on that machine. In other words, if I would have to decide again 8 months ago, I would probably take NUnit. I may not have the integrated test results report, but developers would have a more seamless testing experience.
