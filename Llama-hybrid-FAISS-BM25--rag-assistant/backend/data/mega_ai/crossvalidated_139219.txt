Why is the variance of a moving average process calculated this way?

I have a moving average process that looks like: $$ Y_{t}=\frac{e_{t}+e_{t-1}}{2} $$ And I can see that the variance has been calculated as follows: $$ {Var}\left ( Y_{t} \right )={Var}\left \{ \frac{e_{t}+e_{t-1}}{2} \right \}=\frac{{Var}\left ( e_{t} \right )+{Var}\left ( e_{t-1} \right )}{4} $$ Which I cannot seem to understand. The rules of variance say that the variance of the sum of two random variables ... Well it doesn't look anything like that, it has a Covariance term in it. If someone could help explain how this step is possible, I would be very grateful. EDIT: After some further research I think that this has to do with the fact that the two variables are independent?
