Under the assumption that you're looking at similar data across the different regressions, you're describing Bayesian hierarchical modeling. The classic example of this is the Eight Schools data: students from each school are pre-tested in PSAT scores. Then each of the students' schools provide PSAT coaching to them. Then the students take the PSAT again. Was one coaching experience more effective than the others? How much do the students' scores improve (if at all)? A hierarchical analysis of the PSAT scores can answer this question. Using the posterior predictive density from the model and some pre-coaching data for a hypothetical ninth school, we can make inferences about how effective coaching might be for this new batch of students. Hierarchical models are premised on the idea that regression coefficients themselves have some distribution, e.g. $\beta\sim\mathcal{N}(\mu_\beta,\sigma^2_\beta)$ would imply that the coefficients $\beta$ are normal deviates with a mean and variance parameter. Gelman's Bayesian Data Analysis is a great resource for getting started with hierarchical models.
