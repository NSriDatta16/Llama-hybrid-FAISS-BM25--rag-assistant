Explanation of UMAP assumptions

Uniform Manifold Approximation (UMAP) is a technique for dimensionality reduction and visualization. The author of UMAP states that the algorithm is founded on three assumptions about the data: The data is uniformly distributed on Riemannian manifold; The Riemannian metric is locally constant (or can be approximated as such); The manifold is locally connected. Can someone give an accessible explanation of these assumptions? (Let's say accessible to a bioinformatician/statistics enthusiast). Also, when are these assumptions not satisfied? The "layman" material I found explains how UMAP works without discussing these assumptions. This makes me think that these assumptions are almost always satisfied - still, I'd be curious to know what they mean. 26/10/2022 Edit: Crossposted on UMAP repository since nobody replied yet.
