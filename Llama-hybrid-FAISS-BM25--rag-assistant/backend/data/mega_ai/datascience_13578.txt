Deep learning is a fancy thing now in ML since it has been outperforming other ML algorithms in many respects. Convolutional neural networks is one of the methods to implement Deep learning and it is highly applicable to different data types such as images, signals (time series) and text. I mainly use CNN for images and signals. In my application I have done binary and multiclass classification. The theoretical background to both is the same. Depending on the problem and data at hand you may want to break your multiclass classification to simple binary ones and the combine them at a later stage. These are things that comprise model selection. Applying deep (neural) networks to a feature dataset can be thought in two aspects. One is applying to text data after vectorizing as explained by @HimaVarsha. I have not worked with text data, but my applications has mainly coming from images ,signals or catalogues (astronomy catalogues). I have tried using catalogue data which is basically numerical features (2nd aspect) in deep neural networks but did not get significant improvement in results as made the network more deep -- it can be either the problem with my design or maybe the features itself. (Also this method is not often considered a way of learning in deep learning, because deep learning is more of learning directly from the data. But it's another philosophical question) With convolutional neural networks I have got nice results with deeper layers. In addition to the blog link in the first answer I would also suggest this . Keras blog also recommended if you would like to look into CNNs.
