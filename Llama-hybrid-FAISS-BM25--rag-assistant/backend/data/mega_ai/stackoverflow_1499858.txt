According regular-expressions.info , Japanese isn't made of one script: "There is no Japanese Unicode script. Instead, Unicode offers the Hiragana, Katakana, Han and Latin scripts that Japanese documents are usually composed of." In which case, this regex should do the trick: yourString.matches("[\\p{Hiragana}\\p{Katakana}\\p{Han}\\p{Latin}]*+")
