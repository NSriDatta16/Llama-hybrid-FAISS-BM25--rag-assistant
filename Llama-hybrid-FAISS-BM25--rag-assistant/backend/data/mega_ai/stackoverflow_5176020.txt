Embedding elements of Facebook into website

I would like to do a couple of things with my website that would intergrate elements of Facebook. The first is to embed my status (from a Facebook Fan Page) to my website The second is to embed events that I've created on Facebook into my website and if possible allow users to RSVP instantly. I know some basic html so all the help and any help would be great. Thank You
