Yes, it is bad practice. In all unit test frameworks I know, the execution order of test methods is not guaranteed, thus writing tests which depend on the execution order is explicitly discouraged. As you also noted, if test B depends on the (side) effects of test A, either test A contains some common initialization code (which then should be moved into a common setup method instead), or the two tests are part of the same story, so they could be united (IMHO - some people stick to having a single assert per test method, so they would disagree with me on this), or test B should otherwise be made totally independent of test A regarding fixture setup.
