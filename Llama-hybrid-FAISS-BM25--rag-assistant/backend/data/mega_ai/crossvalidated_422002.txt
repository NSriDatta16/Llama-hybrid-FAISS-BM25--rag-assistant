The sMAPE is a percentage error, which expresses the absolute error as a percentage of the average of the forecast and the actual. Percentage errors appear easy to understand and interpret. However, I would be a bit skeptical about interpreting percentage errors of values that can take positive and negative values. You could even get undefined values, e.g., if you forecast 10 and the actual is -10, and you would try to divide the absolute error of 20 by the average of the actual and the forecast, which is zero. After all, the sMAPE was originally thought up to mitigate the problem of the "ordinary" MAPE with zero actuals, where we would have this exact problem of dividing by zero. I would not use the sMAPE, or any percentage error, with values that can take negative and positive values. Shameless piece of self-promotion: I would also suggest you read What are the shortcomings of the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)? and think about what functional of the unknown future density you want to elicit using the sMAPE.
