I'm assuming "MessageArray" is an instance variable (never name instance variables this way; you should have a property called -messages and access it with self.messages). I'l further assume that it is an NSMutableArray or else you'd be getting warnings from the compiler. NSMutableArray -filterUsingPredicate: modifies the array itself, returning void. The method you want is -filteredArrayUsingPredicate: which returns an array. The fact that the former is a verb and the latter is a noun indicates this fact even without reading the docs. Cocoa naming is extremely consistent, which is why I mention it in the first paragraph. Pay attention to the names and you will have far fewer bugs.
