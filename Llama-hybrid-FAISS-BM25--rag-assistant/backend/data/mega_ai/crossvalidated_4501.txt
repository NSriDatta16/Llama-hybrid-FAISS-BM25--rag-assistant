Typographic conventions for width of figures in LaTeX data analysis reports

I've been thinking recently about conventions for figure width in data analysis reports that lead to PDFs (e.g., in A4 or Letter size). My usual context is R, Sweave, and LaTeX. The default figure width in Sweave is 80% of the text-width (i.e., the width of a paragraph of text). \setkeys{Gin}{width=0.80\textwidth} Questions: Is it reasonable for the width of figures to be wider than the text-width (i.e., to spill into the margins)? Is the 80% rule of text-width a good one or would, for example 100%, or some other value be better? Should the figure widths be consistent throughout a document (or perhaps with two sizes for small and large figures) or should the width be adapted completely to the content? Any references or thoughts on best practice in this regards would be most welcome.
