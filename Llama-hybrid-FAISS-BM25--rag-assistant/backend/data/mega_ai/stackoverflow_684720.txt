Depending on whether the paths could be relative, or contain "..", or junction points, or UNC paths this may be more difficult than you think. The best way might be to use the GetFileInformationByHandle() function as in this answer . Edit: I agree with the comment by RBerteig that this may become hard to impossible to do if the paths are not pointing to a local file. Any comment on how to safely handle this case would be greatly appreciated.
