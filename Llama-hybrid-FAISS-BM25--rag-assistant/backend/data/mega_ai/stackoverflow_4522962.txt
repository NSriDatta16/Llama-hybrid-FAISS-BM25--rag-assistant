I have not tested, but would wonder if you have the same issue if you used a TransactionScope with the options of IsolationLevel.ReadUncommitted. You would have to encapsulate your complete set of calls and that should negate the need for this statement. I realize that this statement is not your basic concern, but in general. Another thing that you can do is to create a DBConnectionScope class (or leverage a trusted vendor's class) and cut down on the total number of connections that are opened.
