You will need from each study an estimate of the prevalence and its standard error. You will probably want to transform them in some way. You do not say whether you have study level information on sex and age (just average age or proportion women) rather than individual level data. If you only have study level data you need to use software which does the meta-analysis appropriately. I do not know whether you can do this in SPSS but there are many packages available in R which do. My personal preference is for the metafor package. If you have individual level data then you can use a mixed effects regression. There is a wealth of material on the author's website http://www.metafor-project.org/doku.php which should help you get further with your analysis.
