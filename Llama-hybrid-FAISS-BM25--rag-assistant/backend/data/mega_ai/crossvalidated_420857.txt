If you wish to control the familywise type I error rate, then you need to adjust for multiplicity. In particular, if you wish to emphasize p-value, statistical significance or whether CIs exclude some value, to claim that some of multiple comparisons you are looking at are "statistically significant", then that is often a situation where that might be something you wish to do. The Bonferroni correction is one of the most simple (and most conservative) adjustments for multiplicity. You can easily adjust your CIs to match the adjustment (e.g. with 2 hypotheses you calculate 97.5% confidence intervals instead of 95% CIs). Other adjustments are uniformly more powerful (e.g. Bonferroni-Holm), but make it hard to find matching CIs. There are of course approaches for dealing with multiplicity other than controlling the familywise type I error rate, e.g. using shrinkage in Bayesian hierarchical models instead.
