You can easily create a site (that contains documentation) with Maven using the mvn site command (i.e. using the plugin site ). This plugin creates technical reports (such as Javadoc, Unit tests reports, code coverage...) but can be also used to create a "real site". You have more details about that in this page . Basically, you write your page using APT ( Almost Plain Text which is quite simple to understand), or a XML-based format, Xdoc . 2 years ago, I create a complete user guide for one application I developed, using the XDoc format and the Site Maven plugin. Globally, it was quite easy to create! I hope this will help you!
