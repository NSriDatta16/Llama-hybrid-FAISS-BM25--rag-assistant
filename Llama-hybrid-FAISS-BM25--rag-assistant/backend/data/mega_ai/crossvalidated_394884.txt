CNN: correct way of reducing dimensionality of last feature maps

I want to reduce the features of the last convolutional layer of my CNN before connecting it to a dense layer to minimize the risk of overfitting. Lets say the feature maps of the last layer have the following dimensions : [2, 2, 1024]. I want to reduce the dimensions to [1, 1, 1024] and don't know if I have to use the average or the sum of these features? What would make sense? Is there any source where I can read about that issue?
