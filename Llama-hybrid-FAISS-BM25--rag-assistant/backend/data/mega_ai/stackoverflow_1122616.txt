When does a touchesBegan become a touchesMoved?

When you drag a finger across the iPhone touchscreen, it generates touchesMoved events at a nice, regular 60Hz. However, the transition from the initial touchesBegan event to the first touchesMoved is less obvious: sometimes the device waits a while. What's it waiting for? Larger time/distance deltas? More touches to lump into the event? Does anybody know? Importantly , this delay does not happen with subsequent fingers, which puts the first touch at a distinct disadvantage. It's very asymmetric and bad news for apps that demand precise input, like games and musical instruments. To see this bug/phenomenon in action slowly drag the iPhone screen unlock slider to the right. note the sudden jump & note how it doesn't occur if you have another finger resting anywhere else on the screen try "creeping" across a narrow bridge in any number of 3D games. Frustrating! try a dual virtual joystick game & note that the effect is mitigated because you're obliged to never end either of the touches which amortizes the unpleasantness. Should've logged this as a bug 8 months ago.
