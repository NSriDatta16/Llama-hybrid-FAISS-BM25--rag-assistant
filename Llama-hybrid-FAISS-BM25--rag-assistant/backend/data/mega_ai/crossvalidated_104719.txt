If you want to deploy machine learning models there are many alternatives such as python or RapidMiner. However, if you want to use your R model I suggest the following options: Use the package RServe ( http://rforge.net/Rserve/doc.html ) it seems pretty interesting and they claim to deploy R models on Java. Use the PMML model language. This PMML language allows R users to translate their models into XML-like files so that other languages (such as Java) can interpret the characteristic of the model. If your model is a standard tree or SVM I recommend to use PMML model. Otherwise, consider RServe.
