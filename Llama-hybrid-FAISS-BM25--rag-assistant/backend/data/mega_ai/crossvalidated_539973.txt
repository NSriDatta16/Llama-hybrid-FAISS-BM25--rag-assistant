How to group cities with similarity in order to perform a regression?

My objective is to understand if the average number of students in the classrooms can lead to better grades in a specific exam to all high school students of the cities in a country. My country has more than 5000 counties, so I think it would be fair to group those counties in order to perform in a fair way based in the population size, gross domestic profit (gdp) and the number of students of each county. I was reading about Matching and Propensity Score, however I do not have a treatment/control (as every County invest in education - it is not binary, but some of them invest a high amount). My first thought was to Cluster them using a technique such as K-Means, and then perform the regression to those group. I was thinking that as long as I am fine to compare different counties, I could compare Average Number of Students in the Classroom vs Grades and understand if there is a correlation. I am not sure if it makes sense and I would like to hear from you any suggestions.
