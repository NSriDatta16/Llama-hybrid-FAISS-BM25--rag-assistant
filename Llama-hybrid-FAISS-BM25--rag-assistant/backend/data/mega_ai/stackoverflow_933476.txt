How to check if an array element only contains new line?

A plain text file made up of paragraphs and some blank lines is loaded into an array via Ajax. The array is split into elements by new lines, such as: var infoArray = new Array(); infoArray = response.split("\n"); Then the array is put through a for loop, with various tests for keywords in various elements, which indicate the next n-elements get processed in particular ways. Mostly the elements are output, such as strMsg += ' ' + infoArray[i] + ' '; The Problem is blank lines from the text file are also saved into array elements. Then a blank list item gets output and is noticeably wrong. Need a test condition just to check if the array element is empty or contains a newline character, I'm not sure which applies. Plus the server is buggy and sometimes takes a minute to load new info so I'm sometimes not sure if I am refreshing my most recent code or not. Some of the things I've tried: if (!(infoArray[i].substring(0,0) == '')) { /* process output */ } if (!(infoArray[i].substring(0,1) == '\n')) { /* process output */ } if (!(infoArray[i].substring(0,0) == '\n')) { /* process output */ } if (!(infoArray[i].substring(0,1) == /\n/)) { /* process output */ } if (!(infoArray[i].substring(0,1) == /\n/)) { /* process output */ } if (!(infoArray[i].substring(0,1) == /\n|\s*\n/)) { /* process output */ } if (!(infoArray[i].IsEmpty())) { /* process output */ } var tempString = infoArray[i].toString(); if (!(tempString.IsEmpty())) { /* process output */ } if (tempString.length != 0) { /* process output */ } Ideas? Edit: oh yeah I also tried doing an 'encode' and 'decode' before checking for '\n' just to bring it out.
