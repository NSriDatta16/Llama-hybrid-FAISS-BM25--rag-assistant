How to retrieve HTML page in proper encoding using Java?

How can I read HTTP stream with HTML page in page's encoding? Here is a code fragment I use to get the HTTP stream. InputStreamReader has the encoding optional argument, but I have no ideas about the way to obtain it. URLConnection conn = url.openConnection(); InputStream is = conn.getInputStream(); BufferedReader d = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(is));
