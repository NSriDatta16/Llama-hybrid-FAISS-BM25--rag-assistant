jQuery Tabs . . . I need to do it all!!! (MouseOver, Navigate from tab click and keep tabs selected based upon page)

After reading through all of the jQuery doc, SO questions, and random blogs, I have been unable to find an answer to my problem. Currently I am porting a Coldfusion Site to a .Net site. In my masterpage for the site I have all of my navigation elements as it is just the Administrative portion of the site. The navigation html code: Insurance Plans Mini-Sites Independent Sites Tools In my header OF MY MASTER PAGE : $(document).ready(function(){ $("#tabs").tabs({event: 'mouseover'}); }); The site as you can tell has 4 (well 3 really) major sections: Insurance Plans, Mini-Sites, Independent Sites and Tools. Under each one of these sections there are several pages (all which use the same master page). The mouse over function works great, the divs hide and display as expected. The problems that I am having is that div id="fragment-1" is selected on every page for every section. (As an example, when in the Tools Section, div id="fragment-4" , I need it to be selected. I have tried adding $('#tabs').tabs('option', 'selected', 3); in both the head of the .aspx page and in the masterpage for testing and I get an error. Additionally I have tried throwing $('#tabs').tabs('option', 'selected', 3); into the $(document).ready function, and it still throws an error, both within the .aspx page and the masterpage. Solution to above problem: Placing $(document).ready(function(){ var $tabs = $("#tabs").tabs({event: 'mouseover'}); $tabs.tabs("select", 3); }); at the end of a page in section "3" allows the appropriate tab to be default selected. While removing: $(document).ready(function(){ var $tabs = $("#tabs").tabs({event: 'mouseover'}); }); from the header of the master page. To top it all off, I need the tabs to be clickable to navigate (not an ajax load, but I need for the user, when clicking on the tab to be taken to a different page. I would assume this would be analogous to window.location(). Can anyone please help with the second part? I am a jQuery n00b.
