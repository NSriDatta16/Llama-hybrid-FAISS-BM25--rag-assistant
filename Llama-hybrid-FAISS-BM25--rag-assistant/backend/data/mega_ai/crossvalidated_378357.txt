How to get the survival duration prediction for each individual in the data by using the Kaplan-Meier method?

I am trying to learn how to use the Kaplan-Meier survival estimator model in the lifelines package. The documentation says that the KaplanMeierFitter.fit function returns " a modified self, with new properties like 'survival_function_'. " I checked what the survival_function_ 's contents are - it seems to contain the average survival probability for all the players in the dataset at each time time interval . For example, in my dataset, there are 66 months and about 250,000 players (i.e., individuals whose death event we are trying to predict - 75% of them have had their deaths and the rest 25% is censored data, i.e., their deaths have not been observed), so the survival_function_ contains the following: >>> kmf.survival_function_ KM_estimate timeline -1.0 1.000000 0.0 0.995473 1.0 0.779609 2.0 0.621312 3.0 0.508698 4.0 0.424205 5.0 0.366714 6.0 0.324090 7.0 0.289432 8.0 0.259339 9.0 0.234256 10.0 0.212542 11.0 0.192735 12.0 0.172880 13.0 0.157821 14.0 0.144604 15.0 0.132614 16.0 0.121743 17.0 0.112202 18.0 0.103710 19.0 0.095829 20.0 0.088811 21.0 0.082302 22.0 0.076773 23.0 0.071249 24.0 0.065752 25.0 0.060534 26.0 0.056082 27.0 0.051978 28.0 0.048073 ... ... 37.0 0.023696 38.0 0.020562 39.0 0.017846 40.0 0.015783 41.0 0.013817 42.0 0.012253 43.0 0.010645 44.0 0.009354 45.0 0.008186 46.0 0.007195 47.0 0.006274 48.0 0.005486 49.0 0.004656 50.0 0.003948 51.0 0.003391 52.0 0.002823 53.0 0.002352 54.0 0.002004 55.0 0.001655 56.0 0.001388 57.0 0.001114 58.0 0.000932 59.0 0.000707 60.0 0.000536 61.0 0.000343 62.0 0.000193 63.0 0.000080 64.0 0.000038 65.0 0.000016 66.0 0.000000 68 rows Ã— 1 columns It tells us the average survival probability of the entire population at each time period, taking both dead as well as censored players. It does not tell us the survival probability for each individual censored player, which is what I am interested in. How do I find that? It can be as detailed as, giving the survival probability for each individual player for each of the 66 months. Or, if that's not possible, I'm ok with having having the survival probabilities of each individual player at a fixed time in the future, say 3 months, or anything else (which is 1 of the 66 time periods). In other words, instead of the output being a 66x1 vector of average survival probabilities, can I get an output matrix of dimensions txn , where t is the number of time periods and n is the number of censored players in the dataset, and the entry (i,j) is the survival probability of player i at time period j ? If this is not possible with the KM method, please feel free to suggest other methods where its possible to get the survival estimate for each individual. Thank you. EDIT: I tried Cam Davidson Pilon's suggested way, and the prediction matrix gives the same exact predictions for each individual for a given time period: This is not what I wanted; I expected a prediction matrix where the (i,j) 'th entry (the survival probability for person j at time i ) would be mostly unique. Whereas this just takes the survival_function_ values and copies them for each individual.
