This is not a very well posed question since the answer is potentially all of the algorithms. This question can easily lead to disputes with the professor about what you were supposed to know and answer based on the lectures vs. what you can find in the scientific literature. In addition to Binu Jasim's points: SVMs can do only binary classification out of the box. Here you have multiple classes. I would therefore not recommend SVM, they would need to be run multiple times in a one vs. all or one vs. one scenario. Like neural networks, decision trees can require to convert categorical variables into binaries. It depends on the type of tree, but this preparation would be very easy anyway.
