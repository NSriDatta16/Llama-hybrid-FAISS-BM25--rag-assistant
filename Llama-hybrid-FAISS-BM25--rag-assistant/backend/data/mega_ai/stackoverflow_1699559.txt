is wcf rest weboperationcontext.current thread safe?

I'm currently returning a stream from all my WebGet/WebInvoke decorated methods from WCF. And I also get a stream as input. I do this because I want flexibility with response & input content types. This is primarily because I need flexibility when parsing the input - it cannot be easily serialized / deserialized. However I then use the WebOperationContext.Current to set httpstatuscodes. I'm concerned this wouldn't be thread safe though (how would the thread know which context it was processing?) So my question is - is using WebOperationContext.Current thread-safe under high load conditions? Does anyone know how the thread and WebOperationContext.Current are linked? Is it using TLS (thread local storage)? p.
