Dim pharse As New Phrase("This is my second line using Pharse.") Dim chunk As New Chunk(" This is my third line using Chunk.") ' Now add the above created text using different class object to our pdf document doc.Add(paragraph) doc.Add(pharse) doc.Add(chunk) pdfdoc1 = MemStream.GetBuffer() Catch dex As DocumentException 'Handle document exception Catch ex As Exception 'Handle Other Exception Finally 'Close document doc.Close() End Try But it is throwing an error at this line pdfdoc1 = MemStream.GetBuffer() value of type 1-dimensional array cannot be converted to system.collections.bitarray Please help
