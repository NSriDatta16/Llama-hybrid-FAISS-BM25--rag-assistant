A typical web application spends very little time doing the things you would write in Ruby or Java and very much time fetching things from a database. If it takes 200ms to deliver a given page using Java and 210ms using RoR, the advantage gained by choosing Java for its speed is insignificant for the vast majority of applications. If you're really worried about speed in a typical web application, spend your optimization efforts on the data storage and retrieval mechanism, not the front end. Use indexes. Denormalize data if you must. Consider a document database or a key-value store.
