Android serialization is notoriously slow. I highly suggest switching to using XML or JSON (or whatever) and writing the file out that way. Since you've already got an XML parser, it may make the most sense just to cache the original XML file you downloaded and reparse it as necessary. I have switched from Serializable to JSON file storage in an app before and the speed increase was incredible, at least one order of magnitude. (I may be misunderstanding your question - I assume you are using Serializable for writing to the disc. If you are reproducing the XML, then I'm not sure why it is so much slower on the SD card. Also, I agree that the SQLite database makes the most sense typically, but as you've already stated it does not fit the needs of your application.)
