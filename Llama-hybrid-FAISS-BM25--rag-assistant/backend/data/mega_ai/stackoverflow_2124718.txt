True, Google App Engine is a very cool product, but the datastore is a different beast than a regular mySQL database. That's not to say that what you need can't be done with the GAE datastore; however it may take some reworking on your end. The most prominent different that you notice right off the start is that GAE uses an object-relational mapping for its data storage scheme. Essentially object graphs are persisted in the database, maintaining there attributes and relationships to other objects. In many cases ORM (object relational mappings) map fairly well on top of a relational database (this is how Hibernate works). The mapping is not perfect though and you will find that you need to make alterations to persist your data. Also, GAE has some unique contraints that complicate things a bit. One contraint that bothers me a lot is not being able to query for attribute paths: e.g. "select ... where dog.owner.name = 'bob' ". It is these rules that force you to read and understand how GAE data store works before you jump in. I think GAE could work well in your situation. It just may take some time to understand ORM persistence in general, and GAE datastore in specifics.
