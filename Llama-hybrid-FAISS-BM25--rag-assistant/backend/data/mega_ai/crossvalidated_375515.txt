Can I use moments of a distribution to sample the distribution?

I notice in statistics/machine learning methods, a distribution is often approximated by a Gaussian, and then that Gaussian is used for sampling. They start by computing the first two moments of the distribution, and use those to estimate $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ . Then they can sample from that Gaussian. It seems to me the more moments I calculate, the better I ought to be able to approximate the distribution I wish to sample. What if I calculate 3 moments...how can I use those to sample from the distribution? And can this be extended to N moments?
