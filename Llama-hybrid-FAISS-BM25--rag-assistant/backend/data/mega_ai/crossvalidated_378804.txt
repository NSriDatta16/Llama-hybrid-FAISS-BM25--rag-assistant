How does Caret's PCA function work?

I've been reading through this question: PCA and k-fold cross-validation in caret package in R . In one of the answers, it was suggested to do PCA within the train function rather than before. However, I tested both methods locally and saw no real difference in performance. What exactly is the logic behind this assumption? This is added just for context: getTrainPerf(pca_train_svm) TrainAccuracy TrainKappa method 1 0.8024293 0.5831657 svmLinear > #PCA right way > pca_train_svm getTrainPerf(pca_train_svm) TrainAccuracy TrainKappa method 1 0.8036165 0.5863854 svmLinear
