if you have control of a mail transfer agent that is configurable to allow .forwards or similar configurable delivery options (qmail, postfix, and sendmail all are), i'd just set the script up in your .forward, .procmailrc, or other similar programmable delivery mechanism. when doing this, you should do some serious input validation on the mail (make sure the sender is who you expect, the received lines match up, the data is sane) if you don't want others who stumble onto the address to be able to muck with your system. you'll also want to use whatever input sanitizer php uses to avoid things like sql injections from malicious data! we can all reflect upon the lesson of little bobby tables: xkcd.com/327/
