How to count people from Multi-column CNN density map?

In this paper , they use Multi-column Convolutional Neural Network (MCNN). The output of MCNN is density map (this is a matrix) and from this density map we can count the number of people. My question are: How does density map matrix look like? What is the formula from which they can count the number of people from density map matrix? I am new to deep learning so I hope you help me. Thanks in advance!
