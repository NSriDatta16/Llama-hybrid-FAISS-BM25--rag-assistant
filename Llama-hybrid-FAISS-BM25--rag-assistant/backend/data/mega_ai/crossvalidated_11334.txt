Don't use the mean of the sampled coefficients for making predictions, instead compute the predictions for logistic regression models with all of the sampled coefficient vectors and take the mean of those predictions (or better still treat the predictions for all sampled coefficient vectors as the posterior distribution of the probability of class membership - the spread of that distribution is a useful indicator of how confident the classifier is about the probabilistic classification). The distribution of the sampled coeffcient vector gives an impression of how well the training data constrain the value of that parameter, so if the distribution is broad, we can't be confident of the "true" value of that coefficient (as explained by Manoel Galdino). However, the key advantage of having a distribution of plausible coefficient vectors is that it provides you with a rational way to get a distribution of plausible values for the probability of class membership, which is what we really want. Often using a Bayesian approach, we are not really interested in the coefficients of the model, but in the function implemented by the model.
