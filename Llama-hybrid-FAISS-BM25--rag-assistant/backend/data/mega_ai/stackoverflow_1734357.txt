Sample Java EE projects using Java EE design patterns

For .Net there are lots of projects that Microsoft/others provide via which one can learn how patterns etc. are implemented in real life projects. I am looking for ones for Java EE (apart from the samples that Sun provides on: http://java.sun.com/javaee/reference/code/ ). Am looking for more complex ones. May be using JSF/Spring/Struts
