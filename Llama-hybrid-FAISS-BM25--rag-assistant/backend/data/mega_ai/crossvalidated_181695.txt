How to fix some coefficients when fitting a logistic regression

In linear regression, if I have a model, b0 + b1x1 + b2x2 + b3x3 + b4x4 = y and I want to fix some of the coefficients ,say b1 = 1 and b3 = 2, I could just do the following b0 + b2x2 + b4x4 = y - x1 - 2x3 and just fit a linear regression on the other three parameters on the new y. Is there a way to do this for logistic regression? The sigmoid function seems to complicate things. Im looking to do this in r, so if theres an easy way to do it in r, that would be very appreciated.
