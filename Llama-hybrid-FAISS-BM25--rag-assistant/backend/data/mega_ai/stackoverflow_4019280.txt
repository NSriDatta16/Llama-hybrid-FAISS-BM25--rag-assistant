wpf custom control: audiowaveform rectangle with selection slider

I'm working on a c# wpf app in which I want to do something with audio. the irrklang audio library provides me with a pcm decoded 16 bit byte array. I want to create a timeline control which shows the waveform along the timeline with an overlaying rectangle which the user can drag and click/drag the left and right side to increase or decrease the selection. It is used to the trim the audio track. I would like the selected min and max to be databindable, the minimum and maximum value of the total track to be bindable. To clarify here is an image mockup: I'm not asking for a complete control but tips and suggestions on how to tackle this are more than welcome. Perhaps solutions like this already exist but so far I haven't been able to find it. I think I need to tackle: the control (zooming, panning and changing the selection) and drawing the waveform in the control Thanks in advance,
