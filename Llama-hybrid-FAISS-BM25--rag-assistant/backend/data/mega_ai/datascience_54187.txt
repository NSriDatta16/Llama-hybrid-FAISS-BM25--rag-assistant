Generating Synthetic Image to improve the performance of classifier

I need some suggestion from experts. For my project work, I have been learning about Generative Adversarial Network . I am trying to make a classifier (say CNN ) to train with original CIFAR-10 dataset and then evaluate the performance. After that, Generating more data of all classes using GAN and retrain the model and compare the performance. But I don't know how feasible will the work be. How complex will be the work and also I want to know if the idea is acceptable as a project?
