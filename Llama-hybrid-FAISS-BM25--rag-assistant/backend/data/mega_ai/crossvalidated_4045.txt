The zoo package is very good at that (as is xts which extends it). The zoo vignettes have e.g. this example: zr3 A (regular) series is created with monthly frequency, and the averaged by quarter. It works the very same way for POSIXct objects at much higher granularity; see the vignette. I suspect that the R-SIG-Finance list archives have plenty of related examples too.
