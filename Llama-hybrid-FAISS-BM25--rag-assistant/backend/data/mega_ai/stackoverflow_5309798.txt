There is no attribute called "seachlist"... You assigned the same id to several elements...this will cause problems... If you are trying to get the text of the a tag, then change #detailpage to .detailpage and then use something like this: $(document).ready(function() { $('.detailpage').bind('click', function() { alert($(this).text()); }); }); Advantage: No "onclick" in your code...this is called unobtrustive javascript and it's way cooler than mucking up your html with javascript stuff. Even better, to pass a value, instead of worrying about the link content, assign whatever value you want to the item's ID and fetch that. Enjoy. Jquery Refs: .ready : http://api.jquery.com/ready/ .bind : http://api.jquery.com/bind/ .text : http://api.jquery.com/text/ UPDATE: Id you want to update some div on the page with the text we retrieved it's simple: $(document).ready(function() { $('.detailpage').bind('click', function() { var thetext = $(this).text(); $('div#pagetwo').append(thetext); }); }); http://api.jquery.com/append/ Append will add text indefinitely, to the end of the element. Or if you want to update a specific part of the page 2 div, you would need to add a class to it like .content and then you could do this: $(document).ready(function() { $('.detailpage').bind('click', function() { var thetext = $(this).text(); $('div#pagetwo.content').html(thetext); }); }); .html will fill the element with what you pass it. http://api.jquery.com/html/ If you wanted to wrap the content in a paragraph tag or something before sending it along: $('div#pagetwo.content').html(' ' + thetext + ' ');
