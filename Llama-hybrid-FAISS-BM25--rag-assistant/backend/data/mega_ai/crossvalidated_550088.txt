Using logistic regression to classify data set (asking about the steps)

I have a training data set of predictors being classified into 2 classes. For now, I have already created a logistic regression model, that is, having solved the coefficients $\beta_0, \beta_1,\cdots$ . What do I do now to be able to classify the testing data set?
