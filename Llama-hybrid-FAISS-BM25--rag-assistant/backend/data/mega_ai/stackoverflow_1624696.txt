I'm always struck by how on point Robert Glass' Rules of Three are in these situations. Don't worry about reuse until you have three places where your function might fit. I always like to write the function the first time I need it. Note that I'm duplicating it the second time. And the third time do the work for reuse (refactor it into a utility library).
