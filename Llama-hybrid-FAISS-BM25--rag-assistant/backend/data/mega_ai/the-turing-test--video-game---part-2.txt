ealize the only way to get off Europa is to stop T.O.M. and they begin to disable his databases. T.O.M. is no longer able to control Ava, but he retains control over his sentry weapons, which he can either use to kill Sarah and Ava, Sarah or Ava, or do nothing. Doing nothing or only killing one of the humans leads to the end of T.O.M. and allows the survivor(s) to escape. Killing both ensures that the organism will not leave Europa. If both people are killed the game ends with T.O.M calling Ava's name repeatedly and imploring her to wake up before the credits roll. Regardless of the player's decision, the test will result as "passed". Development and release In 2015, UK-based studios Deco Digital and Bevel Studios released their first-person puzzle game, Pneuma: Breath of Life. Towards the end of the year, the two studios merged to form Bulkhead Interactive, the developer of The Turing Test. The game was developed using Unreal Engine 4. The Turing Test was in a pre-production phase for six months, where the designers created puzzles and defined the gameplay curve. The game was in full production for a further year. Creative producer Howard Philpott cited Croteam's 2014 puzzle game, The Talos Principle, as a reference point for the progression of introducing gameplay mechanics in The Turing Test. The game was published by Square Enix as part of their indie initiative, Square Enix Collective. The game was released for Windows and Xbox One on 30 August 2016. The PlayStation 4 version was released on 23 January 2017. The Nintendo Switch version was released on 7 February 2020. Reception The Turing Test received "generally favourable" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic. References External links Publisher website
