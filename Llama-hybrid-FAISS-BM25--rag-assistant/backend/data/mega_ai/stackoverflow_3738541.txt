Best way to persist an XML file on iPhone?

I'm using MonoTouch and also System.Data to create a DataSet (just xml to those not familiar) for simple data binding. Data on my app is minimal so no need to go all out with SQLLite. The dataset use makes it easy to pass via web services for cloud sync. I serialize the DataSet to the personal folder on save and of course read this file when the app starts up to load up the user's data. I've had issues where this file is becoming corrupt and I'm not sure why. I assume file I/O may be slow on these devices and that could be the cause, I'm not sure, but it is happening. I'm also concerned that maybe iTunes is passing this file back and forth between the PC/MAC when the user syncs their devices with iTunes, which may be the cause of the corruption? I want to prevent this device file from syncing with iTunes and also reliably persist it. I'm using the NSFile.Save option to save it to the device. I'm thinking since it's a text file maybe I could more safely store it in the standard user settings area instead? This would prevent it from being synced by itunes, I presume? What is the most reliable and safe way to handle this file i/o for the xml dataset storage? Thank you.
