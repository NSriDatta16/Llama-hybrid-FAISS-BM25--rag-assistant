if exists(":command") fails on startup, using Pathogen

I'm using exists() to check if plugins are installed in Vim (I mapped ; to : ): if exists(":NERDTree") map ;NERDTreeToggle endif The mapping doesn't work unless I source the .vimrc file manually. I'm using Pathogen to load my plugins on startup, I imagine that has something to do with it? My complete .vimrc file: https://github.com/ElbertF/dotfiles/blob/master/.vimrc
