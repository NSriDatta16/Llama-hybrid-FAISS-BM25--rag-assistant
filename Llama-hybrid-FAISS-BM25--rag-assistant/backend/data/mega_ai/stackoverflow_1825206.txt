2nd level hibernate cache understanding

**1.**for 2nd level cache, can only set timeout period but cannot force refresh/clear cache of entity? or putthing annotation @Cache(usage = CacheConcurrencyStrategy.NONSTRICT_READ_WRITE) like auto refresh/clear the cache each time doing saveorupdate/mergeupdate? what is hibernateTemplate.flush() relate to this? 2. is it good to enable 2nd level cache for all entity ? what is the average timeout that you folks use for ehcache for this case if i do not want too long caching time as i cache all entities?
