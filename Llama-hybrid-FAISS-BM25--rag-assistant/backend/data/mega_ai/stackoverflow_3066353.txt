Continuous vs Discrete artificial neural networks

I realize that this is probably a very niche question, but has anyone had experience with working with continuous neural networks? I'm specifically interested in what a continuous neural network may be useful for vs what you normally use discrete neural networks for. For clarity I will clear up what I mean by continuous neural network as I suppose it can be interpreted to mean different things. I do not mean that the activation function is continuous. Rather I allude to the idea of a increasing the number of neurons in the hidden layer to an infinite amount. So for clarity, here is the architecture of your typical discreet NN: (source: garamatt at sites.google.com ) The x are the input, the g is the activation of the hidden layer, the v are the weights of the hidden layer, the w are the weights of the output layer, the b is the bias and apparently the output layer has a linear activation (namely none.) The difference between a discrete NN and a continuous NN is depicted by this figure: (source: garamatt at sites.google.com ) That is you let the number of hidden neurons become infinite so that your final output is an integral. In practice this means that instead of computing a deterministic sum you instead must approximate the corresponding integral with quadrature. Apparently its a common misconception with neural networks that too many hidden neurons produces over-fitting. My question is specifically, given this definition of discrete and continuous neural networks, I was wondering if anyone had experience working with the latter and what sort of things they used them for.
