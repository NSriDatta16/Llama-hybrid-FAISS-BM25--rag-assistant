Can I use one sample wilcoxon signed rank test for time series data where I need to check if all of the data points are below a theoretical value?

I have time-series data and I want to check if the data I collected is below a certain theoretical value. Is the one-sample Wilcoxon signed-rank test the best way for my objective? Some background information on what I am trying to do. I have designed an alternative system and I am now checking if my designed system's performance is within the standards set (in this case, the standard is the maximum allowed). For the specifics, my time series data is the aggregate speed/rate of the tasks being processed (i.e. each data point is in seconds). The data is seasonal if that matters. Based on the graphical representation the data is below the threshold, what I am trying to do is to find a statistical test, to prove that my time series data is below the theoretical limit "most" of the time.
