No, it won't be reasonable to use cv.glmnet for cross validation on time series data. A good explanation how CV should look like on time series data can be found here: https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/tscv/ In short, a standard CV would skip time points randomly and thus destroy the temporal relationships you want to identify. (I assume that your samples are your time points, since you didn't give details on your data.) They recommend to use the forecast package in R. Unfortunately, I don't know of a LASSO implementation of cross validation for time series data.
