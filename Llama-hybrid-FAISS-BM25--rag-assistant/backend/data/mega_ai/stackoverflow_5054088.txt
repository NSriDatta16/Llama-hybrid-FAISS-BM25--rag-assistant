SQL - Ordering by pairs of rows

Can someone help me come up with a SQL query to do the following Order a table by individual pairs of rows, where the pairs are consecutive rows based on timestamp. Then order all of these pairs by the average of an attribute of both rows in given pair. Select the first pair / two rows. thanks. ive been puzzling over it for while and am not sure where to start. Example: [Timestamp] [Views] 1 23 2 17 3 30 4 5 5 47 6 15 Order pairs(timestamp) by SUM(views) ASC [Timestamp] [Views] [(sum)] 3 30 35 4 5 1 23 40 2 17 5 47 62 6 15
