Is it correct to report R^2 value for simple time series trend analyses?

I am wondering if it makes sense to report an R^2 value for a simple trend analysis. For example, trends in temperature or stream flow over time. I understand that for linear regression R^2 makes sense in that it is an estimate of how well the variance in y is explained by changes in x i.e., how well your line of best fit predicts the actual data. However, for time series x (time) is not really the explanatory variable. That is, trend analysis is more of a correlative measure or descriptive statistic and so how well time explains changes in y does not make sense. Is that correct? The internet seems to think that trend analysis and regression are the same thing but that is not what I have been told in the past. Unfortunately, I can't find, or don't currently have access to, an authoritative reference that can provide me with some insight. This question comes from using a function in some software that can calculate a trend line much like Excel's trend line function (linear, polynomial etc) but it does not provide an R^2 value. Another user expects an R^2 value and I was surprised at the expectation. There is a regression package that does give the required metrics for proper reporting of regression results including R^2 . Should we be adding in an R^2 value for the function or is that really just a regression metric versus a trend metric. So, two questions: Should I be providing an R^2 metric for trend analysis (time series data). Is there an authoritative reference for it, ideally publicly accessible (internet).
