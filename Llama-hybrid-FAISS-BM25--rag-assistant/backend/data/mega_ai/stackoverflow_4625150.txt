Is it possible to show a html element already on a page a second time without copying it?

I have a page with a hidden form containing several divs. Beitrag öffnen Container öffnen Inhalt öffnen As a first try i copied one of the divs using jQuery to another form in order to show it there (visible). That worked great, but now the html element id is there twice. I do not want to change that id. So a solution where i could only reffer to the div with id " menubar_open_article_iid " to show the html-element would solve my problem. Is that possible? (though i never heard of something like this)
