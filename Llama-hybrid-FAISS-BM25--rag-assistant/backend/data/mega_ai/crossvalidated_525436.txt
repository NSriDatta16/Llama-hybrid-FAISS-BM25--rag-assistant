Comparing a population mean with another population's sample mean

We are currently studying a difference in ESG performance between two groups of companies and initially looked at doing a two sample t-test but now have a question on which method to use since we realized that what we deemed to be our sample is actually our a population (yes, we suck at stats). Hence we have Population 1: Average ESG Score x (known). Sample 2: Indicated Average ESG Score f y (known) Population 2: Average ESG Score y (unknown) -- Rather than two samples and two populations. Is it appropriate to compare the means of Population 1 to Sample 2? Should this not increase the confidence/power due to removing a factor of uncertainty due to not having to sample group 1? Can't find an appropriate test for this scenario, very thankful for any guidance on this!
