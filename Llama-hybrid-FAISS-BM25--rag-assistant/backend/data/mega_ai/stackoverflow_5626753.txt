Pros and cons of whole project as a module?

I am in the process of learning Kohana 3. Just curious: some Kohana 3 projects I have looked at, like Kohanut CMS are implemented as one big module and located in /modules instead of /application (which is empty). Why is that? Only to make it easier to drag just one folder if you upgrade Kohana later?
