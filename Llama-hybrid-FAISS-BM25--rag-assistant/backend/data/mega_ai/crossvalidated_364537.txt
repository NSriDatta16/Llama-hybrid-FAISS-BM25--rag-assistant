I'll add to @Kodiologist that you wouldn't want the numbers to be more than say 5 or 6 places total. So if you have things with an average of 3000, do not have a decimal. If it's in millions, report it in 000's or 000,000's (3.125 million, 3,125 in 000's). There's probably a good rule of thumb to be established that you don't need to add another decimal place if the precision will be less than x percent. In @Kodiologist example, .1 is a change of 1.25% in the mean of 8 which should probably be reported, but .01 (change of 0.125%) is probably not important.
