Should we build our next generation web application on the DotNetNuke platform?

We are currently considering using DotNetNuke as a base for our future portal-based and client-customizable web application that is going to be hosted centrally. The idea is to make the dynamic parts as DNN modules that in turn talk to backend WCF-services which takes care of the business processing and data storage. What are your good/bad experiences with such a model? Anything you would warn against or recommend? Any advice would be appreciated, thanks...
