I would move the saving decision into an explicit Save button for the re-ordering because the user may change their mind and, as Peter Morris suggests, that will get past your performance problem. Further things to consider - explicit Move to Top and Move to Bottom items. I implemented a very successful UI using this kind of approach for user-driven selection of searchable items and reporting items, in an enterprise system. More details of the UI are available for you to see (be kind, remember it's about 15 years old - back in flat mono days!). One key refinement from a lot of user testing - the sweet spot for saving this order was not per-user or per-company but per-group. Groups were people working together who had a the same starting page (essentially the same root in a massively connected graph). We had about 7 unique groups in the organisation. So, if you go for a per-user or per-group approach, you need to pull the sort data out into a separate table which maps data keys to ordinal integers.
