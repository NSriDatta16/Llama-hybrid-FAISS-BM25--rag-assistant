Prerequisite for "Introduction to Statistical Thought"

I was browsing through http://www.math.umass.edu/~lavine/Book/book.html and found the book to be really exhaustive in terms of what I need it for but I was concerned about it's prerequisites. I have a background in Calculus (I/II/III) which were fairly applied (as opposed to proof based) and Linear Algebra. Not many other Math courses. I had taken a Probability and Stats course but dropped it midway because I didn't like the exposition. I remember things like average, mode, median etc. but not something to be relied upon. Can I read that book? As far as the book is concerned, the preface states "This book is intended as an upper level undergraduate or introductory graduate textbook in statistical thinking with a likelihood emphasis for students with a good knowledge of calculus and the ability to think abstractly. " I'm not sure what upper level undergraduate means. The reason I'm confused is because most books start off with probability with simple heads and tails type questions. The distributions come in much later but in his book, they come up in the first chapter itself. (Succinct is better, so if this is OK, I'd love to continue reading the book)
