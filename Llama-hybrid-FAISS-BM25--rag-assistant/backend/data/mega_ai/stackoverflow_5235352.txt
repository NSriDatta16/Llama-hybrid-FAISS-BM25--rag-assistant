Well apart from the "wah wahaaa" ;) you've given very little to go on (for example, you've not even mentioned the version of SharePoint you are having to deal with) but I will do my best ... When you say 'SharePoint Database' I am assuming that you're referring to a SharePoint list? Do you need to allow your users to enter/modify this data or is it read only? Are you inserting this data into SharePoint from another program, if so ran locally or remote? If this is something that you want your users to be able to add/edit/update then you may have to look at custom field types - these allow you to provide storage/view/edit functionality for a custom data type, e.g. ISDB numbers. If you're talking about inserting this data into a SharePoint list from another program then you can probably just use a read only text field (which you can create programatically or via the UI) and then insert records via the object model (will only run locally on your SharePoint server) or via the web services and the Lists web service (could be ran remotely). Or of course a combination of the two.
