Rijndael was renamed AES. Yes, it is safe to use. That said, you should consider carefully what you put in the cookie. It depends on what you have available in the way of storage on your system, but you could simply choose a random number (say a 64-bit number), and store that in the cookie. In your server-side system, you'd keep a record of who that number was associated with, and the other details. This avoids encryption altogether. You use the other details to validate (to the extent anything can be validated) whether the cookie was sent back from the browser you originally sent it to. Alternatively, you can use a different encryption key for each session, keeping a track of which key was used with which session. Even if you go with straight encryption with a fixed key, consider including a random number in with the data to be encrypted - this makes it harder to crack using a known plaintext attack because, by definition, the random number can't be known.
