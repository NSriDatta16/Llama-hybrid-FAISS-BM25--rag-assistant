The thing about WebForms is that it's very easy to make a page that performs really bad, because it encourages you to do a lot of simple updates server-side that really should be done client-side. If you're paying attention to your postbacks and ViewState then WebForms isn't so bad. Also, MVC has the potential for better performance because it takes fewer steps during a page load, but realizing that potential can require a lot of discipline by the programmer, just like web forms.
