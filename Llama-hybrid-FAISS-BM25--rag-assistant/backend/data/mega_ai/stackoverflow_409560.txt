Auto-vectorizing vs. vectorized code by hand

Is it better in some sense to vectorize code by hand, using explicit pragmas or to rely on or use auto-vectorization? For optimum performance using auto-vectorization, one would have to monitor the compiler output to ensure that loops are being vectorized or modify them until they are vectorizable. With hand coding, one is certain that the desired instructions are being emitted, but now the code is likely not portable (either to other architectures or other compilers).
