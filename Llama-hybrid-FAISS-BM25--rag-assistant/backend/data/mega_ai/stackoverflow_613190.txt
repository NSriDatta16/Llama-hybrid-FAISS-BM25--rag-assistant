One technique is to use color histograms . You can use machine learning algorithms to find similar images based on the repesentation you use. For example, the commonly used k-means algorithm . I have seen other solutions trying to analyze the vertical and horizontal lines in the image after using edge detection . Texture analysis is also used. A recent paper clustered images from picasa web. You can also try the clustering algorithm that I am working on.
