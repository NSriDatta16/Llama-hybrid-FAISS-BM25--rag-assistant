GlobalAlloc explanation

(char*)GlobalAlloc(GPTR, len + 1); This is the line of code in question, which I'm using from a tutorial. I'm reading from an EDITTEXT . I'd mostly like to know where GPTR came from, and what it's for. It hasn't been defined anywhere else in the code. I've got a basic understanding of the rest of the line, but MSDN 's explanation isn't quite clear. They say this: HGLOBAL WINAPI GlobalAlloc( __in UINT uFlags, __in SIZE_T dwBytes ); Could someone explain in plain English where GPTR is from, what it's for, and how it relates to __in UINT uFlags ? I know it's an unsigned int but then the knowing stops. Thanks in advance.
