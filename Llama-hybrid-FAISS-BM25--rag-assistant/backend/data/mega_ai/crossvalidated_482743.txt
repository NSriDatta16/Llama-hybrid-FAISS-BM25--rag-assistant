How do you count the number of parameters for AIC?

Suppose I have an $n$ by $10$ data matrix $X$ and a continuous target $y$ . I want to compare 2 models: $m_0$ , which is an OLS regression model, and $m_1$ , which is a deep neural network with $10^6$ weights. The network is maximizing Gaussian likelihood, same as for OLS, and I would like to use AIC as the comparison metric. For OLS the number of parameters would be $10+1$ , but what do I use for the neural network? It seems to me that requiring one extra nat of log-likelihood per parameter is an enormous cost for networks with millions of weights. And what about things like the optimizer and dropout? Technically that's a decision made based on your data, so would those be counted as extra parameters?
