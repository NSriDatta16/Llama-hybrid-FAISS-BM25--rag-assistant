WOE transformations help when you have both numeric and categorical data that you need to combine and missing values throughout that you would like to extract information from. Converting everything to WOE helps "standardize" many different types of data (even missing data) onto the the same log odds scale. This blog post explains things reasonably well: http://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/2015/08/13/weight-of-evidence/ The short of the story is that Logistic Regression with WOE, should just be (and is) called a Semi-Naive Bayesian Classifier (SNBC). If you are trying to understand the algorithm, the name SNBC is, to me, far more informative.
