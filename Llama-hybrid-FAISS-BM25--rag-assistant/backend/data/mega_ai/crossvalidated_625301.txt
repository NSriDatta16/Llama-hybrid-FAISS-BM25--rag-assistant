Percentage change time series correlation vs time series correlation

I have two time series and I computed the percentage change like: (Value at time2)/(Value at time1) - 1 My doubt is on the correlation of the original time series and the percentage change time series. The correlation for the original time series is -0.2 while for the percentage change is 0.22. My question is just on a theoretical level: is it possibile to have opposite relationships between the two pairs of time series? How should I interpret this opposite behavior of the two couple of time series?
