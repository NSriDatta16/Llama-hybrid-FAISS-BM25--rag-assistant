What are some reasons iteratively reweighted least squares would not converge when used for logistic regression?

I've been using the glm.fit function in R to fit parameters to a logistic regression model. By default, glm.fit uses iteratively reweighted least squares to fit the parameters. What are some reasons this algorithm would fail to converge, when used for logistic regression?
