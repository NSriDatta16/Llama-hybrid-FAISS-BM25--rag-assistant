What is the dataset during testing a Variational auto-encoder?

I am getting confused in the testing dataset of a VAE. After training the VAE, what should be the testing data-set of the VAE? I understand that during testing the VAE only has the decoder part. Hence, we need to give inputs from the latent space. But what input shall be there? It can't be any random set of numbers, right? Thanks for the help
