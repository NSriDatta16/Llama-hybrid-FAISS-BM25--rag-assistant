Identifying the nature of the a stochastic Process

I am new to the Stochastic process. I am interested in identifying the description of a stochastic process. For example, Example 1 : let us consider the queue at post office. Let's imagine that we observe the queue every minute. Therefore, at the n-esimo minutes there would be a number of people. We indicate the Xn the stochastic variable that indicates the number of people at the minute n . Thus, we will have X1, X2, x3,... Description 1 : it is a process with discrete time and discrete state. Why? It is a discrete time because we are interested in measuring the queue every minutes. It is discrete state because the possible values for the aleatory variable Xn are numerable. Example 2 : let us consider the queue at post office. Let's imagine that we observe the queue every minute. Therefore, at the n-esimo minutes there would be a number of people. We indicate the Xn the stochastic variable that indicates the average high of people that are in the queue at the minute n . Thus, we will have X1, X2, x3,... Description 2 : It is a process with discrete time and continue state. Why? It is a discrete time because we are interested in measuring the queue every minutes. It is continue state because the possible values for the aleatory variable Xn is all R (Real Number). Is the above correct? if not what is wrong?
