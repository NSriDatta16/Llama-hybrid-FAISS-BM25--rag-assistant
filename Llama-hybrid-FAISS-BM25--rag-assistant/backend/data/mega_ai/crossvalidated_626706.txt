Can I use the residuals of a time series decomposition to estimate the effect of a covariate?

Context I work for a company that has an e-commerce website. Regularly we make specific campaigns in order to sell more. For example: We can make a campaign for fathers day, black Friday, crazy August, and so on. Problem It is hard to understand the impact of the campaign on sales. Because the impact of the campaign can not be isolated from a recent trend or a seasonality of the market. Solution I thought so far If I decompose the time-series using, for example STL , could I take the residuals and correlate them with predictors? Examples Correlate with expenses on media on the e-commerce (as long as I have the historical data) Correlate with the period that a campaign was active (If positive peaks in the residuals agree with the investment in ads, while negative peaks happened when there was no investment, may I say that there is a correlation)? Disclaimer I know that I can't interpret the result of this relationship as causation , but the main point is: Can I take the residuals and proceed with a regular regression analysis? Is there a better approach to measure the impact of a campaign in this case? I read that the US government removes the seasonality of the time-series to evaluate whether the unemployment rate increases/decreases over time. This was my inspiration for the question. Thyme-boost use this approach for prediction;
