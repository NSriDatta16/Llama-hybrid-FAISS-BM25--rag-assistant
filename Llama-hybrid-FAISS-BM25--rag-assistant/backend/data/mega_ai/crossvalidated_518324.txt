Find treshold to separate two classes based on single predictor

I have a binary output variable (not healthy, healthy) that I want to classify. I found based on univariate analysis that one of my independent predictors already tells apart both classes perfectly. So, I want to find the optimal threshold to separate the classes based on this single variable. I thought maybe SVM, but I don't understand the results for a single predictor.. Then I thought about using a varying threshold on the independent variable, get the prediction performance (true positives, false negatives) for each threshold, plot the roc curve and check for the best performance (and the respective threshold). Is this overcomplicated? Is there a statistical test for this?
