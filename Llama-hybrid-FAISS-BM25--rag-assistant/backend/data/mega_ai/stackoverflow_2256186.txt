The CEDET tools at http://cedet.sf.net includes a C# parser in the 'contrib' area that can parse C# code. CEDET then supports specialized interfaces for both speedbar and imenu, that will shape your menu constructs in a way that code organized, not tag type organized. In c++, for example, code like this: namespace foo { class bar { int somemethod(); } } would give you a tree that had "bar" under "foo", and "somemethod" under "bar", so if you know your structure, you just need to unwind by name to the tag you want.
