Random effect 100% correlated to covariate

I work on social insects. I'm measuring the effect of inbreeding in a colony versus the LD50 (lethal dose 50%) of a pathogen. So basically the LD50 is the dependent variable, and the inbreeding level (a value between 0 and 1) as the independent variable. Now, we took a lot of individuals samples per colony. Normally I would add Colony as a random effect in my models, to account for pseudoreplication/structure in the dataset. However, each colony has a specific inbreeding value, so colony and inbreeding level are completely correlated. Furthermore, I guess it doesn't make sense in the first place to estimate a random intercept or slope for colony, considering the fact that we only ever have one value on the x-axis for each colony, so not really a slope/intercept to speak of. Are there other ways in which I could take into account that samples belonging to the same colony are related to each other? I guess I could make one average value of LD50 per colony/inbreeding level, but that would get rid of a lot of statistical power. Hope the question is clear, and thank you for your time!
