How to deal with expected value in the context of time series?

For example, in this MA(2) model, $y_t = u_t + \phi u_{t-2}$ $u_t$ is identically, independently, normally distributed with a mean of 0 and a variance of $\sigma^2$ . (Does variance matter here?) I think $E[u_{t}|y_{t-2}] = 0$ because it is impossible to represent $y_{t-2}$ using an equation containing $u_{t}$ . However, in the solution, it states that $E[u_{t-6}|y_{t-2}] = 0$ is also 0. But I think $y_{t-2}$ can be represented with an equation containing $u_{t-6}$ ( $y_{t-2} = u_{t-2} + \phi (y_{t-4} - \phi u_{t-6})$ ). So why is $E[u_{t-6}|y_{t-2}] = 0$ ? Is it because " $u_t$ is identically, independently, normally distributed"? If yes, am I correct that any expected value of u conditional on y (no matter their index) is always 0 (including $E[u_t-2|y_{t}]$ )? Why is $E[y_{t-4}|y_{t-2}] = E[y_{t}|y_{t-2}]$ ? In the solution, it says "because $u_{t-2}|y_{t-2}$ and $u_{t-4}|y_{t-2}$ are independent conditionally". But how are the reasons given relevant? $y_{t}$ can not really be represented as equation containing $u_{t-2}$ , $u_{t-4}$ and $y_{t-4}$ . Is it also analogous to autoregressive time series?
