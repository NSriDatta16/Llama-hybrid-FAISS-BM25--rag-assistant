Finding Balance in Network of Friendships

I have a couple of data points on a large group of high school students: A: Who their Friends are B: Strength of Friendship for each friend (out of 5, 5 being best friends and 1 being acquaintances) C: Grade Point Average for each student To start, I want to confirm the "popular kids hangs out with other popular kids" phenomenon, I've aggregated the dataset and now I have all student and their friend count. What would be my next step? What kind of model should I be using to confirm the "popular kids" phenomenon. Next, I hypothesize that "high GPA kids hang out with other high GPA kids", which model should I use here? Apologies if this is an easy question, I'm new to network analysis and not sure where to start.
