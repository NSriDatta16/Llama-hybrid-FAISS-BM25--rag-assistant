Neural Networks Algorithms or something like that to Find Appropriate Parameters for an Application that Uses Genetic Algorithms to Run It Less Time

I developed an application with Java that uses genetic algorithms. My application needs parameters as like: How many genes will be populate at first? How many genes will be killed after crossover and mutation? What will be the mutation rate? I can test something as like: How long(milliseconds) does it take to find a solution. How can I find the good values as parameters for my application. I mean I will give as an input that results: Genes to populate | Genes to kill | Mutation rate | Result(milliseconds) --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 50 5 16/1000 146 50 5 16/1000 208 50 5 16/1000 1000 50 5 16/1000 216 100 5 16/1000 178 100 5 16/1000 546 100 5 16/1000 646 100 5 16/1000 46 100 5 16/1000 186 50 10 16/1000 346 50 10 16/1000 246 50 10 16/1000 546 50 5 34/1000 746 50 5 34/1000 186 50 5 34/1000 196 50 10 34/1000 496 50 10 34/1000 23 50 10 34/1000 169 That results are random. I didn't test my program. After I run that algorithm(I think I will give a result time that is good for me for example 78 milliseconds) it will say something like that: You should use that parameters to get a result that takes 78 milliseconds: Genes to populate | Genes to kill | Mutation rate -------------------------------------------------------- 34 7 24/1000 PS1: One more is that, what strategy I should follow to test it. For example just changing one parameters and test them some number of times and changing other parameter etc.etc.(I tried to give my example values as like that) or testing some values and find one parameter and using that parameter always and testing other parameters that changes one by one and finding other parameter and using that two parameters and changing other one by one and going on like that. PS2 I can use an API or a software program to find it too. EDIT: These are my variables that I use nowwith their values: MAX_POPULATION_SIZE = 50; HARD_WEIGHTS = {1,20,1,1,1,20,1};/* It means that I have 7 variables for this */ NUMBER_OF_GENES_TO_KILL = 5; MUTATION_RATE = 100; MAX_MUTATION_NUMBER = 1000; /* Mutation rate is MUTATION_RATE/MAX_MUTATION_NUMBER */
