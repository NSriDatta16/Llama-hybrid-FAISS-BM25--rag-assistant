How to Standardize Image With ImageDataGenerator Standardization is a data scaling technique that assumes that the distribution of the data is Gaussian and shifts the distribution of the data to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. Data with this distribution is referred to as a standard Gaussian. It can be beneficial when training neural networks as the dataset sums to zero and the inputs are small values in the rough range of about -3.0 to 3.0 (e.g. 99.7 of the values will fall within three standard deviations of the mean). Standardization of images is achieved by subtracting the mean pixel value and dividing the result by the standard deviation of the pixel values. The mean and standard deviation statistics can be calculated on the training dataset, and as discussed in the previous section, Keras refers to this as feature-wise. datagen = ImageDataGenerator(featurewise_center=True, featurewise_std_normalization=True) # calculate mean and standard deviation on the training dataset datagen.fit(trainX) The statistics can also be calculated then used to standardize each image separately, and Keras refers to this as sample-wise standardization. # sample-wise standardization datagen = ImageDataGenerator(samplewise_center=True, samplewise_std_normalization=True) I hope this article help you: https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-normalize-center-and-standardize-images-with-the-imagedatagenerator-in-keras/
