I would first connect all coordinates of each trace with lines, or smoother curves. Then I would parameterize the curve by length (distance) from the starting point along the trace. So that half the way on a given path would be 0.5, for instance, i.e. normalized distances. Once this is done for all traces, then it's easy to average lat/lon for any given length (distance) from the start. I’m afraid this is the only non parametric way that matches the problem. From your plot it appears that the traces don’t try to stay on a certain path but rather fly from point A to point B on the path of their choosing.
