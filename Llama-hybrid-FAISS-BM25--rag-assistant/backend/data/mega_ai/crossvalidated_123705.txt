How do we interpret the coefficients of the random effects model?

Also, what is the difference between the interpretation of the coefficients of random and fixed effects? What I understand is this: in fixed effects, the coefficient of x shows that, what would be the increase in y, as compared to individual i's own average y, due to one unit change in x, as compared to i's average x. is this correct? Is the interpretation same for random effects?
