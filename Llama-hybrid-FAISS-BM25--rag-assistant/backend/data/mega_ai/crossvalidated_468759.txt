Housing discrimination example: How do I go about this problem?

I have been given a dataset containing the following setup and the following data. Two prospective tenants, one black and one white are looking for apartments across various neighbourhoods. The average incomes of the neighbourhoods are given as well as race of the landlords(1 for black, 0 for white). Both tenants ask at the same houses and their successes(1) and failures(0) are recorded. How do I relate success of the black and white tenants with income in the neighbourhood? How do I relate success of the black and white tenants by race of the landlord? Can I do anything more with the given data? Stata pointers would also be highly appreciated. I've tried both logit Black(and White) NbdIncm and probit, but I'm not sure which is more appropriate etc. since I have zero experience with such datasets and I'm completely lost. github link here raceexample.dta https://github.com/RT1234-cmd/Data
