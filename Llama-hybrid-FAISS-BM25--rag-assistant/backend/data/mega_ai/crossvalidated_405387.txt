Interpret a multiple linear regression when Y is log transformed

I have the following multiple linear regression model: Log(y) = B0 + B1X1 + B2X2 + B3x3 + e. X1 is a dummy that can take 0 = male and 1 = female and X2 and X3 are continuous variables. I am not entirely sure on how to interpret the coefficients for the variables. The coefficient for the dummy variable is 0,20. Does that mean, that changing from male to female (male is baseline) the Y will increase by an average of 20%. Is it directly translated into percentage? And for the continuous variables, the coefficient for X2 is 0,1. Does that mean that increasing X2 with 1 unit increases Y with an average of 10%? Again, is it directly translated into percentage?
