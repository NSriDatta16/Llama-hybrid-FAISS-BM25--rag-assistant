Need customizable organization chart plugin for my Rails app

It would be great if anyone could let me know of a simple yet sweet jQuery or any other Javascript plugin for my Rails app, to create customizable (I can add sub-ordinates and superiors) organization charts. I did Google, but didn't find anything appropriate. I use awesome_nested_set to maintain the tree structure at the back-end.
