How to check if several variables are empty in Perl

I have a Perl script where variables must be initialized before the script can proceed. A lengthy if statement where I check each variable is the obvious choice. But maybe there is a more elegant or concise way to check several variables. Edit: I don't need to check for "defined", they are always defined with an empty string, I need to check that all are non-empty. Example: my ($a, $b, $c) = ("", "", ""); # If-clauses for setting the variables here if( !$a || !$b || !$c) { print "Init failed\n"; }
