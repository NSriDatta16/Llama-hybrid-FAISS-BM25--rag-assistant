problem creating a simple relationship in SQL Server 2005

I am using the database diagram to simply drag one column in a table to another to associate them and then trying to save it. i have done this a million times in the past with no problems. Both of the data types are the same, uniqueidentifier. Here is the error I get: 'Customer ' table saved successfully 'CustomerOrder ' table - Unable to create relationship 'FK_CustomerOrder_Customer'. The ALTER TABLE statement conflicted with the FOREIGN KEY constraint "FK_CustomerOrder_Customer". The conflict occurred in database "mydatabase", table "Customer", column 'CustomerID'. Not sure how to trouble shoot this.
