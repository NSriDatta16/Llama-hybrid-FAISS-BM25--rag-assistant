Which R package to use to conduct a latent class growth analysis (LCGA) / growth mixture model (GMM)?

I am trying to perform a latent class growth analysis (LCGA) and/or growth mixture models (GMMs) in R. The data I am using is an increasing number of forks of git repositories (discrete variable, not categorical), as you can see in this dataset . I tried lavaan , which helped me fit a latent growth curve model, but not to identify latent classes. I also tried poLCA , which only works for categorical polytomous variables, hence did not suffice either. What is the most appropriate R package for performing a latent class growth analysis on discrete variable data? The analysis I want to do is similar to that in Qureshi & Fang (2010): Qureshi, I., and Fang, Y. 2010. “Socialization in Open Source Software Projects: A Growth Mixture Modeling Approach,” Organizational Research Methods (14:1), pp. 208–238.
