Theoretical calculation of probability

I am trying to do theoretical calculations for a problem where I have microRNA of size 20, with a probability of 0.7 of getting a purine, if I have 100 of these microRNA what is the probability that the average number of purines will be greater than 15. I am not allowed to use monte carlo on this. I had been thinking something along the lines of rbinom(100,20,0.7) but I think that would still be considered a monte carlo? I'm really not sure what direction to go with this.
