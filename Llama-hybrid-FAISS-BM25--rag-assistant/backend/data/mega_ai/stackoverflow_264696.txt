As other answers mentioned, there is also some internal housekeeping that SQL performs, that might trigger your WriteFile or other low-level monitoring process. Is it possible to write a wrapper database, that you connect to, store all changes, or timestamp of latest change. And sends them to the real storage. I think you could do something like this with views. Performance will not be optimal.
