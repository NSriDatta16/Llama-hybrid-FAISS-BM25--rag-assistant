which metric is better for boosting methods

I work on a dataset of 300 000 samples and I try to make a comparison between logistic regression (with gradients descent ) and a LightBoost for binary classification in order to choose the better one. I want to know in this case which metric should I use it and WHY ? Accuracy ?? AUC Test value ?? RMSE ?? LogLoss ??
