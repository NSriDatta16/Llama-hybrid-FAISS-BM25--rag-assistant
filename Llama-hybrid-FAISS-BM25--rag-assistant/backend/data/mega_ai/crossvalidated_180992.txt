Using lagged dependent variables in machine learning regression

I'm building a machine learning (random forest) regression model to predict flow in a river, using rainfall, relative humidity, air temperature and certain other climatic variables. Since flow on a particular day ( flow_t ) is highly correlated with flow on previous day ( flow_t_1 ), I want to include lagged flow in the model formulation. In case I build the model this way: require(randomForest) flow.rf=randomForest(flow_t~flow_t_1+temp+humidity..........) How can I use the above model for predictions? Since the input dataset for prediction will not have the flow variable, I cannot include its lagged version in the prediction call. I know that the dynlm package can be used to perform 'autoregressive distributed lag modeling' to include lagged dependent variables, but how can this be done for machine learning models? Or even for other statistical modeling techniques, like GLMs and GAMs?
