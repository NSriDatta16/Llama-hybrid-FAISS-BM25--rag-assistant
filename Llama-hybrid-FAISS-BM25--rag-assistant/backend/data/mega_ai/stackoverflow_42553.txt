@Ben You can actually do a full delete in TFS, but it is highly not recommended unless you know what you are doing. You have to do it from the command line with the command tf destroy tf destroy [/keephistory] itemspec1 [;versionspec] [itemspec2...itemspecN] [/stopat:versionspec] [/preview] [/startcleanup] [/noprompt] Versionspec: Date/Time Dmm/dd/yyyy or any .Net Framework-supported format or any of the date formats of the local machine Changeset number Cnnnnnn Label Llabelname Latest version T Workspace Wworkspacename;workspaceowner Just before you do this make sure you try it out with the /preview. Also everybody has their own methodology for branching. Mine is to branch releases, and do all development in the development or root folder. Also it sounded like branching worked fine for you, just the solution file was screwed up, which may be because of a binding issue and the vssss file.
