I disagree with the suggestion of using days elapsed given by wjktrs. Unlike medical studies of human patients, starting day of year is very important in ecological studies of seasonal patterns. As seasonality of plant growth patterns is strong, patterns observed on 183 days elapsed since a beginning in January would carry completely different implications from those with a beginning day in July. Therefore, consolidating to days elapsed since a study began discards useful information that day of year retains. It is okay to use different units of measurements in modelling and plotting. They are simple linear transformations. In fact, you do not even need any transformation but a change in axis labelling. You can see tutorials of plotting time series at https://otexts.com/fpp3/graphics.html . How to represent the seasonality is important. If you use day of year, you will need to include many high-order polynomials such as x + I(x^2) + I(x^3) + I(x^4) + I(x^5) or Fourier terms using sine and cosine functions. But the coefficients will be difficult to interpret intuitively. You could benefit by using 11 indicators of month or three indicators of quarter, then you can state that compared with January or winter, July or summer vegetation increase by this amount. Since you have longitudinal data, an ordinary least squares estimator may not suffice and suffer from spatial and temporal serial correlation in errors. You may instead need to learn generalized least squares and mixed-effect models. Since your response variable is vegetative relative cover of nettle plants, it may be a percentage, strictly positive, or nonnegative value. You may need to use fractional model, beta regression potentially with zero and one inflation, gamma regression, or ordinal regression.
