C - accessing a struct from dynamic memory

I'm writing a program with struct Record. As I read in records from text in a loop, I assign them to buffer before saving buffer into the array. nRange is just the total number of records being read. Record *storage; storage = (Record*)malloc(nRange*sizeof(Record)); Record buffer; storage[i] = buffer; I want to access storage[i] in order to check that the record is being saved to memory, but I can't quite get the syntax. I was trying something like: printf("%d \n", &storage[i].x); But I think this is just giving me the address of the x value of the Record at storage[i]. If anyone could give me the exact syntax I'd greatly appreciate it.
