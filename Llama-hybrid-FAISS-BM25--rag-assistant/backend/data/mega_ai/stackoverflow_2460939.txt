Working with financial data? ;) I have an app here hndling 1.5 million such streams (CME complete feed) in tests ;) Relational - you CAN do it, but it is wastefull. What I did is a binary storage PER STREAM and put the alues into a delta format that is binary efficient (timestamps always go up - so no need to keep them total, only smal ldelta from alst). I store them currently in 15 minute slices, and the system to retrieve the tail knows how to get the data. Also puts a LOT less load on the relational side. Ther eare specialized databases for this, but they are obscene (10.000 USD per processor core, minimum license 8 cores - yeah, right). Some applications go with flat files (one per key), eve ntrading style applications. I don tlike that personally.
