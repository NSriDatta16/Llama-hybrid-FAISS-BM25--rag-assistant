Gathering coverage statistics To gather coverage statistics you need to use Devel::Cover . (If you can't directly change the source core of included scripts you can just specify -MDevel::Cover as a parameter to perl.) So you should rather change your "test script" to add this parameter when calling other Perl script like following: my @args = ("perl", "-MDevel::Cover", "ex4200fw","-query-fw","-i","192.168.168.1"); Or you can specify enviroment variable PERL5OPT=-MDevel::Cover before top test script is executed. In this case you'll not need to change any script source. Here is a small shell sample: ## run tests and gather coverage statistics export PERL5OPT=-MDevel::Cover perl test1.pl perl test2.pl ... Calculate result coverage There is the cover utility which outputs all lines which were executed. You should run it after all tests are executed. Standard modules are excluded from the report by default.
