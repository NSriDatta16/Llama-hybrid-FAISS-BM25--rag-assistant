Bayesian and Markovian Networks: How do we obtain the probabilities at each node in a Bayesian or Markovian network

I just have a very basic 2 part question about Bayesian and Markovian networks. I suppose my confusion stems by trying to learn about these things through blog posts and videos, and not being able to ask someone direct clarifying questions, but hopefully someone here can ally my confusion. The 2 questions are explained below. But here are the questions for easy reference. How are the probabilities computed at each node in a Bayesian or Markovian network. Can we, or how can we use continuous distributions at different nodes? Say I have a Bayesian network like the one pictured below . I would like to understand how the probability distribution is setup at each node in the network. That is, usually the probability distribution at each node is setup as a simple table with a discrete probability distribution. Now, if I have a dataset and I want to create the distribution for each node, do I just subset the table and then compute the simple frequencies? For example in the table to compute the distribution over "Congestion" would I just subset my dataset and manually compute the number of times someone has congestion given that the have the flu, over the total number of people with congestion. And then compute the total number of times that someone has congestion given hayfever, divided by the total number of people with congestion. I am not sure if I might need to renormalize the probabilities, but would it just be that simple to obtain the discrete distribution for each node? I might just be overthinking it because I am used to applying multivariate control on things like this--but the graphical structure of the model seems to be handling the multivariate control that I would use in some regression. I mean, some of the people who have Hayfever might have the Flu at the same time, so how do we deal with this? The second question is what to do with continuous distributions. Is it possible to use a continuous distribution for the node? Technically I could discretize the continuous distribution but I was just wondering if something like that is possible, and how we would again estimate the distribution from data. Again, it is just creating a distribution from the table, or is there anything more than that. Thanks for any assistance with clarifying how Bayesian and Markov networks work.
