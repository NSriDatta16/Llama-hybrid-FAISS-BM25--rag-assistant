Mean Average Precision vs Mean Reciprocal Rank

I am trying to understand when it is appropriate to use the MAP and when MRR should be used. I found this presentation that states that MRR is best utilised when the number of relevant results is less than 5 and best when it is 1. In other cases MAP is appropriate. I have two questions: I don't really understand why this is so. I can't find a citable reference for this claim. Please note that I don't have a very strong statistical background so a layman's explanation would help a lot. Thank you.
