The code is just an if-then statement. If replace==TRUE then random forest just does bootstrap resampling: for each tree , it draws a sample with replacement from the data with size equal to the original sample size. If replace==FALSE then random forest just random sampling: for each tree , it draws a sample without replacement from the data with size equal to ceiling(.632*nrow(x)) . The number 0.632 might seem like a "magic number" but it is approximately $1-\exp(-1)$ , which is an important number in bootstrap samples. See: Why on average does each bootstrap sample contain roughly two thirds of observations? Random Forests out-of-bag sample size
