logistic regression with categorical data will assume that there is a scale between the categories, it can not handle unordered categories. Having said that, you could split A and B into one-hot encoded vectors and perform a logistic regression on this representation, which will only include binary variables. If your analysis still applies to this model, you are golden. Otherwise, there will be differences between the chunked model and the full model.
