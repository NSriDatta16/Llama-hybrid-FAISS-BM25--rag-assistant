The following macro will return the alignment requirement of any given type (even if it's a struct): #define TYPE_ALIGNMENT( t ) offsetof( struct { char x; t test; }, test ) Note: I probably borrowed this idea from a Microsoft header at some point way back in my past... Edit: as Robert Gamble points out in the comments, this macro is not guaranteed to work. In fact, it will certainly not work very well if the compiler is set to pack elements in structures. So if you decide to use it, use it with caution. Some compilers have an extension that allows you obtain the alignment of a type (for example, starting with VS2002, MSVC has an __alignof() intrinsic). Those should be used when available.
