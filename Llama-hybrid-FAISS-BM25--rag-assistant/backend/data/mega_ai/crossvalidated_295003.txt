This concept is a consequence of the law of large numbers . From Wikipedia , According to the law, the average of the results obtained from a large number of trials should be close to the expected value, and will tend to become closer as more trials are performed. Results from a small sample may be farther from the expected value than that from a larger sample. And so, as stated in the question, one should be cautious of results calculated from small samples. The idea is also explained pretty well in this youTube video .
