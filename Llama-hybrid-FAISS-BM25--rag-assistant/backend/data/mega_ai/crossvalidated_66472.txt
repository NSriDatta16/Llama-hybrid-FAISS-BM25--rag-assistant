Model each color pill as a multinomial distribution (as Sameer says) over functions (whose natural parameter is the total log probability of the pill having that function). With each draw, you add the bag's log-probabilities to the appropriate color's multinomial distribution parameters. This Bayesian evidence combination is called a "product of experts" by some people.
