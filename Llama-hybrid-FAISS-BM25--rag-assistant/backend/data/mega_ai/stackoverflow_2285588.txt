This decision depends on many factors. Like how many concurrent users will be accessing this application (Access does not allow more than 5). How big is the database? How much growth do you expect? What features do you need besides basic data storage? What is the budget? The answers to these questions will help you to select the right product. There are many different ones out there. So far i've been very pleased with SQL server and MySQL (which is free). I'd steer clear of Oracle though I found it it be a hassle to work with and generally a heap of junk. [Edit] Based on your last comment I would go with SQL Server Express with advanced services http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&FamilyID=b448b0d0-ee79-48f6-b50a-7c4f028c2e3d . This product is still free. The only limitation is the database can't be larger than 4 gigabytes or something like that. I hope this helps.
