Thanks for anwsers guys. It seems that AIR is not the problem here actually. The problem is that when you install an application on the SD card and you write files into your bundle these files are not stored into the bundle on the SD card but they are written onto internal memory. So pointing to your application directory when your app is on the SD card is actually pointing to internal memory storage on the device. This does not make any sense... Which leaves me to writing files into 'user directory's' pointing to the SD card, but doing so leaves my files unprotected on the sd card. There are ways to do encryption/decryption but for larger files they slow down the process too much thus ruining the user experience. It's like a multi headed dragon...Once you succeed in cutting one head of it grows even more... For each solution you find, you get an extra two problems to solve and so on... :-)
