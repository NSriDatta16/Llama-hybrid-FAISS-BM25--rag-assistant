Collecting training data for document classification with unbalanced classes

I have a document classification problem in which the estimated class proportions in the population are severely unbalanced: the population is ~99% class 0 and ~1% class 1. I am using a logistic regression classifier (LibLINEAR), and have little flexibility in this decision. To maximize the classifier's F1 score, should I try to collect training data with the same class proportions as the population (while ensuring that there are enough instances of the minority class)? Or should I collect equal proportions of the classes, and use asymmetric misclassification penalties?
