Expected value of function with normally distributed input

How can we calculate the expected value of a function $f$ with a normally distributed input? The function can vary. Right now, I am sampling $n$ instances from the normal distribution, calculating $f(x)$ for $x \in n$ , and averaging. I am sure that there must be a better way.
