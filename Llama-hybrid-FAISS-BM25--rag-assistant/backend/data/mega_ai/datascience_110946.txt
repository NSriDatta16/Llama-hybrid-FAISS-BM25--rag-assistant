One option would be to use a library like Textblob . It has a function to calculate the sentiment of a sentence and assign polarity score and subjectivity score. So you could also pass a word instead of a sentence and it will calculate the polarity of that word along with the subjectivity. The 2 options you have suggested might also work (specially the BERT one). Try all the available options and then see which gives the best results. Cheers!
