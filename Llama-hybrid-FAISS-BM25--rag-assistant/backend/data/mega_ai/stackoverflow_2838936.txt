Without seeing all your code, I suspect the problem is that you're adjusting the in-memory DOM, but not writing the result back to the file. Writing it out looks something like: TransformerFactory.newInstance().newTransformer() .transform(new DOMSource(doc), new StreamResult(f)); where doc is a Document, and f is the File to write to. In order to find particular elements in a DOM, I recommend XPath .
