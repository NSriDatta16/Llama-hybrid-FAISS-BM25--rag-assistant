If A and B are independent, can P(C | A, B) be expressed only in terms of P(A), P(B), P(C | A), and P(C | B)?

Conditional probability question. Let's say I have... three random variables: A , B , C A and B are independent C depends on A and B My question is: can I express P(C | A, B) in terms of P(A) , P(B) , P(C | A) , and P(C | B) ? Asking this because I'm studying Bayesian networks, and I'm wondering if it's possible to define a node's "complete" conditional probability distribution (i.e. P(X | all parents of X) ) given only "partially conditional" distributions, like one conditional per parent ( {P(X | parent 1), P(X | parent 2), ...} ). I have a hunch that this is not possible. I think we also need to know P(A, B | C) . Just struggling to prove this analytically.
