Is 25-75 a good case-control ratio for a neural network?

I have 50,000 DNA samples from a biobank. Only 2,200 samples have the label (disease) that I want to work with for supervised learning in a neural network. So my question is, how many of those non-diseased samples do I need to include in my training data? If the diseased samples are my cases, how big should my control group be? Twice as big? The same size? What would a good ratio be? The feature space is insanely big, so I am worried about training times. It feels unnecessary to include all the other 48,000 controls. And yes, yes I know it will depend on the accuracy that I am seeing in the model, but whatâ€™s a good starting ratio?
