To connect to SQL Server from C#.NET, you need to create a connection string such as below: private SqlConnection connection; private string connectionString = @"Server=(local);Database=Embedding_SQL_Test;User ID=sa;Password=123"; connection = new SqlConnection( connectionString ); Next, you use the SqlConnection object created above to create a 'SqlCommand', as shown below: SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand( "select * from Customer where CustomerID = @Cid", connection); The SQL query shown here can be replaced by a SELECT , INSERT , UPDATE queries etc. Next to execute the SQL queries in the database, you use the following methods: ExecuteReader - to execute SELECT queries ExecuteNonQuery - to execute INSERT , DELETE , UPDATE , and SET statements.
