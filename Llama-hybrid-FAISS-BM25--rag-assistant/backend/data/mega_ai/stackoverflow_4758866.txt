I recommend this example : Ordinary average : (a+b+c....z)/(number_added_items) Rating average : (va*a + vb*b + vc*c... +vz*z)/(number_added_items) In the first case you could say that the weight for each item is 1 as all items have the same weight in the calculation, while in the second case weights differ) In your case the weight for each rating vote might depend on the voter so let's say a highly rated voter has a ponder for 3 his vote while a novice has 1.If 3 novices vote for an answer the rating of that answer will be (1*1+1*1+1*1)/(3) = 1 while if 2 high voters and a novice vote for an answer the average will be 3*1+3*1+1*1/3 = 2.33. Does this answer your question? otherwise please be more explicit.
