The better test is the the one that better addresses your question. Neither is just better on it's face. The differences here are equivalent to those found when regressing y on x and x on y and the reasons for different results are similar. The variance being assessed depends on which variable is being treated as the response variable in the model. Your research question is terribly vague. Perhaps if you considered direction of causality you'd be able to come to a conclusion about which analysis you want to use. Is age causing people to respond "yes" or is responding "yes" causing people to get older? It's more likely the former, in which case the variance in the probability of a "yes" is what you wish to model and therefore the logistic regression is the best choice. That said, you should examine assumptions of the tests. Those can be found online at wikipedia or in your text books on them. It may well be that you have good reasons not to perform the logistic regression and, when that happens you may need to ask a different question.
