It turns out that you can do impersonated search in SharePoint without a password. We figured this out back in August of 2009 and I have been remiss in updating Stack Overflow with the answer. See http://wiki.threewill.com/display/is/2010/06/18/Connect+to+SharePoint+-+Forwarding+User+Identities for the details and pay special attention to the special requirements. Note that this does work with both SharePoint 2007 and SharePoint 2010. Many thanks to my coworker Eric Bowden who did all of the work!
