System.currentTimeMillis will get it in milliseconds and nanoTime in nanosceconds. If you're trying to compare the performance of different techniques, note that the JVM environment is complex so simply taking one time is not meaningful. I always write a loop where I execute method 1 a few thousand times, then do a System.gc, then execute method 2 a few thousands times, then do another System.gc, then loop back and do the whole thing again at least five or six times. This helps to average out time for garbage collection, just-in-time compiles, and other magic things happening in the JVM.
