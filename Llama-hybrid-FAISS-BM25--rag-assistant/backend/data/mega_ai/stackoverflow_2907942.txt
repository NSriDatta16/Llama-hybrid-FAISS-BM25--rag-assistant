Web Deployment Projects for VS2010 on build server failing with Error MSB4086

When I upgraded my Web Deployment Project from VS2008 to the VS2010 beta version, I was able to execute the build locally on my development box. However, when I tried to execute the build on our TeamCity build server, I began getting the following exception: C:\Program Files\MSBuild\Microsoft\WebDeployment\v10.0\Microsoft.WebDeployment.targets(162, 37): error MSB4086: A numeric comparison was attempted on "$(_SourceWebProjectPath.Length)" that evaluates to "" instead of a number, in condition "'$(_SourceWebProjectPath)' != '' And $(_SourceWebProjectPath.Length) >= 4)". I did install the Web Deployment Project addin on my build server and I did copy over the C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\Microsoft\VisualStudio\v10.0\WebApplications directory on my development box to the C:\Program Files\MSBuild\Microsoft\VisualStudio\v10.0\ directory on the build server. Note: My dev box is 64bit and the build server 32bit. I can't figure out why this is behaving differently on the build server than on my dev machine. Anyone have any ideas? Thanks, Steve
