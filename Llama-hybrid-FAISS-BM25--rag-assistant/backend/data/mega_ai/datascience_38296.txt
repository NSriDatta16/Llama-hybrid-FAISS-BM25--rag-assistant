I think you have assumed that future timesteps also are used for learning by a simple LSTM. But, that actually is Bidirectional LSTM which learns from the past as well as future timesteps. Simple Recurrent Neural Networks don't have the access to future input information. You might want to refer to a book on recurrent neural networks. You can also look this question on cross validated for training an LSTM.
