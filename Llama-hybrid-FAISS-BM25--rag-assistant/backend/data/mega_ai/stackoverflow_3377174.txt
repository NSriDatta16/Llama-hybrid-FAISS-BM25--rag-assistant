Views are fully supported in RTM. One nice feature sneaked in very late in the product life cycle is, you can customize the key of the view from the conceptual model and it will sync it with the storage model as well. However there is still paint point with View where it needs to be mapped to an entity which must have a key. In future a view may be allowed to get mapped to a complex type. You can also use ExecuteStoreQuery for better performance.
