For Windows keys (including the Windows flag and right-click menu keys), get Betsy Flanagan and Betsy Flanagan Two, both from larabiefonts, free for website use. For Mac keys (including the Clover, Cmd, Opt, lights, and numeric keypad keys), use MacKeyCaps, but it does have copyright. Several web sites have it for download, haven't found the actual source to check for licensing. I have a page displaying the keycap fonts I've tried, with mappings and CSS to download and display the characters so the text on the keys is about the same size as text on your web page, at http://www.lernerconsult.com/keycaps.php I have how to use downloadable TrueType/OpenType fonts, with automatic font substitution through CSS if your user's browser doesn't support downloadable fonts, and how to have fonts look the same size even if the letters like x, a, c are different heights at the same point size, at my font-size-adjust page, linked from the keycaps page.
