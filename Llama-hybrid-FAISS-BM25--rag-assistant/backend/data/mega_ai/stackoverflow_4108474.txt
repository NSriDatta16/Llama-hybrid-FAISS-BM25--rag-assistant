Cocos2d sprite touch events in hi-res mode

I have a sprite class that includes touch listeners for touching and dragging. This is all working fine. But I recently added hi-res images for all my sprites and have enabled retina display support using this in the app delegate: [director setContentScaleFactor:2]; The problem I'm having now is that when scale factor is doubled, my sprite class is no longer detecting touches. I have tried to use these solutions to no avail: http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org/forum/topic/10284 In my sprite class I have a rect method: - (CGRect)rect { CGSize s = [self.texture contentSizeInPixels]; return CGRectMake(-s.width / 2, -s.height / 2, s.width, s.height); } Then in my containsTouchLocation method I have: - (BOOL)containsTouchLocation:(UITouch *)touch { return CGRectContainsPoint(self.rect, [self convertTouchToNodeSpaceAR:touch]); } When I return YES here manually everything works the way it should so it's clearly something to do with the CGRect points. Any ideas? I'm using Cocos2d 0.99.5 Thanks.
