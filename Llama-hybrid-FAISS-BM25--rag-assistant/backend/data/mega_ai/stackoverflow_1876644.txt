JSON Parsing in Silverlight 3.0

I have a bunch of little JSON object fragments of the form: { id: "wow", foo: 45.4, bar: "hello, world!" } By "a bunch" I mean about 6 GB worth. :-) (And yes, I know, this isn't technically JSON. The full story is that it originally came from YAML data, but I find that most "JSON" parsers can handle this subset of YAML just fine.) Currently, I use Netonsoft's JSON parser with the line: var obj = Newtonsoft.Json.Linq.JObject.Parse(json); This works well for me, but I am porting my WinForms app to Silverlight 3.0 (and onward to 4.0 once I get the chance). From Googling around, I see that there is some "DataContractSuperJavaScriptExSerializer2" library from Microsoft that does JSON parsing. Should I use that library, or is there something better on the horizon? I'm 30 mins away from writing my JSON parser so that I can ensure that it is efficient, but I thought I would see if there is anything else worth looking at in the Silverlight 3 world.
