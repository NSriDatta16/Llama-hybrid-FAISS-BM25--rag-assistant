For some reason my version of CURL wasn't recognizing the -s or --silent which I know makes no sense. As @Friedo suggested I tried using backticks or the qx operator which also didn't get rid of unwanted upload progress reporting. Ultimately I went the very unelegant route of adding >/dev/null 2>&1 to the end of the system call which resolved the issue.
