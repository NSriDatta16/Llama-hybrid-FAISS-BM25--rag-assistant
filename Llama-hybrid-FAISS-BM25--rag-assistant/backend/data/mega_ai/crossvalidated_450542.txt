The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is applicable whatever the dimension of $\theta$ . Finding the posterior of the joint distribution of $\theta_1$ , $\theta_2$ , $\theta_3$ , and $\theta_4$ , is equivalent to finding the posterior distribution of $\Theta$ , where $\Theta$ is a $4 \times 1$ vector with $\Theta = [\theta_1 \ \theta_2 \ \theta_3 \ \theta_4]$ . Let's apply it to the formalism of the Wikipedia article on the algorithm . Then the most recent value sampled is $x_t = [\theta_{1,t} \ \theta_{2,t} \ \theta_{3,t} \ \theta_{4,t}]$ . We next draw a new proposal state $x' = [\theta_1' \ \theta_2' \ \theta_3' \ \theta_4']$ with probability density $p(x'|x_t)$ , which is the probability of having $[\theta_1' \ \theta_2' \ \theta_3' \ \theta_4']$ (i.e. their joint probability) knowing $x_t$ . A common and practical assumption is to assume that parameters are independent, which means that $p(x'|x_t) = p(\theta_1'|\theta_{1,t})p(\theta_2'|\theta_{2,t})p(\theta_3'|\theta_{3,t})p(\theta_4'|\theta_{4,t})$ . A nice example is the following paper : Bird, A. D., Wall, M. J., & Richardson, M. J. (2016). Bayesian inference of synaptic quantal parameters from correlated vesicle release. Frontiers in computational neuroscience, 10, 116. They compute the posterior joint distribution of having six parameters using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. They even provide the JULIA and MATLAB code they used, which is available in the "Supplementary Material" section. Hope this helps !
