I agree with your observations. I've worked at several companies that had worldwide development centers, or have outsourced parts of their products overseas. Cultural differences became evident in design, function, coding standards, comments (I fondly recall inheriting a module to maintain, that was commented throughout in Russian, where all the variables looked like k1, k2, k3 etc. :)). As for the other part, larger organizations tend to hire certain type of product managers. Even if they had an innovative and independent approach before they joined, they are forced to accede to prior design/conceptions. That's why the UI and flow of some of the products developed by those companies become convoluted over time. If I had to add a corollary to Conway's law it would be that given enough time, these applications would evolve to a state that is completely unusable by the public and only understandable by the organizations that produced them.
