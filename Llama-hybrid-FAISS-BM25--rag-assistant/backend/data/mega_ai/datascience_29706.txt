Turn them to numbers, for example for each unique country assingn a unique number (like 1,2,3 and ...) also you Don't need to use One-Hot Encoding (aka dummy variables) when working with random forest, because trees don't work like other algorithm (such as linear/logistic regression) and they don't work by distant (they work with finding good split for your features) so NO NEED for One-Hot Encoding
