Personally, I don't think that's the hardest part of testing. It'd be possible to do via reflection, but that's not what makes testing worthwhile. The hard part is figuring out all the possible inputs, for "happy path" and erroneous situations, making sure that exceptions are thrown when they should be, etc. Your Java Bean should be implementing equals and hashCode. I'd worry more about tests to check the equals contract: null equals, reflexive, symmetric, transitive, and not equals. Those aren't trivial. Getters and setters are the least of your problems. When people talk about code coverage standards of 70% or better they often say that getters and setters can be left out.
