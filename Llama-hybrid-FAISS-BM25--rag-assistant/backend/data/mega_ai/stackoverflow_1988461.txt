The "Kohana Tutorial" pages are pants. Not so much for their content, but for the fact that they have a pretty damn unorganised wordpress blog and finding useful info isn't exactly made easy. What they need is a post/page at learn.kohanaphp.com that lists the most important tutorials, rather than forcing you to wade through the whole blog. Anyway, rant over, I'd start here: http://zacklive.com/hello-world-tutorial-for-kohana/15/ Then: http://learn.kohanaphp.com/2008/03/26/blog-tutorial-1/ http://learn.kohanaphp.com/2008/03/28/blog-tutorial-part-2/ Other articles of interest: http://www.ninjapenguin.co.uk/blog/2008/06/21/kohana-pagination-tutorial/ http://learn.kohanaphp.com/2008/04/25/using-auto_modeler-to-write-quicker-code/ http://www.ninjapenguin.co.uk/blog/2008/06/29/practical-kohana-hooks-example-phpids/ http://learn.kohanaphp.com/2008/04/14/5-tips-to-help-you-find-something-youre-looking-for-in-kohana/ And, of course, Google.
