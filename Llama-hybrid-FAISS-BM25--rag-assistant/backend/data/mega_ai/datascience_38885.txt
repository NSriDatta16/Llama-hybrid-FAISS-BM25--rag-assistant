The spaCy package has many language models , including ones trained on Common Crawl . Language model has a specific meaning in Natural Language Processing (NlP). A language model is a probability distribution over sequences of tokens. Given a specific sequence of tokens, the model can assign a probability of that sequence appearing. SpaCy's language models include more than just a probability distribution. The spaCy package needs to be installed and the language models need to be download: $ pip install spacy $ python -m spacy download en Then the language models can used with a couple lines of Python: >>> import spacy >>> nlp = spacy.load('en') For a given model and token, there is a smoothed log probability estimate of a token's word type can be found with: token.prob attribute.
