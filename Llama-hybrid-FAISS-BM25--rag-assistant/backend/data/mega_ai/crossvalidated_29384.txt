I always start by doing a PCA (Principal Component Analysis) in R because it takes almost no writing. Say you have all this in a data.frame that we call data . pca For R users, there is also the ggplot2 library. I know that it can do wonders for data representation, but I don't know how to use it. Maybe someone will suggest something with it?
