Why are the price of the house and size of the house poisson distributed

In the following example in Google tutorials, it says the distribution of the house price and house size is poisson. https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/clustering/similarity/generating-embeddings-example#preprocessing-data Can you please explain how/why the distributions of price, size are poisson. Shouldn't they be normal ?
