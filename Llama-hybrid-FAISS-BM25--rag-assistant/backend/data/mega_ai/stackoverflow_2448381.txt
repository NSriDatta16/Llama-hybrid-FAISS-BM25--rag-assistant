Your output shows that you're getting a TransformerConfigurationException ; according to [the API]( http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/xml/transform/TransformerFactory.html#newTransformer(javax.xml.transform.Source)) , those are "Thrown if there are errors when parsing the Source or it is not possible to create a Transformer instance." Your syntax seems okay, so I suspect that your file is causing the problem. I see that you're checking to make sure the file exists, but are you sure its contents are okay?
