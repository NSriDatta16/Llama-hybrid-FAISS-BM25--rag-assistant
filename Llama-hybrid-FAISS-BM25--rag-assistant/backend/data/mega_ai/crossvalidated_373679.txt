Typically, once you've fit an ARIMA model on training data set, you then apply to the time period coming right after that period. If the time series is not stationary (which is usually the case in most real world business problems) then your model won't work on data that too many steps into the future (see this blog for details on why that is the case ). If you purpose is to simply to learn time series models, I recommend you split the data you have from 2010/01-2016/12 into a train set of 2010-2015 and 2016 as a test set, or maybe 2010~2014 as a train set and test on 2015~2016. If you have your heart set on somehow modeling the data in 2017~2018, then you might want to try direct multistep forecasting , given the data step you have. But then you will need something other than auto.arima to pull that off.
