How to organise my web content?

What is the most common way to organise web content, i.e. HTML, JS and CSS? I'm usually doing this for small projects: index.html style.css script.js I think this is fairly standard. But how do you do it for projects with more than one HTML/JS file? My approach is: index.html foobar.html style.css js core.js foobar.js Is this a common way of doing it? Should I move CSS to a separate "css" directory even if there's only one file? How is this central CSS file usually called? "style.css" or "base.css" or something else? Is it common to move HTML files to a separate directory?
