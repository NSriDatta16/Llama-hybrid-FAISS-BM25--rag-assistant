Different algorithms categorized in reinforcement learning

For some time I am going through reinforcement learning, and have found a lot of diverse information specially in area of Policies (algorithms). I figured out that policies can be classified in On Vs Off, Model based vs Model Free, Also, these are kind of Q, DQN, SARSA etc. I am looking for a categorized table where these are all well categorized . There is a good table given in wikipedia, but I think it is incomplete (Wikipedia page url - Reinforcement learning ), as it does not list Model based algorithms and it does not list examples where one kind of algorithm is a best fit. Can someone help getting a bird's eye view of all, current known, reinforcement policies/algorithms, categorized in tabular format, and where to apply which one (and where not).
