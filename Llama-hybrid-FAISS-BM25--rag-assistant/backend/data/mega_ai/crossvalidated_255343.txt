How to avoid collinearity of categorical variables in logistic regression?

I have the following problem: I'm performing a multiple logistic regression on several variables each of which has a nominal scale. I want to avoid multicollinearity in my regression. If the variables were continuous I could compute the variance inflation factor (VIF) and look for variables with a high VIF. If the variables were ordinarily scaled I could compute Spearman's rank correlation coefficients for several pairs of variables and compare the computed value with a certain threshold. But what do I do if the variables are just nominally scaled? One idea would be to perform a pairwise chi-square test for independence, but the different variables don't all have the same co-domains. So that would be another problem. Is there a possibility for solving this problem?
