Unfortunately, there are no straight forward checks on the $a_{ij}$ 's and $b_{ij}$ 's coefficients in the BEKK case, like $\alpha+\beta ensure stationarity and weak time dependence in the GARCH(1,1) case. The conditions are a bit more convoluted in the BEKK-case. The process is stationary and weakly time dependent (in the sense that it's a geometrically ergodic Harris recurrent Markov chain), if all the eigenvalues of the $k^2 \times k^2$ matrix $A_{11} \otimes A_{11} + B_{11} \otimes B_{11}$ are less than 1 and $C^{\ast}C^{\ast\prime}$ is positive definite, but that will always be the case with $C^{\ast}C^{\ast\prime}$ , since it's positive definite by construction. The $\otimes$ denotes the Kronecker product . Theorem 2 in Comte and Lieberman (2003) says that this condition ensures that the maximum likelihood estimator is consistent, and if we further assume that the process has finite sixth order moment , that is $E \left\|X^6\right\| , then Theorem 3 in Hafner and Preminger (2009) establishes asymptotic normality of the MLE. To my knowledge the literature gives no straight forward parameter restrictions, which ensures finite sixth order moments of the BEKK-process. Theorem C.1 in the appendix of Pedersen and Rahbek (2014) provide sufficient conditions for the ARCH-version of the Gaussian BEKK-process ( $B_{11} = 0$ ), to have $E \left\|X^6\right\| . This conditions is that all eigenvalues of $A_{11} ⊗ A_{11}$ should be less than $15^{−1/3} \approx 0.4055$ . F. Comte and O. Lieberman. Asymptotic theory for multivariate GARCH processes.
