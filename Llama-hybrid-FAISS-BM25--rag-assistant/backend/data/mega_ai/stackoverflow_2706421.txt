How significant are JPA lazy loading performance benefits?

I understand that this is highly specific to the concrete application, but I'm just wondering what's the general opinion, or at least some personal experiences on the issue. I have an aversion towards the 'open session in view' pattern, so to avoid it, I'm thinking about simply fetching everything small eagerly, and using queries in the service layer to fetch larger stuff. Has anyone used this and regretted it? And is there maybe some elegant solution to lazy loading in the view layer that I'm not aware of?
