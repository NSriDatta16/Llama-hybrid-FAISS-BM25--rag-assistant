Calculate the average of hourly data of three sensors

I am trying to calculate the average of hourly data of three sensors but the hourly timestamps of all three sensors are different. How is it possible to measure the average of hourly data of all three sensors at a regular interval of hours say- 01:00,02:00,03:00 and so on. And also is it possible to start an extensible time series with a specific time which is before the first timestamp of the given dataset so that the extra timestamps have NA values and i can use na.rm=TRUE while calculating mean.: library(xts) library(forecast) data1$V1 I have 27 sensors data. so i m trying to caclulate hourly,weekly and daily average of each sensors but each sensor provides 4 critical parameters like - blood pressure, temperature, Pulse and WBC. The above loop provided is only for temperature of 27 sensors. I have a bed connected to some 3 sensors and each sensor has 4 critical parameters to measure. I m concerned only with temperature for now. I need to calculate hourly average of temp for that bed only. So, initially i measure hourly average of any 3 given sensors each and then i intend to take the hourly average between these 3 sensors. The problem i m facing here is each hourly average has different number of rows and different timestamps. How to normalise all the timestamps? If the starting timestamp of sensor 1 is 2004-02-28 00:59:16, sensor 2 is 2004-02-28 01:08:23, sensor 3 is 2004-02-28 01:19:34, it is not possible to normalise them by any methods i know of yet. Please help me find the hourly average of three sensors.
