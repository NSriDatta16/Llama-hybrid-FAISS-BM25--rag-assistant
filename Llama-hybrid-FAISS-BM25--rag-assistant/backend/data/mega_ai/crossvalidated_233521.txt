BoxCox transformation suggest natural logarithm transformation. Can log10 transformation be used instead?

I run a Box-Cox transformation for a linear model to find an appropriate transformation for a response variable, which is a number of insect per sq.meter. I need to transform the response variable because of a pattern in the residual plot obtained after running the linear regression using none-transformed response variable. I used a boxcox() function from the ‘MASS’ package in R. Box-Cox suggested the best lambda value of 0.055 for transformation, which is close to 0 and corresponds to natural log transformation (Osborne 2010). My question is may I use log10 transformation instead of natural log transformation? log10 transformation is the most common transformation my field. Are there any references, to back up this decision? Just to mention, I can’t use Poisson regression because I work with averaged values of insects per sq.m, it is complications of using different sampling equipment. Thanks
