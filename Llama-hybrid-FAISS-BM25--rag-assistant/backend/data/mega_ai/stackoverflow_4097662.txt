Video itself is never "FLASH" (unless you are talking about SWF encoding ). What's flash is the player you use for streaming. If the tag embedding the video contains a type attribute like application/x-shockwave-flash or similar, then it's a flash player, or the filename is something ending in SWF (it means video encoded in SWF format), then is a video for playing on a flash player.
