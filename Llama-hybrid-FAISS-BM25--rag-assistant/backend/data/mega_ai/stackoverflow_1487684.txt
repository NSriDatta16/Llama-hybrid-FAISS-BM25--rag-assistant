Tell tale sign of memory fragmentation (as opposed to a memory leak)?

First I realize that leaks can fragment memory badly, but please bear with me. Using WinDbg and attaching to a process: Using !heap (or another WinDbg command), what should I expect see if I'm dealing with memory fragmentation as opposed to a leak? For instance, I can use "!heap stat" and "!heap stat -h handle" to zero-in on the code generating a leak; but is there something in these same return values which would hint at fragmentation? Has memory allocation changed radically between XP and Vista? Particularly, as related to DLL and other library-loading? We've been developing exclusively on XP so I'm unfamiliar with Vista, but it turns out that certain memory issues we've been seeing on XP disappear when we install the same binaries on Vista. Thanks!
