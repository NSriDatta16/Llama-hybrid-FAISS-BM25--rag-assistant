cvs checkout time series

We have a cvs archive, and I can get any version of any file I want. However, is there any way to just get the code as of a certain date and time? I don't see any options to request that. I'd like the ability to walk through a cvs archive day by day and do metrics automatically, perhaps a visualization of what happened to the code over time.
