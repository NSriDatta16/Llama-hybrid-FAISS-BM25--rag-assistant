Date Table/Dimension Querying and Indexes

I'm creating a robust date table want to know the best way to link to it. The Primary Key Clustered Index will be on the smart date integer key (per Kimball spec) with a name of DateID. Until now I have been running queries against it like so: select Foo.orderdate -- a bunch of fields from Foo ,DTE.FiscalYearName ,DTE.FiscalPeriod ,DTE.FiscalYearPeriod ,DTE.FiscalYearWeekName ,DTE.FiscalWeekName FROM SomeTable Foo INNER JOIN DateDatabase.dbo.MyDateTable DTE ON DTE.date = CAST(FLOOR(CAST(Foo.forderdate AS FLOAT)) AS DATETIME) Keep in mind that Date is a nonclustered index field with values such as: 2000-01-01 00:00:00.000 It just occured to me that since I have a clustered integer index (DATEID) that perhaps I should be converting the datetime in my database field to match it and linking based upon that field. What do you folks think? Also, depending on your first answer, if I am typically pulling those fields from the date table, what kind of index how can I optimize the retrieval of those fields? Covering index?
