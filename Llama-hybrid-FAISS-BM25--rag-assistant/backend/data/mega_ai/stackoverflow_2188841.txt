TTNavigator not opening URLs when clicking on links in TTStyledTextLabels

Trying to make a simple link clicking activity work. I think I understand TTNavigator and TTStyledLabel, but can't get it to work. Code: @interface SomeVc : UIViewController { IBOutlet TTStyledTextLabel *styledTextLabel; } @end @implementation SomeVc - (void)viewDidLoad { [super viewDidLoad]; navigator = [TTNavigator navigator]; navigator.persistenceMode = TTNavigatorPersistenceModeNone; navigator.delegate = self; TTURLMap* map = navigator.URLMap; [map from:@"*" toViewController:[TTWebController class]]; styledTextLabel.text = [TTStyledText textWithURLs:someText]; [navigator openURLAction:[TTURLAction actionWithURLPath:@"http://www.cnn.com/"]]; } - (BOOL)navigator: (TTNavigator*)navigator shouldOpenURL: (NSURL*)URL { NSLog(@"trying to open %@", [URL absoluteString]); return NO; } @end I.e inside a viewcontroller, get the navigator and set self to be its delegate. When a link is opened, the shouldOpenURL delgate method gets called, where I will handle the URL opening myself. (I plan to let navigator handle more of it, but want to get this simple case working first.) I have a test call at the end of viewDidLoad: which fires the delegate method fine. Problem: I see the styledTextLabels rendered fine with URL-s, but when I tap on those, nothing happens. They don't reach the TTNavigator for some reason and I can't understand why. Feels like I'm missing some simple connection/scaffolding somewhere, but can't figure it out. How to make it so that the links tapped in the styledtextlabel will reach the navigator delegate? Or how else should I implement this simple case with styledtextlabel? (just want to get callbacks for url taps.)
