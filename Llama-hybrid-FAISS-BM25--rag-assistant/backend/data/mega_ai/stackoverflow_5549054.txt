I`v asked the same question: Sync list with outlook only with items in current view. . In this case it was possible to use stssync protocol to do whatever you want. It takes much effort (luckily someone already wrote an implementation ) But there was another solution i ended up using - implementing a wrapper for Lists.asmx webservice and rewriting outlook requests (by using custom Global.asax file) to use this new webservice instead of Lists.asmx, that only queries specific view in a list. if (ctx.Request.UserAgent.Contains("Microsoft Office Outlook") && path.ToLower().IndexOf("_vti_bin/lists.asmx") >= 0) { ctx.RewritePath("/_layouts/OutlookLists.asmx"); } I'm not sure you would want a solution like this. If you do, you may ask and i may publish the solution source for the webservice, however i'm not using this webservice myself anymore. And you could use it as a draft, not a production ready code. The source has been published on CodePlex . Regarding to the script problem I don't know why list id isn't being replaced by view id. I tried to run the function within script console (F12 for IE8/9) >> var menuItems = document.getElementsByTagName('ie:menuitem'); for (var i = 0; i As you can see, the function argument (third one) has been replaced with a view id instead of list id. Don't forget to remove console.log statements before deploying, because if IE doesn't have web developer tools, javascript will crash there.
