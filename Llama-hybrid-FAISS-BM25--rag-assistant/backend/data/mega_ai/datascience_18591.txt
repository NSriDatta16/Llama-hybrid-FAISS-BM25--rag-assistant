My two cents If your intention is training a different model for each individual, then you should consider using more than just average for between model comparison. Imagine one model performance is great(low RMSE) for 70% of individuals and performs poorly for the other 30% and the second model has mediocre performance across all individuals. Both models could have the same average but in reality would behave quite differently. Moreover, you should consider using some sort of statistical measure for the RMSE of each individual model(say a confidence interval of the RMSE). Maybe one model is more volatile than the other.
