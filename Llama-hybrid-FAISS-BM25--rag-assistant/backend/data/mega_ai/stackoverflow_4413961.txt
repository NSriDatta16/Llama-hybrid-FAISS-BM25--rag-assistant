This is an interesting use case; I haven't heard of using Magento for room reservations before. If you want to avoid creating the options and populating them manually, you could create your own Model class for retrieving room occupancy and a Block to display it on the page. How are you handling blocking out the room times? If you can skip adding it to product options entirely, you'd be at an advantage for freedom in your implementation. Hope that helps! Thanks, Joe
