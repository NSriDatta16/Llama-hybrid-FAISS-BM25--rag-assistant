FullCalendar - Default Event Duration

I'd like to be able to change the default duration of any newly created events. I'm in dayView and if I simply click (not drag&drop) on the calendar, I get a half hour session. I'd like to set it to one hour by default. Maybe with this kind of code: , select: function (startDate, endDate, allDay, jsEvent, view) { endDate = new Date(startDate); endDate.setHours(endDate.getHours() + 1); } This is effectively setting the good endDate but not visualy updated Edit I'm trying to make the behavior similar to Google Calendar: If the user clicks it will select a 1h event, but the user can still select half hours.
