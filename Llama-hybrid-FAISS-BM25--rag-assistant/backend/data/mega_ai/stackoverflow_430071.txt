Doing Forms With Just Windows SharePoint Services 3.0?

For the most part my organization is happy with WSS 3.0 (no upgrading to MOSS) with one exception, there is really just one form we'd like to put up somehow. It's fairly big form (basically change requests for IT services, on paper it's easily 2 full 8.5 by 11 pages). We thought about Custom ASP.NET coding as a separate stand-alone page or maybe as a web part. What have other people out there done? MOSS and Infopath is not really an option as it really is too expensive for us at this time. Thanks in advance!
