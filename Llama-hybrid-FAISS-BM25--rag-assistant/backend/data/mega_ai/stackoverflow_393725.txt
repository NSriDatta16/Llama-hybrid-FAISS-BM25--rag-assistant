How to add CMS to an existing website

I have an existing ASP.NET website which I would like to painlessly add CMS functionality to. The site is a estate agent's property website and is backed by a database etc. however some pages like 'About Us' etc. I would like the user to be able to edit using a simple CMS. I would also like the user to be be able to create new pages and put them into the navigation system. The site is multi-language and the database part uses resource files to store the strings it uses. The site uses ASP.NET Master pages and Themes, I would like the CMS to use these to add new pages and to support multi-language. Now I could clearly code my own simple CMS but not wanting to reinvent the wheel is there any existing ASP.NET CMS that can be added to existing site and take advantage of the Master Pages model that I already have. EDIT: I have looked at DNN, Umbraco, My Web Pages Starter Kit, Graffti CMS, Sitefinity.net but as far as I can tell these can't be easily retro fitted. I also want to avoid (if possible) writing my own system using the FCK editor. Thanks in advance.
