which one is faster 5+5+5+5+5 or 5*5?

I don't know how to ask but just want to ask. help me to tag it please. Anyway, my friend asked me a question that which one is faster in Java int a = 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 or int b = 5 * 5 ? Is it language dependent ? I mean, a is faster than b in java but not in C my answer is a is faster than b because of comparison of addition/multiplication in computer organization
