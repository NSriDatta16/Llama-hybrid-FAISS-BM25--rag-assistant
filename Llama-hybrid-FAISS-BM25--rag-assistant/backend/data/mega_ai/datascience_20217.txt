Which algorithm is used in sklearn SGDClassifier when modified huber loss is used?

The documentation says: The loss function to be used. Defaults to ‘hinge’, which gives a linear SVM. The ‘log’ loss gives logistic regression, a probabilistic classifier. ‘modified_huber’ is another smooth loss that brings tolerance to outliers as well as probability estimates. When we use 'modified_huber' loss function, which classification algorithm is used? Is it SVM? If yes, how come it is able to give probability estimates, which is something it can't do with hinge loss?
