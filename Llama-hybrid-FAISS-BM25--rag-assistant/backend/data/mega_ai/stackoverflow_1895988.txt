There is no reason why the cURL method you tried wont work with the correct headers. playing around scraping sites like digg.com i found i needed a valid USER AGENT header and of course an appropriate REFERER URL, keep going with the curl technique if that will work best for you overall. use an http header add-on to firefox to see what headers you are sending to gmail and then fake them completely.
