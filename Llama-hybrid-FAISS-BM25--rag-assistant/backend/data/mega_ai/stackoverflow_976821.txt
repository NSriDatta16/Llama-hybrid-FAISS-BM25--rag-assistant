Iterating through a large table with performance in mind

If I need to check an entire table to see if a condition is true (e.g. every Ticket column has an ID with a certain suffix). What would be a good way of going about this, performance wise? The table is quite large so if I go through every row, that's a lot of time hitting the database. Cursors are slow, so that wouldn't really be an elegant solution Also, for the future, you can always validate your parameters, but this is not the case in the past with this scenario.
