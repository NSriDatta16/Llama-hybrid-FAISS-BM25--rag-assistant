Within panel estimator - how to perform standard error adjustment?

I am fitting a within panel model via glm in R and I am trying to understand standard error adjustment as in plm package (to account for loss of degrees of freedom via demeaning): Consider the following within model fitted via glm: library(plm) data("Produc", package = "plm") df_train_within % group_by(state) %>% mutate(gsp = gsp - mean(gsp),pcap = pcap - mean(pcap)) fit.glm Output glm model: summary(fit.glm)$coefficients[2,1:2] Estimate Std. Error 2.8493965 0.1189785 Now consider the output from the model fitted via plm: fit.plm As can be seen, the coefficient estimates are the same for glm and plm, but the standard error is too low for glm. According to Cameron/Trivedi we need to inflate the residual variance by factor 1/[N(T-1)-K]*[N*T-K] . Performing this adjustment for the glm standard error using N=48, T=17, K=1 I was not able to re-produce the standard error reported in the plm package. Can anyone help me in explaining how the adjustment is performed in the plm-package? I wasn't able to find the relevant piece of source code which could also be very helpful
