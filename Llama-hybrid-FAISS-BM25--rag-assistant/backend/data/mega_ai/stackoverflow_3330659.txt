I'm not familiar with Zend, so this may be off in left field. Looking at that line, and which properties are accessed, it looks likely that $this->_auth->getStorage()->read() is not returning the object you want, thus the usr_role property can't be accessed. To test, maybe var_dump that bit just before line 169 and see what happens... Could it be that the getStorage or read implementation uses a storage mechanism that requires specific configuration? Maybe sessions, memcached, or file permissions?
