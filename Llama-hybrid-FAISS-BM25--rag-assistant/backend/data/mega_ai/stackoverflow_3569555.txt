Because we offer quality merchandise, caring, conscientious, sales and service, we have been able to make our customers our good friends. Our 26,000 sq. ft. facility includes a complete parts and accessories department, full service department (Merc. Premier dealer with 2 full time Mercruiser Master Tech's), and new, used, and brokerage sales. Edit: Here is an alternate solution based on Steven D. Majewski's xpath which addresses the OP's comment that the number of tags separating 'Additional Info' from the blurb can be unknown: import lxml.html as lh import urllib2 url='http://bit.ly/bf1T12' doc=lh.parse(urllib2.urlopen(url)) blurb=doc.xpath('//td[child::*[text()="Additional Info"]]/following-sibling::td/text()') blurb=[text for text in blurb if text != u'\xa0'] print('\n'.join(blurb))
