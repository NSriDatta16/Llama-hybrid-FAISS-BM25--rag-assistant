How to compare seasonality between time series?

I have data like this: Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec x 0.03 -0.07 -0.62 0.26 0.47 0.01 0.54 0.41 -0.38 0.50 -0.84 -0.30 nx 0.23 0.45 1.12 0.45 0.53 0.95 0.56 -0.79 -1.68 -0.12 -0.68 -1 This is the result of the decompose(tes$seasonal) in R. Its a table of time series that I filtered by a variable, people with x, or people without x. I had a dataframe with a time variable, I created a time series filtering how many observations have that characteristic, and I put them this way. Then i noticed that people that use x, need less tests some months that people who doesn't use x. For example in March, for x is negative, and for nx is positive... The thing is, I want to prove if there is diference in the time distribution between using x or not. So i thought that maybe as this is categorical(?) data, I can use Chi-squared, but I have no clue and I've met a dead end. So maybe this has another name that I'm missing and I can learn, any tips?
