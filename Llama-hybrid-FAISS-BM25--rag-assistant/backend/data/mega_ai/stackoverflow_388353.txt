Validating Kana Input

I am working on an application that allows users to input Japanese language characters. I am trying to come up with a way to determine whether the user's input is a Japanese kana (hiragana, katakana, or kanji). There are certain fields in the application where entering Latin text would be inappropriate and I need a way to limit certain fields to kanji-only, or katakana-only, etc. The project uses UTF-8 encoding. I don't expect to accept JIS or Shift-JIS input. Ideas?
