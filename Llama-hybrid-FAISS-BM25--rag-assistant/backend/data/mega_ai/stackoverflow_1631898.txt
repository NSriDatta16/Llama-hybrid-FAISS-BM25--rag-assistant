You said @Coincoin that can not pack. If you just need size for some reason, here is dirty solution #define STRUCT_ELEMENTS char cmember;/* padding bytes */ int imember; typedef struct { STRUCT_ELEMENTS }paddedData; #pragma pack(push) #pragma pack(1) typedef struct { STRUCT_ELEMENTS }packedData; #pragma pop now you have size of both; sizeof(packedData); sizeof(paddedData); Only reason that I can think of why you can not pack is linking this to other program. In that case you will need to pack your structure and then unpeck when working whit external program.
