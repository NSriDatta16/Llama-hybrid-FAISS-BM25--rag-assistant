With regression you need to think about actual causality. It could be that there is just a very high correlation between sex and the new variable. And, it might just be random that that variable fits a bit better and 'takes away' from sex as explanatory - even though it is not 'real'. Suppose, for instance, that hair length is your new variable. On average women probably have longer hair than men. But suppose you are trying to determine hearing loss rates. Women may, indeed, be more susceptible to hearing loss with age (I don't know, but let's suppose so), but you might pick up in hair length a lot of rock musicians who are men (depending on where you got your data) who have hearing loss from years of exposure to loud sounds. That doesn't say anyhting about the link to sex. It says everything about your sample.
