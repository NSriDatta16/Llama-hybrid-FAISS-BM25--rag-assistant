An individual tree in a random forest is just a decision tree trained on a random subset of the full feature space. Therefore, trees are not independent of one another, as they depend on the same set of data. Bootstrap Aggregation (i.e bagging), is a technique in which the same model is trained independently on bootstrapped samples of the full dataset. See Are observations independent in bootstrapped resamples? for a discussion of whether bootstrapped observations are independent. The TL;DR is that samples are independent with respect to the observed dataspace, but not the full dataspace. So, single models are not independent in either technique as they depend on the full dataset.
