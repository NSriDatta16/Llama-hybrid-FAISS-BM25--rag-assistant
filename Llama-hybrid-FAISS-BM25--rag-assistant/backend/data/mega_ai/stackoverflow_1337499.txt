If you just want XPath queries then I just wrote a script yesterday that uses XML::XPath::XMLParser to do XPath queries on an xml file. I have tested it with both Activestate's perl installation and with strawberry perl on windows. I don't remember having to go to cpan to install any modules( though I may have earlier and forgot doing so:)), so perhaps you can use the XML::XPath module instead? Here is the sample from the documentation use XML::XPath; use XML::XPath::XMLParser; my $xp = XML::XPath->new(filename => 'test.xhtml'); my $nodeset = $xp->find('/html/body/p'); # find all paragraphs foreach my $node ($nodeset->get_nodelist) { print "FOUND\n\n", XML::XPath::XMLParser::as_string($node), "\n\n"; }
