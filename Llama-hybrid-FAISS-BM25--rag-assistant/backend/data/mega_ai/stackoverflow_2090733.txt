The UI Is Unresponsive When Loading Large Document in UI Thread, Even with BackgroundWorker Implemented

I asked a similar question here ; thanks to everyone who provided suggestion! However, it seems that my problem is bigger than the one described above, so I am posting a new question. The issue is that I need to keep my UI responsive when I am loading a large document using a third party control called document . The document is a class embedded in a third party control, there is no way for me to new it, and it doesn't have Invoke function. I am trying to use Backgroundworker for this. The code I try is of this form: public class MyForm: Form { private delegate bool OpenFile(string filePath); private void backgroundWorker1_DoWork(object sender, DoWorkEventArgs e) { OpenFile oF = new OpenFile(document.Open); var openFile = this.Invoke(oF, MyFileName); e.Result = openFile; } } Now, in the UI thread, where document belongs, when it is doing the Open operation, a dialog box is supposed to come up and updating itself and the main thread is supposed to remain responsive ( i.e., I can still drag and drop the form anyway I like). This is what I was trying to accomplish. The problem is that the above code will make both of my threads ( the main UI thread and the dialog box thread) hang during the time of loading. My question is,is there anyway to fix this issue? P/S: I have tried var openFile = Invoke(oF, MyFileName) and var openFile = BeginInvoke(oF, MyFileName) and var openFile = OtherControl.Invoke(oF, MyFileName) , all didn't help.
