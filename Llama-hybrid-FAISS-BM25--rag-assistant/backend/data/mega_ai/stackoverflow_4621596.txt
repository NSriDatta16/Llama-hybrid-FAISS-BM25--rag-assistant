I guess you are asking the wrong question. I mean, may be you are not seeing the difference between the if/while/for group and the repeat/try group. The first group needs something (condition or arguments) to BEGIN something. The second, instead, implies to BEGIN something. Just read the words: repeat (the following) and try (the following). Pascal is clean, simple and elegant because it's designed for regular human readers, Professor Wirth had in mind people learning programming when he designed it.
