Android application icon not showing up

I've just spent numerous hours constructing an icon for an Android app I'm working on, but can't get it to show up for the app in the emulator. I've put it in res/drawable-hdpi, res/drawable-mdpi, res/drawable-ldpi in the respective sizes as defined in http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/ui_guidelines/icon_design_launcher.html The manifest contains the line: Any ideas as to why it isn't showing up?
