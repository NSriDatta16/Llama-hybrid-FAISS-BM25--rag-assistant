I wouldn't call myself a javascript expert, but this is what I would try. When I get stuck, and don't know if or when my methods are being called , I fall back to using the trusty old "alert('in method 1');" technique to debug my code. $(document).ready(function(){ alert("In document.ready()"); $("#loginPass").blur(function(e) { alert("In loginPass.blur() with keycode = " + e.keyCode); }); $("#loginPass").keydown(function(e) { alert("In loginPass.keydown() with keycode = " + e.keyCode); }); }); It certainly isn't an elegant technique, but is often revealing. If you find none of your methods are getting called, I guess make sure your text box id correctly matches "loginPass".
