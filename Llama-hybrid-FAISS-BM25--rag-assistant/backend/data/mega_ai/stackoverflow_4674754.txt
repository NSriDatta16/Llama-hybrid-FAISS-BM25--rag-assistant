Spring is the par exellance example of what the cool kids don't like about Java. Many, many configuration files that make every aspect of the app customisable but is difficult to keep in your head where stuff belongs. If you are not a huge company this is almost certainly not what you need. I would encourage you to look into the Play or Wicket framworks if you want to keep using Java. Both are conceptually simpler, don't throw in the kitchen sink and are heavily geared towards web sites. Spring MVC is just a part of the very large Spring ecosystem.
