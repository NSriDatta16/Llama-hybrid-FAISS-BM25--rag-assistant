(removed original part of the post here, since it is not the solution) Then the only solution I can see is to perform the loop that you have now the number of times that you have digits. So, first you calculate all digits till you get to the last, and then print it. Then you take the original value + base and start dividing again till you come to the second "highest value" digit, then print it. It is a double loop and you calculate everything twice, but you don't use extra storage.
