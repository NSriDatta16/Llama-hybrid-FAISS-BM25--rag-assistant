Decision Trees cannot deal with strings. To be able to learn from your log lines, you need to represent what is happening at the logs. You can use both categorical features and numerical features. This process is called feature engineering, which is part of preprocessing. I don't know what the number after yoru header represents but this could very well be a feature if it influences if it counts as 'Normal' or 'Abnormal'. I would extract a categorical feature for the type of request, like GET and POST. You could add a granular level that tries to represent what document the client requests. Just feeding strings to Machine Learning algorithms will not work (un)fortunately.
