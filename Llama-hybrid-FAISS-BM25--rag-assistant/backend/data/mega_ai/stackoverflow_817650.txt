Serialize MVC ViewDataDictionary

I'm using SQL state server for session variables. I'm also storing ViewData in TempData so I can access the ModelState across a redirect. The problem is that the ViewDataDictionary is not serializable. Is there a way to hook into the session storage logic to serialize the ViewDataDictionary when the Session variable is stored? Thanks.
