Detecting passwords in code repos

I'm a newbie to ML trying to understand if its feasible to train a network to detect inadvertent inclusion of passwords in code repositories. One way to do this is to tokenize the code within a repo and then use heuristics for an "entropy estimate" for each token through a Shannon entropy variant known as "N-gram entropy" Is it feasible to do this with a deep network or a linear model (and which would be better) where the input would be a token or tuples of tokens and output for the classifier would be a binary "yes" or "no" (for the tuple containing / not containing a password) How large the training set would need to be? Can someone give me some pointers on how to model this or some code that could serve as a starting point? For example I started looking at the tensorflow examples related to language processing eg. word embeddings, noise contrastive training could any of this be relevant? ML Newbie
