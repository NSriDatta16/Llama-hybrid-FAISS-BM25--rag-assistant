Imputation: which method is this

I'm working on a paper on machine learning. Suppose I have three classes (A, B, C). Suppose now I have a model that outputs Y = [A, ?, ? , A, ?, ?, B, ?, ?, C, ?, ?, A] The question marks indicate missing values. These missing values always come in pairs of two with always a classification before and after each pair. I now want to impute it such that it becomes Y = [A, A, A , A, A, B, B, B, C, C, C, A, A] the missing value becomes the left value if that isn't a question mark or becomes the right value if that isn't a question mark. I'm now simply wondering wht this specific method is called. I found this link describing seven ways of imputation but what I did did not seem seem to be among them. Closest imputation method I believe was cold deck, but I'm not certain. I simply need the official technique/name for a paper. EDIT: The order of the elements in Y is of utmost importance! They are not random! It's about classifying time-series where classes often follow up each other a long time and only sometimes switch
