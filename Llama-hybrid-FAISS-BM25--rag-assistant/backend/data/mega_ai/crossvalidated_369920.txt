Does Alphabet Case Matters while Training Stanford Open NLP NER classifier?

I'm working with Named Entity Recognition for non-English. I've some raw text file (all small letter) and trying to make NER classifier. I'm not sure If it'll be better using Small Capital mixed text for training. Any Idea guys?
