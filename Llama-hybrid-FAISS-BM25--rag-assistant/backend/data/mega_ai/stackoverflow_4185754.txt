How to Serialise Images from Remote URL to IsolateStorage or to XML?

I need to download images from a remote URL and serialise them to Isolated Storage, but am having trouble with figuring out how to get this to work, I'm currently serialising the URIs to the Images - and can get this to work, but want to download the image and store it in the file system, what is the best way to do this using C# and Silverlight. I've tried finding some ways to do this, but they are too complicated, if possible I can store Image Data in the XML if this is a solution, but I just want to download the file - .NET on the desktop has many methods to do this sort of thing, but I need a Silverlight Solution. If there are any examples that demonstrate this sort of thing, then this may help too - it seems like a straightforward issue but I cannot resolve it and have tried many things to make this work simply, so that I can save an Image from a remote URL to IsolatedStorage and do this Asynchronously. I do have some code that does this at the moment but I can't seem to streamline it, will post it if no suitable alternatives are posted if needed.
