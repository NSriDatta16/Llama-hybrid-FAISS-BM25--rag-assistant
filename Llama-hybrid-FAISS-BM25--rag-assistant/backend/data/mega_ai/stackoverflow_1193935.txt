I swing backwards and forwards hugely with NetAdvantage. The controls are good but over complicated - huge learning curve on a new control. They are also not very efficient and tend to generate large amounts of viewstate data and HTML; much more so than I feel is necessary. Their control set has evolved over the years and to be honest, I'd prefer them to start again - even though it would force me to rebuild big parts of my webapps. Their quality control though is awful. Every new release is greeted more with fear than joy introducing new bugs as fast as old ones are fixed. For example, they've left a "debugging" statement in the JavaScript files. I suspect their support has recently been outsourced and their standard response is "Please produce a standalone project to demonstrate the bug" which is tedious to say the least. It took three months waiting for a fix recently. I find myself raising far more support calls with Infragistics than all other companies put together. Linked in with this, their documentation never seems to work for me. Maybe I'm not trying hard enough. But despite all of the negatives, the controls are feature rich and can save time in rolling your own. How much time? Not so sure about that anymore.
