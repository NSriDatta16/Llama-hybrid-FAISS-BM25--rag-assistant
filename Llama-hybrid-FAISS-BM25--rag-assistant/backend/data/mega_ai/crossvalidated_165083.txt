Vehicle license plate recognition using Convolutional Neural Network trained with mnist data

I would like to construct a license plate recognition system using convolutional neural network (CNN). But I do not have appropriate dataset to train from. If I train my CNN on the MNIST handwritten digits data set and use them for car registration plate recognition, would it work in theory? Thank you.
