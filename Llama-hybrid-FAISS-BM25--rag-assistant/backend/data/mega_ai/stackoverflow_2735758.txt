Sounds like a good use for a parent-child relationship in a dimension? Like the standard Employee dimension, where each employee is 'beneath' their boss in the hierarchy. A quick example is here: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms174846.aspx In this dimension table, the ParentOrganizationKey column has a foreign key relationship with the OrganizationKey primary key column. In other words, each record in this table can be related through a parent-child relationship with another record in the table. This kind of self-join is generally used to represent organization entity data, such as the management structure of employees in a department.
