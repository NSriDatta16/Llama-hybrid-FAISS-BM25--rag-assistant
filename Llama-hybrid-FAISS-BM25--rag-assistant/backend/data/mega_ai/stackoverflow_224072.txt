Is the Open Source Jalopy Eclipse plugin compatible with Ganymede?

After much searching, I found the download for the eclipse version of jalopy . Is this compatible with Eclipse 3.4? It's dated 2006. I've copied the extracted folder to my plugins directory and run eclipse -clean , but I can't find anything matching 'jalopy' in preferences. If it's not compatible, are there any (free) alternatives?
