Silverlight doesn't allow direct access to the file system. However you can take advantage of Isolated Storage to read and write files on the client side. Here is a tutorial for that. If you need access to a folder in the web application that is hosting your Silverlight app, use your service. Once you are in your OperationContract method, or even if you leverage the WebClient to make an AJAX style request, you can access the file system on the server but remember that is a different machine than your Silverilght client with the exception of when you do development (or browse your app on the server).
