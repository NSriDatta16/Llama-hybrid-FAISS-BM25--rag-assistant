Yes! The more resources out there for helping with embedded software (microcontroller programming) the better. It can be quite daunting to start with, especially if you've only written software for PCs or similar in the past. There are lot more constraints (e.g. on RAM and code space), and a whole load of things you need to know that don't apply to non-embedded software. As others have mentioned here, there a number of websites that cover different aspects of this; some others are OnARM , for ARM processors, the related STM32 Circle , and Jack Ganssle's articles on his website and on Embedded.com . Though embedded systems are an enormous market (just think how many such devices there are in your house, or in your car), my impression is that there is a lot less coverage of the subject on the web - and on Stack Overflow - than for non-embedded. So, I look forward to seeing the fruits of your labour!
