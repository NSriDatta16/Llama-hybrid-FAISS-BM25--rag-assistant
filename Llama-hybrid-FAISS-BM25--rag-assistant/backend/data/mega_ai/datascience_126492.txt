I found the solution to the problem. The VGG was not made to detect and localize multiple objects at once. We can do some workaround to make it work like I described earlier, but it's just too complicated and very computationally expensive. So I decided to move on and use R-CNN and YOLO for multiple object detection and localization. This models are designed for this. I hope this helps anyone who has the same problem as me.
