Real world time series

I am not used to time series forecasting, so I feel sorry that my question might be stupid. Now i'm dealing with real world time series data, which is very short. I want to know what method I should try that i can successfully predict this dataset. First I'll explain about my dataset. High value(about 10^8~10^9) and high variance. Univariate Data length : 60 Do not have seasonality and trend. Below is seasonal decompose, acf and pcaf after I logged my dataset. I tried some stat methods such as ARIMA, ETS, but the result was poor. I also tried on LSTM, but it had poor result. Also I think it's not an good method due to lack of dataset and it's univariate. In my case, what method I should use?
