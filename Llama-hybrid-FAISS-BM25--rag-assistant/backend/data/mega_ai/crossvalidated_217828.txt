As per the comment by @Roland, there is no requirement for the response variable itself to be normally distributed in a linear mixed model (LMM). It is the distribution of the response, conditional on the random effects, that is assumed to be normally distributed. This means that the residuals should be normally distributed. Therefore, you can proceed with fitting an LMM and then check the residuals to see if they are normally distributed. Treating likert item responses as continuous data is a contentious topic - for example see here: Parametric tests and Likert Scales (Ordinal data) - Two different views This simulation study plays down the concerns. Clearly, with fewer levels in the likert scale there is going to be more of a problem. This presentation from one of the authors of the lme4 package for R seems to suggest that 10 or more levels is OK. So with a 7 point scale, there is a good chance that the residuals will not be normally distributed, in which case you can look at fitting a generalised linear mixed model for ordinal data - two such packages which fit these models in R are ordinal and MCMCglmm
