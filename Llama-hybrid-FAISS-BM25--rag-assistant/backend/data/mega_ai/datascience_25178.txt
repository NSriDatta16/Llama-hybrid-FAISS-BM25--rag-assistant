I think the easiest way would be to cluster them with wordvectors. The "20 Newspaper" dataset would be a good test for the algorithm http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups/ On the Sklearn Website, you will find some easy example for using wordvectors and classification: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/twenty_newsgroups.html If you go deeper into this space you could start using LSTM networks and neural networks, but this is a little bit harder to develop. So first, try to use the problem statistically. If you want to analyze the text semantically you will need LSTM. I hope I could help you.
