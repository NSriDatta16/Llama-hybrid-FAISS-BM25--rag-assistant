XSLT Select all nodes containing a specific substring

I'm trying to write an XPath that will select certain nodes that contain a specific word. In this case the word is, "Lockwood". The correct answer is 3. Both of these paths give me 3. count(//*[contains(./*,'Lockwood')]) count(BusinessLetter/*[contains(../*,'Lockwood')]) But when I try to output the text of each specific node //*[contains(./*,'Lockwood')][1] //*[contains(./*,'Lockwood')][2] //*[contains(./*,'Lockwood')][3] Node 1 ends up containing all the text and nodes 2 and 3 are blank. Can some one please tell me what's happening or what I'm doing wrong. Thanks.
