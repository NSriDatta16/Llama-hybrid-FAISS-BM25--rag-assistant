If a header file contains definition like int i; than, being included several times without a guard, will produce a compilation error. ifndef checks that some preprocessor variable is not defined (and it is not, for a first time), then defines it explicitly to avoid being captured again. In MSVC you can also use #pragma once instead of ifndef 's.
