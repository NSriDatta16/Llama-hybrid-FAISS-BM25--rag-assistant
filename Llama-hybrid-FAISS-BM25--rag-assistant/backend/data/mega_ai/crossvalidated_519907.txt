Confusion about epochs in validation/test

This is specific to neural networks. I see a lot of posts with epoch vs loss graphs for validation sets. I am a bit confused about that. For the validation set, shouldn't there be only one epoch? Because all weights and biases have been calculated during the testing phase. And there won't be any backward propagation, just one forward pass to test how well the model does on the validation set.
