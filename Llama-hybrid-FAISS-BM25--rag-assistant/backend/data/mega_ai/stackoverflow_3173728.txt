Though I have been using Grails a lot lately, I hesitate to recommend in this case. If you want to read more about what the Grails framework offers 'out-of-the-box', beyond RESTful URL mappings and core REST features, see refguide . Sounds as though you have the web tier and components solidified and are just looking for Java (or Groovy-) based service and DAO components, to be made available to the client with a REST api. In that case, rather than to recommend Grails, you might just encourage your server side developer(s) to install a lightweight framework in front of their POJO classes. Candidates for this I like are REST-lets and DWR direct web remoting. . .of course there are others but the concerns such as security and maturity, ease of use, etc. these are tops. DWR is a Java library that enables Java on the server and JavaScript in a browser to interact and call each other as simply as possible.
