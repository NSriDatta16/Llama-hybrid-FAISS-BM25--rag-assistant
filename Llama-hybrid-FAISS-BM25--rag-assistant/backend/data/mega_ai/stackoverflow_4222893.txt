You should use @ManyToOne(fetch=FetchType.LAZY) for Hibernate lazy loading (FetchType.LAZY) so that the entire Organization object will not be loaded. If you are only accessing user.org.id hibernate will know not to join the whole table just to find the organization_id. See http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/annotations/3.5/reference/en/html_single/#entity-hibspec-singleassoc-fetching And yes you can just map Integer orgId if that's really the only field you will be using in your code.
