Bayesian MAP Estimates

Suppose you have a simple linear regression problem (y = bo + b1x) and you decide to use Bayesian Estimation to estimate the value pf bo and b1. Using Bayesian Estimation, you obtain a list of different acceptable values for bo and b1. For instance, for b1 : you could make a histogram out of all these values. But from here, how do you identify the "best" value of b1 from the histogram? Do you have to use Kernel Density Estimation and fit a continuous function over the histogram, and then take the mode of this continuous function (I am not sure how to do this)? In the following link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_a_posteriori_estimation The general formula for the MAP estimate of a parameter "thetha" is : Thetha-map = argmax (likelihood * prior). I am a bit confused. I thought the goal of Bayesian Estimation would be to obtain the posterior distribution of thetha. Thus, why is the posterior distribution absent from the formula of the MAP estimate? Thanks
