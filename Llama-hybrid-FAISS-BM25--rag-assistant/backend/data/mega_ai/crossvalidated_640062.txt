You ran a linear probability model. While there are issues with such a model, it is a model that exists in the statistics literature and has its advocates. Most of the advocacy I have seen for linear probability models can be summarized as, “I do not want to work with models beyond OLS linear regression,” but a linear probability model can be interpreted as a simple way to predict the probability of a binary outcome. Because there is no link function that squashes the result to $[0, 1],$ the predicted probability values can exceed $1$ or fall below $0.$ How do you interpret this? Perhaps you begin to see the issues with the linear probability model. I would encourage you to read about the pros and cons of linear probability models, but the ultimate test is if you are able to do useful work for your client. After all, if your linear probability model is able to give insights that reliably help your client, aren’t you doing your client a disservice by switching to a model that reliably helps them less? (I have my doubts about your linear probability model compared to an analysis that isn’t rooted in forgetting to set a function argument (and I wonder if the R function should have a default family that allows this very mistake), however.) What does strike me as shoddy work is running a linear probability model and then sending the results through the inverse link function of a logistic regression as if you had fit a logistic regression the whole time. If you know you’re delivering results based on a software mistake (neglecting to set a function argument), I think you owe the client a correction. I am a statistician, not an attorney, but I wonder if keeping this from your client could expose you litigation, either your firm or perhaps even you personally.
