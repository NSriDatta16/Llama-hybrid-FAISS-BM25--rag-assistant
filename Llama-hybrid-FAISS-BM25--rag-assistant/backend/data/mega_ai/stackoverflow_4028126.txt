If what you're asking is if you can get the URL of the browser that's hosting your page in an iframe through Javascript, the answer is no; you cannot do this in a properly-written web browser. If an iframe could spy on whatever is hosting it, then all kinds of malicious things could be done. What you may be able to do is from your server-side code look at the referrer HTTP header in the request for your hosted page. That should be set to the URL of the page that's embedding your page.
