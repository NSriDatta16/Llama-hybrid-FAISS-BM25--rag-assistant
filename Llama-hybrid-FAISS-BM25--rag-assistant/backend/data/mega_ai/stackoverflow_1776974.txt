I don't think I'm at the point where I need to go through and get memcached setup for my Rails app, but I would like to do some simple caching on a few things Then use your existing database to store your cached items. (You are using a database, right?) memcached is only a fast-but-dumb database. If you don't need the ‘fast’ part(*) then don't introduce the extra complexity, inconsistency and overhead of having a separate cache layer. memcache with file_store is a dumb-but-not-even-fast database, and thus of little use to anyone except for compatibility/testing. (*: and really, most sites don't. Memcache should be a last resort when you can't optimise your schema, denormalise it for common queries or pre-calculate complex operations any further. It's not something the average web application should be considering as essential for scalability.)
