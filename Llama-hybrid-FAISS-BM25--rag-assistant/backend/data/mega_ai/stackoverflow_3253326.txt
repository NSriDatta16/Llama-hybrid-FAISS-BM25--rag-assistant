How did CNN get my Facebook login information?

I browsed to CNN and was horrified to see my Facebook picture there with a "post a comment" box. How did CNN get my Facebook login information? More specifically, how did CNN know I was logged into Facebook? It seems like CNN would have to have access to a cookie set by Facebook to do that. This is the only sequence I can think of. I browse to Facebook and log in. I check the "Keep me logged in" box. Facebook places an authorization cookie on my machine. I browse to CNN. CNN reads my Facebook cookie and sends the authorization code to a Facebook API. The Facebook API verifies my login information and displays the comment box. Is this what is happening? Or is there some other voodoo going on? I've seen cross-site stuff like this with advertising, but that just displays information. I just assumed sites like LinkedIn sold my information to advertisers. Automatically logging me into a third-party site seems totally different.
