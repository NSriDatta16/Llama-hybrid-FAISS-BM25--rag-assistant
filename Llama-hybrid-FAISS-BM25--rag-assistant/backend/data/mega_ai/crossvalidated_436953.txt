You can include correlated variables in a linear regression model if you want, but there are a couple of caveats. The interpretation is a bit dicey, because a unit increase in one will also likely lead to an increase in the other, so you can't think of the coefficients in isolation. The model may overfit and offset the two correlated variables (e.g. one will have a large positive coefficient and one will have a large negative coefficient). To fix this, you can use a regularized regression model. You can also use PCA to create regressors that are orthogonal.
