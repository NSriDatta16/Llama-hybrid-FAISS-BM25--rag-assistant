First idea that came to mind while reading your post was the size of your canvas that groups your Blob objects. So found some interesting fragments that might help you: In addition to specifying the UIElement, you can get the physical size of the print area with the PrintPageEventArgs..::.PrintableArea property. If the UIElement exceeds the PrintableArea, the content will be clipped at the bounds of the PrintableArea. The dimensions of the printable area are in screen-based pixels. and You use the PrintPageEventArgs..::.HasMorePages property to print a document with multiple pages. The default for PrintPageEventArgs..::.HasMorePages is false, so it does not need to be set for one-page documents. However, if there are multiple pages to print, you set the PrintPageEventArgs..::.HasMorePages property to true to indicate that there are additional pages to print. You set PrintPageEventArgs..::.HasMorePages back to false in the PrintPage event handler, when the last page is being printed. Documentation article
