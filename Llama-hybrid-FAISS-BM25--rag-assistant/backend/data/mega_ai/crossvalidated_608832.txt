Vanilla OLS linear regression can suffer from coefficient bias when predictors are omitted that are correlated with included predictors. Logistic regression is worse, because omitting a predictor that is totally independent of the included predictors can still lead to biased coefficients (okay, yes, the usual estimation is biased, but the bias is even worse). Consequently, including relevant predictors can help you get better point estimates of your coefficients of interest. Further, better performance can help tighten up confidence intervals on your coefficients. If you have enough data to support a model with many relevant variables, including all of them can have some serious advantages.
