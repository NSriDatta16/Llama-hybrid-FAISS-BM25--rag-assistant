From the information given so far, I'd say that First Normal Form would be your friend here. So your table would become something more like this: CREATE TABLE FCT_SALES_SUMMARY ( PROD_SID NUMBER, CURR_CUST_SID NUMBER, BIO_ID NUMBER, CURR_TERR_SID NUMBER, FRAN_SID NUMBER, CURR_EMP_SID NUMBER, ESTMT_FLG VARCHAR2(1 BYTE), PROD_WAC_PRC NUMBER(15,4), SALE_RATIO NUMBER, WK_UNITSCUR NUMBER(15,4), WEEK_NUMBER NUMBER, WK_UNITS NUMBER(15,4) ) ...with one row per week (as designated by WEEK_NUMBER above - call it whatever is most meaningful for your app). Now you won't lose any data that you don't want to lose: WEEK_NUMBER (or whatever) just keeps incrementing by one each week. Will it make the table's storage requirements greater? Yes. Disc space is cheap. Will it make queries slower? Possibly, but computers are fast... ;-)
