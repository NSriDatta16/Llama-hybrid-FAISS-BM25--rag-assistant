Before and after effect with logistic regression, what method to use?

So I have a test subject A which consist of a binary variable 0 and 1. I want to see if this binary variable is decided by some independent variables (plus interactions) which are continuous, which in my case I apply normal logistic regression to see if I can model it. However after I apply a treatment on test subject A, I want to see if: - Does the binary variable odds ration effect change after treatment? - Does the independent variables effects change on the binary variable after treatment Should I do two different logistic regression models (before and after) and compare its parameters with each other?
