Time Series Analysis in R

I am focusing on implement an automated solution that will take as input many time series data (one at a time). After padding any missing values in order to have a time series without gaps, I am trying to check whether each one is stationary or not and then proceed into using either hybridModel() or auto.arima() in order to get a proper forecasting. One of the questions that have arisen is that I haven't found a complete solution/algorithm describing the steps one has to take to do so. Specifically it is not clear to me what to do if p-value is not 0.05 . Is it stationary or not? For instance after decomposing I get the screenshot below: I wonder whether I have to remove the trend in the series, and if that is the case how I could do so. It is not clear to me after the decomposition whether I have to get for instance the log() of my time series or find a way to remove the trend. Can this task be automated or it needs to be "supervised" in terms of having to beforehand examine the series decomposition etc? Why the seasonal seems so repeating even thought my time series shows one distinct spike during Finally, I found information about the procedure online but I haven't found a tutorial of explanatory step-by-step guide in order not to replicate existing solutions but to be able to produce tailored solutions as there are huge differences between the time series I examine. Sorry for the long post, I tried to gather some time series questions in one place that I think will benefit others as well.
