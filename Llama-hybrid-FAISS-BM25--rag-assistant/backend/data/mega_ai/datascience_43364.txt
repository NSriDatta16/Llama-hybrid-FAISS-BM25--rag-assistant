To add to the above references (the Deep Learning book by Goodfellow et al. is a must if you want to go deep into the subject), an excellent hands-on book is dive into deep learning that gives a state of the art approach (computer vision, NLP) using the gluon API (mxnet framework, see also the straight dope ). I also highly recommend the resources in the PyTorch software ( tutorials ).
