The residual deviance is twice the difference between the likelihood in the log scale of the saturated model and that of your proposed model: $$ResidualDeviance=2\times(ll(SaturatedModel)-ll(Proposed Model)) $$ It can not be calculated simply as -2*logLik(model) in R generally, because the likelihood in the log scale of the saturated model is not always $0$ . Read this post for mathematical evidence. -2*logLik(model) works for the logistic regression because in this case the likelihood in the log scale of the saturated model is $0$ . To calculate the residual deviance of the negative binomial regression model manually in R , you can try this: sum(residuals.glm(m1, "deviance")^2) You are right about the likelihood that adding parameters will always increase the likelihood of a GLM. It is just a matter of statistical significance. It is recommended to choose a model based on the AIC and the BIC rather than the deviance only because the AIC and the BIC penalize you for adding more parameters. I hope it will help.
