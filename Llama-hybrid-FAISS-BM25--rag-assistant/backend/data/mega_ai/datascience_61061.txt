Word embedding microservices in the cloud

I would like to build nlp classifiers for various tasks such as sentiment analysis, topic modeling, name entity recognition etc. . I realized that most of them only involve simple logistic regression or as small recurrent neural network taking embedded words as an input. At the moment, I store a dictionary of the word embedding for each of my machine learning classifiers but I would like to replace it by a a micro-service which would be used by each of my machine learning model to retrieve the embedding of words . I looked on the internet and could not find any sources which already implement thi (on AWS for example). So I have two questions: Does it seems like a good idea to architect a large "farm" of nlp models Has any of you come across an open source solution which implement such word embedding microservice on the cloud. Thanks in advance for your help
