Drop outside the control

I'm improving standart WPF TabControl. I want to add undocking functionality to it: user drags the page just outside the TabControl and this page undocks in the window. I want two events in this control - PageDragStart (raises when the page dragged outside) and PageDragEnd (raises when the page dropped outside) I've got no problem with the first event. But the second... OnDrop doesn't call, because the item dropped outside the tabcontol container. How can I know that it was dropped? P.S. I want a universal control (so, undocking functionality shouldn't be connected and hardcoded with the window tabcontrol is placed or something like this)
