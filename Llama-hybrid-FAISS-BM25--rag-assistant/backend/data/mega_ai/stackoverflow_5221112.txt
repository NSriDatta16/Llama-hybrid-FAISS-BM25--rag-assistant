The best Javascript tool I know of for this sort of thing is Timeline . The example on the above link shows it mainly being used for points in time, but it can also be used for periods of time as per a gantt chart. (scroll around the example to see some) It's a Javascript tool, but you should be able to use PHP or another language to populate the data into it. Oh, and it's open source as well. :-) Hope that helps.
