Methods to demonstrate time series causality?

I am working with a team to understand the relationship between two processes that are hypothesized to have a relationship but which occur simultaneously. The hypothesized relationship is that action A taken against population P produces behavior B in that same population, but I am concerned that behavior B , which in many cases occurs without the presence of action A , drives some of the observed volume of action A . One proposed approach was to gather observations of action A in period $t-1$ and correlate them to the volume of behavior B observed in period $t$. I have serious concerns about this approach, as the volume of action A in $t-1$ is more highly correlated with the volume of action A in period $t$ than with behavior B. I've started by working with correlograms to demonstrate those basic facts but would like to apply a time series approach (perhaps Granger causality testing) to address the issue. Are there other tools or methods available that would address the issue of causality in a time series relationship?
