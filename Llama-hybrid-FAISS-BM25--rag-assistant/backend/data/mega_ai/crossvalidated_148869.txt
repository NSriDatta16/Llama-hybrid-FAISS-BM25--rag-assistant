CNN are typically supervised. So you need training data, and you forward propagate the training images through the network, then back propagate the training labels, to update the weights. There are unsupervised neural networks, for example Geoffrey Hinton's stacked boltmann machines, creating deep belief networks. You can also stack auto-encoders, which can also perform unsupervised learning. In both cases, the goal of the unsupervised learning is that the result of forward propagation followed by backward propagation is the original image.
