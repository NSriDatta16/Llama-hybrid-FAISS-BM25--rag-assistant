How to share log4j library most effectively

i have a few batch java command-line applications which are planned to be deployed as: batch_apps app_1 batch1.jar run_batch1.sh app_2 batch2.jar run_batch3.sh {...etc...} what would be the best practice on organizing a shared library pool - for example log4j: batch_apps app_1 batch1.jar run_batch1.sh app_2 batch2.jar run_batch3.sh libs log4j.jar ojdbc.jar ? and include individual log4j.xml's in each app's own jar file? i understand i would need to add 'libs' to the classpath either in manifests or in run_batchX.sh (which way is preferable?) I am mostly wondering what would be the most efficient setup performance-wise. thanks
