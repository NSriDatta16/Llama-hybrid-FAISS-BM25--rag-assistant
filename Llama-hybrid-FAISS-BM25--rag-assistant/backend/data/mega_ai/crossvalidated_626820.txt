How to interpret those ACF & PACF?

I have some problems when analyzing my time series dataset. Basically, the dataset is about the daily sales volume of an FMCG company (they work from Monday to Saturday with Sunday being a day off, so the sales volume of Sunday will not be listed in the dataset). When plotting the ACF of the dataset, I noticed some unusually significant correlations in lag 6, 12, 18, and so on, which is a multiplication of 6. My first conclusion is that maybe due to the working day of the week being 6, the dataset exhibits a seasonal pattern. When differencing the dataset with the number of lags is 6, seems like all the lag at multiplication of 6 lies within the significant limit. Nevertheless, there still be a high correlation in lag 6. How can I continue to interpret that plot? This is my first post so if there are any problems with the post, please let me know. Note: The dataset before differences is not stationary (ADF test), and after differences it is stationary. I also include PACF of the dataset before and after differences.
