Other than dummy variables, try investigating a regression model of income (either median, average, mid-mean,...) or log transform thereof, as the dependent variable, versus an intercept and a constant times number of years of education. Further, also try adding the square of years of education to the model. Logic: Years of education is a proxy for earning potential. Also, try adjusting your income data as ${$60,000}$ in the southern states is not ${$60,000}$ in New York or California. Look at observations with the same education levels and estimate a correction factor for geographic location. I hope this helps.
