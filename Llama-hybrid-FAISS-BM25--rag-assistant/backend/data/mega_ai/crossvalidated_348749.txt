With which accuracy ? And with which (algorithmic) complexity ? One can extract "features" from an integer (with a constant time) : Does it end by 2 ? Does it end by 5 ? Does it end by ... ? Is the sum of its number a multiple of 3 ? Is the sum of its number a multiple of 11 ? And train any model on these features (random forest...), the label being "is my number prime". I guess with this you would be much better than a random classifier. Now you can add more complex features (but they may be longer to evaluate than simply check from being prime) Is it a square of an integer ? Is it a Mersenne number ? Does it have the form $3k+1$ ? (or any other form) ...
