I'm not sure if I understand your question correctly but with respect to question 1 I think you are looking for a ViewModel. Like this perhaps.. OrganizationViewModel.cs public class OrganizationViewModel { public OrganizationViewModel(Organization org, IList addresses) { this.Organization = org; this.Addresses = addresses } public Organization Organization {get;set;} public IList Addresses {get;set;} } OrganizationController.cs public class OrganizationController : Controller { private readonly IOrganizationService _organizationService: //or whatever method you use public OrganizationController(IOrganizationService orgService) { this._organizationService = orgService; } public ActionResult Item(int id) { var org = _organizationService.GetOrganizationById(id); var addresses = _organizationService.GetOrgAddressesByOrgId(id); return View(new OrganizationViewModel(program, addresses)); } } Item.cshtml @model OrganizationViewModel @Model.Organization.Name @foreach(var a in Model.Addresses) { @a.Line1 @a.Line2 } Before I try and answer number 2 maybe you should indicate whether I am correctly understanding question 1. Hope this helps.
