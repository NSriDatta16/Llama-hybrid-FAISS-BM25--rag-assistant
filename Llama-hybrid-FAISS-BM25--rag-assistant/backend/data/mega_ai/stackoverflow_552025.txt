Is Objective-C 2.0 exception handling supported on non Mac OS X platforms?

Objective-C 2.0 has some new enhancements: garbage collection fast enumeration: for..in properties thread synchronization: @synchronized(self) @try/@catch/@finally/@throw exception handling I'm interested in using Objective-C 2.0 as a language to program portable code across multiple operating system platforms - while avoiding frameworks such as OpenStep or GNUStep. However, though gcc 3.4.5 on Windows will parse the syntax of using @try/@catch/@finally/@throw exception handling when compiling with -fobjc-exceptions, it still generates this error: error: storage size of '_stackExceptionData' isn't known Is there any support of Objective-C 2.0 features on operating systems other than Mac OS X v10.3 and later?
