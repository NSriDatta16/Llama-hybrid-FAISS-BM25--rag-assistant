unlink('path_to_filename'); will delete one file at a time. If your whole files from directory is gone means you listed all files and deleted one by one in a loop. Well you cannot de delete in the same page. You have to do with other page. create a page called deletepage.php which will contain script to delete and link to that page with 'file' as parameter. foreach($FilesArray as $file) { $FileLink = $Directory.'/'.$file['FileName']; if($OpenFileInNewTab) $LinkTarget = ' target="_blank"'; else $LinkTarget = ''; echo ' '.$FileName.' '; echo ' '; } On the deletepage.php //and also consider to check if the file exists as with the other guy suggested. $filename = $_GET['file']; //get the filename unlink('DIRNAME'.DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR.$filename); //delete it header('location: backto prev'); //redirect back to the other page If you don't want to navigate, then use ajax to make elegant.
