suggest a reinforcement learning agent that will learn to efficiently switch on a bit vector

The following env describes a simple task: there's a bit-vector of size 10, with all bits initially set to 0. The agent must learn to switch it all to 1s. It has 10 possible actions - each one switches the corresponding bit to 1. Switching a bit which was 0 to 1 gives a reward of 1, but trying to switch a bit which is already 1 gives a reward of -1 and ends the game. The agent sees the entire bit-vector after each step. Why isn't it very very simple? I wrote a policy-gradient approach agent but it doesn't arrive to sufficient results (stay at around ~3 points average) after 10K episodes. What am I missing? Is it indeed such a hard task???
