SEM is a covariance base model which gives priority to CFA. When working with SEM, it is must to go for CFA before proceeding to path analysis and checking for model goodness of fit. The basic point to be clear with is the issues of validity (convergent/average variance extracted and discriminant) and reliability (Composite reliability and internal consistency or alpha value). Once you check for these issues you can directedly jump into path analysis and hypothesis testing. https://drive.google.com/file/d/19v2nmhuM5G6OhclnilDEGFhVD6mEZtKJ/view
