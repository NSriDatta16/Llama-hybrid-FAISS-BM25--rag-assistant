I'm not aware of a more elegant way, than using a buffer. But the size of a buffer can make a difference. Remember the issues about Vista's File Copy? It's reason was (basically) changing the buffer size. The changes are explained in this blogpost . You can learn the main factors from that post. However, this only applies for file copying. In applications probably you do a lot of memory copies, so in that case, the 4KB could be the best buffer size, as recommended by the .NET documentation .
