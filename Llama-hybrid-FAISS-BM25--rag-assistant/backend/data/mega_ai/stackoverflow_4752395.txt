Like @Jon Hess mentioned, just create a wrapping class for the "optional" methods of the NSXMLParserDelegate. These methods help you separate the tasks that you might find useful when you parse your xml. One really good online journal file I found is Elegant XML parsing with Objective-C . Phil Nash really took his time to show the basics of the parsing options at your reach. It can take a new programmer and guide him/her through the whole setup. Loading the xml can be a modification of @Jon Hess method. You can setup the: -(void)parser:(NSXMLParser *)parser didStartElement:(NSString *)elementName namespaceURI:(NSString *)namespaceURI qualifiedName:(NSString *)qName attributes:(NSDictionary *)attributeDict{ } to handle events on certain elements. Also implement the: -(void)parser:(NSXMLParser *)parser foundCharacters:(NSString *)string { } to place the strings found into a collection of objects.
