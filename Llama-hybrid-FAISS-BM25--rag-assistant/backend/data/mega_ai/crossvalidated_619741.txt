As said in the comment, "time-series linear regression" is not a different model. As its documentation says tslm is largely a wrapper for lm() except that it allows variables "trend" and "season" which are created on the fly from the time series characteristics of the data. The variable "trend" is a simple time trend and "season" is a factor indicating the season (e.g., the month or the quarter depending on the frequency of the data). If you didn't use those extra terms, the two models are exactly the same, not only mathematically, but it is also exactly the same code underneath.
