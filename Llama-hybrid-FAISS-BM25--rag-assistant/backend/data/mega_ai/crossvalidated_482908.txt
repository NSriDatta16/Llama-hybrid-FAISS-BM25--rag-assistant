What is the difference in my case in using linear or log returns? Also, what is the difference in general and why would it matter? The log returns and arithmetic returns would be close, trivially, if the returns are close to zero. FX returns for major currency pairs can be measured in basis points (percent of a percent)---empirically, this is very close to zero. (A 4 basis point move would be a huge move for this pair). As a result, the difference between these two quantities are negligible. This can be seen already in the time series and histogram plots you provide. (Incidentally, exchange rates between majors are also quoted in increments of 0.0001, except the yen.) I read somewhere that using the log is better for when you inverse the output of the LSTM as it will reduce the prediction exploding errors. Do you have an opinion on this? If the inputs series are close, one would expect the outputs to be also close. Is there a better way of making this specific series (trending, no seasonality and some outliers) stationary? For price series in general, computing returns is about the only standard thing to do if your method requires stationarity. Note that information regarding levels is lost when one computes the return series. As a comment, FX series may not be the best playground for RNN-type methods. Those spikes in the return series are easily identifiable, and explained, by major economic events. Similarly, in a higher frequency exchange rate series with intra-day data, you would see clustering around the London 4pm fix, for example.
