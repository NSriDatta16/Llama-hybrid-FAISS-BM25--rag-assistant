You can pass the entire month's data as a single sample, which should predict the sales of that month. It would look like an index with multiple indexes. Something like MultiIndex in python's Pandas library . Another idea would be to still try predicting the sales every day, then just sum up all predictions at the end to create your monthly aggregation. Using something like a neural network may be overkill - it depends how much data you have - but will offer the flexibility to easily train a model with multiple inputs and a single output, as is your case.
