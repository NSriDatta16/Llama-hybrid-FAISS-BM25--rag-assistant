Short answer: You don't need to do dyadic analysis You can include all six predictors (i.e., 2 raters by 3 constructs) in a standard multiple regression (or perhaps logistic regression if diagnosis is binary). In fact, this will allow you to examine questions such as whether child or parent ratings are better predictors of diagnosis. Also, there are other things you may want to look at. In order to better understand your data, you may wish to explore the intercorrelations between the six predictors. E.g., What is the correlation between child and parent ratings? Are the scale intercorrelations for parents and children similar? You might want to explore multimethod-multitrait approaches .
