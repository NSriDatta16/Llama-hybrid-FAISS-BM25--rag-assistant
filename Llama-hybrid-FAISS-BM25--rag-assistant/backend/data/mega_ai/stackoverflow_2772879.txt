Extrating image information about a PNG in .NET

I'm trying to get information about a PNG file but I've yet to discover a comprehensive site to help me. These are some of the semi useful code snippets I have: Bitmap bmp = new Bitmap(pngFileName); BitmapData bd = bmp.LockBits(new Rectangle(0, 0, bmp.Width, bmp.Height), ImageLockMode.ReadOnly,PixelFormat.Format48bppRgb); and Stream imageStreamSource = new FileStream(pngFileName, FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read, FileShare.Read); var decoder = new PngBitmapDecoder(imageStreamSource, BitmapCreateOptions.PreservePixelFormat, BitmapCacheOption.Default); BitmapSource bitmapSource = decoder.Frames[0]; With these I've been able to to get the image height and width. However I still need to discover the following information: Is it RLE encoded? Is it in native video format? Is it rotated? Does it use a grayscale palette? Does it have a transparency? Is it RGB or BGR? I'd really appreciate some pointers on how to acheive this or links to good articles dealing with this. We're working with .NET 4.0
