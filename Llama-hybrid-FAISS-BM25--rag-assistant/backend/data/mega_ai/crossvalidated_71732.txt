Here are the generic steps to solve these problems. The first computations may be difficult or time consuming, so do not hesitate to use online symbolic equation solvers like wolframalpha to gain time. Start by solving the case $n=3$ to compute explicitly $\pi_3$ and try to guess what will be the general form of $\pi_n$ for larger $n$. If the guessing step is not trivial, you should try to solve the case $n=4$ and understand how to pass from $\pi_3$ to $\pi_4$. Prove by induction on $n$ that $\pi_n$ verifies $\pi_n \mathbf{P}_n = \pi_n$, where $\mathbf{P}_n$ is the transition matrix of your process. Prove the ergodicity of your Markov chain in order to claim that $\pi_n$ is the unique steady state distribution.
