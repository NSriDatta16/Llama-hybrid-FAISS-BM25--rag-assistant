How do I set up a buffer when doing an FFT using the Accelerate framework?

I'm using the Accelerate framework to perform a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), and am trying to find a way to create a buffer for use with it that has a length of 1024. I have access to the average peak and peak of a signal on which I want to do the FFT. Can somebody help me or give me some hints to do this?
