The load method has an implicit (and unavoidable, I believe) filter on the body of the document. This used to be documented on the jQuery site, but seems to be missing in the current documentation. Consider that load places the returned data inside a container in the body and it becomes obvious why it filters out everything outside the body -- it's illegal to have multiple html and/or head elements in the document and they are most certainly illegal inside any element that would be contained in the body of a document. Note: I'm easily able to load script elements that appear in the body of the document. Perhaps all you need to do is move them from the head to the body of the fragment. One caveat is that the script may need to be local to your site. Browsers may refuse to load remote scripts loaded via ajax due to security concerns.
