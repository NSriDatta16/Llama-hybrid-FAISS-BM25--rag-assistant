How to implement a map in JavaScript?

I'm wondering, what would be the simplest approach to turn this: {x: 0, y: 0, image: 'map_00_00.png', x: 50, y: 0, image: 'map_01_00.png', x: 50, y: 50, image: 'map_01_01.png'} Into something like a Google Map. I'd like to stay with jQuery. Would you use some plugin for dragging? Or just go with some simple events? I'm thinking the simplest approach would be to load all images at once, position them with CSS, and add some dragging to show hidden parts of viewport. Still I'm very curious about what other people think.
