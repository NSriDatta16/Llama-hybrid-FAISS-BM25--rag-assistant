I guess that if you perform a crisp linear SVM classifier between two groups, one of it being your data and the other being the null vector, either the algorithm will fail because 0 is in the convex hull of those points (groups not linearly separable), or a solution will be found, where one of the SVs will clearly be 0 , and the other k vectors define the k -face of the hull nearest to the origin.
