This is a bit late, but I cannot resist one suggestion and one observation. First, I believe a more "image processing" approach may be better suited than histogram/variogram analysis. I would say that the "smoothing" suggestion of EngrStudent is on the right track, but the "blur" part is counter-productive. What is called for is an edge-preserving smoother, such as a Bilateral filter , or a median filter . These are more sophisticated than moving average filters, as they are by necessity nonlinear . Here is a demonstration of what I mean. Below are two images approximating your two scenarios, along with their histograms. (The images are each 100 by 100, with normalized intensities). Raw Images For each of these images I then apply a 5 by 5 median filter 15 times*, which smooths the patterns while preserving the edges . The results are shown below. Smoothed Images (*Using a larger filter would still maintain the sharp contrast across the edges, but would smooth their position.) Note how the "river" image still has a bimodal histogram, but it is now nicely separated into 2 components*. Meanwhile, the "white noise" image still has a single-component unimodal histogram. (*Easily thresholded via, e.g. Otsu's method , to make a mask and finalize the segmentation.) Second, your image is certainly not a "river"! Aside from the fact that it is too anisotropic (stretched in the "x" direction), to the extent that meandering rivers can be described by a simple equation, their geometry is actually much closer to a sine- generated curve than to a sine curve (e.g. see here or here ). For low amplitudes this is approximately a sine curve, but for higher amplitudes the loops become "overturned" ($x\neq f[y]$), which in nature eventually leads to cutoff . (Sorry for the rant ... my training was as a geomorphologist, originally)
