How to store the index separately from the data on Azure?

I've read that a lot of websites store the index separably from the data. Specifically on Azure, the index will be stored in Azure SQL and the data stored in Azure Table Storage . This supposedly increases the performance and allows you to store a lot more data and query it efficiently. I'm not sure how to architect a system to do this. Can someone explain the process and how having an external index actually works? What happens when you want to have secondary indexes on different columns, how does that work? What about when you update/remove/add data? How does the index + actual data get updated?
