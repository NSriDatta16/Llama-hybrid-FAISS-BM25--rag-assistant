For what I understand, once a new document arrives, SVM just applies the discriminant function and decides if the document is going to be classified or not. This would mean that the kernel function is not exploited in the test phase. You can find a very good introduction to SVM in this tutorial by a UCL PhD student. In addition, this videolecture from the Machine Learning Summer School (from 2006) is very informative as well. Regards,
