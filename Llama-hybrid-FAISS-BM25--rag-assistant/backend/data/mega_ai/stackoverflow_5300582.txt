Expandable Divs/Paragraphs

I am looking to create an help section for my website and wish to use expandable divs so that when you click on a link it opens up below the link and when you click a separate link it closes the previous one and opens the other one below it? I'm using asp.net web forms and vb. Any help is greatly appreciated. Marc
