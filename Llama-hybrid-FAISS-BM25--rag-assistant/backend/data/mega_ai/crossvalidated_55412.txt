Say I do this for 60 countries, so i will get for average annual growth of income of the poor (in percent): 21.10 , 16.23 , 12.34 , 23.25 , 11.12 , 13.55 etc and for average annual growth if income of all: 43.13 , 35.31 , 56.31 etc as I said: I consider you put in the values as 21.10 and not as 0.2110? So if income of all increases one unit, the income of the poor increases 0.6 units. Wrong, remeber your variables, these are not income variables but annual growth rates! So if the average annual growth rate of the income of all increases by one unit, the annual average growth rate of the income of the poor will increase by 0.6 units on average. Is it correct to say than that a 1 percent change increase in average income of all will result in 0.6 percent change average income of the poor? Or is it percentage points change? I suppose you put in the values as 21.10 and so on. The regression output is y = 2.433 + 0.6 x where x is the average annual growth rate of the income of all and y is the average annual growth rate of the income of the poor. You put in the values, as e.g. 21.10. If x (average annual growth rate of the income of all) is increased by one unit (from e.g. 21.10 to 22.20, so from 0.2110 percent to 0.2220 percent, this is a change by 0.01 percentage point) the y (average annual growth rate of the income of the poor) will increase by 0.6. So from $y = 2.433 + 0.6 * 21.10=15.093$ to $y= 2.433 + 0.6*22.10= 15.693$ so from 15.693 to 15.093, which is from 0.15093 percent to 0.15693 percent, which is a change by 0.006 percentage point. Or an increase by $(0.15693-0.15093)/0.15093= 0.03975353$. So an increase by about 4 percent.
