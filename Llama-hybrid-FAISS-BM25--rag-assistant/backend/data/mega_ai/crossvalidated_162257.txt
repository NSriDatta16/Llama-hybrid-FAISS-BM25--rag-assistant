What's the difference between logistic regression and perceptron?

I'm going through Andrew Ng's lecture notes on Machine Learning. The notes introduce us to logistic regression and then to perceptron. While describing Perceptron, the notes say that we just change the definition of the threshold function used for logistic regression. After doing that, we can use the Perceptron model for classification. So my question is - if this needs to be specified and we consider Perceptron as a classification technique, then what exactly is logistic regression? Is is just used to get the probability of a data point belonging to one of the classes?
