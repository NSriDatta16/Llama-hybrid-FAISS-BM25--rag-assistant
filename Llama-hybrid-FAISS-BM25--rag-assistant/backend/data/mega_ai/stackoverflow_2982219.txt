pyparsing ambiguity

I'm trying to parse some text using PyParser. The problem is that I have names that can contain white spaces. So my input might look like this. First, a list of names: Joe bob Jimmy X grjiaer-rreaijgr Y Then, things they do: Joe A bob B Jimmy X C the problem of course is that a thing they do can be the same as the end of the name: Jimmy X X grjiaer-rreaijgr Y Y How can I create a parser for the action lines? The output of parsing Joe A should be [Joe, A] . The output of parsing Jimmy X C should be [Jimmy X, C] , of Jimmy X X - [Jimmy X, X] . That is, [name, action] pairs. If I create my name parser naively, meaning something like OneOrMore(RegEx("\S*")) , then it will match the entire line giving me [Jimmy X X] followed by a parsing error for not seeing an action (since it was already consumed by the name parser). NOTE: Sorry for the ambiguous phrasing earlier that made this look like an NLP question.
