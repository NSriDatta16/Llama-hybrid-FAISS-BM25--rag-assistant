The flexibility of C for this has some advantages (reduced memory/storage consumption if you use 32 instead of 64 bits), but these advantages tend to become less relevant as the hardware improves (this was designed in the 70s). This flexibility however comes with severe interoperability and long-term vision problems (Y 2038 bugs). In contrast, a Java object has anyway some storage overhead, so saving 4 bytes on each Date object would be quite pointless and only troublesome.
