One possibility would be to average across days, to get one or a few "average" daily cycles instead of 1,000+ individual days. Another idea might be a 3D representation like in Tominski, Schumann, Andrienko, and Andrienko (2012) . Reference: Tominski, C., Schumann, H., Andrienko, G., Andrienko, N. (2012).
