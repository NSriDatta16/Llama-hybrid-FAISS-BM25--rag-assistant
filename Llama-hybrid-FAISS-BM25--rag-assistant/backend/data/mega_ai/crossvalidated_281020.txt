As was pointed out in the comments, my previous approach didn't address the entire question. Suppose there is no difference between $A$ answers and $B$ answers. Then there are $6$ different ranking sequences. Let us score these sequences by summing the position of the $A$'s. $AABB$ - 3 $ABAB$ - 4 $ABBA$ - 5 $BBAA$ - 7 $BABA$ - 6 $BAAB$ - 5 Thus, assuming no difference between the answers, we have a simple pmf for the score of $A$ for each question under the null hypothesis. $$P(A_i = x) = \begin{cases}\frac{1}{6}, & x \in \{3,4,6,7\} \\ \frac{1}{3}, & x=5 \end{cases}$$ Quick calculations for the mean and variance yeild: $$\mu_o = E(A_i) = 5$$ $$\sigma_o^2 = Var(A_i) = \frac{5}{3}$$ Since your samples size is large, the normal approximation should work reasonably well. Let $N$ be the total sample size (i.e. if $n$ users each answer $m$ questions then $N = nm$). Finally, denote $$\bar{A} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N A_i$$. By the CLT, $$Z = \frac{\bar A - \mu_o}{\sigma_o/\sqrt{N}}$$ will be approximately standard normal under the null hypothesis. Via a quick simulation, here is a plot which shows that the CLT does provide a good approximation here. If answers from category $A$ are better than $B$, we might expect $A$ to be less than $5$ on average. We know the distribution of $A$ under the null hypothesis test, and we can define the P-value to be $$p = P(Z For example, suppose $200$ users each answer $14$ questions and we calculate $\bar A = 4.9$, we can obtain an approximate P-value for this test as follows (using R). N In this case, we get $Z = -4.10$ and a P-value of $2.07e^{-5}$. Thus in this hypothetical example, it appears that we have evidence to conclude that $A$ is getting ranked more favorably than it would under the null hypothesis.
