What kind of research can be done with genomic data?

It is well known that science has given us large amounts of free accessible data, such as https://www.1000genomes.org and https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank . How can we play around with the data and apply data science/machine learning to it? What could be some ideas? My own ideas: Biological data visualisation Gene prediction using hidden-markov-model Any more?
