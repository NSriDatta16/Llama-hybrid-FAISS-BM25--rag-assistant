Possible jQuery.delay Bug?

I'm using jQuery.delay in tandem with jQuery.accordion and jQuery.fadeIn/Out effects. Here is my javascript: $(function() { $("#accordion").load("update.php"); var refresh = setInterval(function() { $("#accordion").fadeOut("slow", function() { $("#accordion").load("update.php", function() { $("#accordion").delay(1); $("#accordion").fadeIn("slow"); }); }); }, 5000); }); What this does is load HTML generated by update.php in an accordion layout (i.e it's collapsible content), and every 5 seconds it will poll update.php for new HTML and fade it in after fading out the old HTML. The problem arises at the line reading $("#accordion").delay(1); . With this line in, the section of content that's collapsible gets curtailed somehow and won't "unfurl" like a proper accordion effect should. All the data is still there; you can click and drag your mouse to scroll down through it. It just doesn't render properly in the browser or draw the div correctly or something. By simply removing that line, it loads successfully and without issue. I encourage you to try reproducing my results, and let me know if you can locate a work-around, because I really do need that delay in there! Thank you for reading.
