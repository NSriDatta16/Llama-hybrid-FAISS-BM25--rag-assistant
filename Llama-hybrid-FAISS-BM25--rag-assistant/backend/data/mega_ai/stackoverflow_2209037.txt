.Net Configuration files confusion

We've got a somewhat complex project that the original developers split into multiple projects for organization purposes. What this means to me is that I've got an ASP.Net site that has a web.config and contains all sorts of good settings, and another project that compiles to a DLL that has it's own .config file, app.config. In the DLL, it would be very nice to be able to access all the AppSettings that I have in the ASP.Net proejct's web.config file. Is this possible? Is it good practice? I don't really want to copy and paste the same information and have to manually keep them in synch between the 2 (actually there might be up to 20 -- it's a large project and someone organized it to an absurd level) .config files. Any suggestions or best practices?
