I don't know the specifics of the browsers you are using, but I do know that most of the big sites will detect your OS + browser combination to decide what HTML to show you. If Google is seeing a different user agent, you might get a generic mobile version of the HTML instead os the Blackberry specific HTML you get for the built in browser. If you have access to a web server, try hitting it with both browser setups and see if there is any difference in the log file. That might tell you something interesting.
