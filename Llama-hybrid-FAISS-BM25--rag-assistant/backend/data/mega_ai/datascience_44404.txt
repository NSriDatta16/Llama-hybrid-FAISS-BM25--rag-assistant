Usually it is a binary classification problem, i.e. supervised learning. One thing to take into account in these projects is the imbalance betweeen FRAUD - NO FRAUD labels, being the former instance much less frequent. But with no labels, I would start by doing some feature engineering and applying PCA, to check the existance of instances getting slightly away.
