How to store binary data in SQLite tables with FTS3 enabled?

I'm transitioning an application from using a normal SQLite database to one with full text search enabled. It has several BLOB columns that store things like digital signatures, which obviously do not need to be indexed. I've read that other people solve this by moving all non-TEXT data to a separate, non-FTS3 table that they inner join with the FTS3 table when necessary, but this is a very inelegant solution. Is there no way to simply exclude certain columns from indexing?
