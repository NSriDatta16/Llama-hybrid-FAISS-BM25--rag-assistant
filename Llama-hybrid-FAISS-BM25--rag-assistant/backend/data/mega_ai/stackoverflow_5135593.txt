I think you're missing some brackets and have the logical operators a bit mixed up. How about this. $query = "SELECT * FROM places WHERE "; $query .= "((lat BETWEEN $latmin_2 AND $latmax_2) AND NOT (lat BETWEEN $latmin AND $latmax)) AND "; $query .= "((lng BETWEEN $lngmin_2 AND $lngmax_2) AND NOT (lng BETWEEN $lngmin AND $lngmax)) AND "; EDIT To solve the circle/square problem: $query = "SELECT * FROM places WHERE "; $query .= "(POW((lat - $lat) * $avgMilesPerLatDeg,2) + ". "POW((lng - $lng) * $avgMilesPerLngDeg,2) BETWEEN 1 AND 4)"; // the four at the end is 2 squared I would suggest using this approach if your app is not large-scale (geographically speaking) and the averages produce acceptable results. Calculating the real distance takes longer to compute and the difference might not be that big. This is up to you and your application's goal.
