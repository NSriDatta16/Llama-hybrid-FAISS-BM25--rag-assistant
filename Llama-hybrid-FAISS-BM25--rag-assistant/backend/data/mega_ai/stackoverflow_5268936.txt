Mysqldump only tables with certain prefix / Mysqldump wildcards?

I have this huge, messy database I am cleaning up. It houses 500+ tables, which is the result of combining Magento Enterprise with Joomla in one single DB. To make things worse, there is a set of 70+ Joomla tables that are not in use at all. These are all prefixed with bak_ . Just deleting these bak_ tables will be easy, but I want to 'bak' them up first (see what I did there?). In my mind I can picture a command like this: mysqldump -u username -p mydatabase bak_* But this doesn't work. What would be the best way to do this? Thanks! EDIT: Yes, I could explicitly list the 70 tables to include, or the ~430 tables to exclude, but I am looking for a better way to do this, if possible.
