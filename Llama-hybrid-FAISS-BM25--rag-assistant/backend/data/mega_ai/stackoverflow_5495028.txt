To save time when looking for high-volume tags like p (paragraph, I presume) in docx or c (cell) in xlsx, it's usual to set up the full tag once at the global or class level: WPML_URI = "{http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main}" tag_p = WPML_URI + 'p' tag_t = WPML_URI + 't' I have never seen an explanation of why one would want to use QName() . In the other direction, given a full tag, you can extract the base tag easily: base_tag = full_tag.rsplit("}", 1)[-1]
