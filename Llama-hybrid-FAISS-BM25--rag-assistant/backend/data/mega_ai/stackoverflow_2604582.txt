Consider saving the call to encode() until you retrieve the value for display, rather than before you store it. So long as you are consistent in your retrieval mechanism, the extra data in your database probably isn't worth fretting over. Edit Re-reading your question I realize now my answer doesn't fully address the issue seeing as calling encode() later will still have the same results. Not knowing of an alternative myself, it may not be much help, but you may want to consider finding a more suitable method for encoding that will respect existing symbols.
