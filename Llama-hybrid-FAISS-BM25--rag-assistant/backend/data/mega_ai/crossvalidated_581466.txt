discontinuous predictions time series model

I am trying to predict patient census by hour for a hospital and the historical data provided to me is in hourly format. The issue however is that the there is a discontinuous region between the end of the historical data and the beginning of the first time value in the prediction period. For example, I am given historical data from [1/1/2020,10/15/2021], and from this data my first predicted point forecast is 12/1/2021 at 12AM. ARIMA models require the first predicted point period t+1 to be the end of the training period at time t, however clearly with this gap region I cannot use ARIMA. ARIMA also has issues with long-term forecasting at short intervals asymptotic convergence. In my research in time series modelling I have not encountered this gap issue before, most models will train and then predict the first prediction point as the next point following the end of the training interval.
