Loading external SWF's with Transparent Background

Just to get some professional opinions, is it possible to load in an external SWF and set that SWF's background to transparent? This question has nothing to do with embedding the SWF in an HTML page. I already know that setting the WMODE to transparent will create a SWF with a transparent background in a browser.
