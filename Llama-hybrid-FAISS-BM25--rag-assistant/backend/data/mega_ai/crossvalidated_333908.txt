If your response variable is produced by taking the fraction of $a \textrm{ and } b$, $\{a,b\} \in \mathbb{R} \mid \{a,b\} > 0$ (i.e $a$ and $b$ are non-zero, positive, continuous), then it is reasonable to model it as being distributed according to the Beta distribution . In such case you should perform a beta regression, implemented in the betareg package in R. You can then compare your models with stats::AIC . If $a$ represents counts and $b$ trials, you should rather use a logistic regression which uses the binomial distribution as a model. Using the quasi-binomial distribution as a model is useful if your data exhibit more (or less) variance than that expected from a binomial model. If you choose to use a quasi-binomial model, the package AICcmodavg can provide you with the quasilikelihood counterpart of AIC. However you should proceed with caution as this metric may be too sensitive with departures from the model ( Wang et al. 2015 ).
