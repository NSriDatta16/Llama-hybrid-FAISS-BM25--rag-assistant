Frequency error when running Holt-winter's seasonal method in R

I am trying out time series analysis on R using the "Unemployment Rate" data of the US_indicators dataset in the TSstudio package. As the dataset originally exists as a data.frame, I tried turning it into a xts object before applying it to some time series model (in this case, a holt-winter's damped additive model). The codes I have used as are follows: # packages library(TSstudio) library(xts) library(forecast) # xts unemployment_xts $"Unemployment Rate", order.by=US_indicators$ Date, frequency=12) fc_xts However, I was prompted that the "time series should have frequency greater than 1". When I checked the xts object's frequency, I realize that it was "1" although I specified in the argument that the frequency should be "12". May I enquire why is this so? And what should I have done instead so as to correctly run the time series model on the data? Thank you!
