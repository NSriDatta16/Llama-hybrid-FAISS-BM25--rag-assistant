How do you set a "score" of the data?

My data is like this grid average_2bhk average_3bhk conf_2bhk conf_3bhk 210 900 $ 1200$ 0.5 0.4 213 1012 $ 1360$ 0.4 0.8 215 922 $ 1500$ 0.4 0.2 grid is the id, we are giving to a place and average_1bhk, 2bhk is the average rent per room in that area. Conf_1bhk, 2_bhk is the number we have given according to the percentage of houses available in that area compared to other houses. Now my question is how I can make a "score" column, which can say which grid is the most expensive among all those, I tried using normal multiplication but that doesn't give any implication. My professor told me to think for myself, but I have totally burned out. Any advice would be great. You can even tell any source where I can read about these topics, so I can think something.
