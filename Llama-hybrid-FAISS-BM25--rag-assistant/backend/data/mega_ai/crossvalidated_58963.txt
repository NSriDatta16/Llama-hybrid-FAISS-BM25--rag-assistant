What is the correct sample size in BIC formula?

The definition of the Bayesian information criterion is usually given as $$\operatorname{BIC} = -2 \text{ln}(L) + k\text{ln}(n)\,,$$ where $\ln(L)$ is the maximized log-likelihood of the data given a particular model, $k$ is the number of free parameters that this model has, and finally $n$ is the number of data points that the model is being fit to. If I had a model which predicts the number of correct responses in two experimental conditions with 100 trials each, and my data consisted of the number of correct responses in each of the two conditions (e.g., 34 out of 100), then what exactly should I use for $n$, 2 or 200?
