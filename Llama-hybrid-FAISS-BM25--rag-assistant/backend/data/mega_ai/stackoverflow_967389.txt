How can I nest these two SQL queries in MS Access 2007?

I have a table called baskets with these columns: basket (name of the basket) colour (colour of the basket) apples (the number of apples in the basket) bananas (the number of bananas in the basket) oranges (the number of oranges in the basket) pears (the number of pears in the basket) peaches (the number of peaches in the basket) With Query1, I determine the total number of fruit in each basket and I also include the colour of each basket: SELECT basket, colour, apples+bananas+oranges+pears+peaches AS fruit FROM baskets; Query1 consists of three columns: basket colour fruit (total number of fruit in the basket) With Query2, I determine the average number of fruits there are in all baskets of each colour by drawing the information from the result of Query1: SELECT DISTINCT candidate.colour, candidate.fruit (SELECT AVG(fruit) FROM Query1 AS average WHERE average.colour = candidate.colour) AS fruit FROM Query1 AS candidate; Query2 consists of two columns: colour fruit Is it possible to nest these queries so that I may obtain the result of Query2 with only one query? Your help will be much appreciated. Thank you.
