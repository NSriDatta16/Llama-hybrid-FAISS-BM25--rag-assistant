visual of how to find the feature maps of two input with 3 filters in cnn

1st layer of CNN : We have an input and we apply two filters on the input to get 2 feature maps. now in my knowledge, we'll use these two feature maps as an input in 2nd layer of CNN. if we apply 3 filters on these two inputs I know the total feature maps will be 3 because no. of feature maps = number of filters. My Question : How to do it visually. In simple words, we have two inputs and we have to add three filters to these inputs. How would we do it? question: 2 feature maps: 4X4 w11,w12,w13,w14 .... .... w41,w42,.....,w44 4X4 u11,u12,u13,u14 .... .... u41,u42,.....,u44 3 filters: 3X3 f11,f12,f13 .... f31,f32,f33 g11,g12,g13 .... h11,h12,h13 ....
