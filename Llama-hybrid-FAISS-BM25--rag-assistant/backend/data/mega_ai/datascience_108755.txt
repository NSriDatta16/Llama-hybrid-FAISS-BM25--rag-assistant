Does Multicollinearity affect Neural Networks?

Can someone explain to me like I'm five on why multicollinearity does not affect neural networks? I've done some research and neural networks are basically linear functions being stacked with activation functions in between, now if the original input variables are highly correlated, doesn't that mean multicollinearity happens?
