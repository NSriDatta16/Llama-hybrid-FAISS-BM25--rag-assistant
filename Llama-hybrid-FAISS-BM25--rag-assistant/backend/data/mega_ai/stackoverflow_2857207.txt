As Joseph said, there is no definite list of possibilities. My suggestion to you is to just start going through Magento's config.xml files. Just open up /app/code/core/Mage/ and then each folder inside there is a core module. So, Sales for instance. Open up Sales/etc/config.xml and see what they've done. You can learn a ton just by looking at what Magento has already built. When I stopped trying to ask everyone questions and started inspecting and learning from the code that is already there, that's when I really started to progress in my understanding how everything works.
