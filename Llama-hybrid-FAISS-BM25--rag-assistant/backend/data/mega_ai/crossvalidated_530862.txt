Why is the generalized DiD not reported as the Variance Weighted Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (VWATT)?

Normally, when dealing with the staggered implementation of laws we normally use generalized difference-in-differences. I saw that Dasgupta, 2019, p. 2596-2597 did not mention the VWATT which is described by Goodman-Bacon (2018) , I am wondering why he did not account for the VWATT? From his model, it appears they simply ran OLS with fixed effects and clustering. The identification in Dasgupta's paper is: $Y_{it}$ = $\alpha$ + $\beta$ $(Leniency Law)_{kt}$ + $\delta$$X_{ikt}$ + $\theta$$_t$ + $\gamma$$_i$ + $\epsilon$$_{it}$ where $i$ , $k$ , and $t$ index firms, countries, and years respectively. $X_{ikt}$ is a vector of the different firm, country, and industry control, while $\gamma$ and $\theta$ are firm and year fixed effects.
