Whether to create a custom exception or wait to occur NullReferenceException down the line?

I am confused. Whether to create a custom exception or .Net base class library has the relevant exception? I am calling some kind of service or framework API and it returns back a null reference which is an exceptional case for my tier. I know that the system won't be able to proceed with null reference and I should get a NullReferenceException down the line if I proceed. So, should I create a custom exception at that point or should I wait to occur the NullPointerReference? See the code snippet below Organization organization = OrganizationService.GetOrganizationById("123"); this.SetOrders(organization.Id); // This will give me NullReferenceException please guide me. Thanks and regards 123Developer
