How can a neural network predict a policy vector of non-constant length?

I am reviewing how the AlphaZero works. In the article it is said that the neural network predicts a single value number $v$ and a policy vector $\pi$ : P[s], v = nnet.predict(s) For one state $s_1$ there can be 3 different actions, whereas for another state $s_2$ there can be 4 different actions, etc. That means a neural network predicts either 4 or 5 different numbers depending on the input. Question: what kind of neural network does that?
