I fully agree that Pearl's tone is arrogant, and his characterisation of "statisticians" is simplistic and monolithic. Also, I don't find his writing particularly clear. However, I think he has a point. Causal reasoning was not part of my formal training (MSc): the closest I got to the topic was an elective course in experimental design, i.e. any causality claims required me to physically control the environment. Pearl's book Causality was my first exposure to a refutation of this idea. Obviously I can't speak for all statisticians and curricula, but from my own perspective I subscribe to Pearl's observation that causal reasoning is not a priority in statistics. It is true that statisticians sometimes control for more variables than is strictly necessary, but this rarely leads to error (at least in my experience). This is also a belief that I held after graduating with an MSc in statistics in 2010. However, it is deeply incorrect. When you control for a common effect (called "collider" in the book), you can introduce selection bias. This realization was quite astonishing to me, and really convinced me of the usefulness of representing my causal hypotheses as graphs. EDIT: I was asked to elaborate on selection bias. This topic is quite subtle, I highly recommend perusing the edX MOOC on Causal Diagrams , a very nice introduction to graphs which has a chapter dedicated to selection bias. For a toy example, to paraphrase this paper cited in the book: Consider the variables A=attractiveness, B=beauty, C=competence. Suppose that B and C are causally unrelated in the general population (i.e., beauty does not cause competence, competence does not cause beauty, and beauty and competence do not share a common cause). Suppose also that any one of B or C is sufficient for being attractive, i.e. A is a collider. Conditioning on A creates a spurious association between B and C. A more serious example is the "birth weight paradox", according to which a mother's smoking (S) during pregnancy seems to decrease the mortality (M) of the baby, if the baby is underweight (U). The proposed explanation is that birth defects (D) also cause low birth weight, and also contribute to mortality. The corresponding causal diagram is { S -> U, D -> U, U -> M, S -> M, D -> M } in which U is a collider; conditioning on it introduces the spurious association. The intuition behind this is that if the mother is a smoker, the low birth weight is less likely to be due to a defect.
