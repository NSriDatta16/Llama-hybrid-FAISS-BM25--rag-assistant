What does this line in a WSDL file mean?

In a Magento forum someone wrote that removing this line from the WSDL file has a huge impact on the performance of the SOAP server: What does this line actually do? Can it really be removed? (Everything seems to work fine, but who knows...) Is it possible this line causes performance issues? EDIT: Has this something to do with XML namespaces?
