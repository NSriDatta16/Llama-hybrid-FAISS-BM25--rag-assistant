Can supervised classification models be used as hypothesis testing to compare alternative groping of labels?

Since I didn't find any resource online, I'm asking here. In this paper of Pereira et al.,(2007; https://doi.org/10.1600/036364407780360201 ), they use cross validated Canonical Discriminant analysis to test whether, from a morphological point of view, the species studied are worth to be separated or must be merged. Is this, from the Machine Learning point of view legit? Specifically: Can supervised classification models be used in hypothesis testing? What are the effects of reducing the number of classes on the possibility of getting an higher accuracy just by chance? Does che change of labels influence the structure of the data? If it is wrong, is there any more sounded methods to do so? Thank you in advance
