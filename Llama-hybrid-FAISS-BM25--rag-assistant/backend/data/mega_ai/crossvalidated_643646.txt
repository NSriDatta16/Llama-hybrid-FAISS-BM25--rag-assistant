Standard function to quantify consistency of a sequence of predictions

Let's say I let a deep learning model classify a single object multiple times but under varying circumstances. Ideally it should predict the same class again and again. But in reality its class predictions may vary. So given a sequence of class predictions for the single object, I'd like to quantify how consistent the sequence is. To be clear, this is not about comparing predictions against some ground truth. This is about consistency within the prediction sequence itself. For instance, a perfectly consistent prediction sequence like class_a, class_a, class_a, class_a should get a perfect score. A less consistent sequence like class_a, class_b, class_a, class_c should get a lower score. And a completely inconsistent sequence like class_a, class_b, class_c, class_d should get the lowest score possible. The goal is to find out on what objects we may need to keep training the classification model. If the classification model is not very consistent in its predictions for a certain object, then we might need to add that object to a dataset for further training. Preferably it works for any number of possible classes and also takes into account prediction confidences. The sequence class_a (0.9), class_b (0.9), class_a (0.9), class_c (0.9) should give a lower score then class_a (0.9), class_b (0.2), class_a (0.8), class_c (0.3) , as it's no good when the predictions are inconsistent with high confidences. Please note that the model's prediction confidences do not relate to probabilities. A prediction from the model also contains just 1 class with 1 confidence . Not a set of classes with confidences adding up to 1 in total. (That would of course be an interesting case too.) I could build something myself, but I'd like to know if there's a standard sklearn or scipy (or similar) function for this? Thanks in advance! The comment to this question suggests Spearman's correlation coefficient or the Kandell correlation coefficient . I'll look into that as well.
