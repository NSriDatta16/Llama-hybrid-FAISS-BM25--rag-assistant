No, there's no way to automatically check additional checkboxes when a single checkbox is clicked without scripting. If you absolutely want a solution that degrades gracefully if JavaScript is disabled, one approach could be to include an extra checkbox that means "select all child items", without actually checking the children. Here's a somewhat contrived example: Javascript disabled: Pick the stuff you like (check all that apply): [ ] Colors # Doesn't check all children, since scripting is disabled [ ] All colors # Won't check all boxes, but should be interpreted # by the server as if all color boxes were checked [ ] Red [ ] Blue [ ] Yellow [ ] Beverages [ ] All beverages [ ] Tea [ ] Coffee [ ] Coca-Cola [ ] Pepsi With JavaScript enabled, you could remove the All colors/beverages check boxes and instead add a script that checks all children when a check box is checked: Pick the stuff you like (check all that apply): [ ] Colors # Automatically checks all children [ ] Red [ ] Blue [ ] Yellow [ ] Beverages # Automatically checks all children [ ] Tea [ ] Coffee [ ] Coca-Cola [ ] Pepsi In this case I probably wouldn't bother with graceful degradation, though. Those few users that have JavaScript disabled can still check all checkboxes manually, so the application won't be completely broken for them.
