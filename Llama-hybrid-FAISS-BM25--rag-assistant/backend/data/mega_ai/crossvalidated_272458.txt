Is it compulsory to partition data in training and testing for time series modelling?

Is it compulsory to partition data in training and testing for time series modelling ? The reason for asking this question: Lets say training data= first 80% observation of actual time series data(not using random sampling because if we use it, we won't be able to capture trend) and testing data = last 20% data. If we build model on training data (we are leaving most recent observations to train the model), then we won't be able to capture recent effect in model. So it may lead to underfit situation, which we don't want.
