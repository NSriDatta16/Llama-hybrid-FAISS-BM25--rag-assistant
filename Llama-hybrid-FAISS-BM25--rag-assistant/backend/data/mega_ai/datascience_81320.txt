The Model learns to match the weights as per the image and feedback from label data. If you will feed a few Image classes as "Not Cat", it will learn to classify similar features as " Not Cat ". But might fail for a new Class. e.g. if it is trained on "Car/Furniture/Dog" as "Not Cat", then chances are high that a Wild Cat will be classified as Cat . Dumping all the Imagenet dataset will definitely provide quite a good variance to the "Not Cat" class and may work most of the time but that is not the appropriate solution for the problem. Such type of problem will fall under One-Class-Classification . Core idea is to use CNN to extract features then use some specialized models e.g. one-class SVM, Gaussian Mixtures, etc. to define a boundary for "Cat" This problem, as defined by the one-class SVM approach, consists of identifying a sphere enclosing all (or the most) of the data. The classical strategy to solve the problem considers a simultaneous estimation of both the center and the radius of the sphere.

Here, we try to put a Threshold on reconstruction error. References- Quora SO Keras blog Also, may look here to check an idea which generated Random images for "No Cat" Class. Here
