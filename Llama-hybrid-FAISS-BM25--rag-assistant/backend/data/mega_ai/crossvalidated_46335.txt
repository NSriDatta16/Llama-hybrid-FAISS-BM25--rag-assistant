Sure. First, sort by average number of actions. Then make (say) 4 graphs, each with 25 lines, one for each quartile. That means you can shrink the y-axes (but make the y axis label clear). And with 25 lines, you can vary them by line type and color and perhaps plotting symbol and get some clarity Then stack the graphs vertically with a single time axis. This would be pretty easy in R or SAS (at least if you have v. 9 of SAS).
