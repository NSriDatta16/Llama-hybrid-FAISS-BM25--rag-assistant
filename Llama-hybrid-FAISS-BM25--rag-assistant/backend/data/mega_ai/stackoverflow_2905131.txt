Maybe a #pragma once at the very beginning of your header file will solve the problem. The error message tells you that the linker finds multiple definitions of your class, obviously because you are including the header more than once. That is fine in general, but then you should always add some so called inclusion guards in your header file to prevent this error. EDIT: Just saw that Brian R. Bondys answer is the correct one.
