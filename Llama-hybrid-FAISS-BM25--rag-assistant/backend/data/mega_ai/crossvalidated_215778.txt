Lagged time series analysis

Given 3 continuous, normally distributed, independent, time-series vectors ( X , Y , Z ) and 1 continuous, Poisson distributed, dependant, time-series vector ( A ). How can I rank the independent vectors in terms of how much they influence ( A )? Baring in mind there will be a delay (lag), of an unknown time period, in changes X , Y , Z causing changes in A . My initial thought was cross-correlation, but I'm struggling to evaluate my results to determine which vector has the most influence and whether that influence is significant.
