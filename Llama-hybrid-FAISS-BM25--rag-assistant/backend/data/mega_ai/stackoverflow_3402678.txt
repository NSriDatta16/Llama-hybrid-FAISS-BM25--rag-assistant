I am not a php guru by any means but are you writing the extracted files to a temporary local storage location that is within the scope of the application? Because if you are not then I think what is happening is that the application is storing the zip file and extracted files in memory and then is attempting to read them. So if it is a large zip and/or the extracted files are large that would introduce a huge amount of overhead on top of the overhead introduced by your read and processing actions. So if you are not already I would extracted the files and write them to disk in their own folder, dispose of the zip file at this point, and then iterate over the files in your newly created directory and perform whatever actions you need to on them.
