iOS4 MPMoviePlayerController Embedding

I am using MPMoviePlayerController currently to play a video inside IPhone and now I wish to play this video in a small area of the view (not the full screen). I think there is a frame way of doing it but I couldn't find the required tutorial somewhere. Have you been across any? That would be great. UPDATED I have reached to this point but still it doesn't show the player to play on screen. -(IBAction)startVideo { //start video here NSURL *path = [[NSURL alloc] initWithString:[self localVideoPath:NO]]; // Create custom movie player MPMoviePlayerController *moviePlayer = [[[MPMoviePlayerController alloc] initWithContentURL:path] autorelease]; [moviePlayer setScalingMode:MPMovieScalingModeAspectFill]; [moviePlayer setControlStyle:MPMovieControlStyleNone]; [moviePlayer setFullscreen:FALSE]; // May help to reduce latency [moviePlayer prepareToPlay]; [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self selector:@selector(onMSAASDone:) name:MPMoviePlayerPlaybackDidFinishNotification object:moviePlayer]; //---play partial screen--- //moviePlayer.view.frame = CGRectMake(0, 0, 200, 300); moviePlayer.view.frame = image.frame; //[[moviePlayer view] setFrame: [image bounds]]; [image removeFromSuperview]; [self.view addSubview:moviePlayer.view]; // Show the movie player as modal //[self presentModalViewController:moviePlayer animated:YES]; // Prep and play the movie [moviePlayer play]; }
