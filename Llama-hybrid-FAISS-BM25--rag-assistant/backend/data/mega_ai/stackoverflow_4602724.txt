Easy rotation in 3D with mouse in Flash rotationXYZ in 2 directions

I have a Cube which I want to rotate using mouse motion. So if I move my mouse to the left it rotates as if rotationX was increased. When I move right rotationX is increased. Moving Up and Down alters rotationY. This looks fine as long as you modify only one dimension (either rotationX or rotationY). But if I have already changed rotationX and then try to modify rotationY the results are weird. If rotationX is 180 rotationY effects are reversed. It basically is quite unpredictable and certainly not suitable for user. I have tried to look around (failed), read about quaternions (couldn't understand), tried some out of blue and very complex trigonometric calculations (made a fool out of myself) and so I am stuck now. I've found this SO question Best way to translate mouse drag motion into 3d rotation of an object but it doesn't help me a bit, I can't understand any of the answers, really. A complete, working solution/algorithm in AS3 would be the best, but some pseudo-code or just clear explanation will be really appreciated.
