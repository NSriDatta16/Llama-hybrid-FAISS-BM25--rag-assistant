General mathematical definition of a score

I understand what scores are in PCA, in particular this answer gives a good mathematical formulation: (Scores) are projections of the centred data in the linear space defined by the eigenvectors. But the concept of scores , as representations of the original data in a new space does not have to be PCA-specific - other linear spaces can be identified with other techniques. Does the concept of scores have a general mathematical definition outside of PCA? Specifically, I wonder if there is one that would accommodate nonlinear techniques as well - the way I see it, techniques such as non-linear PCA also produce something that is analogous to scores, just that they can have higher dimensionality than the original data. So, is there one mathematical definition to rule them all ?
