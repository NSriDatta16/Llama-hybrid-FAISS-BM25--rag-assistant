None of the answers is correct. Evidently the answer ought to be substantially greater than $1/2=0.5$ because the mean of this Binomial distribution is $20=200\times 0.1$ and the event "less than 24" includes all values less than the mean and a substantial number greater than it. This alone indicates (A) is the intended response. The correct probability is given by the cumulative value for the Binomial $(200, 0.1)$ distribution evaluated at $23.$ In R you can find this directly or add the individual probabilities, thus: > pbinom(23, 200, 0.1) [1] 0.7982976 or > sum(dbinom(0:23, 200, 0.1)) [1] 0.7982976 Often, textbook questions of this nature are expecting you to use a Normal approximation to the Binomial distribution. This approximation is based on matching the Binomial mean, $\mu=200\times 0.1,$ and the Binomial variance, $\sigma^2 = 200\times 0.1 \times (1-0.1),$ to a Normal distribution and evaluating its cumulative value at $23 + 1/2.$ In R this would be > pnorm(23 + 1/2, 200 * 0.1, sqrt(200 * 0.1 * (1-0.01))) [1] 0.7842322 As you can see, this is a good approximation but it still does not agree with any of the answer choices. I cannot find any variation of either approach that gives any of the answer choices. The closest I have been able to get is to use the exact Binomial calculation and average its values for $23$ and $24:$ > mean(pbinom(23:24, 200, 0.1)) [1] 0.8267018 However, this still does not agree with any of the choices exactly. As remarked in a comment, your method embodies a conceptual error: the event "less than 24" includes the possibility of zero, which you haven't included. However, zero is so unlikely that omitting it produces no appreciable error; its chance is > dbinom(0, 200, 0.1) [1] 7.055079e-10 This error could matter in other problems, though, so it's worth remembering.
