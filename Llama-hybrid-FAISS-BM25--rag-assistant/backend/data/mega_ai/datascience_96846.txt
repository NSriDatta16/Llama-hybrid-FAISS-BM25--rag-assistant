Can Darknet be Integrated with Tensorflow and tfx?

Tensorflow and Darknet are deep learning frameworks that work and are configured. Can Darknet be Integrated differently? Is there any framework or way to integrate Darknet within a tfx pipeline, for both inferencing and training models? I do work with both frameworks and need to unify this work. For example, I may train my model in Darknet and make all the inference work in Tensorflow or vice versa.
