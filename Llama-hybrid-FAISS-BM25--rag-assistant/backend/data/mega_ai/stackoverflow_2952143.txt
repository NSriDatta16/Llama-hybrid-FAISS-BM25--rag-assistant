I'd recommend against implementing this against a desktop-application such as Digsby (unrelated: which, last time I checked, has the ulterior motive of being a malware installer) .

PoshTweet : The PowerShell Twitter Script library Facebook Organizer I'd think for your goal of having it aggregated to more than one service, Ping.fm integration may be the best bet. I don't see anyone who has made a PowerShell script for this yet, but seeing as the Ping.fm API is also REST based, it would look a lot like the PoshTweet implementation.
