ASP.Net ec2 + s3

I am wondering what's the best way to setup s3 storage for an ec2 instance running windows/IIS/Asp.Net website? Currently, the website makes web service calls and caches the result to the file system. These cached files will then be used a few times. Finally an output (movie) file will be generated. This file will need to be stored on S3. Currently, all I know how to setup is to make a AWS api call to the S3 and store the movie file. But I heard there's a way to mount S3 as a partition on AWS, but it seems to be linux only? Thanks in advance for the help.
