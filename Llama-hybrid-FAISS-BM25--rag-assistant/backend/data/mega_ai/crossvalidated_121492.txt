Would a simple OLS regression work with this example?

First and foremost I would greatly appreciate any help you can provide me with. I am writing my undergraduate thesis on the rise of populism in France. The relationship I am trying to better understand is as follows: Can we explain the rise in popularity of the National Front (political party) between 2000 and 2014 through the rising number of immigrant populations immigrating to France? The data I have so far are the average popularity ratings per year for the political party, and the change in immigrants in France?
