Hurdle model for non-count continuous data with both positive and negative values

I am aiming to estimate a hurdle model (where being non-zero is the hurdle) in the vein of Cragg. My data is both positive and negative where the data reflects the difference between a value reported initially and then in a follow-up. The hurdle is effectively that an individual does not report the same value twice in a follow-up (i.e the difference values that I am using as my dependent variable are not 0). Having not reported the same value (i.e not being 0), I would like to estimate a normal regression model. All the packages I have looked at (churdle in stata and pscl::hurdle in R) seem to focus on non-zero data. I am wondering if there is a way to do this for my type of data. I have attempted to just simply estimate a probit on the likelihood of reporting 0 and then estimate my normal regression model for the observations where it does not equal 0 but this seems wrong. I imagine I would need to be adjusting my standard errors somehow.
