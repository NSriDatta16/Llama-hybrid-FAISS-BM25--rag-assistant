IIS6 HTTP request prioritization

I am submitting POST requests to an external server running IIS6. This is a time critical request where I want to ensure that my request is processed at a specific time (say 10:00:00 AM). No earlier. And I want to ensure that at that specific time, my request is assigned the highest priority over other requests. Would any of this help: Sending most of the message a few seconds early and sending the last byte or so a few milliseconds prior to 10:00:00. Not sure if this will help as I will be competing with other requests that come in around that time. Will IIS assign a higher priority to my request based on how long I am connected? Anything that I can add to the message header to tell the server to queue my request and process only at a specific time? Any known hacks that I can leverage?
