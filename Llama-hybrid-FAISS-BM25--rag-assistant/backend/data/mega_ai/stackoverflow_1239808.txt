creating an object with user's selections in UI, and displaying it back

I have some dropdown and checkbox items on the front end. I have an object that collects all the selections made by the user. For example: Object myObject = new object(); myObject.Value1 = Convert.ToInt32(DropDown1.SelectedValue); myObject.Value2 = Convert.ToInt32(CheckBoxList1.SelectedValue) I want to be able to store one instance of the object on the "submit" button click and give the user options to create more instances, by changing selections. Then, I would want to display each object they create in a grid below. How can i do this in an elegant fashion? I was thinking of creating an arraylist of my object, but how would I display that data back in a gridview or something to that effect? Thanks!
