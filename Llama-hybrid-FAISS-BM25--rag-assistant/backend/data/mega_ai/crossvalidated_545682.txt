I would expect that there is a linear relationship between probability of conversion and price (this would certainly be easy to check with collected data). So as price goes up, probability of conversion goes down. Modelling the probability of an event is a classification problem and can be modelled (for example) by logistic regression: \begin{equation} P[conversion] = \frac{1}{1+e^{-(\beta*Price+\alpha)}} \end{equation} One might then expect that the sensitivity to price $\beta$ will depend on other factors such as age. For example, older users may have more money and be less sensitive to changes in price (small $\beta$ ). I would create age categories and learn a different $\beta$ for each category. This relationship can then be used to select the revenue optimising price for a given category.
