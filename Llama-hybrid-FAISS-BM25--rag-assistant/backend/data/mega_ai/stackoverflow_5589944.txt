'git diff' inconsistent between CLI and other clients

I'm trying to get a list of changed/added/deleted/etc. files for a commit in my Git repository. When I run the following in the shell, this is the output: Indragie$ /usr/bin/git diff --name-status 0836 D INPopoverController.h D INPopoverController.m D INPopoverControllerDefines.h D INPopoverWindow.h D INPopoverWindow.m D INPopoverWindowFrame.h D Images/blue_progress_slice.png M Images/next.png M Images/pause.png M Images/play.png M Images/previous.png D Images/progress_left_cap.png When I check the list of changes in Xcode (or any other third party Git client), I see this: Xcode diff http://cl.ly/2i3P3s0m0i3I10110h3E/Screen_Shot_2011-04-07_at_8.59.18_PM.png Obviously these are just excerpts of the larger lists, but the point is that they are not the same at all. I've verified that the SHA1 hash of the commit I'm looking at is the same in both the CLI git and in Xcode. I'm new to git so there might be something fairly obvious I'm doing wrong, but even after pouring over man pages and git tutorials, I can't seem to find where I'm going wrong. Any help is appreciated.
