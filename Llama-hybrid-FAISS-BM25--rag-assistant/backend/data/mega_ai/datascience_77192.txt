Most deep learning frameworks have APIs that are significantly similar to NumPy. I recommend you take a look at PyTorch as it will let you refactor your code reasonably intuitively to make use of your GPU via Cuda. Speaking as someone who has coded a neural network in NumPy, I would highly recommend learning a popular deep learning framework. It will be easier than learning to make your NumPy code run on a GPU (which is in any case a less useful thing to be able to do than to use NN frameworks that already exist).
