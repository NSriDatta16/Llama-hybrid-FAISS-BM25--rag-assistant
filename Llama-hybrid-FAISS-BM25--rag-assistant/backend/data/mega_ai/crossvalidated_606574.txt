Suppose there were two different Best linear unbiased estimators, $\hat\beta_1$ and $\hat\beta_2$ , with (necessarily) the same mean and variance $\sigma^2$ . The average of the two would also be a linear unbiased estimator, and it would be Better. Its variance would be $$(1/2)^2\times (\sigma^2+\sigma^2+2\tau^2)$$ where $\tau^2$ is the covariance of the two. Since the estimators are different (by assumption), the covariance is less than the variance of each estimator. So the variance of the average is less than either component estimator
