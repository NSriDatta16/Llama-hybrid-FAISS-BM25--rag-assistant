CSS - using an image along with an accent line for a paragraph heading

A common, and good looking, typographical effect is a small image, maybe a stylized arrow, some text, and an accent line. Something like this: -> Now this paragraph --------------------------------- Where the "->" is some kind of small graphic, and the "-------" is an accent line, maybe colored. I would like to do this in css, so in a content management system, the author would simply label the line "h3" and the style definition would add the graphic and the accent line. I can put in the graphic, using CSS css that looks like this: hd3 { background-image: url(/image/arrow_button.gif); background-position: left top; background-repeat: norepeat; padding-left: 55px; } but I don't know how to add the following accent line. The accent line should start after the text and continue to the right margin of the page.
