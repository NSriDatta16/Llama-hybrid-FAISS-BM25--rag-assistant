Efficiently retrieve objects with one to many references in Grails using GORM

I'm trying to determine how to find/retrieve/load objects efficiently in terms of a.) minimizing calls to database and b.) keeping the code as elegant/simple as possible (i.e. not writing hql etc.). Assume you have two objects: public class Foo { Bar bar String badge } public class Bar { String name } Each Foo has a bar and a badge. Also assume that all badges are unique within a bar. So if a Foo has a badge "4565" there are no other Foos that have the same badge # AND the same bar. If I have a bar ID, how can I efficiently retrive the Foo w/o first selecting Bar? I know I can do this: Foo.findByBadgeAndBar("4565", Bar.findById("1")) But that seems to cause a select on the Bar table followed by a select on the Foo table. In other words, I need to produce the Grails/Hibernate/GORM equivalent of the following: select * from foo where badge="4565" and bar_id="1"
