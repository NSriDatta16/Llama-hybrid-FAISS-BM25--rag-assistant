I think a little more clarification is needed to understand your requirements. Some things you say are unclear or even conflicting. However, a few general thoughts: If the amount of data in the cache would not be large, I would not bother with local storage--I would just store it in some application-level scope (global variable, application context, etc.). If the application restarts, the cache would have to be pulled from the database fresh (I would imagine that would be desirable anyway). Usually, objects that are cached are read-only (can't be changed by the user). If a user does change an object that would be cached, you would generally want to persist that information to the server/database immediately, so that other clients can get that information. If the server/database holds the "master" cached data, and needs to notify clients in the case of a data change, the silverlight app will likely have to be a subscribed listener to a service of some sort (MSMQ may actually work as a back end). If the updates don't have to be in real time, consider the cache simply refreshing itself on a timer, every 5-10 minutes or so.
