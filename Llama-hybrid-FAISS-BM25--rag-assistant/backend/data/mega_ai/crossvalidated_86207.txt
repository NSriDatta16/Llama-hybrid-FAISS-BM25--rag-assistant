How to construct the feature weight vector (or decision boundary) from a linear SVM classifier with scikit?

I use the following code to train an SVM classifier: clf = svm.SVC(kernel='linear') clf.fit(train_mat, train_labels) It fits the data and saves the info in the clf object. Now I know how theoretically the w vector is constructed in the formula. It is a sum over all support vectors multiplied by their labels and the corresponding alpha values. Problem is, I can't seem to find this info in clf . I have a _coef attribute but I am not sure if it is what I am looking for. Documentation in scikit is simply lacking. I couldn't find the info there. Does anyone know how to do that? I need the w vector to check the weights given to each of the features and see which ones are the most valuable.
