Make sure to visualize your data. Scatter plot grids can be helpful, but also try dimensionality reduction with PCA and MDS. Try to find an explanation for your clusters. For example, you could train a decision tree on your clusters. If the tree has a reasonable accuracy, you can try to analyze it to figure out which features have the largest impact on your clusters. This may be helpful to eventually identify classes you want to have, and prune clusters that are not meaningful or useful.
