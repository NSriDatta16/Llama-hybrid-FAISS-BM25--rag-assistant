PCA and variable contributions to first n dimensions

I am looking at this tutorial: Factoextra R Package: Easy Multivariate Data Analyses and Elegant Visualization Especially the contributions of the variables to the first 2 dimensions: # Contributions of variables to PC1 fviz_contrib(res.pca, choice = "var", axes = 1, top = 10) # Contributions of variables to PC2 fviz_contrib(res.pca, choice = "var", axes = 2, top = 10) Can this be used for feature selection - i.e. take all variables with values above red line? I would not think so, if the first 2 dimensions do not describe much of the variance in the data. Is this correct. However, if the first 2 dimensions describe more than 80% of the variance maybe? Thanks!
