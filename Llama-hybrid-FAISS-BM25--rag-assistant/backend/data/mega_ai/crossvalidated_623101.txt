Simple example where Bayesian > Frequentist (Unambiguously)?

I'm trying to understand the main appeal of Bayesian methods & whether they are indeed capable of offering more than regular frequentist methods. The thing is my impression is that by default the prior should be 'uninformative' (i.e. Objective Bayesian movement). And I've heard doing this gives you similar results to frequentist? But I've also heard that Bayesian can be more sample efficient? Is this true? For example if you have a large prior sample (say a control group's data accumulated across several different research projects), but a small experimental group say P.S. Specifics given in the body of my post are context. But question remains what is in the title.
