What to do with very little training data

What are some popular solutions in dealing with very little training data? Do these solutions rely on generating more data (e.g. bootstrapping, SMOTE, etc.)? Or do they rely on methods that do not really need a lot of training data (e.g. ensemble methods like random forests, etc.)?
