No matching lock-token

According to the Subversion documentation : after the commit is finished, svn status shows that the lock token is no longer present in the working copy. This is the standard behavior of svn commit—it searches the working copy (or list of targets, if you provide such a list) for local modifications and sends all the lock tokens it encounters during this walk to the server as part of the commit transaction. After the commit completes successfully, all of the repository locks that were mentioned are released—even on files that weren't committed. This is meant to discourage users from being sloppy about locking or from holding locks for too long. In trying to ensure this functionality works, I continually get this message when trying to commit a file change that has a lock in my working copy: svn: Cannot verify lock on path '/test/test'; no matching lock-token available Now, I've tested this scenario in two different working copies on Windows, and once on RHEL, and each time got the same error with a fresh checkout and no prior locks on the file. If I unlock the file and then commit, no problem, commits happens. If I use the svn:needs-lock property, same error if try to commit before unlocking the file. I'm pretty sure the error is not occurring on the client side, but on the server side. I thought it could be that the clients are not passing the local authorization token back to the Subversion server. However, I've tried this with three different clients (2 CLI, and Subclipse). Because it fails with three different clients, I'm feeling that the clients are passing the local authorization tokens back to the server. So I'm pretty sure the server is the place I need to solve this, but where?
