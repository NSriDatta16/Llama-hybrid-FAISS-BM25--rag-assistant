URL fragment removed by update panel

My Problem: I use IE8 for testing. I create a simple aspx page(mypage.aspx) having an updatepanel with a button (button1) in it. When page loaded i use javascript to add a fragment to window.location window.location.href = window.location.href + "#myfragment"; //Window address bar will be: http://mydomain.com/mypage.aspx#myfragment Then i click button1, mypage update successfully. But in address bar myfragment is removed //Window address bar will be: http://mydomain.com/mypage.aspx# My Question: What things happened? How can i remain myfragment when click button1? Note: This problem occurs only in IE8, Firefox and google chrome work fine. Thanks for any answer...
