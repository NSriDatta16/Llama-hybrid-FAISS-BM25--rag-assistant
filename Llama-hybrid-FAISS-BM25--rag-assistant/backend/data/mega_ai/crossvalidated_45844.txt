That's exactly how asymptotic results are being used in practice, e.g., in logistic regression. I would probably factor it differently as $$\sqrt{N}\frac{\hat{M}-M}\sigma \overset{d}{\to}\mathcal{N}(0,1)$$ which shows the desired result more immediately, IMO (as mptikas mentioned in the comments, it is not kosher to have $N$ on the RHS of the asymptotic expression). The practical problem with this of course is that $\sigma$ is usually unknown, and needs to be estimated. The result, and the application, would still hold if a $\sqrt{N}$-consistent estimator is plugged in place of $\sigma$. In some applications, getting such an estimator is a non-trivial task, as is the case with say dependent data (time-series, cluster sampling, spatial data). Update : since the asymptotic distribution is the normal rather than Student, a $z$-test is more appropriate. In practice, $t$-tests are often used instead, but coming up with the degrees of freedom is often a challenge. Besides, for most sample statistics, the finite sample asymmetry and bias are greater concerns than heavy tails, and these obviously cannot be corrected by referring the test statistic to the $t$-distribution instead of the standard normal.
