Global arrays can't have the size changed dynamically unless they are a pointer to an array, in which case you can erase them and reallocate them. Perhaps what you're after is an automatically resizing array, like a std::vector. You can see how many letters you have in the array by calling size() on the vector, and you can increase the size of the array by calling resize(). While not the most elegant solution, it might be a bit easier to use for the moment.
