How do I conditionally format a WPF TextBlock?

I have a WPF TextBlock bound to a string. If that string is empty, I want the TextBlock to display a warning message in another colour. This is easy to do in code, I was wondering if there was a elegant WPF pure XAML solution for it? I have investigated Style Triggers, but the syntax doesn't come naturally to me. Thanks!
