Tensors, as defined by the deep learning software are multidimensional arrays , so if you need only to conduct simple (small-scale) mathematical operations and transformations on the data, then TensorFlow is an overkill. But TensorFlow is much more then this, it implements most of the common building bricks for building the deep learning models, it has the state-of-the-art optimization algorithms, it does automatic differentiation out-of-the-box, it supports GPU training, it has high level ( Estimator ), middle level ( Keras ) and low level (core TensorFlow) interfaces depending if you want to program something by hand, or just train a generic model, the probabilistic programming module is developed, there is an ongoing work of building Spark interface for TensorFlow, so it will natively integrate with big data environments, it can be easily integrated in production environment, or the models can be transformed to TensorFlow Light and ran on mobile devices, or translated to JavaScript , and it has many, many more features.
