What is the largest n root transformation I should consider for making a time series stationary?

Currently, I am working with multiple time series and not all of them are stationary. In order to make them stationary I am considering different transformations and checking the augmented dickey fuller test. I have considered $log(x), \sqrt{x}$ , and $x^\frac{1}{3}$ as well as box cox. Some of the transforms have not made my series stationary but higher order roots have such as $\frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{5}, etc$ . My questions are: Should I consider higher order n root transformations for making a series stationary? If yes, then at what point is too high? So far, the highest I have used is $x^\frac{1}{7}$ .
