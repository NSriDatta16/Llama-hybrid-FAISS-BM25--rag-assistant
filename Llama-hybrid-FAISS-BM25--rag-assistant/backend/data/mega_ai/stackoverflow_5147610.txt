If you "want to given someone a set of maven coordinates" it would be the best to put them in a special pom.xml (you have to write them down anywhere). This pom is not the pom of your "main artifact" but has the "main artifact" as dependency. The packaging type can be pom as this project will not create any artifcat itself. Then use the dependency:copy-dependencies solution that you already evaluated and you will get all the dependencies you need. IMHO a elegant and simple solution. I do not know any better.
