There might be an easier way for secure data storage. With iOS 4.0 apple introduced system provided encryption of application documents. This means that the OS is responsible for doing all the encryption and decyryption in a fairly transparent way. Applications that work with sensitive user data can now take advantage of the built-in encryption available on some devices to protect that data. When your application designates a particular file as protected, the system stores that file on-disk in an encrypted format. While the device is locked, the contents of the file are inaccessible to both your application and to any potential intruders. However, when the device is unlocked by the user, a decryption key is created to allow your application to access the file. So only when your app is active, the files can be read back in unencrypted format. But the nice thing is that they are always encrypted on disk. So even if someone jailbreaks the device, or backs it up, the retrieved files are worthless. This was probably introduced to conform to some specific data security standard that is required. I can't find that anywhere though. For more info see the iOS 4.0 release notes .
