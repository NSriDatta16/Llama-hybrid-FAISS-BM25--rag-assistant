Setting user agent in Java httpclient and allow redirects to true

I am trying to set my user agent string in the HttpClient apache object in Java but I cannot find out how to do it. Please help! Also I am trying to enable redirects to true but also cannot find this option within the HttpClient object. Thanks Andy
