Machine Learning: Writing Poems

I'm a student of machine learning, and these days I was trying to learn how to use the TensorFlow library. I've gone through various tutorials and trial&errors with tensorflow, and I thought the best way to learn it for real would be to make use of it in a little project of my own. I've decided that I should attempt to make a program that writes poems. I'm not aiming for top-end quality program; for my first model, I'd be happy with just a string of non-sense words groups together in poem format. The problem is that I'm having problem looking up books or videos about machine learning programs that deal with writing sentence structures. Can you make any suggestions on what I could look for (even google keywords are fine) to get the sample programs and basic knowledge that I need? Thank you.
