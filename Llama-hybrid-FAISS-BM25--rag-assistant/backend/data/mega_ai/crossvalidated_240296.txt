Need Some Advice on How to Plot My Scientific Data

I have a project where I am running water through very small diameter tubes and I am trying to show for this plot that if you double the pressure that you double the flow rate out of these capillaries. The thing is though that I have different diameter tubes that I have tested this relationship for, so I am trying to compare three variables. I have to show that if you double the pressure and keep the diameter constant your flow rate doubles, and I have different diameters to show that this is true. How do I make an elegant graph that compares these three variables?
