mixing javascript and php variables in ajax

I have a pretty basic jQuery ajax thing happening, but I want to mix form data that is retrieved by JS with some PHP variables and have them all sent as part of the ajax GET. Should this work?: var longform = $("input:text").serialize(); $.ajax({ url: 'actions/create.php', data: longform + "domain= &useragent= &ip= &cookieuser= ", Currently, when create.php tries to echo the variables back, they're empty. UPDATE After checking the source as suggested, it comes out like this: data: longform + "&domain=example.com&useragent=Mozilla/5.0
