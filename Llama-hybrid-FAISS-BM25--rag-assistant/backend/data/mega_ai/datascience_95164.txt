Transformer removes heading labels

Question: Is there a way to retain/include headers once they go through a make_column_transformer? My dataframe has the usual columns and rows, but a header is included. Example: When I take the data through a transformer, the column labels are removed and the data is displayed in a scientific format. Example of the first row: This obviously makes it difficult to interpret the features. Is there a way to keep or add labels?
