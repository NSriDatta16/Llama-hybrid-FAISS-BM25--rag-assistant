Jquery Draggable and Stack and sec. CLass?

I have a little problem with the jQuery UI Stack $('.dra').draggable({ addClasses: false, containment: 'window', zIndex: '9999', stack: '.sta'}); The problem is that all DIVs with the class .dra are with stack. But i only want all div with the class .dra and with the second class .sta with stack. or must i say $('.dra .sta').draggable({ addClasses: false, containment: 'window', zIndex: '9999', stack: '.sta'}); $('.dra').draggable({ addClasses: false, containment: 'window', zIndex: '9999'}); i dont understand it. For what is the value after stack: ? Can anybody help me? kind regards Peter
