In the GoF book "Design Patterns : Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" , there is a Case-Study that shows how to employ the patterns. They namely describe the way to use the Composite design pattern for graphical purpose. (Using Glyphs, a glyphs being a graphical component). They base their case-study on a real text/graphical editor called Lexi . Unluckily for you, the code is in DELPHI, not C++. But the code is here: LEXI . However, it is explained among the thourough explanations of the Gang of Four book. You should take a look at the book if the site explanations aren't clear enough.
