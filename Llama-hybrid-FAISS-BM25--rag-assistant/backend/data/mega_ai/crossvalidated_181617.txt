Failure prediction from production line data/ Statistical process control

I'm a research student looking into predicting product defects from on-line time series data. I'm struggling to find exactly which statistics area I should be looking into to create an error prediction model using my data. The response variable is going to be either fail/pass or possibly number of failures in a time period, therefore I was thinking I should look into logistic regression. However the independent variables are time dependent and although there isn't any autocorrelation in the data, errors that do occur tend to occur close together. I've been looking into statistical process control, but haven't really found a journal/book which I've found useful, I need a book/journal which explains how the statistics are calculated and preferably with a real life example. Any help much appreciated.
