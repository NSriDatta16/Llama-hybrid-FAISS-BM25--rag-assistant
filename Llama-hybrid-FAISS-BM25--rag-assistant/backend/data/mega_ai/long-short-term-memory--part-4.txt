18: OpenAI used LSTM trained by policy gradients to beat humans in the complex video game of Dota 2, and to control a human-like robot hand that manipulates physical objects with unprecedented dexterity. 2019: DeepMind used LSTM trained by policy gradients to excel at the complex video game of Starcraft II. History Development Aspects of LSTM were anticipated by "focused back-propagation" (Mozer, 1989), cited by the LSTM paper. Sepp Hochreiter's 1991 German diploma thesis analyzed the vanishing gradient problem and developed principles of the method. His supervisor, Jürgen Schmidhuber, considered the thesis highly significant. An early version of LSTM was published in 1995 in a technical report by Sepp Hochreiter and Jürgen Schmidhuber, then published in the NIPS 1996 conference. The most commonly used reference point for LSTM was published in 1997 in the journal Neural Computation. By introducing Constant Error Carousel (CEC) units, LSTM deals with the vanishing gradient problem. The initial version of LSTM block included cells, input and output gates. (Felix Gers, Jürgen Schmidhuber, and Fred Cummins, 1999) introduced the forget gate (also called "keep gate") into the LSTM architecture in 1999, enabling the LSTM to reset its own state. This is the most commonly used version of LSTM nowadays. (Gers, Schmidhuber, and Cummins, 2000) added peephole connections. Additionally, the output activation function was omitted. Development of variants (Graves, Fernandez, Gomez, and Schmidhuber, 2006) introduce a new error function for LSTM: Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) for simultaneous alignment and recognition of sequences. (Graves, Schmidhuber, 2005) published LSTM with full backpropagation through time and bidirectional LSTM. (Kyunghyun Cho et al., 2014) published a simplified variant of the forget gate LSTM called Gated recurrent unit (GRU). (Rupesh Kumar Srivastava, Klaus Greff, and Schmidhuber, 2015) used LSTM principles to create the Highway network, a feedforward neural network with hundreds of layers, much deeper than previous networks. Concurrently, the ResNet architecture was developed. It is equivalent to an open-gated or gateless highway network. A modern upgrade of LSTM called xLSTM is published by a team led by Sepp Hochreiter (Maximilian et al, 2024). One of the 2 blocks (mLSTM) of the architecture are parallelizable like the Transformer architecture, the other ones (sLSTM) allow state tracking. Applications 2001: Gers and Schmidhuber trained LSTM to learn languages unlearnable by traditional models such as Hidden Markov Models. Hochreiter et al. used LSTM for meta-learning (i.e. learning a learning algorithm). 2004: First successful application of LSTM to speech Alex Graves et al. 2005: Daan Wierstra, Faustino Gomez, and Schmidhuber trained LSTM by neuroevolution without a teacher. Mayer et al. trained LSTM to control robots. 2007: Wierstra, Foerster, Peters, and Schmidhuber trained LSTM by policy gradients for reinforcement learning without a teacher. Hochreiter, Heuesel, and Obermayr applied LSTM to protein homology detection the field of biology. 2009: Justin Bayer et al. introduced neural architecture search for LSTM. 2009: An LSTM trained by CTC won the ICDAR connected handwriting recognition competition. Three such models were submitted by a team led by Alex Graves. One was the most accurate model in the competition and another was the fastest. This was the first time an RNN won international competitions. 2013: Alex Graves, Abdel-rahman Mohamed, and Geoffrey Hinton used LSTM networks as a major component of a network that achieved a record 17.7% phoneme error rate on the classic TIMIT natural speech dataset. 2017: Researchers from Michigan State University, IBM Research, and Cornell University published a study in the Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD) conference. Their time-aware LSTM (T-LSTM) performs better on certain data sets than standard LSTM. See also References Further reading Monner,
