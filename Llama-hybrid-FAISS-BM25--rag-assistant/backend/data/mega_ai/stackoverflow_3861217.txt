I am working on Ubuntu 10.04 and I am using feed-zirra to parse RSS feeds and I have MySQL database. I am trying to parse RSS feeds from Times of India Top Stories . There seems to be problem with the first link, I am sure TOI guys will correct it soon. But anyway, I dont want to face similar error later so thats why I want to ask you guys how to solve this problem. Just look at this and especially look for link CWG: Abhinav Bindra, Gagan Narang win first Gold for India Abhinav Bindra and Gagan Narang on Tuesday bagged Gold for the men's 10 m air rifle pair's event, getting India its first gold in the 19th Commonwealth Games. /cwgarticleshow/6688747.cms /cwgarticleshow/6688747.cms Tue, 05 Oct 2010 04:57:46 GMT The link is /cwgarticleshow/6688747.cms Now, when I click the link, in the view.. its getting routed to http://localhost:3000/cwgarticleshow/6688747.cms instead of http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/cwgarticleshow/6688747.cms And the error I am getting is **Routing Error** No route matches "/cwgarticleshow/6688747.cms" with {:method=>:get} How do I correct this type of Error?
