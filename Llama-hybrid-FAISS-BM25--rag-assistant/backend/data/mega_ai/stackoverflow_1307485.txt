UIControlEventTouchDragOutside An event where a finger is dragged just outside the bounds of the control. UIControlEventTouchDragExit An event where a finger is dragged from within a control to outside its bounds. It sounds like with UIControlEventTouchDragOutside is fired when the user touches just outside the bounds, regardless of whether or not the finger was ever within the bounds. UIControlEventTouchDragExit is only fired when the finger is dragged from within the bounds to outside the bounds. So, UIControlEventTouchDragOutside would be used when resizing a control (an edge tap, then drag), whereas UIControlEventTouchDragExit would be used to move the control around (tap inside and drag).
