You don't want to be doing dimensionality reduction (as suggested in the question comments) here. The problem is that your data are in wide format, and to analyse them with a regression model you need them in long format. At present you appear to have 1 row per patient. What you need is 1 row per aneurysm. You should have columns for Patient ID Aneurysm ID instead of different columns for different aneurysms Aneurysm Location instead of different columns for different aneurysm location Aneurysm Size instead of different columns for the sizes of different aneurysm. The treatment for that particular aneurysm The adverse outcome variable for that particular aneurysm ...and that's about it unless there are other variables not mentioned So to illustrate: PatientID AnID AnLoc AnSize Treat Adverse 1 1 A 2 1 Y 1 2 B 2 1 N 2 1 C 3 1 N 3 1 A 4 2 Y 4 1 C 3 2 N 4 2 D 2 3 Y 4 3 E 3 1 N 5 1 C 3 1 N 6 1 A 2 1 Y 7 1 A 3 2 N 7 2 B 4 2 N [obviously I don't know the details of your data, so obviusly some combinations might not make sense but hopefully you get the idea.] Then you would run a mixed effect model with random intercepts for patient, and aneurysm nested in patient. Adverse ~ Treat + AnSize + AnLoc + (1|PatientID/AnID) If there is only one measurement for each aneurysm then you don't need to include AnID This will estimate the associations of treatment, aneurysm size and location on an adverse outcome. You might also consider inteactions between these variables. If Advserse is binary then it should be a logistic model. However, some care is need to ensure that you don't include mediators on the causal path - for example if location affects treatment, then you don't want to include treatment in the same model because it is a mediator and it will bias the estimate for location. Similarly if size affects treatment you would again not want to include treatment.
