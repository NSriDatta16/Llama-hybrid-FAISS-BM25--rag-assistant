I would recommend consulting the "Handbook of International Large-Scale Assessment: Background, Technical Issues, and Methods of Data Analysis" which was published in 2014 for three relevant chapters and the references therein. Chapter 17 by Laura Stapleton is called "Incorporating Sampling Weights into Single- and Multilevel Analyses", Chapter 18, by Kim, Anderson, and Keller is called "Multilevel Analysis of Assessment Data", and Chapter 21, by Anderson, Kim, and Keller is called "Multilevel Modeling of Categorical Response Variables". All three chapters give examples of how to incorporate design weights into multilevel modeling and address software capabilities. Chapters 21 and 18 also give example strategies for multiple imputation with multilevel data with sampling weights. Since you do a lot of logistic regression (and will likely be doing more if you are interested in estimating propensity scores), chapter 21 will be of particular relevance. The key is to look for a program that uses adaptive quadrature to estimate model parameters; psuedolikelihood approaches tend to perform poorly with categorical outcomes and weights. AFAIK, software options for multilevel logistic regression with design weights that use adaptive quadrature and report robust sandwich standard errors include Mplus, SAS NLMIXED, and gllamm (see StasK's answer).
