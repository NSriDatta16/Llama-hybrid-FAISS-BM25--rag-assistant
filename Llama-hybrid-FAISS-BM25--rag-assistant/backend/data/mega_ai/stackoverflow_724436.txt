You could use a 32 bit integer, and extract information out of it using and- and bitshift operators. With that in place, you could simply use htonl (host-to-network, long). Network byte order is big endian. This won't be as elegant as a bit-field, but at least you'll know what you have and won't have to worry about the compiler padding your structures.
