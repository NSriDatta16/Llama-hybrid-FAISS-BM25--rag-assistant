That's the goal of machine learning! You will not be able to evaluate your predictions until you get labels, however, which can happen a number of ways (e.g., the stock has gone up in price a year from now). This is why it is so important to be honest with your out-of-sample testing. Just insert the predictor variables into your model following the tensorflow documentation or a tutorial. I'll give an example of the math of this using linear regression when we have $x = (1, 2, 3)$ , $y=(1,3,3)$ and want to predict $y$ for $x = 1.5$ . Taking some notational shortcuts, we get the following regression equation. $$ y = \frac{1}{3} + x $$ Evaluate the function at $x = 1.5$ to get the prediction. $$ y(1.5) = \dfrac{1}{3} + 1.5 = \dfrac{11}{6} $$ Your neural network will do the same process, just evaluating on a more complicated function.
