This organization's certificate has been revoked

I have just Installed Intermediate Certificates supplied by Thawtes, and installed their SSL certificate for a test site sat on our network behind a load of firewalls. the dns lookup is an internal one only. I have run a test validation service provided by Thawte locally and it responds as successful. Yet trying to visit the site over https:// says that the organization's certificate has been revoked. If I disable the Online Certificate Status Protocol in firefox I can view my site, but this is obviously not an option. Has anyone else come across this problem? Is it due to me being completely internal and the SSL provider cannot see my site? Need help understanding what is going wrong. This is the output from the checker: test.elife.co.uk is successfully secured by an SSL certificate. The following certificates are correctly installed: ------Certificate 1------ --Issued To-- Organization: test.elife.co.uk Organizational Unit: Domain Validated Organizational Unit 2: Thawte SSL123 certificate Organizational Unit 3: Go to https://www.thawte.com/repository/index.html Common Name: test.elife.co.uk --Issued By-- Organization: Thawte,, Inc.
