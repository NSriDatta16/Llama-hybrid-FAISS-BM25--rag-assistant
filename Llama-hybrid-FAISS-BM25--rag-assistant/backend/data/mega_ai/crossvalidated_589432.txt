Interpret neural network like the linear regression equation such as how much will Y change if we change X1 and keep the other variables fixed

In linear regression, assume we get the following equation : Y = 0.8X1+1.9X2+2.4X3+4X4 . We can interpret the linear equation: Keep the other predictors fix, one unit change in X1 will increase 0.8 units in Y in average. Now, I use the neuralnet package in R and built a neural network model. Then, make a plot like the following picture. From my perspective, all variables start with W such as W11,W21,W31 are the weight that previous variable or neural. The blue line and letters starts with b such as b11,b21,b31 are the bias weight. Ignore the other coefficients I did not notice, just focus on the X1 , can I write the equation of this neural network plot like: Y = W31*W21*W11*X1 + W31*W21*W12*X1 + W31*W21*W13*X1 + W32*W21*W11*X1 + W32*W21*W12*X1 + W32*W21*W13*X1 + W32*W22*W11*X1 + W32*W22*W12*X1 + W32*W22*W13*X1 It looks quite ugly, but what I am curious is can I interpret the formula like the previous linear model ? Such as how Y changes if X1 increases one unit. Or are there any other ways to interpret neural network plot ( neuralnet ) like this?
