SELECT MIN(q1.AvgProjCost) FROM (SELECT DeptNo, AVG(projcost) as AvgProjCost FROM projects, clinicians WHERE clinicians.Clinicianno = projects.Clinicianno GROUP BY DeptNo) q1 EDITED Suppose I Have the following department project costs Department ProjectCost 1 15 1 15 1 15 2 16 2 16 3 17 3 17 4 18 These project Costs would render the following averages Department Average 1 15 2 16 3 17 4 18 The minimum average for each department is still the same result set. EDITED AGAIN If you really must have Minimum Average for each department then this will work SELECT q1.Dept, MIN(q1.AvgProjCost) FROM (SELECT DeptNo, AVG(projcost) as AvgProjCost FROM projects, clinicians WHERE clinicians.Clinicianno = projects.Clinicianno GROUP BY DeptNo) q1 GROUP BY q1.Dept However you will soon realize that this result set is and will always be the same as SELECT DeptNo, AVG(projcost) as AvgProjCost FROM projects, clinicians WHERE clinicians.Clinicianno = projects.Clinicianno GROUP BY DeptNo EDITED Once More To obtain the department with the smallest average project cost SELECT q1.Dept, q1.AvgProjCost FROM (SELECT DeptNo, AVG(projcost) as AvgProjCost FROM projects, clinicians WHERE clinicians.Clinicianno = projects.Clinicianno GROUP BY DeptNo) q1 WHERE rownum = 1 ORDER BY AvgProjCost DESC
