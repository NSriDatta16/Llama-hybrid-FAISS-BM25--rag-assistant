Data preparation for classification models

I am trying to predict user response (binary output 1 or 0) based on several interaction factors. After merging all information by user, my database looks like the table below : ID Interaction_Type Time_Since_Response Frequency Response 1 Email 0-2 months 3 1 1 Email 3-4 months 6 1 1 Email 5-6 months 1 1 1 Phone 5-6 months 1 1 1 Phone 0-2 months 1 1 1 Phone 3-4 months 0 1 2 Phone 5-6 months 2 0 2 Email 3-4 months 6 0 I was thinking of a logistic model or random forest classifier to predict the variable "Response". My question is about my dataframe. Do I have to pivot the table to get one row by individual like below before applying the model? I have 6 interactions type, and 3 categories (time interval) in time_since_Response ID Email[0-2m] Email[3-4m] Email[5-6m] Phone[0-2m] Phone[3-4m] Phone[5-6m] Response 1 3 6 1 1 1 0 1 2 0 0 6 0 0 2 0 What methods do you usually apply with this type of data?
