Where can I find these libraries to install in Ubuntu 8.10?

Here is some information saying some libraries are needed to build OpenCV for programming: -- checking for module 'libunicap' -- package 'libunicap' not found -- checking for module 'libucil' -- package 'libucil' not found -- checking for module 'libv4l1' -- package 'libv4l1' not found I tried to look it up in Synaptic Package Manager but did not find any. Any advice? UPDATE: I am installing OpenCV 2.0 via CMake , following http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/InstallGuide .
