It would be terrible practise to specifically serve a different non-functional page to IE6. For starters, if you're in the UK you're likely to run afoul of the DDA, for seconds (depending on your situation of course) you really don't want to just stop 20-25% of your users using your site. A lot of people are forced into using IE6 at work. Pissing them off unneccesarily doesn't make good business sense. That said, there's no reason to make your site look pixel-perfect. You can detect that they're using IE6 server-side with Request.UserAgent and display an unobtrusive message at the top of your home page (or at the top of every page) letting users know that their browser is very old and you don't support it anymore. Then you can either serve a specific IE6 stylesheet (very cut-down), or if IE6's rendering issues aren't so severe as to make your site unusable, you can just not bother about them. When I'm doing internet-work these days I charge extra to support IE6.
