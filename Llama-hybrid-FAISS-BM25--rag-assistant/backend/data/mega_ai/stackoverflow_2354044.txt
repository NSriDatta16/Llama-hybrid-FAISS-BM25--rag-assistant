is the implementation based on stream or datagram? there are some problem with your operation flow. the server might start to read before client send anything. since client and server are separated, you can imagine them running concurrently. right after your server side "accept" connection request, there might be possibly some handshake overhead occurs or network delays causing server app to execute ahead in time, attempt to extract data but meet with errors (no data received yet). you can try this out by adding sleep in server code after accept connection, where client should have enough time to send the data. another better solution is to make data retrieval cope with empty buffer or asynchronous read.
