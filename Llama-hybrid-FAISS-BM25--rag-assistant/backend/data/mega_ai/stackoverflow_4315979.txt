Handling special entities like & nbsp; , & pound; in HtmlCleaner

I am using HtmlCleaner library for html content extraction. It works fairly but with few limitations. It is not able to handle special characters like &pound or quotes etc. For e.x. for url : http://www.basicelegancefurnishings.co.uk/alaska-3-and-2-seater-sofa-setspan-classukmadespan-p-280.html , On giving xpath to price, It gives me "& pound;" inplace of Â£ Is there any property which we can set in htmlcleaner for handling this or any other solution. Thanks Jitendra
