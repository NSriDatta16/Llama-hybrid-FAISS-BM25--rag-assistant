Here we are :) Short Bio: For the last 4 years, I am working as a Data Scientist in the Game Industry. The last 1.5 year, I am an instructor in a 40-hours "Intro to Data Science" workshop with ML theory and hands-on exercises. We focus mostly on Maths, Python and AzureML. My background is in Mathematics and I have also a MSc Degree in Web and Data Science. In my free time: I was a Senior Editor in a team of 200 editors writing articles for an online game. Also, a pioneer member of the Greek Open Knowledge Chapter, working on Open Data projects. I participated in two book translations to the Greek language. "The Data Science Handbook" and "The Data Journalism Handbook". In addition, I am a co-host of the biggest, monthly "Data" Meetup in my city. Why StackExchange: Stackoverflow was a huge help during my first working years. I felt that I have to give back whatever I could. Now, I am in the Top 10 on Open Data SE and quite involved in Area 51. Data Science SE is always one of my opened browser tabs and I try to answer whatever I can. My answers on the Meta Questions
