For the purposes of statistical tests, this would be considered a sample. For example the average time for group 1 to complete puzzle is $\bar X_1 $ and not $\mu_1$ the population mean. Using a small group (or even large group) to determine effect of alcohol on 'completion time' of puzzle, cannot give you $\mu_1$. The population mean is usually something 'imaginary' (unless we know the exact distribution) often approximated by $\bar X$.
