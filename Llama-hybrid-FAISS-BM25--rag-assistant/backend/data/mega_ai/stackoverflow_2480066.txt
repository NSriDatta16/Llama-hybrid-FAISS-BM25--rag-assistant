I would guess your package is doing something the SQl Server agent deosn't have the rights to do. Often it turns out that the location of file to be imported or the location where the file exported are in directories that are not open to the account that runs the SQL Server Agent. I also agree woth Raj who said you really need to implement logging. You can;t expect to know why something fails six months down the road if you aren't recording the details of waht is happening with the package. SSIS pacakages can be hard to debug anyway, so you need those logs to know where to start looking.
