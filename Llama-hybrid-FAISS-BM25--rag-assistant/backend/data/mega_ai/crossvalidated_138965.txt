Dimension reduction for discrete qualitative and aggregated variables

I know about PCA for multiple dimensions of continuous features but here is a problem I have some trouble to find a method for. I don't have a list of individual countries but rather a discrete classification of countries, and for each line (which I'll call segments ) I have two output variables. Each line can represent one or several countries, as long as they fit all the classifications of this particular line. In case a line represents several countries, then the output variables are total values (in case of a number like total population) or pondered averages (in case of a percentage like employment rate). So my questions are: Does this particular way of organising data have a name? How can I isolate the most influential dimensions for, say, Employment rate? (aka discriminant analysis) How can I perform something similar to PCA with this discrete classification instead of continuous values as dimension values?
