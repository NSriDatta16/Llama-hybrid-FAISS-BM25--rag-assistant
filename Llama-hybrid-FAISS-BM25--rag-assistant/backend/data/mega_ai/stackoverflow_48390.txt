Eclipse spelling engine does not exist

I'm using Eclipse 3.4 (Ganymede) with CDT 5 on Windows. When the integrated spell checker doesn't know some word, it proposes (among others) the option to add the word to a user dictionary. If the user dictionary doesn't exist yet, the spell checker offers then to help configuring it and shows the "General/Editors/Text Editors/Spelling" preference pane. This preference pane however states that "The selected spelling engine does not exist" , but has no control to add or install an engine. How can I put a spelling engine in existence? Update: What solved my problem was to install also the JDT. This solution was brought up on 2008-09-07 and was accepted, but is now missing.
