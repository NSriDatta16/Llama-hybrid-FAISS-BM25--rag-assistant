POST request includes all the elements of the form you submit. So, if you have a form with several submit buttons: then you would get a POST request with request data looking like: ClearDB=Clear%20DB&hostname= every time you submit the form using the "Clear DB" button. Basically, to get the name of the button you pressed to submit the form, you just need to search for the button's name. Another approach is using same name for buttons, but different values: Then you just need to check for the value of the request element you get (in the case above it would be "action"). In Python you would therefore just need to get the value you got via the FieldStorage class indeed, using FieldStorage.getfirst() method.
