So users can drag views around inside a parent view? And when a view changes position, you want to change its place index among the subviews so that the draw order will be correct? You can use -(void)exchangeSubviewAtIndex:(NSInteger)index1 withSubviewAtIndex:(NSInteger)index2 do do this. It won't be enough to just reorder them in you array, since the parent UIView has its own array to keep track of the views. You should create a reorder method where you switch the views around both in your own array and in the parent view. There are functions for checking equality of points, inclusion of points in rects, intersection of rects, etc, but here it just sounds like you want to get the origin.y point and use that to compare which views are further "back" or to the front... As an aside, you might want to look at using CALayers, which have support for setting a z position as well.
