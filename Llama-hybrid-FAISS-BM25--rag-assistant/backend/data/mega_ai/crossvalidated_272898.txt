How does GBM work with a Poisson loss fonction

I’m familiar with Poisson Regression and the concept of GBM (a tree learn from the residual of the previous tree) but I don’t understand how GBM works in the case of a Poisson loss function. Questions: How is the residual transformed before being fit by a tree? Log of the residual? Do we need to apply a transform at the end to get the prediction? Exemple : prediction = exp (average of Y + prediction of the first tree + prediction of the second tree + …)
