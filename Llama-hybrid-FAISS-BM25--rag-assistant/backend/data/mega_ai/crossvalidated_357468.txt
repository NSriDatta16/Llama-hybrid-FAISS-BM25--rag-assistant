AR on Non-Linear Time Serires

Should autoregressive model be able to fit and forecast non-linear time series, for example, a sine curve (by non-linear I mean the data generating process)? I used ar() function in R to automatically select order and perform an AR model on a sine curve of length 1000; then predict another 1000 points: t The result is as follows: Coefficients: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1.2551 -0.0654 -0.0482 -0.0351 -0.0251 -0.0172 -0.0108 8 9 -0.0054 -0.0563 Order selected 9 sigma^2 estimated as 7.645e-05 The prediction (first 1000 real data, last 1000 predictions) looks like: My questions are: Why does AR seem to fit the frequency well? Why does the amplitude shrink over time in the prediction?
