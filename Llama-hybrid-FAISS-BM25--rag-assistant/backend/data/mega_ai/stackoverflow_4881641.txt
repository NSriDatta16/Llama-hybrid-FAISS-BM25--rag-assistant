Can the "Buddies Now" widget be implemented with the standard Android launcher?

The Samsung Galaxy S includes the custom widget "Buddies Now". This widget implements a carousel that can be rotated with a a press-drag. Here's a description of the widget: http://www.phonescoop.com/articles/article.php?a=389&p=2830&g=3054&h=25816 This widget exhibits features not commonly seen in other widgets: animated images and interactivity beyond a simple click. Does this widget take advantage of Samsung's custom launcher (TwLauncher), or is it a standard widget? If it is a standard widget, what API does it use for the animation and interactivity?
