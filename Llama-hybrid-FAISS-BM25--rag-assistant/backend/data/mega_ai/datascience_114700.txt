Denoising with classic CNN has its own limitations because they haven't been created for this purpose. That's why you may have to improve the convolution/deconvolution process or apply other solutions so that you can remove noise or random spots more efficiently. Here are available libraries that could do the job very well: https://github.com/LabForComputationalVision/bias_free_denoising/blob/master/generalization_demo.ipynb https://github.com/JWSoh/DUBD https://github.com/chintan1995/Image-Denoising-using-Deep-Learning
