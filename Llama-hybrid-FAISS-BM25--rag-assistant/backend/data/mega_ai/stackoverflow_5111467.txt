SQL0666 - SQL query exceeds specified time limit or storage limit

Periodically, I get this error message while making a call to a DB2 database using the Odbc connection string. I have tried setting the CommandTimeout of the DbCommand object to multiple values, but I still get the following error. SQL0666 - SQL query exceeds specified time limit or storage limit. Is there a trick to getting this to stop erroring out. It is very odd because the same query sometimes will work and sometimes will timeout. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!
