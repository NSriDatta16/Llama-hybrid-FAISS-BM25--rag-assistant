If you're trying to build the url yourself use urllib.urlencode . It will deal with a lot of the quoting issues for you. Just pass it a dict of the info you want: from urllib import urlencode args = urlencode({'xml': ' As for replacing hostname in the base of your url string, just do what everyone else said and use the %s formatting. The final string could be somthing like: print 'http://%s/Altiris/NS/Agent/GetClientPolicies.aspx?%s' % ('foobar.com', args)
