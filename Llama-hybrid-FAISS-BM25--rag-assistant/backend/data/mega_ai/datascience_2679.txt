The closes thing I know is ConvNetJS : ConvNetJS is a Javascript library for training Deep Learning models (mainly Neural Networks) entirely in your browser. Open a tab and you're training. No software requirements, no compilers, no installations, no GPUs, no sweat. Demos on this site plot weighs and how do they change with time (bear in mind, its many parameters, as practical networks do have a lot of neurons). Moreover, if you are not satisfied with their plotting, there is access to networks parameters and you can plot as you wish (since it is JavaScript).
