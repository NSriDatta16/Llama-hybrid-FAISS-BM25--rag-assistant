You can use a translate transform to position the ellipses as you create them. TranslateTransform transform = new TranslateTransform(); transform.X = X; transform.Y = Y; Ellipse ellipse = new Ellipse(); ellipse.RenderTransform = transform; ... You could store the ellipses in a dictionary with the id as they key for quick and easy retrieval. TranslateTransform transform = data[id].RenderTransform as TranslateTransform; transform.X = newX; transform.Y = newY;
