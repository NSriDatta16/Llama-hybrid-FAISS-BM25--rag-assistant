This is not a repeated measures experiment, since the outcome is not repeated, it is only measured once for each participant. There are various possibilities for analysis: You could build a (logistic) regression model, and build features from the blood pressure measurements. I'm not sure about the best way to do that ... manova (multivariate anova) See T-tests, manova or logistic regression - how to compare two groups? for a comparison!
