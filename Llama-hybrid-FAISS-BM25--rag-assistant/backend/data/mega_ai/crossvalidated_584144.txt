What does it mean when my R^2 for my cross validation vary a lot?

My R^2 values for the cross validation vary from 0.174 to 0.967. What's the reason behind this major difference? Degree-1 polynomial: R^2 for every fold: [0.87593726 0.17452837 0.58873146 0.96734281 0.95324541 0.91276834 0.92310873 0.86275813 0.94933422 0.96215234] Degree-1 polynomial: Average R^2 for all the folds: 0.816990706233325, STD: 0.2388768905829066
