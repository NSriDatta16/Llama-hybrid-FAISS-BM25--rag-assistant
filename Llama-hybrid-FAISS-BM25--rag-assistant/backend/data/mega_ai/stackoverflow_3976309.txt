Instead of changing the path of /admin, you should beef up security elsewhere. First, finding out your site uses Drupal is a piece of cake. Huge companies use Drupal, and don't change their /admin path. Don't use User 1. Most of the time, there is no need for anyone to be using User 1. Even the highest of admins should be given a role, and certain permissions. User 1 should have a complicated long password, changed every (x) number of days or hours, but never actually used. I think there is also a module for this, but I can't remember off the top of my head because I just do this programmatically. logintoboggan.module The Login Toboggan module will display the login form for Access denied pages login_security.module protect_critical_users.module userprotect.module session_limit.module nodeaccess.module Don't let direct access to update.php and cron.php. Create a cronjob to run via shell. -have them direct to forbidden/or a 404 with a search page Use the tools in cpanel/whm or similar. Knock out bad login attempts and such. There are a ton of other ways to beef up security in drupal.
