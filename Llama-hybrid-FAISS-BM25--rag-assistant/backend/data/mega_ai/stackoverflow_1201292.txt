Could you not split the query into batches, and execute each batch separately on a separate connection? SQL server only uses parallelism in a query when it feels like it, and although you can stop it, or even encourage it (a little) by changing the cost threshold for parallelism option to O, but I think its pretty hit and miss. One thing thats worth noting is that it will only decide whether or not to use parallelism at the time that the query is compiled. Also, if the query is compiled at a time when the CPU load is higher, SQL server is less likely to consider parallelism.
