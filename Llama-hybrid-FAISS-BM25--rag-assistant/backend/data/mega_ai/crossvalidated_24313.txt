Multi task learning

I have a dataset where all observations are measured several times and reported outcomes correspond to those measurements. In other words, my set of data points looks like $\{x_i, y_{i_1}, y_{i_2}, ... y_{i_n}\}$ I would like to make a predictive model to predict $y$ from $x$. What should I try to predict? The average of $y_i$? I've heard something about multi task learning, where each observation is considered as $n$ different regression problems and all problems share the same kernel. Can anybody elaborate on this?
