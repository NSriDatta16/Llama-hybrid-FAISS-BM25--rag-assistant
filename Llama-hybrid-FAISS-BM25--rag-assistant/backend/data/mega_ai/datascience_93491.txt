Forecasting with Neural network and understanding which underlying model is favoured

If I have a very large set of data (~ 1TB). How can I use Neural Network on this data to understand which underlying distribution (eg. let's say a Gaussian or a Poissonian with a certain mean, sd) is favoured by the data. At least, can I conclude, if one of the distributions (out of the 2 distributions) is not favoured? hence the main goal was to see, if when forecasting, after learning from this dataset, can I have the knowledge that based on which underlying distribution (or favouring which distribution) the algorithm is predicting.
