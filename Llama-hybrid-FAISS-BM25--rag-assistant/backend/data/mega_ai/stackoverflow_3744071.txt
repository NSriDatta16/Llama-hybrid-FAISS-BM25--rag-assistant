The APC ttl should take care of fragment build up. I usually set it at 7200. I am running it on a small VPS with WordPress and my settings are: apc.enabled=1 apc.shm_segments=3 apc.shm_size=32 apc.ttl=7200 apc.user_ttl=7200 apc.num_files_hint=2048 apc.mmap_file_mask=/tmp/apc.XXXXXX apc.enable_cli=1 apc.max_file_size=10M You will also get a lot more benefit from it by using WordPress's built in object cache and Mark Jaquith wrote a really good drop in plugin that should also help with some of your fragmentation issues when saving or editing a post.
