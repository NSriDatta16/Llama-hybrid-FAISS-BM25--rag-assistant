Feature selection for random Forest using rfcv in R package

I am running randomForest regression. My observation number is 70 and independent variables is 122. For variable selection for the final model, I combined rfcv() function and Importance(randomForest) function. For example, if the model with six variables has lowest OOB error based on rfcv. Then the final model will have the six most importance variable based on Importance function. I wonder that whether my approach is appropriate or not?
