There are two articles that comes to my mind that may help you understand RTF, the first is a RTFTree which can be used to build a complex document and loads it akin to an XML document loading where you have trees/nodes. The other article is about writing your own RTF converter - a parser that can convert a RTF to HTML and vice versa. You will find samples in the code on how to insert a italic formatting and so on. I included these two links to help give you insight into how to use RTF. Begin Edit: I have created a simple rtf document in WordPad as shown here {\rtf1\ansi\ansicpg1252\deff0\deflang6153{\fonttbl{\f0\fswiss\fcharset0 Arial;}} {\*\generator Msftedit 5.41.15.1515;}\viewkind4\uc1\pard\b\f0\fs20 Bold\b0\par \i Italic\i0\par } The RTF document has two lines 'Bold' and 'Italic' with their respective formatting, saved the document and opened it up in another editor, that is what is shown. So something must be missing perhaps a paragraph marker \par wrapped around it. This was done under Windows XP Home's WordPad. End Edit Hope these will be of help and use to you, Best regards, Tom.
