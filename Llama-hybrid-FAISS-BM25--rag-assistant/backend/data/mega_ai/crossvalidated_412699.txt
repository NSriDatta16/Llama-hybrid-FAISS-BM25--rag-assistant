pca gives a new set of variables to us?

did I understand pca correctly? if we have 9 features we call PCA to find corresponding components, then for example we use 2 first PCA, now we have a data set with 2 variables? and they are linear combination of our 9 features? now regression can be done on this 2 variables rather than 9?
