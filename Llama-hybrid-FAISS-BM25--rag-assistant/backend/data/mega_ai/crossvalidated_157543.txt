How Does Kriging Interpolation work?

I am working on a problem in which I need to use Kriging to predict the value of some variables based on some surrounding variables. I want to implement its code by myself. So, I've went through too many documents to understand how it works, but I was so much confused. Generally, I understand that its a weighted average, but I couldn't completely understand the process of calculating the weight then predict the value of a variable. Can anyone please explain to me in simple terms the mathematical aspects of this interpolating methods and how it works?
