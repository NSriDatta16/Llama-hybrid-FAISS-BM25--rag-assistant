@EpiGrad makes some nice points here. I thought I would throw in one extra bit of information. He mentions that power analyses are often optimistic, and you mention that it is often suggested to estimate the effect size you want to capture from a pilot analysis. I just want to make it explicit, that this procedure is known to be biased such that the estimated power will be higher than the true power. There is considerable uncertainty in the estimated effect size based on a pilot study, or even a full study. If the true effect size is larger than the estimate, you will have more power, and if it is smaller, you will have less power, than you believe. However, the rate of change in power is not the same in both directions. Specifically, power diminishes faster as the effect size shrinks than it increases as the effect size expands. In this way, even though the distribution of effect sizes is symmetrical, the distribution of power is not. To compute a more robust estimate of power, compute the full distribution for the effect size and integrate over it. (A quick and dirty approach is to compute a 95% CI for the ES, and get a weighted average of the power at your estimate and at the CI endpoints.)
