Adding some resources here . . . You have to use WPF for that, and probably with some custom controls. For WPF have a look here: Wikipedia MSDN Expression Studio For already made controls you can check: Xceed Infragistics Devexpress There are a lot more out there even a lot of free ones. All the above are commercial but i think they have a few free samples.
