Interpreting Pooled OLS and FE different results

I know there are many similar questions like this one, which I have consulted (e.g Panel Data: Pooled OLS vs. RE vs. FE Effects ; Pooled OLS vs RE and FE ; Difference between OLS and FE ) . Yet I haven't been able to answer my question from this. I have a panel data set of administrative agents pay. I have six years of average monthly pay (thus one observation per year per agent). The panel is unbalanced: some agents are here for 6 years, some only 2 etc. I am trying to understand the difference of pay between agents based on a categorial variable that does not vary over time . I have a couple of control variables (gender, age-categories, admin category etc.) most of which also do not vary over time. So far, I have understood that fixed-effect models get rid of individual characteristics that do not vary over time. So in theory I understand that this should also remove the categorical variable I'm after, as well as gender etc. However my R implementation of the model leaves it and runs the model without a warning. I find this quite confusing. testdf |t|) origageSTRUCTURés 23.87762 54.99487 0.4342 0.6642 origageTransféré 423.91081 65.24857 6.4969 8.706e-11 *** femme -169.78465 26.57132 -6.3898 1.757e-10 *** heures_mens 8.91896 0.27759 32.1300 My problem is that here the variable of interest origageTransféré gets a high and significant coefficient estimated, whereas when I run a pooled OLS mode with the same control variables, I get a non-significant estimate. The Breusch-Pagan Lagrange multiplier Test on the pooled ols regression rejected the null (very significantly). All in all I'm quite confused as what is appropriate in this case.
