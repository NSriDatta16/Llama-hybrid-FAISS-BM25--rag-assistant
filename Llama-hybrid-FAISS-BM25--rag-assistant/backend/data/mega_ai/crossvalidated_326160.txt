Is this a strange relationship between individual and joint p-values?

I have two outcomes with 5 weekly effects for each one that stem from a synthetic cohort analysis. The two tables below show the p-value for each week (for the null that the effect is zero in that week), along with a joint p-value (for the null that all five effects are zero). Outcome 1: Week p-value for each week 1 0.51 2 0.22 3 0.13 4 0.09 5 0.03 Joint p-value: 0.41 Outcome 2: Week p-value for each week 1 0.12 2 0.65 3 0.12 4 0.16 5 0.07 Joint p-value: 0.19 I am little puzzled why the joint p-value for outcome 2 is so low, whereas it is much higher for outcome 1. Does this seem strange? Or am I overthinking things? To give more context, these p-values come from repeating a synthetic cohort analysis on randomly sampled untreated units to get a set of placebo results and then comparing to the results of the actual treated unit(s). The weekly p-values are the proportions of standardized placebo effects that are at least as large as the actual effect in each week. The joint p-value is the proportion of placebos that have a ratio of post-treatment RMSPE over pre-treatment RMSPE at least as large as the average ratio for the treated units. All these effects are standardized by dividing the by the corresponding pre-treatment match quality.
