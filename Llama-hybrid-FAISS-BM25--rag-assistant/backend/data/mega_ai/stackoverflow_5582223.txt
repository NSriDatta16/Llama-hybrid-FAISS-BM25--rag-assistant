My understanding of inclued (after using it several times) is that you will need to have it execute on live code, as opposed to just parsing. This is required for two reasons: that's how it works (it's attaching to those functions in the Zend core to monitor them) that's how it's able to resolve conditional includes (the information it provides is true for the run on which it was executed). Without this it wouldn't be able to understand files loaded by an autoloader, or any sort of conditional processing (such as loading a controller in the average framework).
