Custom Rendering in Bing Silverlight Control

I'm ramping up on a Silverlight 2 project that leverages the Bing Maps control. One thing our UX guys are wondering is whether it is possible to customize the look of the map completely. For example, draw countries as simple outlines with different color interiors. Or draw the ocean as white and countries as black dotted shapes. Does anyone know whether it is possible to achieve this level of customization? The MapMode class looked promising, but it doesn't seem to quite give me what I need. Thanks, Kent
