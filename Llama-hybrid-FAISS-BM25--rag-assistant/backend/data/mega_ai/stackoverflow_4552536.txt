std::aligned_storage just declares a member typedef ( type ). The member typedef type shall be a POD type suitable for use as uninitialized storage for any object whose size is at most Len and whose alignment is a divisor of Align (This is from the latest C++0x draft, N3225, 20.7.6.6 Table 53, but the language in the TR1 specification, N1836, is effectively the same except that in C++0x the Align template parameter has as its default argument the maximum alignment value.) std::aligned_storage doesn't allocate any memory itself. You can create an object of type std::aligned_storage ::type and reinterpret that object as an object of any type that meets the requirements stated above.
