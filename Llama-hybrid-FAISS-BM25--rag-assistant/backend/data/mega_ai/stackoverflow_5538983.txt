I see "Do It Well" as being as much about quality of implementation of a function than about the completeness of a set functions (in your example having rename, as well as create and delete). Do It Well manifests in many ways, some ways of thinking: Behaviour in response to "special" inputs . Example, calculating the mean of some integers: int mean(int[] values) { ... } what does this do if the array has zero elements? If the items total more than MAX_INT? Performance Characteristics . Has sufficient attention been given to behaviour as the data volumes increase? Dependency Failures . If our implementation depends upon other modules or infrastructure what happens when these fail. Example: File System Full, Database Down? Concerning feature creep itself, I think you're correct to indentify a tension here. One thing you might consider: you don't need to implment every feature providing that it's pretty obvious that a feature can be added easily without a complete rewrite.
