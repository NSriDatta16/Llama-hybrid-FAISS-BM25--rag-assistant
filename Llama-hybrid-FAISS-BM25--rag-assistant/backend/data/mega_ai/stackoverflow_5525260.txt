How to use a JavaScript loader like head.js or labjs in Magento

Off the bat Magento comes with more than half a dozen JavaScript libraries which do not help with the already cumbersome load times. Has anybody been able to successfully use a script loader like head.js or labjs with Magento so that they can load asynchronously? I have been trying but can't get it to work. Seems as though the in-line scripts on the pages are firing before the libraries are loaded. I know that head.js has a function like head.ready to tell a script to execute , but there are so many in-line scripts it is not practical to add this to every occurrence in the whole site.
