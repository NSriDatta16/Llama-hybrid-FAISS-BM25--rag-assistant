Silverlight 4 RichTextBox Bind Data using DataContext

I am working with Silverlight 4 and trying to put my test apps multilingual but I am having some trouble when I arrive to the "RichTextBox" control. I am able to bind it properly by doing back-code (c#), but when trying using the "DataContext" attributes I am not able to load it at all. I have created a FormatConverter that return a Block (paragraph) for testing and my code where I have my RichTextBox looks like: I am wondering if there is a way of binding a RichTextBox from the XAML.
