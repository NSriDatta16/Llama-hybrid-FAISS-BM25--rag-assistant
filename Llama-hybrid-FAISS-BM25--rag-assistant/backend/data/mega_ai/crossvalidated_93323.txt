Since your outcome is binary (win/loss), you may want to fit a Logistic regression by including all or a subset of those 6 independent variables and decide which variable is significant based on reported $p$-values. Now there are different methods, to find a reasonable model including: r-squared ($R^2$) sometime called coefficient of determination, Adjustted r-squared, $C_p$ Mallows' statistic, Akaike information criterion ( AIC ), Bayesian information criterion ( BIC ). As said above, you may also try to use some automatic procedures such as (forward selection, backward selection, stepwise regression ) to find a preferred model. However, these methods are not optimal in any sense and don't take into account your knowledge about the independent variables and should be used with care. Some examples of fitting a logistic regression in R have been given here .
