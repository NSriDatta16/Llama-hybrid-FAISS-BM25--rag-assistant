Could I specify the variable influence before building the model?

For most genomic questions, we have ~20k genes as variables and relatively small sample size ~100 samples. We also have two variables which are extremely relevant to our Y. How should I build the model in this situation? One suggestion I got is changing the Random Forest model to select those two important variables with higher probability. I haven't found any existing tool that I can prespecify the probability to select columns. I guess I need to change the code to get it work. Is there any other suggestion? Build a model with those two important variables first and then integrate the gene expression data in the second layer? Thanks
