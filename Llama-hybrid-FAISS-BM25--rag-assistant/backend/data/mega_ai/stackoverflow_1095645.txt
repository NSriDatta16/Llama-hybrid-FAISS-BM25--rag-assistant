MySQL 5: Does it matter what order my GROUP BY fields are in?

Peeps, I have a few aggregate/calculated fields in my MySQL query. My GROUP BY clause is dynamically generated, depending on what options a user selects in a web form. Curious if the order of fields listed in the GROUP BY clause can have any impact on the calculations (things like SUMs, AVERAGEs, etc) Thanks!
