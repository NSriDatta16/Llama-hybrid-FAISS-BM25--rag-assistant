I was browsing a shopping website, and when I typed in my email address, I noticed the address entry page just had in the URL "?nOrderID=301". Alight then. I change that number to 99, and guess what? I get the name, address and phone number of some lady who lives in Bend, OR . I did email the site admin a few weeks ago, and he didn't sound very happy about it, but it still hasn't been fixed... That, and for a while the company's I work for entire employee information list (everything about the employee from address to SSN to pay) was stored in a password protected Access database. Use your favorite search engine and look up how to recover access database passwords. Yep. Drag and drop it into this , and you get the password. A five letter dictionary word.
