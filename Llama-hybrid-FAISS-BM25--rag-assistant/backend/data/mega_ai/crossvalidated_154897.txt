Alex Graves' Generating sequences with Recurrent Neural Networks uses recurrent networks and Long short term memory Cells to predict text and do handwriting synthesis. Andrej Karpathy has written a blog about generating character level sequences from scratch. He uses RNNs in his tutorial. For more examples, you should look at- Hochreiter, S., & Schmidhuber, J. (1997). Long short-term memory. Neural computation, 9(8), 1735-1780.
