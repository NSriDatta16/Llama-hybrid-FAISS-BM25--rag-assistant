How to prevent window resizing temporarily?

I have a window which can be resized, but there are some situations when resizing is not possible because of the application state. Is there a way to prevent resizing the window temporarily? I want to disable resizing by all means available to the users, which include window menu, dragging edges by mouse, user initiated window tiling performed by OS - and perhaps some other I am not aware of?
