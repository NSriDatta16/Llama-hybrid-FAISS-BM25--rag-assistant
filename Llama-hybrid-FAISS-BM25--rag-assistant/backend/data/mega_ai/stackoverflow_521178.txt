Except the Ant you mentioned and the scarry make/autotools, the mainstream tools are: SCons Jam CMake Maven I use SCons, because it is python based, well-funded and elegant. Jam seems to be the most pragmatic one. I don't know too much about CMake. Maven may be the choice for you as it is Java centric and more high level than Ant. More you can find at wikipedia: List of built tools
