Yes, you can defer loading of the images, though you might want to include the regular HTML version inside a tag so that simpler user agents/spiders can see your page. Another technique is to load the images from a number of subdomains, since browsers typically only open a small number of connections to each domain. For example, if you site is on foo.com, load your static images from a.foo.com, b.foo.com and c.foo.com
