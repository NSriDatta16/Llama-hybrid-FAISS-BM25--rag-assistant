The basic process is to accumulate a number of examples of each letter to be identified, pre-process the raw data, train a collection of candidate models and choose a final model based on test performance on a separate, holdout set of data. The nature of the pre-processing will depend on the data you collect. If it is "connect the dots" pen movement data, then it may be simplest to divide the image into regions, and summarize by the number of dots per region. If, instead, you are recording a raster image, other pre-processing would be useful, such as simple statistics and vertical and horizontal projection profiles (row and column averages). "Dr. Dobb's Journal" ran a handprinting recognition contest some years ago (using electronic ink data).
