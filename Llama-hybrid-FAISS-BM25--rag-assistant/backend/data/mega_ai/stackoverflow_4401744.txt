I'm not seeing anything of obvious use like an emulator console command. From the host, you could perhaps inject the F11/F12 into the emulator using Xtest or some win32 code (and possibly determine the current state by reading the window geometry). If the test logic is running in the emulator you could tcp out to something listening on a port on the host which would appear as 10.0.2.2 from the emulator and ask it to inject that key. But this seems inelegant. Rebuilding the emulator to add a console command would be a little better.
