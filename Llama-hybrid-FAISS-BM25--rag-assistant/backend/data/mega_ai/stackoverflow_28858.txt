Coolest C# LINQ/Lambdas trick you've ever pulled?

Saw a post about hidden features in C# but not a lot of people have written linq/lambdas example so... I wonder... What's the coolest (as in the most elegant) use of the C# LINQ and/or Lambdas/anonymous delegates you have ever saw/written? Bonus if it has went into production too!
