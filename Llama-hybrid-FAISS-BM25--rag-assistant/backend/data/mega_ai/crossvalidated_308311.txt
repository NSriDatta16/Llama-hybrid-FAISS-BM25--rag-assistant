How to use ada boosting as an ensemble method in R?

I am trying to learn ensemble methods and came across that ada-boosting can be built on top of the ordinary machine learning methods such as Random forest. the method can use the misclassified data in training set to build more accurate classification models. However, I searched online but I couldn't find answers for the implementation. I am wondering how to build a ada-boosting on top of a random forest for a classification problem to minimize the errors? let's just say I have a training set(df): Train test set(df): Test and a number of features called: Feature. and the classifier is called: Outcome (Train$Outcome) my normal model would be(assuming using caret package): mymodel_rf Then how to move forward? to build the ada-boosting methods using the outcome of this?
