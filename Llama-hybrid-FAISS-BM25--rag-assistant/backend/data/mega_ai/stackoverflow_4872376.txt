Using web sql database

I am creating a website based on rails which uses a database based on mysql. I want my website to be available offline. For that I have to store the database on client's machine. I have the option on Web storage, Web sql database, Indexed DB. I have decided to use Wed sql database which is implemented using SQLite. I want the two database to be synchronized whenever the user is online. Please let me know how to make this possible
