You could create an .eml file and open it which should give you the effect you want as long as there is any email client registered in the system to handle files with this extension. I'm sure this is not as universal as the mailto: scheme but if mailto: does not work for you I think this could be the second best option to try. From http://www.coolutils.com/Formats/EML Since EML files are created to comply with the industry RFC 822 standard, they can be used with most e-mail clients, servers and applications. Besides the Microsoft Outlook Express, EML files can be opened using most e-mail clients, such as Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Entourage, Mozilla Thunderbird, Apple Mail, and IncrediMail. Side note When I click 'E-mail' in Picasa I get dialog where I can choose which application (Thunderbird or Google Mail) I want to send email with. This means Picasa knows specific email client being used to send email and can use custom method, specific to chosen email client, to send email. This is of course just speculation but it might be that Picasa makes user to choose email client because there's no generic way to do what you ask about.
