The bar charts which you present do seem to show interaction. Just looking at the 3 month data the patterns for women with and without WA seem very similar in contrast to the men where the patterns are different with and without WA and different from the women's pattern. You ask whether you are fitting the interaction correctly. What you have done is something which I sometimes advise people to do when they cannot understand their output but it is not the canonical way. I do not use SPSS myself but there must be a way of specifying interaction directly so you can see the two-way and three-way interaction. I have found in the past that typing into your favourite search engine UCLA followed by the name of what you want to do in your case logistic regression interaction followed by the name of your favourite statistical software in your case SPSS usually find a very helpful page on their web site. Try it and see what happens.
