No, not automatically. There are some tools however (called "tallow" for Wix" or "heat" for Wix3) that will scan a directory and create a Wix fragment (a separate WiX *.wxs file) for you. You can then compile that "filelist.wxs" file (or whatever you call it) into your WiX install. See this page for the WiX3 heat documentation and there should also be a WiX2 equivalent for tallow on that site. Marc
