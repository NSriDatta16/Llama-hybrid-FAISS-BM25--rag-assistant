Don't implement your own authentication. Mark the opening page as authentication required (ie "login: required" in the app.yaml) and then when they hit the front opening page they'll be be asked to authenticate before they even see your Flash/Flex app, or if they're already authenticated then they'll go straight into your app. This avoids your Flash -> HTML -> Flash issue and lets you leverage the in-built proper authentication (my app keeps a table of user settings and permissions in the datastore but simply uses the GAE authenticated current user identity as a key)
