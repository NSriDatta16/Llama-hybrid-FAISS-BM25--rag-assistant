Is there a standardized way to do data analysis?

Is there a standard way to do data analysis? So for example, something like this: 1. Data mining 2. Data cleaning 3. xx 4. Data and result interpretations I ask this because I'd like to do it for a paper which analyses a model of Data Science and, therefore, a common method would be appreciated. For a Literature Review, its f.e. (Transfield et. al 2003). I actually could not find any reliable source, neither an approach to do it standardized.
