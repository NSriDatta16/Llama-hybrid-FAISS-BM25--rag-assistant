There's no need to migrate. You can start using YUI 3 right along side YUI 2, and I encourage you to do so. I'm very impressed with the ideas and architecture behind YUI 3. For example how YUI 3 normalizes node and event handling and how custom events are handled like native events. The modularity of the library not only makes it easier to use but promotes the writing of more modular code yourself, which is a good thing. Take a look at Eric's introduction video and all the other YUI 3 videos at the YUI Theater to see more reasons to make the switch.
