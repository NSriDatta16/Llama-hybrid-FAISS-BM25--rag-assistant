You can associate the right semantic to each letter, start with the definition of the semantic. Build your model from scratch, use rigor to moove on forward. At this point you have the semantic of letter but which is the semantic of a word ? Can we reduce it to something more dense ? I was jocking but not :) The question is, how can you categorise data ? You have to put rules/limits to define something. If you want your work works for a mean interpretation, thus use the mean meaning of each letter/word/sentance/pararagraph. You can make disjonctions, for example, good(0) bad(1) => lucky = 0 , unlucky = 1 But you can say that be lucky for a moment is be unlucky later thus lucky = 1 Thus you have to put hard limits and build on it, you have 2 options, look backward or moove forward ! With the hope to be helpful !
