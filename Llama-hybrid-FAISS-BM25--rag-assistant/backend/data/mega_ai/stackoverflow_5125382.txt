See set-fill-prefix (bound to C-x . by default). In brief, move the point to the end of the fill-prefix ("Foo> " in your case) and press C-x . ; subsequent fill-paragraph ( M-q ) will have the desired effect. Edit(2011-02-27): It works for me in text-mode, without any customization (i.e., I started emacs with "emacs -Q"). After C-x . , can you check if the fill-prefix is set correctly? Pressing C-h v fill-prefix should show its value as the string "Foo> ".
