While one typically things of rejection sampling when considering Monte Carlo, Markov Chain Monte Carlo allows one to explore a multi-dimensional parameter space more efficiently than with a grid (or rejection sampling for that matter). How MCMC can be used for integration is clearly stated in this tutorial- http://bioinformatics.med.utah.edu/~alun/teach/stats/week09.pdf
