How critical is positive/negative example ratio for training LR model as probability estimator?

Is it correct to assume that when we train Logistic Regression as probability estimator, then the ratio of examples in training data with Label 1 and 0 is absolutely critical and will be determining factor at least for mean of probabilities produced as an estimate.
