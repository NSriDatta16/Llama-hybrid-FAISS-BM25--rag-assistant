Hudson/Jenkins: Buckminster emma: How to exclude packages

I use Jenkins and Buckminster for rcp app for CI and this works like a charme. The only problem I have is that the buckminster emma task does the code coverage for ALL packages in the checked-out workspace. I would like to specify an exclude filter as this is described for the ant task but did not get it working. The buckminster emma help command didn't helped me neither. I have several plugins in my workspace, the unit tests are specified for my own packages. But there is one plugin including source files which I do not want emma to take into account for code coverage as this is an external package. My JUnittests also do not cover this package. How do I achieve this to exclude this package/classes in the one plugin? Example: plugin A (external) plugin B (own) plugin C (containing unit tests) The commands I use is the following: importtargetdefinition -A '${WORKSPACE}/de.plugin.site/plugin.target' import '${WORKSPACE}/de.plugin.site/site.cquery' build perform -D target.os=* -D target.ws=* -D target.arch=* de.plugin.site#site.p2 perform -D target.os=win32 -D target.ws=win32 -D target.arch=x86 de.plugin.site#create.product.zip emma -l '/de.plugin.test/AllBuckminsterTests.launch' -o '${WORKSPACE}output/junit_result.xml' --xml '${WORKSPACE}/output/coverage_report.xml' --flatXML ` I tried the parameter --define 'filter=-de.external.*' given in the buckminster emma help but without success. Any help would be great!
