CBOW and Skipgram are alternative model choices, the only difference is the loss function. Call it a neural network if you like, but both models are really just a pretty simple loss function involving two matrices of trainable parameters (each with one vector per word). Once trained, one matrix is usually dropped and the other gives the "word embeddings". There are certainly not multiple neural networks. The top part of the diagram is pre-processing of the text.
