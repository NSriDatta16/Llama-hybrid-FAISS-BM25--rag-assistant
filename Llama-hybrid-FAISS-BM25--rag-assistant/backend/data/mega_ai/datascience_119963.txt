Evaluation parameter in knn

I am using KNN for a regression task It's like that: 1- I normalized the data 2- I calculated the distance of the new data with the previous data (Euclidean distance) 3 - I choose k nearest neighbors 4- I calculated the appropriate weight for the distance of each neighbor 5- value= I calculated the dot product of the distances & weights (which gives a specific number) 6- I evaluate the result of this value with the normalized average of each data (threshold ) to see how far or close it is from this value. example: threshold = ( sum_of_featur1_normal/N + sum_of_featur2_normal/N + sum_of_featur3_normal/N +...) /number_of_features Percentage change= |threshold -value| / threshold 7- and By checking the Percentage change, I estimate how close we were to the desired state Now my question is whether this method of using the average value mentioned in step 6 is correct or not and do you have a better suggestion?
