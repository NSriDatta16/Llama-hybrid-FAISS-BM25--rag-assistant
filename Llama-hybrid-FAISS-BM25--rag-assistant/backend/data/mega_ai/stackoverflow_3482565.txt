I will say that your document semantics are quite vague. You probably don't need to use STRONG inside your heading - it's conceivable that you really mean to emphasize the thought expressed in it, but I suspect that you only want the heading to appear bolder. Use CSS to achieve that, as in: h4 {font-weight:bold; font-size: 14em;} . It's also conceivable that your page makes the most sense with the navigation starting at the fourth level of some topic, but it's highly unlikely; in the vast majority of cases, the navigation would exists higher up - under h1 or h2. Your navigation itself would be more coherent if it was an unordered list. Home About Us ... This also has the advantage of allowing you to style the navigation elements both as a set and individually. You probably don't need to be wrapping your elements in all those divs. Most elements in HTML are containers - headings, lists, paragraphs, just about everything can be styled - including positioning and moving - by itself. For instance, one means of positioning the navigation list to the right of the h4 would be to style the h4 with "display:inline", or "float:left", which would bring the following element (the list) onto the same line. There's a lot of different ways to go about that kind of positioning, and it's not even clear that this is what you're after. Clarify what you mean; and it would help if you posted whatever CSS or JavaScript you're using.
