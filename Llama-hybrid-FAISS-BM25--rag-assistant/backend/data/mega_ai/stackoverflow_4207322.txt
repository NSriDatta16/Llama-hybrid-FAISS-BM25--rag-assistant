How to get `File` reference to external disk?

I would like to get in my file browser File reference to external disk not SD Card. I mean I know that there is method Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(); But to my knowledge this will get reference to SD Card. But how to get external disk (say kind of USB storage attached to Android device)? You know that device can have both SD card and external USB stick attached to them.
