How to explain BSTS models to non stats person?

I am using BSTS for building time series models. I am using exogenous variables also. BSTS stands for Bayesian structural time series. While, I am mostly not sure how bsts works e.g. how it picks trend, seasonality and coefficient for exogenous variables. I know the MCMC part. But not able to connect it with BSTS . This means that I am not sure how BSTS uses MCMC in estimating trend, seasonality and variable coefficients. How BSTS uses MCMC during the forecast phase? Is there some easy to understand explantion for understanding the working of BSTS? Any explanation will help.
