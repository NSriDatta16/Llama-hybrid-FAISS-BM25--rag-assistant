You are trying to clone using the git protocol. The git protocol runs on TCP port 9418 by default, and you are cloning arago-project.org. Therefore, we'd expect to see a connection to IP address 184.73.161.183 on port 9418. However, your error message reports an error to 150.229.12.128 port 8080. This is likely some sort of proxy running on www.csiro.au. You'll have to investigate things on your end to see if you can avoid that proxy. If you can't, perhaps you can clone over HTTP. It's not as efficient as the git protocol, but if should get the job done. Just run: git clone http://arago-project.org/git/arago.git
