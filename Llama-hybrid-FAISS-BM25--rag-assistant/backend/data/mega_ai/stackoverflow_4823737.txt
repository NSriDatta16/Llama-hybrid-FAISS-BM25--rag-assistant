In SQL Dividing a Value by its mean

I am trying to divide a calculated field (in the example it is called CALC_TIPS) by the mean for that calculated field given a certain COMM_TYPE_ID. With this query I am able to extract the AVG for each COMM_TYPE_ID. SELECT AVG(CALC_TIPS), COMM_TYPE_ID FROM (SELECT tips_amount/COMMUNICATIONS_ID AS CALC_TIPS, COMM_TYPE_ID FROM consumer_action_log) AS cal GROUP BY COMM_TYPE_ID; How would I then go back and divide each value in the CALC_TIPS field by the average for its COMM_TYPE_ID? I am currently at a loss. Thanks in advance! Note: I am working with MySQL Also Note: I know the subquery is not necessary. I am using this query as a proxy for a more complicated query I have to do the same thing with.
