Add the following line to your loading code: image.CacheOption = BitmapCacheOption.OnLoad; This will load open the file, read it into memory, and close it all during image.EndInit . The default of BitmapCacheOption.Default has the odd behavior of opening the file, reading it into memory, but not yet closing it during image.EndInit .
