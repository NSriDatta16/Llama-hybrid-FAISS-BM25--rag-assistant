When applying PCA to reduce the number of variables in a regression model, you would typically use the first few components with large eigenvalues as they explain the majority of the variance in the data. In your case, the first component appears to have strong patterns for all variables, but it's still important to consider the second and third components as they might also contain valuable information. To avoid collinearity, you could use the first few components as your new independent variables in the regression model instead of the original variables. This is because the components are orthogonal and uncorrelated, which helps to reduce the risk of multicollinearity. Additionally, you could consider interpreting the factor loadings for each variable to see how much of each variable's variance is explained by each component. This can help you determine which variables are contributing the most to the first component and if there are any outliers that might affect your regression results. Finally, it's always a good idea to visualize the data and the results of the PCA to gain a better understanding of the relationships between the variables and components.
