The last example you posted(w/o -Djavax...) works because the META-INF/services directory contains a file named java.xml.transform.TransformerFactory with the content net.sf.saxon.TransformerFactoryImpl The reason using java -cp lib/saxon9.jar;myjar.jar works and java -cp lib/saxon9.jar -jar myjar.jar doesn't is that using the -jar option tells java(w).exe to ignore the rest of the command line and pull everything (classpath included) from the jar's manifest file. If you put saxon9.jar in your jar manifest's classpath it should work. Manifest-Version: 1.0 Main-Class: net.my.MainClass Class-Path: lib/saxon9.jar
