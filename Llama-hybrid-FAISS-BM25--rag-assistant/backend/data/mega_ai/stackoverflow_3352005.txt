jspc-maven-plugin - inconsistent genereated class directory

I have a web-app with the configuration below (inherited from a parent's pluginManagement). JSPC precompiles my JSPs just fine but there is some really weird behaviour: In my web-app, if I run of mvn clean install , the compiled JSP class gets placed in target/classes just like I want. If I then run mvn install without cleaning, the compiled JSP is placed alongside the JSP itself in target/jsp-source/jsp Result is that on a non-clean run, it's the old version of the JSP class that gets included in the WAR. Anyone know why this might be happening? org.codehaus.mojo jspc-maven-plugin 1.4.6 jspc compile &lt;!-- [INSERT JSPC FRAGMENT HERE] --&gt; org.codehaus.mojo.jspc jspc-compiler-tomcat6 2.0-alpha-3 Thanks Gary
