Zend form and Zend filter HtmlEntities

I have a registration form with a few fields. One of them looks like this: $first_name = new Zend_Form_Element_Text('first_name'); $first_name ->setLabel("First name") ->setRequired(true) ->addFilter(new Zend_Filter_HtmlEntities()); I use the same form for editing user's details. The problem is with the Zend_filter_HtmlEntities. It does the job when I send the form's data to the database, it replaces html special chars with their alternatives. However, when I initialise this form and give it default values from a database record, Zend_filter_HtmlEntities filters those values again and I get some garbage in my input fields. For example, in first name input field, instead of Name, I get &amp;lt;b&amp;gt; Name Which means that when the form is rendered with default values, element filters are applied again and Is there an elegant solution to this problem, apart from reformatting the data before it gets passed to the form?
