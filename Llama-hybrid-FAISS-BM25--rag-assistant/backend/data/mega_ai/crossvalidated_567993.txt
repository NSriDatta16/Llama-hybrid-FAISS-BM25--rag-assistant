If you actually know the machine state - on or off, this is an important input and can be solved as a regression model, or more specifically a control model. I don't know much about strain models, but the curves remind me of some of the physical models for circuits, like the Hodgkin Huxley equations . Or more generally, you can estimate the first order differential equation by regressing the $Y_i$ on the $X_i$ , $X_{i-1}$ , and $Y_{i-1}$ where $X_i$ is the machine state at time $i$ (on, off) and $Y_i$ is the amplitude (or whatever) on your y-axis in the graph of the time series. With a known physical model, you can calculate the residuals, and easily use clustering or other methods to identify these abnormal periods. For instance, a simple boxcar filter can be used to identify segments of time where the average residual exceeds a certain threshold, identified using classifier development techniques.
