A discrete-time survival model with a single event type (even if repeated) can be modeled as a binomial regression with data as you seem to have already, in a person-period format. That is, you have one row of data for each individual at risk during each time period, with each row indicating the corresponding individual, the time period, the covariate values in effect during the period, and an indicator of whether or not the event happened during that period. In that format, there simply are no data values for an individual after the last observation, handling censoring as in other survival models and posing no problems so long as censoring in uninformative. Capturing the relationship between years_since_entering and outcome is a matter of how you choose to model that predictor. If there are only a few values of years_since_entering covering all cases, you might treat that as a multi-level categorical predictor and get a separate coefficient for each year. That's analogous to what you would get with a Cox model, in which the baseline hazard over time is zero between event times and can take arbitrary positive values at each event time. If you have many values of years_since_entering and wish to model it as a numeric predictor, you should use a flexible modeling strategy like a regression spline. If you just include it as a numeric predictor the usual way you are imposing, in a logistic regression model, a strictly linear association between that variable and the log-odds of outcome. That's not likely to hold. There might be some advantage to using a complementary log-log link in your binomial regression instead of the usual logistic link, as that directly represents what you would get in a proportional-hazards model with times grouped like this. You can then incorporate the intra-individual and intra-country considerations as random effects, in principle including things like random "slopes" for covariates if there are enough data (probably only on an among-country rather than an among-individual level). If there was at most one event possible per individual you wouldn't have to include random effects per individual, but in your situation that would be important, presumably as a random intercept. For an individual with more than 1 coup attempt, you also need to think about whether and how to incorporate the prior coup attempt into the model; otherwise, you assume independence among coup attempts on the same individual, which seems unlikely.
