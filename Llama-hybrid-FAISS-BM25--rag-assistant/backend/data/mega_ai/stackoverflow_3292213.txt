Since you're already using jQuery, why not use jQuery UI's draggable component? This way, you don't have to deal with all the mouse down calculations. I switched your site's code to use jQuery UI's draggable functionality and it was pretty quick and required a lot less code. Here's the code I used: jQuery Drag and drop #dv { position: absolute; cursor: move; } $(document).ready(function() { $("#dv").draggable({ cursor: 'crosshair' }); }); Hope this helps!!
