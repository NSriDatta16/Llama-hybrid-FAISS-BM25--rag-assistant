How do machine learning algorithms handle classification labels?

I am working on a domain adaptation problem, where the default is a classification problem. I have worked exclusively with regression problems until now, so I am kind of thrown for a loop when it comes to understanding how ML algorithms handle the labels in classification problems. In regression, we use MSE loss with the output from our CNN and compare with the numeric label, how does this work in classification problems? The model outputs an array of numbers, so how cross entropy, and its variants, compare this array with a string label such as 'car', or 'unhealthy'. Is there a specific call to add to my CNN output to make this make sense? For reference, i am trying to classify images into 3 categories.
