Making a qqplot in R for functions

The question is: given that I have a data set and a theoretical cumulative distribution defined as a function, how can I make a qqplot to compare them? I cooked up a solution as follows: I chose a domain for the empirical distribution and evaluated it over those points, obtaining an image. Then, I constructed inverses of this image under the theoretical distribution, using a kind of Newton-Raphson iteration. I only had to plot the result against the initial domain. This works practically. But I feel there has to be a better way. EDIT: I reformulated my question and I wanted to signal that I have in the meantime found a more elegant way to apply my 'cooking method' in that I found that I could more efficiently compute the inverse by using the function uniroot of the stats library. This in effect does the iteration procedure for me, in a much more efficient way than I could program myself. Nevertheless, I'm still looking for a more compact approach. Maybe a variant on qqplot that does all this directly. In a sense, what I'd like to have is this qqplot(data,distribution=function(x) {...} );
