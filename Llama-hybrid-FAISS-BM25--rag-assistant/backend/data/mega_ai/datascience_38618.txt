Time series on syslogs

Is time series model suitable for network syslogs considering the fact the messages are sequential and the messages are outputted as a result of dependency between themselves which can range from normal notifications to alarms if there are. Can the state of the art models like ARIMA be applied ? What kind of questions can be answered with applying time series models on syslogs ?
