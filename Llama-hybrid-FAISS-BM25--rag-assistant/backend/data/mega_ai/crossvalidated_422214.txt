I'm not sure that your approach would give a valid $IRR$ approximation. First, you would be "looking into the future" to determine the person-time at risk through this approach, since you know cases/controls. Generally speaking, looking into the future like that causes all sorts of problems. Second, there is a stipulation to the rare-disease assumption, and that is that every strata is rare (generally defined as 10%). That means each strata of month/year (along with any other variables you stratify by) would need to satisfy the assumption. Third, if the rare-disease assumption is met, then the $RR$ will approximate the $IRR$ following from $RR \le IRR \le OR$ when $RR \ge 1$ . Instead of the above approach, I would recommend revising the control selection procedure since you have a nested case-control study. Depending on how controls are selected, the case-control $OR$ (abbreviated $ccOR$ hereafter) can approximate different cohort measures. There are three approaches I will briefly detail; case-cohort, density, and cumulative control sampling. ( note: case-cohort and density sampling require careful determination of what the start time is) For case-cohort sampling, controls are sampled from baseline of the cohort study irrespective of later case status . Under this scenario $ccOR$ is the cohort $RR$ For density sampling (this is the one you will want to use), controls are selected at every time point when a case occurs, irrespective of later case status . As an example, consider case-1 occurs at $t=0.5$ . From all individuals who are not cases at $t \le 5$ , you randomly select a control from that group. In this way, the control selection mimics person-time in the cohort study, and $ccOR$ approximates the $IRR$ Lastly, is cumulative sampling where controls are selected at the final follow-up time, where controls cannot be cases. In this scenario, the $ccOR$ approximates the cohort $OR$ , which under the rare disease assumption the cohort $OR$ approximates the cohort $RR$ Finally, based on the matching procedure you would need to use conditional logistic regression. However, I would forgo matching since it will not necessarily improve efficiency and you will still need to include the matching criteria in your regression model despite matching. I would skip matching and directly include month/year of entry in the conditional logistic model Sources / Further Reading Case-control selection: Modern Epidemiology 3rd Edition pg 121-126 Matching in case-control: Pearce 2016 , Mansournia 2018
