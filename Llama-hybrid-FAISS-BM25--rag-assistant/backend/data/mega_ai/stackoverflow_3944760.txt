You'll need to do a couple of things differently in order to work offline. First, you'll need to cache a list of projects. This way, the user doesn't have to go online to get the project list - you can pull it from your local cache when the user is offline. Secondly, you'll need to save your timing results locally. Once you go online again, you can update the server will all of the historic timing data. This just requires saving the information locally. You can choose to save it anywhere you wish, and even a simple XML file would suffice for the information you're saving, since it's simple - just a project + a timespan. It sounds like this is a timing application for business tracking purposes, in which case you'll want to prevent the user from easily changing the data. Personally, I would probably save this in Isolated Storage , and potentially encrypt it.
