People who do Bayes network say it's best, could not have any advice on NN I doubt any statement regarding the performance of the model can be reliable as long as they have not been tested against the data. In your case, I would consider two factors to make my choice. Feasibility 10k examples with around 20-30 features It is not a big amount of data. On a very large scale, neural network still have a good (low) training time. Here, you should be able to run both models. Interpretable model Bayes network will provide you nice visualization of your data (see per example Bayes Network/Conditional Probability Visualization Tools ). It will be harder with neural networks.
