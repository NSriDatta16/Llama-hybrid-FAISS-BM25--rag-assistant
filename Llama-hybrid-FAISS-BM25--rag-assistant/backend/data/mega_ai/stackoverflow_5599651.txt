JQuery local mock vs. remote system

I am afraid I similar question might be already asked somewhere, but I wasn't able to find a solution. Here's roughly my environement + purpose: I have a very simple HTML JQuery Setup whose intent is do collapse the later content when a page has more than 5 h3's. Each h3 is followed by 1 or more paragraphs. If a page does have more than 5 h3's every content belonging to the h3 should be automatically collapsed (hidden), shown when the corresponding h3 is clicked and hidden, when clicked again. Here's my jquery code: $(document).ready(function() { if ($('h3').length > 4) { var headlines = $('h3').slice(3); var start = $('h3').slice(3,4); var content = start.nextAll().not('h6'); headlines.addClass('expandable-headline'); content.hide(); headlines.click(function() { var successors = $(this).nextUntil('h3'); successors.toggle(); $(this).toggleClass('expandable-headline'); }); } }); Here's my html : ABC some nice content ABC some nice content some even nicer content Last but not least, here's my problem: All code above works perfect when run locally in simple test files, but when I try it inside my production system (a Drupal site) it throwns an error at var successors = $(this).nextUntil('h3'); stating, that $(this).nextUntil is not a function . Any ideas, what this is about? I appreciate any help. Best Greeets, Sunny
