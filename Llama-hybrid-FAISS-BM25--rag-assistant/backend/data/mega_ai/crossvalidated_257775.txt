Simulation: One large simulation or average over multiple smaller simulations

I'm interested in clinical trial simulation. Consider a trial where group n receives placebo and group m receives treatment. From the literature, I take the relationship $$ \frac{n \cdot m}{n + m} = \frac{(z_{1-\alpha/2} + z_{1-\beta})^2}{(\delta/\sigma)^2} $$ where n and m are the number of participants in the groups, $z_{1-\alpha/2}$ is the significance quantile, $z_{1-\beta}$ is the power quantile, $\delta$ is the difference in treatment effect compared to placebo and $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the response. The simulation allows me to find estimates for $\delta$ and $\sigma$, assuming I have a model for the dose-response-relationship. Now I want to run the simulation for different values of $n$ and $m$ until I satisfy my $\beta$ requirement. For a reliable result, should I run multiple simulations at smaller values of $n$ and $m$ and average over $\delta$ or rather one big simulation with larger $n$ and $m$?
