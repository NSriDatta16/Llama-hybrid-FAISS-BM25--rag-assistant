Regular expression to skip character in capture group

Is it possible to skip a couple of characters in a capture group in regular expressions? I am using .NET regexes but that shouldn't matter. Basically, what I am looking for is: [random text]AB-123[random text] and I need to capture 'AB123', without the hyphen. I know that AB is 2 or 3 uppercase characters and 123 is 2 or 3 digits, but that's not the hard part. The hard part (at least for me) is skipping the hyphen. I guess I could capture both separately and then concatenate them in code, but I wish I had a more elegant, regex-only solution. Any suggestions?
