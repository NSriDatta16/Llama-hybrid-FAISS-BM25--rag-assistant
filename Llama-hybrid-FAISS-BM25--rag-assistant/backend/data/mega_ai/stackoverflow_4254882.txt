Custom form on WordPress blog

I would like to create a custom form for my WordPress blog which takes the user's email address and then adds it to a database. I know how to write the form and script to achieve the data storage. I don't know how I would go about sticking it on WordPress blog though. Are there any plugins for this type of thing, or is there a way I can manually add the form to the page? It's basically a signup for notifications box. Thanks.
