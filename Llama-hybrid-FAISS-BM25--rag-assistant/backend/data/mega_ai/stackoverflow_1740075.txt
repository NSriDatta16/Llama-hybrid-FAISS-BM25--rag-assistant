The previous answer is erroneous in his assumptions that this will decrease performance. Quite the contrary. Here's a lengthy, but informative article and the why and how to do partitioning in MySQL: http://dev.mysql.com/tech-resources/articles/partitioning.html Partitioning is typically used, as was mentioned, to group like-data together. That way, when you decided to archive off or flat out destroy a partition, your tables do not become fragmented. This, however, does not hurt performance, it can actually increase it. See, it is not just deletions that fragment, updates and inserts can also do that. By partitioning the data, you are instructing the RDBMS the criteria (indeces) by which the data should be manipulated and queried.
