Difference between Time series clustering and Time series Segmentation

In the context of time series data mining, I have read about time series segmentation and time series clustering, but I couldn't differentiate between both. In case they are different, how these methods are correlated with each other? Well from my understanding (please correct me if I am wrong), the segmentation is considered as a preprocessing step for the clustering phase. I mean that the segmentation step is used mainly to partition your time series data into segments, let's say into states. After that, a conventional clustering algorithm can be applied to group these segments into clusters (similar segments belong to the same cluster). As an example, let's say that the segmentation process represents a given time series into the following segments: (S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6). Then after applying the segmentation process, a conventional clustering method is applied to cluster the extracted segments. So we might end up with something like this: If k = 3: then K1 {S1, S5}, K2 {S3, S6}, K3 {S2, S4} Please correct me if I am mistaken, and provide links for more clarification if you have any.
