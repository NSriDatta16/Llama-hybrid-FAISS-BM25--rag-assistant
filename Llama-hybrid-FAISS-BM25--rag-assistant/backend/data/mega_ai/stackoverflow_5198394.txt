Fragment Backport requires seperate class for the backport and for the honeycomb?

Am I missing something important in this, or do you have to maintain a seperate version of all your fragments for the backported classes, and for the native honeycomb fragments? -- Attempting to use the backported fragments on honeycomb was expected to do a fall-through and use the native, not crash because of a ClassCastException Any help would be greatly appreciated.
