I second duffymo and Martin McNulty, you must use getResourceAsStream and put your Excel file, here it goes the example: Your webapp structure is something like this, right? - Application Root | +- WEB-INF | +- classes/ In this structure your application classpath is conformed by the JAR files located into lib folder and the classes folder. When you compile using an IDE the files located in your source folder are compiled and the .class files are copied in the classes folder, if the files are not Java files they're just copied in the folder, but still are in the classpath. So, being briefly... You can add not-class files in the classpath, like your Excel file and organise it into packages just like it'd be a class. If you put the Excel file in the classpath you'll have the advantage that the file can be accessed independently of your JAR file or WAR file location, just by knowing its location in the classpath. The method Class.getResourceAsStream(String path) provides you access to files into the classpath, just pass the path replacing the dots by slashes, for example: getClass().getResourceAsStream("/yourpackage/YourExcelFile.xsl"); will provide you an InputStream of the file YourExcelFile.xsl that is inside the package yourpackage . I tried my best to explain you this but if you have doubts you can check the method documentation .
