Optimise selection from a set, with constraints

I would like to use R to solve a problem I have. I don't even know what to call a problem of this kind and I'm finding Googling difficult. My guess is that this kind of problem already has R packages to help solve it, but I'd very much appreciate help defining the problem. I want to select the optimum combination of agents, given some constraints. I have a large set of agents, each of which has four 'measures': Category 1 : can take 1 of 4 possible values Category 2 : can take 1 of 20 possible values Cost : a continuous variable Expected Return : a continuous variable I wish to select a set of exactly 15 agents, to maximise Expected Return , with the following constraints: There must be a certain number of agents from each value of Category 1 There is a maximum number of agents from each value of Category 2 There is a maximum Cost What kind of problem is this, specifically? Are you aware of any R packages that I could use / adapt to help me? I specify R only as I am very comfortable with the language. Many thanks for your time.
