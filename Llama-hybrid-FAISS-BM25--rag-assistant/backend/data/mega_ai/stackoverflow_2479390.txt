Is there any way to "peek" at a file while it's uploading through HTTP onto a Windows box?

I need to add a file upload function to an ASP.NET website and would like to be able to read a small portion of the file on the server while it's still uploading. A peek or preview type function so I can determine contents and give some feedback to the user while it is still uploading (we're talking about large files here). Is there any way to do this? I'm thinking worst case of writing a custom control which uploads only a fixed number of bytes of the file once chosen and then under the covers starts another upload of the full file. Not totally sure even this is possible, but I'm looking for a more elegant solution anyway... Thanks!
