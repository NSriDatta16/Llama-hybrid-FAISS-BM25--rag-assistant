Cointegration structure

I have two time series that I am investigating, acc and amb, the time frequency is daily data. They are both non stationary, as evidenced by the follows: adf.test(df$acc) Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test data: df$acc Dickey-Fuller = -2.7741, Lag order = 5, p-value = 0.2519 alternative hypothesis: stationary > adf.test(df$amb) Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test data: df$amb Dickey-Fuller = -1.9339, Lag order = 5, p-value = 0.6038 alternative hypothesis: stationary I am looking to test for cointegration between the two time series but the problem I am running into is that the cointegrating vector seems to change in time. 1) First 200 points Johansen-Procedure Test type: maximal eigenvalue statistic (lambda max) , with linear trend Eigenvalues (lambda): [1] 0.0501585398 0.0003129906 Values of teststatistic and critical values of test: test 10pct 5pct 1pct r Eigenvectors, normalised to first column: (These are the cointegration relations) acc.l2 amb.l2 acc.l2 1.0000000 1.000000 amb.l2 -0.9610573 -2.237141 Weights W: (This is the loading matrix) acc.l2 amb.l2 acc.d -0.03332428 -0.002576070 amb.d 0.03986111 -0.001591227 2) First 1000 points Johansen-Procedure Test type: maximal eigenvalue statistic (lambda max) , with linear trend Eigenvalues (lambda): [1] 0.019211132 0.001959403 Values of teststatistic and critical values of test: test 10pct 5pct 1pct r Eigenvectors, normalised to first column: (These are the cointegration relations) acc.l2 amb.l2 acc.l2 1.0000000 1.00000 amb.l2 -0.8611314 15.76683 Weights W: (This is the loading matrix) acc.l2 amb.l2 acc.d -0.008993595 -0.0002419353 amb.d 0.027935684 -0.0002067523 3) Whole History Johansen-Procedure Test type: maximal eigenvalue statistic (lambda max) , with linear trend Eigenvalues (lambda): [1] 0.0144066813 0.0008146258 Values of teststatistic and critical values of test: test 10pct 5pct 1pct r Eigenvectors, normalised to first column: (These are the cointegration relations) acc.l2 amb.l2 acc.l2 1.0000000 1.00000 amb.l2 -0.8051537 -25.42806 Weights W: (This is the loading matrix) acc.l2 amb.l2 acc.d -0.01003068 7.009487e-05 amb.d 0.02128464 6.980209e-05 You can see the marginal change the coefficient values, from -0.96 to -0.86 to -0.80. My question is how to interpret this, what is the optimal look back period, what is the true relationship I should use for future prediction?
