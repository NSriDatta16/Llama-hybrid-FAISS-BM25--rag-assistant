Yes, you can do ordinal logistic regression with continuous independent variables. But what do you mean when you write Could I obtain in this way the D variable as percentages? You can get the D variable as percentages without doing any regression, just simple arithmetic. That's probably not what you want. You can get the predicted proportion of D in each level from an ordinal logistic regression. In SAS there is the output statement in PROC LOGISTIC; you would want the predprobs option. In R you could look at polr in the MASS package, and then look into predicted and profile .
