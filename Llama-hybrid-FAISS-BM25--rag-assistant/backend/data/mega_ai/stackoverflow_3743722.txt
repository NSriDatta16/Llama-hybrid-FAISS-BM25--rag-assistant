How to read in a txt file in XNA 4 for Windows Phone 7?

I had a look at this previous question however this doesn't seem to work for XNA 4 for a Windows Phone 7 project: XNA Framework Importers I've been trying to use: string line; using (StreamReader sr = new StreamReader("credits.txt")) { while ((line = sr.ReadLine()) != null) { //reads line by line until eof //do whatever you want with the text } } ` but this is throwing a System.MethodAccessException "Attempt to access the method failed: System.IO.StreamReader..ctor(System.String)" Do I need to look at using IsolatedStorage for this instead? Edit: Please note I am trying to load a pre-prepared file, not save settings for a running application. e.g. a text file containing credits that I will only read in at run time but need to be able to edit during design time.
