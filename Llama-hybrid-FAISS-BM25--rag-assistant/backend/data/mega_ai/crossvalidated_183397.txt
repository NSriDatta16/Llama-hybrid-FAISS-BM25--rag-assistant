How to reduce dataset for plotting

I have a large dataset that contains a lot of noise that I would like to eliminate in order to reduce the size of the dataset and speed up data visualization. I was thinking to reduce the number of datapoints by selecting data points with similar values and replacing them a single point. Let's say I have the following dataset and each datapoint has a timestamp associated with it: [0.1, 0.11, 0.08, 0.065 .... 0.5, 1.2, 5, 5.1, 5.01, 5.05, 4.98, ...] I want replace the first N numbers with a single value, since I'm not getting any useful information, then I keep the ramp up, then when I get to 5, replace the next N numbers with a single value and so forth. I was thinking to use a rolling variance that would reset if the value crosses some threshold. As long as the values are within that band, they'll be replaced by an average? I guess another option is to sample the data and plot that? What would be the best way to do that? It's been a long while since I had to do any statistics so I'm having hard time convincing myself that my approach will work. Edit: Maybe calculate the mean absolute deviation, then divide by the mean of the sample (the sample being the first N points), then if that's within the acceptable range(let's say 1%), move to the next N points (maybe with some overlap?). I'm currently prototyping in python but will end implementing the algorithm in java.
