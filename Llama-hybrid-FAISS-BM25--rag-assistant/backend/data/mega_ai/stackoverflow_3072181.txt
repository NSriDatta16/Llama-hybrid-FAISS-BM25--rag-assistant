First i would probably suggest that your opinion about using database for this would be too storage costly is invalid. Storage itself is cheap, and i doubt the recordset will get that huge. Plus when properly indexed, this table will be blazing fast to access (and it will be mostly read access with pretty unique constraints). But this is your decision, not mine :) One idea would be to use cookies - it would be really really easy, although you have a size limit do deal with, which can complicate things a bit. The thing with memory (and memcache alike) is that it's not persistent. The next time you boot your application environment, the data is reset. So for persistent storage, you still need some kind of a database or persistent queue thing (Redis for example).
