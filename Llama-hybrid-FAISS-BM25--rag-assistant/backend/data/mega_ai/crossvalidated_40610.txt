Using an assumed distribution (ie. parametric analysis) will reduce the computational cost of your method. I am assuming that you would like to perform a regression or classification task. This means that at some point you are going to estimate the distribution of some data. Nonparametric methods are useful when the data does not conform to a well studied distribution, but they typically take either more time to compute or more memory to store. Also if the data are generated by a process that conforms to a distribution, such as they are an average of some uniformly random processes, then using that distribution makes more sense. In the case of averaging a set of uniform variable the correct distribution is probably the Gaussian Distribution.
