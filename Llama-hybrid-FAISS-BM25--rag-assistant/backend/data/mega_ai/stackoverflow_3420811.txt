No , that is not the "right" approach. You can perform initialization of instance variables in awakeFromFetch . Apple guidelines for NSManagedObject subclasses include the following: You are also discouraged from overriding initWithEntity:insertIntoManagedObjectContext: , dealloc , or finalize . Changing values in the initWithEntity:insertIntoManagedObjectContext: method will not be noticed by the context and if you are not careful, those changes may not be saved. Most initialization customization should be performed in one of the awakeâ€¦ methods. If you do override initWithEntity:insertIntoManagedObjectContext: , you must make sure you adhere to the requirements set out in the method description [...] ( NSManagedObject Class Reference ) To really help, I'd need a deeper understanding of what you're trying to accomplish. Regardless, I strongly suggest combing through Apple's Core Data Programming Guide and sample code before proceeding.
