You can simply calculate proportion of right answers, $$ P = {n_r \over n}, $$ but it's better to add a correction for total number of answers given. One way to correct is to add "dummy" wrong answers (e.g. $10$), so $$ P' = {n_r \over n + 10 }. $$ People with a large number of answers see their modified percentage alters very little from their real percentage, but people with relatively few answers will see their modified percentage move considerably toward low values . This is known as " Bayesian averaging ". In effect, the people with many answers will rank higher than people with the same percentage but fewer answers.
