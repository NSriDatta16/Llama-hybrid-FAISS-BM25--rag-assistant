I'm not going to repeat essentially the same code others have posted, but a proper drag shouldn't be triggered on simply a mousedown event. On mousedown you should flag a Possible Drag and save the mouse coordinates where the mousedown occurred, then attach a mousemove handler. (This way you don't constantly track mousemoves when you're only really interested in them during a drag) The mousemove handler should change the CSS class of the dragged element only when the distance between the saved mousedown coordinates and the current mouse coordinates is greater than some delta. This prevents every brief/accidental click from looking like a drag. Finally, on drop (mouseup) then handle the drop event as desired, and clear the Possible Drag flag and the saved mousedown coordinates. Watch an OS Desktop click-and-hold on an icon, without moving, then begin moving -- you'll see that this outline is how it behaves.
