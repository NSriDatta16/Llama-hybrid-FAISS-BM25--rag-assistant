You might want to look at diagrams which give the entire picture of the logical structure of the system, like, for example, looking at class diagrams in an OOP system would be of great help. Looking at the design diagrams of large and complex apps gives you a clear understanding of how the internal modules of the system are organized and this way its makes the task of figuring out what functionality does a particular piece of code does much much easier. In the absence of diagrams, you're best bet would be to start from the entry point of the app, like main() and proceed from there while you draw(literally draw or write down on paper) your own conclusions about the system(this way you can have your own documentation) and ask your peers if they're correct.
