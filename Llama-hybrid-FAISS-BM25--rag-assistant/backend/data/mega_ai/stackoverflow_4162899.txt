Troubleshooting PNUnit at the client end

I'm using PNUnit framework (based on NUnit) to run tests in Parallel. Basically the Runner deploys the PNUnitAgent on a client machine and sends it an NUnit Test as a dll file (as is normal for running PNUnit tests ). The problem is that the test is failing unexpectedly on the client machine. I need to troubleshoot how the test is running at client end but cannot use Visual Studio as its not installed. How can we troubleshoot PNUnit test failures? Is there any tool or any easy way to do this? Expecting any quick suggestions as it is very urgent.
