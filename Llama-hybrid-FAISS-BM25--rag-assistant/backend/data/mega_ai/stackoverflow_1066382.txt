Why not just store the generated HTML in the database? It seems like you'll effectively be treating the file system as a database anyway - At least if you store the HTML in a database you can rely on the DBMS to optimise lookup performance (e.g. by caching recently queried HTML) and you can add indices and analyse query performance. Otherwise you'll just be hammering the file system instead; i.e. moving the problem elsewhere. Also, I would suggest taking a step back and seeing where the bottleneck currently lies. Storing HTML (presentation layer data) is not an elegant solution - If the real problem is due to query performance perhaps consider introducing denormalised tables into your schema containing intermediate results, from which you can quickly generate HTML.
