Just to say it again, if the sample size is , then we will consider the sample $_1,\cdots, _$ as independent identically distributed according to $_$ defined in equation (1) above. This is incorrect: if the $X_i$ 's are i.i.d. conditional on $\theta$ , they are not unconditionally so since $$ (_1,\cdots, _) \sim \int \prod_{i=1}^n f(x_i|\theta)\,\text d\Pi(\theta) \ne \prod_{i=1}^n \int f(x_i|\theta)\,\text d\Pi(\theta)$$ In other words, the $X_i$ 's become dependent when integrating out $\theta$ because they all contain information about the same $\theta$ . To address more directly the question, the prior construction is an inferential, post-observational, choice that logically does not impact the way the $X_i$ 's were generated . (Think of the usual case when the Bayesian analyst comes upon the scene after the data was collected.) This prior construction is indeed adopted (only) for Bayesian inference about the (true) parameter $\theta$ driving the generation of those $X_i$ 's. Thus the per se generative model on the $X_i$ 's is unrelated to $\Pi$ , as it is either the postulated model attached to $f(\cdot|\theta)$ for an unknown value of $\theta$ or it is an unknown "true model" in case of model misspecification. This is why different Bayesians will adopt different priors for the same dataset with none being "wrong". In other words, there is no such thing as the "true" prior , because, otherwise, we would not find ourselves within a Bayesian setting but a genuine generation mechanism (as in error in variable models). As to why one would ressort to noninformative priors, there are many entries on X validated about it. Like this one . But also limitations to their use, as for instance for model choice , since the marginal density of the sample $$p(\mathbf x) = \int \prod_{i=1}^n f(x_i|\theta)\,\text d\Pi(\theta)$$ is not a probability density and thus cannot be scaled (or compared with a genuine probability density). This strong limitation (DeGroot, 1973) is directly connected to the impossibility of generating samples using the prior predictive and hence to the question. This is also related to the impossibility of running ABC with an improper prior (Sisson et al., 2019) since pseudo-samples cannot be produced from the prior predictive.
