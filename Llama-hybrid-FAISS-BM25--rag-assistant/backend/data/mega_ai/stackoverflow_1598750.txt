The documentation: Concatenate the elements of this list. The elements of this list should be a Iterables. Note: The compiler might not be able to infer the type parameter. Pay close attention to that second sentence. Any cannot be converted to Iterable[Any] . You could have a list of Int s, and that list cannot be flattened since Int is not iterable. And think about it, if you have List[Int] , what are you flattening? You need List[B , because then you would have two dimensions, which can be flattened to one.
