Embedding Live Video from an IP WebCam

We are using a Sony SNC-RZ30N IP-based webcam to monitor osprey nests and would like to stream the video feed via our own webserver. Rather than use the built-in webserver of the camera (which requires either ActiveX or Java on the client side) to display the live feed, I would like to weed out just the live feed and display it on our campus webserver (Win2k8/IIS7). Perhaps in an iFrame or the like. Unfortunately, documentation for anything other than FTP'ing a static image snapshot from this camera seems to be pretty much non-existent. There are other "video surveillance" packages (ie: ProSight SMB) that will feed up a web page with the live feed on their own built-in webservers (along with controls to position the camera, which we don't want displayed) - but that is undesireable. I simply want to capture the live stream from the camera and embed it a page on our website so that we can control how the page looks as well as other relevant hyperlinks. Thx.
