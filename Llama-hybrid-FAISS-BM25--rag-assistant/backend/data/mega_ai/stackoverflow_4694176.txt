finding out when a MotionEvent has finished

Im trying to figure out how to see when a MotionEvent is done with an event (i.e, the user has pressed on the screen, dragged around, and took their finger off the screen). In the Docs i only see getEventTime to generate when the event started, but theres no mention on how to figure out when it finished. Any ideas?
