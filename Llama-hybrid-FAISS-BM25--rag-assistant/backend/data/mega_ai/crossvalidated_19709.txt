Here is a crude argument giving a slightly different estimate for uniformly distributed random variables. Suppose the $X_i$ are continuous random variables uniformly distributed on $[0,1]$. Then, $\sum_i X_i$ has mean value $N/2$. Assume that by a surprising and totally unbelievable coincidence, the sum is exactly equal to $N/2$. So we want to estimate how many of the largest values of $X$ sum up to $N/4$ or more. Now, the histogram of $N$ samples ($N$ very large) drawn from the uniformm distribution $U[0,1]$ is roughly flat from $0$ to $1$, and so for any $x$, $0 You could try and generalize this a bit. If $\sum_i X_i = Y$, then for any given $Y$, we want $x$ to be such that $(1-x^2)N/2 = Y/2$ where $Y$ is normal with mean $N/2$ and variance $N/12$. Thus, conditioned on a value of $Y$, $x = \sqrt{1-(Y/N)}$. Multiply by the density of $Y$ and integrate (from $Y=0$ to $Y=N$) to find the average number of largest samples that will exceed half the random sum.
