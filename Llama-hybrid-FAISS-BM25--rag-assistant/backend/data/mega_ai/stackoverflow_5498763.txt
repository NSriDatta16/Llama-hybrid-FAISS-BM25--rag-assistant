Depending on how much the window size is growing by, you could try using the "RenderAtScale" attribute, e.g. (xaml): (C#): Path path = new Path(); BitmapCache bitmapCache = new BitmapCache(); bitmapCache.RenderAtScale = 2; path.CacheMode = bitmapCache; This would cache the path at twice its original size, meaning that it shouldn't look fuzzy when scaled up. I know this isn't what you asked to do but it might solve your problem.
