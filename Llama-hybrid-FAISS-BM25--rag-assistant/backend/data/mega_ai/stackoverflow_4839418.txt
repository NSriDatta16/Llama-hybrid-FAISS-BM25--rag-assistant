Save file to android memory

I'm experimenting with android, and I got to the point where I want to save something to internal memory and read from it, but I'm kind of stuck. I found this article http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/data-storage.html#filesInternal and as it suggested I created dummy method : public void test(){ String FILENAME = "hello_file"; String string = "hello world!"; FileOutputStream fos = openFileOutput(FILENAME, Context.MODE_PRIVATE); fos.write(string.getBytes()); fos.close(); } Which always throws NullPointerException, anyone knows what I'm missing?Maybe some permission in Androidmanifest.xml ? QUESTION UPDATE: FileOutputStream fos = openFileOutput(FILENAME, Context.MODE_PRIVATE); Above line trows NPE. My class is abstract and its extending Activity, I don't know if that is relevant or not. Stack trace : 01-29 22:30:44.575: ERROR/TEST(458): java.lang.NullPointerException 01-29 22:30:44.575: ERROR/TEST(458): java.lang.RuntimeException: java.lang.NullPointerException It seems that any IO operation throws NPE, I tried this as well : try { File myDir = new File(getFilesDir().getAbsolutePath()); String s = ""; FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(myDir + "/Test.txt"); fw.write("Hello World"); fw.close(); BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(myDir + "/Test.txt")); s = br.readLine(); // Set TextView text here using tv.setText(s); } catch (FileNotFoundException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } File myDir = new File(getFilesDir().getAbsolutePath()); Throws NPE, I even added into Androidmanifest.xml I've made method and pass in Context ctx, but my ctx ends up null, how can I get this variable? set it to which value ?
