Agree with kprobst. Our team's best practice includes avoiding any sort of server side code in aspx files (except databinding calls). Any business or page logic can be more neatly organized on the code behind. Tag soup is hard to avoid with Classic ASP, ColdFusion and PHP. It is easily avoidable with ASP.NET.
