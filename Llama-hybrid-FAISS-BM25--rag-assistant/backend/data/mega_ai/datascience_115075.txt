PCA/PLS results are hard to Interpret, because you do not know the feature_mixture present in pc_scores, that are the results of dimensionality reduction -- and of course, reducing dimensionality you're loosing some info (exactly things what you're asking about). The only you can do (not you're interested in) is to reconstruct your initial data ( from eigenvectors ) or see here for computer_version ... In any case, I consider, the answer to your question is NO you can't know what set of features mostly input to your highest loadings, because this information is already reduced. Though - can see here - if it's enough for you Frankly speaking in sklearn PCA fitted result-object you can see its properties for weights , but personally I see no reason to do dim_reduction and next explore (try to decompose) components back to features (because you have only weight for the certain point, not the whole sample) p.s. though there is terminologic difference between eigenvectors and loadings
