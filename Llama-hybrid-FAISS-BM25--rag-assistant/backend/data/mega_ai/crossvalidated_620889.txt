Yes, as Graham says, odds ratios (ORs) are not intuitive and frequently misinterpreted as risk ratios (RRs). ORs are always farther from 1 than RRs, unless both are equal to 1. Even if you use a logistic regression model, you can present your results with RRs or risk differences (RDs), but it's tricky. Here's how to do it in Stata. RDs are absolute risk differences. If the exposure is a treatment, the absolute risk reduction (ARR) is -RD, and the number needed to treat is 1/ARR. The relative risk difference $RRD = RR-1$ . This can be generalized to other populations with different baseline risk in the unexposed $R_u$ . $$RD = RRD \times R_u$$ If you know the baseline risk in the unexposed $R_u$ you can calculate the RR from the OR. $$RR = \frac{OR}{1-R_{u} + R_{u}(OR)} $$ $$R_{u}(OR - 1) = \frac{OR - RR}{RR} $$ The first equation is called Levin's Equation. I prefer the second equation, which provides the percent by which the OR overestimates/underestimates the RR. If $R_u$ is small and OR is close to 1, then OR $\approx$ RR, but not otherwise. $R_{e} = $ Risk in the exposed $R_{u} = $ Risk in the unexposed \begin{align*} OR &=\frac{\dfrac{R_{e}}{1-R_{e}}}{\dfrac{R_{u}}{1-R_{u}}} = \text{Odds Ratio}\\ RR &= \frac{R_{e}}{R_{u}} = \text{Risk Ratio}\\ &= OR \left(\frac{1-R_{e}}{1-R_{u}} \right)\\ &= OR \left(\frac{1-R_{u}(RR)}{1-R_{u}} \right)\\ RR(1-R_{u}) &= OR \left({1-R_{u}(RR)}\right)\\ RR(1-R_{u}) &= OR-R_{u}(OR)(RR)\\ RR(1-R_{u}) + R_{u}(OR)(RR) &= OR\\ RR(1-R_{u} + R_{u}(OR)) &= OR\\ RR &= \frac{OR}{1-R_{u} + R_{u}(OR)} &&\text{(Levin's Equation)} \\ RR + (RR)R_{u}(OR) - (RR)R_{u} &= OR \\ RR + (RR)R_{u}(OR - 1) &= OR \\ (RR)R_{u}(OR - 1) &= OR - RR\\ R_{u}(OR - 1) &= \frac{OR - RR}{RR}\\ \end{align*} The $OR$ mis-estimates the $RR$ by a percentage equal to $R_{u}\cdot(OR -1)$ , where $R_{u} = $ risk in the unexposed (control) group. If $OR = 3$ and $R_{u} = 10\%$ , then the $OR$ is 20% higher than the $RR$ , because $0.10\cdot(3-1) = 0.2$ . That means the $RR$ is $3/1.2 = 2.5$ . If $OR = 0.33$ and $R_{u} = 10\%$ , then the $OR$ is 6.7% lower than the $RR$ , because $0.10\cdot(0.33-1) = -0.067$ . That means the $RR$ is $0.33/0.933 = 0.357$ .
