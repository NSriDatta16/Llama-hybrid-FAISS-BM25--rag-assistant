I now this may sound absurd, but I had exactly same problem recently and my research suggested that I delete the table in my dbml and drag it in again and guess what, its fixed! So try deleting your tblArtworkDataLabels and recreate it. I dont know whether it was my changes that caused the out of synch between the model and my db, or it was purely VS issue.
