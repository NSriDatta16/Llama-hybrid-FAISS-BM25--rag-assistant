Javascript AOP support

It is easy enough (for 90% of aop features) to do it without any support being the language itself, like in most dynamic languages like python and ruby. However, Dojo had direct support for it on 1.3.2 . What happened in the latest versions? Did they remove it? Is there another javascript aop library that should get more attention?
