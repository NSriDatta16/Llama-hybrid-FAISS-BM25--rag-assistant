What are differences, or relationships, among "relative probability", "relative frequency", "probability density" and "probability"?

ORIGINAL QUESTION What are the differences, or relationships, among "relative probability", "relative frequency", "probability density" and "probability"? A simple example would help to better understand the differences and relationships among those terms. As far as I understood, these terms are used to indicate/represent histograms and probability density functions (PDF), but I do not understand the exact relationship between those terms... EDITED PART: THE NEW QUESTION IS NOT RELATED TO THE OLD ONE, THEREFORE IT IS NOT A DUPLICATE (please review and re-open it - thank you for your collaboration!) In summary: I asked for relationships among quantities/terms, and not just for fragmented pieces of information. I need to see/establish/understand their connections.
