NLB for the webservers and mirroring for your database servers is really your only option. You need some kind of shared storage to do clustering such as a SAN, NAS or a disk array. If you have a database that is a decent size eg. > 2-3GB then running a db server off a mac mini which has a single 5400RPM sata drive will mean you'll run into performance problems. If you decide to go down the clustering path, you'll need to invest in more hardware. Take a look at openfiler this may be a cheap option.
