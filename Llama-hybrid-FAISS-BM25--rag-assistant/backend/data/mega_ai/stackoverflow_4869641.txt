How do you ensure your MVC routes don't conflict with each other? What tracking system do you use?

What system do you use to ensure that changes to the MVC route table does not cause conflicts, or hidden routes? Please share details. For example, if in Excel, how do you organize it? I am not interested in the technical manner in which the routes are applied to the website (attributes, global.asax, etc) unless your technical solution also directly relates to an at-a-glance route management system.
