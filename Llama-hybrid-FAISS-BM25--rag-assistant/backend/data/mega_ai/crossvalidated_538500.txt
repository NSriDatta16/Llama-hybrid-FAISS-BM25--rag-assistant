To say “using one of the algorithms [...] as the dependent variable“ is imprecise wording and actually doesn’t make sense. Perhaps you meant “using the FIB-4....” What is the purpose of this regression? To show the degree to which the FIB-4 index depends on each of its inputs, or building blocks? If so then one would hope to see some high correlations. These would be indicated by the strength — of r, partial r, semipartial r, b, or beta — more than by p, which depends so much on the sample size. It is hard to see how binary logistic regression would apply. The FIB-4 sounds like an interval-level variable, in which case linear regression would be a natural choice. If FIB-4 is nominal—unusual for such an index—then multinomial logistic regression would probably apply. If you are dichotomizing interval-level scores into a binary Disease/No Disease variable, it would be a great loss of fine-grained information and would call for special justification. If the purpose is to predict each patient’s FIB-4 score as a proxy for liver disease, then using the inputs to that score as predictors would accomplish little. It would seem to be circular. Examples abound of clinicians or clinician-researchers trying to conduct such analyses without calling on statisticians or data analysts, or calling on them too late, with unhappy results. I hope your team is not heading down that road.
