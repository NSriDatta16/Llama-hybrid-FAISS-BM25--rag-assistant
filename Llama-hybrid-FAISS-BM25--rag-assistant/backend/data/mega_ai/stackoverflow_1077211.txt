This is difficult to answer accurately since parallel processing is not a generic problem. You'll need to analyze your project to find places where you can leverage parallel processing. If your application can be easily broken down into concrete independent tasks, parallel processing will definitely improve. If its primarily serial in nature, multiple cores/threads won't really help at all. If you've determined that parallel tasks represent the core of your process, a parallel library can help you perform the basic tasks as well as make it easier to get right.
