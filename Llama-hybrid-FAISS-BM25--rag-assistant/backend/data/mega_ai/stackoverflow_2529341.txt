failed to connect to any given host:port - RoR Error?

I'm very new to Ruby on Rails so please go easy! I've uploaded the whole application to the server (Dreamhost) and gone through the steps. But when I try to run it I get the following error: failed to connect to any given host:port (Mongo::ConnectionFailure) I have installed the Mongo gem; but maybe I haven't got it configured correctly? I know you can't use localhost for describing where a Dreamhost mysql database is; might it be something like that? These are the first five lines of the backtrace if that helps?: /home/user/.gem/ruby/1.8/gems/mongo-0.19.1/lib/../lib/mongo/connection.rb 440 in `connect_to_master' 1 /home/user/.gem/ruby/1.8/gems/mongo-0.19.1/lib/../lib/mongo/connection.rb 131 in `initialize' 2 /home/user/.gem/ruby/1.8/gems/magent-0.3/lib/magent.rb 19 in `new' 3 /home/user/.gem/ruby/1.8/gems/magent-0.3/lib/magent.rb 19 in `connection' 4 /home/user/.gem/ruby/1.8/gems/magent-0.3/lib/magent.rb 27 in `database=' 5 /home/user/.gem/ruby/1.8/gems/magent-0.3/lib/magent.rb 35 Any help much appreciated and apologies for my n00bishness! Thanks.
