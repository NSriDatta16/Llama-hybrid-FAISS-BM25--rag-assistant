A computer's central processor can only execute program code found in read-only memory ( ROM ), random access memory ( RAM ). Modern operating systems and application program code and data are stored on nonvolatile data storage devices, such as hard drives, CD, DVD, flash memory cards (like an SD card), USB flash drive, and floppy disk. When a computer is first powered on, it usually does not have an operating system in ROM or RAM. The computer must execute a relatively small program stored in ROM along with the bare minimum of data needed to access the nonvolatile devices from which the operating system programs and data are loaded into RAM. The small program that starts this sequence of loading into RAM is known as a bootstrap loader , bootstrap or boot loader . This small boot loader program's only job is to load other data and programs which are then executed from RAM. Often, multiple-stage boot loaders are used, during which several programs of increasing complexity sequentially load one after the other in a process of chain loading.
