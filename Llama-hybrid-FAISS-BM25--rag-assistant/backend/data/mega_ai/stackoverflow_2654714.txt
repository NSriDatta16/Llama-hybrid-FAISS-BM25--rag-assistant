Assembly loading behaviour has changed between 2.5.4 and 2.5.3. It was causing problems for us, so we reverted to 2.5.3, since that still supports the 4.0 framework. We use nunit-console.exe 2.5.3 with multiple assemblies in our msbuild script, which looks like this: On execution, it fills out like this (edited for readability): "c:\Program Files\NUnit 2.5.3\bin\net-2.0\nunit-console.exe" /noshadow D:\BuildAgent\GojiSoft.Application.Test\bin\Release\GojiSoft.Application.Test.dll D:\BuildAgent\GojiSoft.Common.Test\bin\Release\GojiSoft.Common.Test.dll /xml D:\BuildAgent\work\2f016459feee51ce\Build\NUnit-Results.xml We don't use a 64bit machine for our unit tests, so YMMV. I have a blog post about the addtional modification your should make to the nunit-console-x86.exe.config here: Getting .Net 4.0, Team City, MSBuild and Nunit to play nice.
