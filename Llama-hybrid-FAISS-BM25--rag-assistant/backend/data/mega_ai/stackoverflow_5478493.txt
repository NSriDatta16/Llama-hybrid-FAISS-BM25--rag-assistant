You are describing a fairly standard ETL procedure and that is exactly what SSIS was designed for. SSIS will indeed read CSV files and be able to perform validation on individual fields. What you do with the result of that validation (good or bad, pass no pass) is entirely up to you. And yes, you can fire off SSIS packages on the fly... as necessary. Check out the dtexec utility . You could also set up a SQL Server Agent job which would monitor the folder that receives the uploaded CSV files and trips off the SSIS processes against them automatically. You ASP.NET code only have to worry about the upload. Everything else would then be a SQL Server/SQL Agent-based ETL operation.
