Comparing two fields using FieldInfo.GetValue without knowing the MemberType

Given the name of a field that exists on a class (public) and not knowing the field type, is it possible to compare this field on an instance of the class to the same field on another instance of the same class? I'm trying to do this for a "ValueHasChanged" function, something like the following: Protected Function ValueHasChanged(ByVal fieldName as String) As Boolean Dim presentFieldInfo = presentInstance.GetType().GetField(fieldName) Dim originalFieldInfo = originalInstance.GetType().GetField(fieldName) Return presentFieldInfo.GetValue(presentInstance) <> originalFieldInfo.GetValue(originalInstance) End Function The Return line spawns a compiler error about not being able to compare operands of type Object for operator '=', which makes sense, of course. Is there a way I can cast the values or do this differently without having to test the field's type and write a long switch/if...elseif statement?
