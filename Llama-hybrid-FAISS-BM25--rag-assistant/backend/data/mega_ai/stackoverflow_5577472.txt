You want to add tabbarcontroller to your split view at detail view side and its very simple. create as many viewcontrollers subclasses with xib for ipad as u want to put in tabbarcontroller.Open Mainwindow.xib then do this, expand your splitview , u have two things navigationcontroller(which in turns contain rootview controller),detailview controller(right side view). Open your library just drag tabbar controller to exectly onto detailviewcontroller ,so it will replace that detailviewcontroller. now expand this tabbar controller u can see viewcontroller 1 - viewcontroller 2 etc. Now simply select view controller 1 , open attributes [press command 1 attribute] and select nib file of your detailview controller and on command 4 attribute select controller as detailview controller. Reapet this for view controller 2 in tabbarcontroller but in this select nib file and controller file as u want or as new file created by u and save close IB. run program select landscape then u can see its done. even u can add more than two tabbar items bye just drag viewcontroller from library exectly on tabbarcontroller then expand tabbarcontroller then u can see new viewcontroller then repeat above process.
