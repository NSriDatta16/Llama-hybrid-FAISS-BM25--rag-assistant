What I would do is charge the user for the hosting. You can sell your customizations as you please as they technically are not subject to the Magento license. I would stay away from making changes to the "core" code and instead build off of them. That way you are not selling modified versions of the core software (which would kill your ability to easily upgrade the system). You are allowed to license your extensions however you please so you would not have to worry about the open source model.
