Model multivariate time series with copula - concepts

I have a question regarding some time series concepts: Suppose I have some "time series" data with cross correlation. Suppose I am able to fit a copula, say to capture dependencies between data of $\{t,t-1,...,t-n\}$ - i.e. for some time-lag. Now, if I want to draw some random numbers of this time series, I could do the following (ignoring the marginal distributions): If I have the sample of the time-lag, e.g. $X_{t-1},...,X_{t-n}$, then I could draw $X_t|X_{t-1},...,X_{t-n}$, if I know the conditional distribution (the easiest case is a multivariate normal). What is the closest time series concept to this? Is there any buzzword I have to look for? I used this concept to do a quick analysis of the data, but I'd like to know if this is a common and reasonable approach.
