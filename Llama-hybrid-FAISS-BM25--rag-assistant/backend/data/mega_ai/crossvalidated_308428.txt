What is the equivalent of regularization in optimization theory?

I'm using a coordinate search to find an optima in a noisy search space. I'm wondering whether there's a notion of regularization in optimization to help mitigate avoid the noise? Regularization seems to be a topic exclusive to machine learning. Thanks for any pointers!
