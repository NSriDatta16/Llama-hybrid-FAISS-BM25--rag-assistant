Saving widget settings: php file vs db [apc installed]

What would be faster in terms of performance and usability of editing etc. Storing the settings for widget in a file or storing the settings for it in a db. There are about 23 settings for the widget. The settings in the file will be stored as vars and saved as a php file. The settings in the database will be stored as serilized and then retrieved. But after one retrieval they will be cached for about 5 minutes in a php file as an array. So basically the database class will cache the results and then this would be used. What do you suggest is better to be used. I also wanna give the user the option to edit the widget, so please throw me some answers. Another issue was that if I was to check which widgets are owned to the a member on a file system with file names linke memberid_filename, how would i do it?
