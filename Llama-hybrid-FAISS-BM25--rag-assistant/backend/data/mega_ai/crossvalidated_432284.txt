How to compare the performance of different SVMs and CNNs?

I'm a beginner in machine learning und I have a problem to find the best way to compare the performance (accuracy) of different SVMs and CNNs (Jupyter Notebook)? The CNNs I train in Google Colab with GPU. So far I've tried to make the models reproducible by setting seeds und train each model architecture several times. The reproducibility works with the SVMs, but not with the CNNs in Google Colab. But generally I'm not sure if reproducibility is really helpful in this case. Wouldn't it be better not to put any seeds and train each model several times and then compare the models by using the calculated mean and standard deviation? I hope and would be very grateful when you can explain me how to do it right. Many thanks in advance
