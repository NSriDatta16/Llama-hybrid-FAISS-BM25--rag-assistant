You callback signature should be like this gboolean appCallBack(GtkWidget*,gpointer); You can typecast the gpointer to the structure of your type. Please create a entry using API gtk_entry_new(). I have not found any reference in gtk+2.0 documentation for gtk_entry_new_with_max_length . GtkWidget *entry; entry = gtk_entry_new(); Now in your appCallback the function can get the entry text as follows. GtkWidget *entry = (GtkWidget *) callback_data; //data passed in signal connect. Then you can get the text from this entry with the call gchar *text; text = gtk_entry_get_text(GTK_ENTRY(entry)); Also do the proper error checks. Or you can declare the textentries structure as a pointer.
