How to create custom routes for certain actions in a CakePHP controller?

Coming from Django, I'm used to be able to organize my URL routings any way I see fit. For example, user registration would exist under the /users/ url. /users/ /users/registration/ /users/registration/optin/ /users/registration/thankyou/ However, I'm creating a user registration system in CakePHP and the default convention behaviour for url routings is /controller/action/ . This yields: /users/ /users/registration/ /users/optin/ /users/thankyou/ How can I achieve a /controller/action/custom/ style-url routing on some of my actions (where /custom/ is a sub-section, not a parameter)? Should I even be expecting to do this or am I just fighting the convention?
