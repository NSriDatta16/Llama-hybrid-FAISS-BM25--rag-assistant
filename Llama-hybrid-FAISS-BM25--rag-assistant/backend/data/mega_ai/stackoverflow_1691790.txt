Man..I'd go with the entity framework . It supports Linq. The entity framework 4.0 has major performance improvements over 3.5. It has everything that you require in your post. EF is more then a ORM it is a framework. I think nhibernate is a joke compared to the M$ entity framework. Nhibernate really dropped the ball for not including intellisense and making the setup easier. Many enterprise organizations have embraced entity framework as well. Entity framework can support any database that can be ran on windows because it has a feature to allow any vendor to create a provider for it. Do yourself a favor and go with EF.
