Logistic regression: Ranking of Betas (Categorical variable)

I am running a logistic regression in Stata and would like to rank a categorical predictor variable (which is translated into four binary variables). Stata gives out three of them and compares them with the fourth which is defined as the standard. The confidence intervals overlap each other so that I can't easily rank them using the intervals. Does anyone has an idea how to check if they are significantly different from each other (not only from 0) so that I may rank them? I heard of two possible ways: work with margins (Stata command: margins, dydx ): However, there are so many variations of this specific command that I am not sure if it works and if yes, which one would work. work with standardized coefficients: The Stata command listcoef is supposed to calculate the Beta values for standardized data. Also here I am not sure which - if any - of the different columns of that output count and how to interpret other values which might change within this output.
