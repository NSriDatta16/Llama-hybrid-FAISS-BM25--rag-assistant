Access Specifier in C++

I read the following statements from BRUCE ECKEL'S THINKING IN C++ 1.Access specifier are part of structure and do not affect the object created from "structure Doubt:As we know the access blocks are not stored contiguously, aint it that access specifier change the way object layout in memory 2.All of the access specification information disappear before the program is run (during compilation).In a running program,object become the "region of storage" and nothing more..thus we can break all the rules and access the memory directly as you can in c Doubt:Does it mean one can even access private member directly?please help me to comprehend the above statement 3.c++ is design to be pragmatic, not to aspire to abstract deal Doubt:whats a meaning of being pragmatic?
