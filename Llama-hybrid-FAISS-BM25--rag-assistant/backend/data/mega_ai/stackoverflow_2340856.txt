You can use javascript to scroll to a part of the page. So if you have an element you can drag, you can take its coordinates and save that. When someone wants to go to the bookmark, you then scroll to the coordinates you have saved. window.scrollTo(left, top) is the function to scroll to a part of the page. Adding dragging behavior would be easy with a framework like jQuery . If you then get the offset and save it somewhere, restoring it would not be that hard.
