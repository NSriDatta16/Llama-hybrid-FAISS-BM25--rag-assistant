This is part of several modifications the HTML parser module of libxml makes to the document in order to work with broken HTML. It only occurs when using loadHTML and loadHTMLFile on partial markup. If you know the partial is valid X(HT)ML, use load and loadXML instead. You could use $doc->saveXml($doc->getElementsByTagName('body')->item(0)); to dump the outerHTML of the body element, e.g. anything else and strip the body element with str_replace or extract the inner html with substr . $html = ' I am a fragment '; $dom = new DOMDocument; $dom->loadHTML($html); // added html and body tags echo substr( $dom->saveXml( $dom->getElementsByTagName('body')->item(0) ), 6, -7 ); // I am a fragment Note that this will use XHTML compliant markup, so would become . As of PHP 5.3.5, there is no way to pass a node to saveHTML() . A bug request has been filed.
