 by some reviewers as suffering from the uncanny valley effect, and negatively compared to the appearance of the Hulk in the same series. The Seven Dwarfs in the 2025 remake of Snow White were called this. Stuart Heritage of The Guardian criticized the visual effects for the animals and dwarves. He said the dwarves "look like someone has snuck into Disneyland, grabbed the statues from Snow White's Enchanted Wish and wrapped them in human flesh, as a serial killer would with a gift for their mother" and "like someone has shaved the Sonic the Hedgehog from that first Sonic the Hedgehog trailer that everyone hated." Virtual actors An increasingly common practice is to feature virtual actors in movies: CGI likenesses of real actors used because the original actor either looks too old for the part or is deceased. Sometimes a virtual actor is created with involvement from the original actor (who may contribute motion capture, audio, etc.), while at other times the actor has no involvement. Reviewers have often criticized the use of virtual actors for its uncanny valley effect, saying it adds an eerie feeling to the movie. Examples of virtual actors that have received such criticism include replicas of Arnold Schwarzenegger in Terminator Salvation (2009) and Terminator Genisys (2015), Jeff Bridges in Tron: Legacy (2010), Peter Cushing and Carrie Fisher in Rogue One (2016), and Will Smith in Gemini Man (2019).
