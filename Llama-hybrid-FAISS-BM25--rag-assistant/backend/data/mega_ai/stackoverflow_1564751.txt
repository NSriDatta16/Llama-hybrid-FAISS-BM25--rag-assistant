Building a community photography site, where can I store my photos online?

I am in the process of laying down the requirements for a photography community site. An important feature to investigate would be allowing more fotos/account than rival sites around my country's internet. What are the possibilities out there? Should I go for something like amazon S3, or is there anything that offers more image-related features? I am mostly interested in low price per GB (storage and transfer out).
