Many good suggestions from other people. Here's my 2 millicents worth. My backend data is on server accessed through a Drive mapping. In my case, the Y drive. Production users get the mapping through a login script using active directory. Then the following scenarios are easily done by batch file: Develop against local computer by doing a subst command in a batch file run reports against last nights data by pointing Y to the backup server (read only) run reports against end of month data by pointing to the right directory test against specialized scenarios by keeping a special directory In my environment (average 5 simultaneous users, 1000's of rows, not 10,000's.) corruption has occurred, but it's rare and manageable. Only once in the last several years have we resorted to the previous days backup. We use SQL Server for our higher volume stuff, but it's not as convenient to develop against, probably because we don't have a SQL admin on site.
