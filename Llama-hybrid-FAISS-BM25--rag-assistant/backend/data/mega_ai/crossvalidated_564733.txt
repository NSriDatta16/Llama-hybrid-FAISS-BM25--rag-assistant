If your data consists of 126 measurements, each with five variables, and you feed this 126 x 5 matrix to PCA, and you ask PCA for two PCs, PCA will compute those two PCs, i.e. two vectors of dimension five. When you project your data onto those two PCs, you will get, for each of your 126 measurements, a two-dimensional vector, i.e., all together, a matrix of shape 126 x 2. So, while I don't know your code and all this is guess work, chances are, this 126 x 2 matrix you have there is already the collection of the projections of your data to the PCs.
