GET must be idempotent - getting the same resource should give the same value, and it should be safe. Safety implies that the user is not held responsible for any side-effect. Although idempotency and safety generally imply absence of side-effects, I would consider acknowledging the receipt of an email or resetting a password to be both idempotent and safe - acknowledging or asking for a form to reset more than once does not alter the resource (assuming the response to resetting the password is to show a form which is POSTed to enter a new password). If a user had a mail agent which retrieved and cached all URLs in messages, then the effect that the user would have inadvertently triggered would be to have acknowledged receipt of the email (which is harmless, and 'true'), or inadvertently retrieved a form to reset his password. If the reset link actually resets the password on the GET rather than on the form's POST, then it's a bit more grey, but more of a usability issue than anything else - if the reset token is only good for a given number of hits, then it can't constitute a denial of service.
