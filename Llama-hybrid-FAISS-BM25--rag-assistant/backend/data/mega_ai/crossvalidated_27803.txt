Time series modeling the number of users of a mobile app

I want to model the number of users of an mobile app. This app has two kinds of users: free and paid . I thought of this autoregressive model: $x_t = Ax_{t-1}$ with $x_t$ being a 4-dimensional vector, with quantities (all in period $t$) for the numbers of mobile users visitors of the app page free users paid users I imagined $A$ as follows: $A = \begin{bmatrix} a & 0 & b & c \\ d & e & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1-e & f & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1-(b+f) & g \end{bmatrix}$ Each parameter is the proportion of people in a group going to another group. Example: $f$ is the proportion of free users that remain free users in the next period; $d$ is the number of mobile users that visited the app page, and so on. Problems I see with this model: $b$ and $c$ are the proportion of users that leave the app. Not sure if it's nice to put them in the group of mobile users , or make another dimension for the group former users , that don't register back in the app. The number of mobile users grow in time, so the way I thought to cope with this is by not demanding that $a$ and $d$ sum is 1. Not sure if it's valid. So, the question is: how can I make a better model that I could feed the numbers after the launch of the app and get good estimates for these parameters, and good estimates for future numbers of users?
