Brian's answer covers the issues, but I do think it needs to be explained a little less verbosely You are using the wrong crypto algorithm here MD5 is wrong here, Sha1 is wrong to use here Sha2xx is wrong to use and Skein is wrong to use. What you should be using is something like RSA . Let me explain: Your secure hash is effectively sending the password out for the world to see. You mention that your hash is "time + payload + password", if a third party gets a copy of your payload and knows the time. It can find the password (using a brute force or dictionary attack). So, its almost as if you are sending the password in clear text. Instead of this you should look at a public key cryptography have your server send out public keys to your agents and have the agents encrypt the data with the public key. No man in the middle will be able to tell whats in the messages, and no one will be able to forge the messages. On a side note, MD5 is plenty strong most of the time.
