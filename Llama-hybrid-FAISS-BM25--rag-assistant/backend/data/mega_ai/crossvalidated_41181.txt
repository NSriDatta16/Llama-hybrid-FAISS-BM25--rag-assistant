There have been questions on this site addressing related issues as your questions. To find them, make the local search about "CATPCA" and "Optimal scaling". I don't know what is Latent Class Factor Analysis. According the traditional classification of such methods , factor analysis produces continuous latents and latent class analysis produces categorical latents. The object scores are usual PCA scores. CATPCA is usual PCA (of the correlation matrix) but the PCA is performed after the embedded optimal scaling algorithm quantifies (transforms, generally nonlinearly) categorical input variables into scale (interval) variables; the "optimality" target function is to maximize variance accounted by m first components. Be aware that CATPCA does not allow for truly continuous variables input. It accepts only descrete positive values. So, your Dollars variable should be discretized first; in SPSS, there is a good option to do it right in CATPCA procedure. Discretization amounts to binning data into categories 1, 2, 3, 4, etc; therefore, your Dollars variable becomes initially comparable with your likert-scale variable. If the categories are not equally spaced because you deliberately drop some of the categories, as in 1, 2, 4, 5, this will produce the same quantification as 1, 2, 3, 4 under "ordinal" transformation, but different quantification under "numeric" (=linear) transformation. In SPSS, CATPCA can take any descrete positive values, but 1, 2, 3,... coding for ordinal variables is recommended. So, make them all start with "1", but different variables may potentially be of different number of scale points. See point 2: continuous variables must always be categorized into 1, 2, 3... scale, no fractional values allowed; you may prefer any method of binning you like. CATPCA does not work with truly continuous variables.
