Alternative to GLM with non-independant observation

I would like to perform a regression to study association between 3 categorical variables and a presence/absence response variable. I was planning on using a GLM. However, my observation unit being minutes within hours-long recording sessions, the assumption for independency of observation is not met (The presence/absence in a given minute is likely to influence the following minute). Moreover, my recording sessions being scattered in time, I don't have a full time series. Would it be interesting or completly out of scope to use a GLMM with recording session or hour as random effect ? Would anyone have any suggestion of a statistical test I could apply ? Thank you very much for your help!
