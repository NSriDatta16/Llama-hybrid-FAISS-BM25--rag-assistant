you should include days of the week into your contingency table. This would make it a three way table, with observed counts $O_{grd}$ for group $g$ , result $r$ , and day of the week $d$ . Now if your model/assumption is that day of the week "doesn't matter" for your analysis. You could check this by running a separate tests for each day, where the expected values are $$E_{grd}=\frac{O_{g\bullet d}O_{\bullet r d}}{O_{\bullet\bullet d}}$$ This test allows for the treatment effect to vary by the day of the week. If you are assuming a constant treatment effect across the days then your expected values are $$E_{grd}=\frac{O_{g\bullet \bullet}O_{\bullet r \bullet}O_{\bullet\bullet d}}{O^2_{\bullet\bullet\bullet}}$$ These can both be done using logistic regression, and by inspecting either the "deviance" or "pearson" residuals, you can get your chi square test. however it can be useful to work through the observed/expected counts to see where the assumptions are failing
