Goodness of fit in logistic regression where features are not frequencies

I am fitting a logistic regression model with a set of features for predicting outcomes in football games (three outcomes available: home wins, away wins or draw). The features are such as difference in position in the league table between the home team and the away team, difference in previous 10 games number of wins... So they can be positive as well as negative. I would like to do a goodness of fit of this features. I understand that the correct way of doing it is using the Pearson chi squared test, however this test is used when the features are observed frequencies, which is not my case. Is there any other test that I can use, or a way of modifying my test to understand how good my features are?
