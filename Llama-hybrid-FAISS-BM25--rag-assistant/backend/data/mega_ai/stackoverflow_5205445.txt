jQuery "blinking highlight" effect on div?

I'm looking for a way to do the following. I add a to a page, and an ajax callback returns some value. The is filled with values from the ajax call, and the is then prepended to another , which acts as a table column. I would like to get the user's attention, to show her/him that there is something new on the page. I want the to blink, not show/hide, but to highlight/unhighlight for some time, lets say 5 seconds. I have been looking at the blink plugin, but as far as I can see it only does show/hide on an element. Btw, the solution has to be cross-browser, and yes, IE unfortunately included. I will probably have to hack a little to get it working in IE, but overall it has to work.
