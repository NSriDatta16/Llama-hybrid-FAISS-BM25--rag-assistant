In systems I've worked on, the linker parameters could be controlled to set the alignment of the start of each section--but not the alignment of individual variables within the section. The alignment of individual variables was determined by the compiler, according to the variable's type. You may be able to use some sort of compiler pragma, platform-specific of course. An alternative is to define your array as an array of whatever type you need aligned to, such as uint32_t. I'm curious to know what you're trying to achieve--it sounds as though you're doing something a little unusual and platform-specific, if you have this alignment requirement. Best to create platform-independent code if at all possible, of course.
