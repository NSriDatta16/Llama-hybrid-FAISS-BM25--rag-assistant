simultaneous independent time series forecasting

I have a number of independent time series. With the term independent I mean that they are not multivariate time series. There is not direct relationship between them (there is not any variable or lag from one time series that participates to another time series) that would make it a VAR problem. So we can imagine a matrix whose rows are different time series and columns are their values over time. To make forecasting with this matrix the obvious solution would be to create a forecasting model for each one of them. I want to ask if someone can suggest some other method that might transform the problem to something simpler. It is an open question and I would like suggestions, opinion, etc. A solution is not necessary.
