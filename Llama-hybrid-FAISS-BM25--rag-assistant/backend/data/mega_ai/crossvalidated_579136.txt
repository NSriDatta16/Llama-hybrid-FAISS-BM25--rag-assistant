First define a metric that monitors the customer behavior you are interested and that is related to the business goal you want to optimize for. Then pick an appropriate statistical procedure. Take your proposed count metric. What if 10% of customers are "indecisive" and pause two or more times, 10% of customer don't pause at all and the remaining 80% pause once. The count metric gives 1 pause per customer, on average. Is this a useful summary (of the hypothetical situation)? Or perhaps it's better to look at the probability that a customer doesn't pause at all? Statistics cannot tell you what's the best metric for your business/product.
