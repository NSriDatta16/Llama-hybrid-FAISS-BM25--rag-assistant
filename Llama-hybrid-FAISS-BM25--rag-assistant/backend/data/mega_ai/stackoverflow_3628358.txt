I'm not necessarily sure what you're looking for here...but the internal implementation of localStorage is going to be browser specific. I wouldn't count on any two browsers implementing the feature the same way internally (just like everything, the implementation and performance will give each browser a different advantage). If you're really interested, I'd suggest pulling down the Chromium source and seeing how they implement things internally.
