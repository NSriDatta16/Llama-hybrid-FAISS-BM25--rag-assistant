Should GBlup method and Bayesian Ridge Regression give the same results?

I am working on genomic selection and I am comparing the performance of two models, one of them is a likelihood method (GBlup) and the other is a Bayesian meyhod (Bayesian Ridge Regression). I am looking at the variance component and they are not exactly equal. So I wounder if it estimates should be equal. Anyone that have some idea?
