Dealing with large time series gaps

I have data with big missing gaps over the same months. Should I split this into separate dataframes? Impute over the gaps (seems like a bad idea). Any other ideas? Real lost and am having trouble finding a similar example online to my surprise. I am currently down sampling the readings to weekly mean readings (as some days have multiple observations) and am then splitting this into three separate dataframes... not sure if this is right and if it is where to go from here.
