Work with results of tbats decomposition

I made a time series decomposition with tbats. There is weekly and yearly seasonality in the data (and maybe also monthly - not really important for the question) x As far as i understand the tbats result is an "additive decomposition", right? I can now access the different parts of the tbats decomposition: level Since i suppressed 'Box-Cox transformation' earlier, level is roughly the same then trend according to a post from Rob J Hyndman in the comments section here: here In order to get the remainder part of the decomposition is it a legit way to just subtract all the parts from the original data? remainder What do i get when i use this: y I am a bit confused right now about the right way to do it... Many thanks for all your input! Update: resid(fit) fit$errors Those two are both the same. I guess these values are related to the tbats method. I am doubting that i can take them as the "remainder" of the decomposition? Is there a way to extract the remainder out of the tbats method? In his paper ' Forecasting time series with complex seasonal patterns using exponential smoothing ' Rob J Hyndman shows remainder graphs for the tbats method so that's why i think it is possible to get in R as well. Anyone any thoughts about that?
