I think 2 is not the best option. It's sounding like you're going to create a single DataContext and keep it alive for the entire lifetime of your program which is a bad idea. DataContexts are lightweight objects meant to be spun up when you need them. Trying to keep the references around is also probably going to tightly couple areas of your program you'd rather keep separate. Running a hundred ALTER TABLE statements one time, regenerating the context and keeping the architecture simple and decoupled is the elegant answer...
