My comment got too long for a comment, so I've made an answer: I made one suggestion in the comment you replied to. My other suggestion would have been roughly similar to @GregSnow's answer, though I might have suggested bootstrapping. There are poisson time series-type models you could fit; here are some references: http://www.econ.ucdavis.edu/faculty/cameron/research/CTE01preprint.pdf gives an overview of count data regression models, which has a section on time series data (sec. 5), and their book has a chapter (ch. 7) on it. http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~rdavis/lectures/montreal.pdf Gives a sequence of steps for estimating a GLM on time series of counts Somne other potentially useful references: M. J. Campbell (1994) Time Series Regression for Counts: An Investigation into the Relationship between Sudden Infant Death Syndrome and Environmental Temperature Journal of the Royal Statistical Society. Series A Vol. 157, No. 2, pp. 191-208 http://www.utdallas.edu/~pbrandt/pests/apsa99sc.pdf If you fit a GLM with a simple time series component where the time component doesn't pick up much, you can argue you don't need it.
