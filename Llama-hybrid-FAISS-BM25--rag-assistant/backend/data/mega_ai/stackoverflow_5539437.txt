You could try to override the following methods from the view controller : - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event; - (void)touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event; - (void)touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event; this way you can replace the usual touches management with your own implementation.
