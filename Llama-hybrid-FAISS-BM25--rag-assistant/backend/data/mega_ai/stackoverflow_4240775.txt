Generate a value to reflect the average brightness of an image

I need to determine if an image is above a certain brightness. Using a scale of 0 - 255 I want to generate a value within this range to reflect the image brightness. i.e. a white image is 255 and a black image is 0. All this needs to take place via a bash script I am building up at the moment. I have no idea what image lib could do this for me though.
