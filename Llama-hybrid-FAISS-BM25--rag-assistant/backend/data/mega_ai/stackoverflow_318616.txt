I would suggest running a dump command every day and just keep the last 5 dumps. That's 30 gigs for you. Here's a script to run automated dumps that I use but I do manually delete backups: ::This script backs up the subversion repository. ::Reset Temp backup storage rmdir /S /Q C:\SVNBACKUP mkdir C:\SVNBACKUP ::Initiate SVN backup. Use svadmin hotcopy svnadmin dump /svn/myProj1 > /home/username/myProj1Bak for /f "tokens=2-4 delims=/ " %%g in ('date /t') do ( set mm=%%g set dd=%%h set yy=%%i ) if exist "\\networkdrive\Clients\SVN\%mm%-%dd%-%yy%" ( rd /S /Q "\\networkdrive\Clients\SVN\%mm%-%dd%-%yy%" ) xcopy "/home/username/myProj1Bak" "\\networkdrive\Clients\SVN\%mm%-%dd%-%yy%" /s /i
