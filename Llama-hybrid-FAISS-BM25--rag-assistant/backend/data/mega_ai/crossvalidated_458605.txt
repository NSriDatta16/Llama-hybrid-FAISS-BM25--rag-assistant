Random Forest: Histograms for the Margins for Different Outcome Classes

I am working with random forests (in R). Is there a way to plot a histogram of the margins of different response outcomes? I have a categorical response variable with three outcomes, and I want to graph a historgram of the margins for each of these outcomes. Is this possible? I know that hist(margin(rf, response)) is a histogram of the margins, but with three outcomes how do I know which outcome it chose to be True? And how do I change it?
