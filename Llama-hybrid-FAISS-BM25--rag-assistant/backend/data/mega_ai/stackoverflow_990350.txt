For large sets you can use what is known as the "sort based indexing" in information retrieval, but for 50,000 words you can use the following: read the entire file into a buffer. parse the buffer and build a token vector with struct token { char *term, int termlen; } term is a pointer to the word in the buffer. sort the table by term (lexicographical order). set entrynum = 0, iterate through the term vector, when term is new, store it in a vector : struct { char *term; int frequency; } at index entrynum, set frequency to 1 and increment the entry number, otherwise increment frequency. sort the vector by frequency in descending order.
