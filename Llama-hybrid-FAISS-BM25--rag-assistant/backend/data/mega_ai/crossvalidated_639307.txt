Outputs of Granger causality and FEVD are opposite of each other

This is regarding cointegration or VAR analysis of bivariate systems. The Granger causality will either say that instrument 1 (say fund) and instrument 2 (say index) are either not Granger causing each other or that the instrument 2 is Granger causing instrument 1. However, when I see the FEVD output, more than 90% of FEV of index is attributed to fund. This happens regardless of the existence of cointegration between the two instruments. In other words, set1 is cointegrated and an ECM is estimated and set2 is not cointegrated and a VAR in differences is estimated. This means that the FEVD and Granger causality outputs are showing opposite results. How do I resolve this? I am using "Analysis of Integrated and cointegrated time Series with R" by Bernhard Pfaff for the R code. R code given below: comboFEVD1
