Settings.Designer file and Staticness

I have a DAL class library that is included in my program as a DLL. The below line is from the DAL to initialize the connection. DataSet ds = new DataSet("table"); SqlConnection cnn = new SqlConnection(Settings.CMOSQLConn); When I run this I get the below error: An unhandled exception of type 'System.StackOverflowException' occurred in CMO.DAL.dll The below is in the Settings.Designer.cs file and it is where it shows the error on the get call : [global::System.Configuration.ApplicationScopedSettingAttribute()] [global::System.Diagnostics.DebuggerNonUserCodeAttribute()] [global::System.Configuration.SpecialSettingAttribute(global::System.Configuration.SpecialSetting.ConnectionString)] [global::System.Configuration.DefaultSettingValueAttribute("Data Source=WWCSTAGE;Initial Catalog=CMO;Persist Security Info=True;User ID=CMOWe" + "bService;Password=ecivreSbeWOMC")] public static string CMOSQLConn { get { return (CMOSQLConn); } } Anyone have any ideas of what to look for? Is it because the connection string is stored in the dll instead of my Main App? I am really stuck on this and will greatly appreciate any help! EDIT 1 I tried Greg's suggestion below: public static string CMOSQLConn { get { return (Settings.CMOSQLConn); } } And I still get the same error... Any more thoughts? Thanks so far! EDIT 2 So I followed the suggestion of regenerating the settings file below and now my setting file looks like this --> public string CMOSQLConn { get { return ((string)(this["CMOSQLConn"])); } } Unfortunately this won't compile now as wherever I have this statement --> SqlConnection cnn = new SqlConnection(Settings.CMOSQLConn); I now get this error --> Error 1 An object reference is required for the non-static field, method, or property 'CMO.DAL.Properties.Settings.CMOSQLConn.get' B:\MyDocs\tmpPATRIOT\Projects\VS2008\DisConnectDAL\CMO.DAL\SupportWorker.cs 13 51 CMO.DAL Is this what I should expect? Thanks!
