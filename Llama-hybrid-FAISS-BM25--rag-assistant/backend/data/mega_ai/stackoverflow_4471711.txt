UIBezierPath containsPoint not working with touchesBegan

I'm drawing a filled shape using the UIBezierPath and i want to check if a user touches this shape. Here is my code: - (void)drawRect:(CGRect)rect { aShape = [UIBezierPath bezierPathWithOvalInRect: CGRectMake(0, 0, 200, 100)]; [[UIColor blackColor] setStroke]; [[UIColor redColor] setFill]; CGContextRef aRef = UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext(); CGContextTranslateCTM(aRef, 50, 50); aShape.lineWidth = 5; [aShape fill]; [aShape stroke]; CGPoint x = CGPointMake(30, 40); if([aShape containsPoint:x]) { NSLog(@"in"); } else { NSLog(@"out"); } } - (id)initWithFrame:(CGRect)frame { if ((self = [super initWithFrame:frame])) { } return self; } - (void)dealloc { [aShape dealloc]; [super dealloc]; } -(void) touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *t = [[touches allObjects] objectAtIndex:0]; CGPoint p = [t locationInView:self]; [aShape containsPoint:p]; } @end I have some issues with the :containsPoint method. It is working in the drawRect-Code, but not in the touchesBegan method and I don't know why :( I would appreciate some help...Thx.
