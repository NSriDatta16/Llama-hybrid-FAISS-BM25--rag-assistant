The only workaround is to set the rows value large enough to return all documents. However, I wouldn't recommend this for anything larger than about 1000 documents. If the number of documents you are fetching is large enough, you will run into memory or timeout issues with the XML you have to generate and parse. For example, if there are 2-3 million documents in your index, do you really want all of that in a single response? It's paginated for a reason. You should probably leverage it. Of secondary concern... Why are you doing this to begin with? What's the point of putting a bunch of data into a search index, if you are just going to pull it ALL out? You may be better off using your original data source at that point.
