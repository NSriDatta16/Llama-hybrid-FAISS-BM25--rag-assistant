It does not answer your question, but... For a chess like game board I think you can also use a table. After all, it is is columns and rows you are displaying. Now I know that many people start shouting 'don't use tables' and 'tables are evil'. Tables are however still a valid tool for showing some types of data, especially columns / rows organised data.
