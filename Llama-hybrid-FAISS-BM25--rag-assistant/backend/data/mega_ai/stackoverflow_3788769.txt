Getting started with a cross platform C++ project

I am starting a c++ project which I would like to compile equally well in Eclipse (Linux) and vs2010 from the same repository and could use some help getting started. While many of the aspects can individually be Google'd, I was hoping for advice on how to approach the problem on a whole. For example, where to keep the library sources, how to structure the make file, and how to integrate googletest (finding a novice tutorial on googletest alone is hard). A link to a tutorial that addresses these aspects would be great, or a series of tutorials that together could help. My background is in C# and I'm trying to maintain the "cleanness" and organization of my VS projects.
