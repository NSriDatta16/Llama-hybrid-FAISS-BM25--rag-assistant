static void Main(string[] args) { var sw = new Stopwatch(); sw.Start(); for (int i = 0; i Average from 3 runs: for with i++: 1307 for with ++i: 1314 while with i++ : 1261 while with ++i : 1276 That's a Celeron D at 2,53 Ghz. Each iteration took about 1.6 CPU cycles. That either means that the CPU was executing more than 1 instruction each cycle or that the JIT compiler unrolled the loops. The difference between i++ and ++i was only 0.01 CPU cycles per iteration, probably caused by the OS services in the background.
