Windows tcmalloc replacement with static linking

A C++ project encounter the memory fragmentation problem, and tried following: nedmalloc- Did not pass the stress test (crashed after 15 hrs), that means it works in the most of cases but not the all. And more memory usage than other allocators. jemalloc- Not ready for Windows? tcmalloc- Compiled with host code with static linking, but conflict with the CRT symbols. Can I just use the alias like tc_malloc(...) to build my own wrapper for allocation? How to do that? Any comments? Thanks in advance.
