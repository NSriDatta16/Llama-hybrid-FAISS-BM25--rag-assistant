In Objective-C, how does +alloc know how much memory to allocate?

Let's say I have a class declared as: @class SomeClass @interface SomeClass: NSObject { NSString *myString; NSString *yourString; } @end And later, in some other code I say: SomeClass *myClass = [[SomeClass alloc] init]; How does SomeClass know how much memory to allocate given that it didn't override +alloc? Presumably it needs storage for the ivars myString and yourString, but it's using +alloc inherited from NSObject. Is there reference material that covers these details?
