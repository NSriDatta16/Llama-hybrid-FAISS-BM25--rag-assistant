I am very much pro-TDD, but I don't place much importance in coverage stats. To me, the success and usefulness of unit tests is felt over a period of development time by the development team, as the tests (a) uncover bugs up front, (b) enable refactoring and change without regression, (c) help flesh out modular, decoupled design, (d) and whatnot. Or, as Martin Fowler put it, the anecdotal evidence in support of unit tests and TDD is overwhelming, but you cannot measure productivity.
