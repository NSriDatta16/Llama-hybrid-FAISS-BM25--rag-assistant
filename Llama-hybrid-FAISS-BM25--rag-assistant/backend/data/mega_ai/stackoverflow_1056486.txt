If you're on Oracle, you can do it without creating a new column. IMO it's a smell to create a column that contains data you already have. The SQL's a bit ugly - I'm sure there's a more elegant way to do it. Generally in these cases I'd ask my DBA friends for advice. User.find(:all, :conditions => "TO_NUMBER(TO_CHAR(dob, 'MMDD')) >= TO_NUMBER(TO_CHAR(SYSDATE, 'MMDD'))", :order => "TO_NUMBER(TO_CHAR(dob, 'MMDD'))", :limit => 5) Some people think a duplicate column is faster, but if you have enough user data that speed's an issue, you should benchmark the duplicate column against a table without it that has a functional index on TO_NUMBER(TO_CHAR(dob, 'MMDD')) .
