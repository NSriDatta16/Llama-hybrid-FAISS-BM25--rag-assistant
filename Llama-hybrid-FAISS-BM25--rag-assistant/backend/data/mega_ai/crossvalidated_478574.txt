How to derive this proportional conditional probability

In the book Bayesian Data Analysis 3rd edition by Gelman et al., the solution for task 3.15 on time series data involves the following expression: $$p(y_t|y_{t-1})p(y_{t+1}|y_t) \propto p(y_t|y_{t-1}, y_{t+1})$$ This means that $y_t$ depends only on $y_{t-1}$ and $y_{t+1}$ . But how do I derive the right-hand side?
