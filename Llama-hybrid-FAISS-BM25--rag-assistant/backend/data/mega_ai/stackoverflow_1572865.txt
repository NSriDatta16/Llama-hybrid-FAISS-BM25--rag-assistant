A particular bit layout by itself is meaningless. Suppose I have the following: 1101 Maybe I say that is unsigned and it represents the value 13. Maybe it is signed and that high bit signifies that the value is a negative which means it is now -5. Consider further that I consider the high two bits to be a base and the low two bits to be an exponent, then I get the value 3. You see, it isnt the storage, its the interpretation. Read up on how floating point values are represented and interpreted; it will serve you much better than seeing how the bits are packed.
