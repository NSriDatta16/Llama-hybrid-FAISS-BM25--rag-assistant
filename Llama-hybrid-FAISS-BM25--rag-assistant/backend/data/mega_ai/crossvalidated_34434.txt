Binary interaction terms using lmer

I am trying to create a model using the lmer function. The model will contain the continuous response term "Average.profit" and explanatory terms "Type", "OtherType," and "Game" all 3 of which are binary. I also would like to include the two way interaction terms, these should have 4 possible levels {00,01,01,11} all of which I am interested in, As I would like to know if any of the 4 combinations increase or decrease "Average.profit". The model is below. > m1 m1 Linear mixed model fit by maximum likelihood Formula: Average.payoff ~ Game + Type + Others.Type + Type:Others.Type + Game:Others.Type + Game:Type + (1 | Subjects) Data: Subjectsm1 AIC BIC logLik deviance REMLdev 54.47 69.67 -18.24 36.47 49.83 Random effects: Groups Name Variance Std.Dev. Subjects (Intercept) 0.025177 0.15867 Residual 0.122703 0.35029 Number of obs: 40, groups: Subjects, 20 Fixed effects: Estimate Std.

How then do I know about the effect of any of the other combinations of Type and OtherType ie. Does 01 result in a higher response variable than 10? If this can't be shown from this model what information can I infer about the interaction between Type and OthersType?
