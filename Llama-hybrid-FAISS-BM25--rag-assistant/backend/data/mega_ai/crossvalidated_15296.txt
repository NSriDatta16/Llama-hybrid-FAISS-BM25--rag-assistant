Chi-square test for checking if values are close to zero?

I have a number of set of data points. For each set I have done linear regression to find the lines of best fit for the data. I hypothesise that the gradients of all the lines of best fit should be zero. I took the average and standard deviation of all the gradients and these are the values I calculated: mean = $5.72 \times 10^{-5}$, standard deviation = $5.02 \times 10^{-4}$ To me, a layman, I would say that this shows that the gradients should be zero given the very small mean value and the tight standard distribution. However I've been told that I need to be a bit more rigorous - apparently I should do a chi-squared test to prove my hypothesis. Could someone please give me a set of steps detailing how I would go about this? Thanks.
