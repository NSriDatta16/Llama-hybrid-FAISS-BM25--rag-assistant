How do I call another function in the same javascript namespace?

I like to organize my javascript in namespace style like below. What I want to know : is there another (shorter?) way to call myFirstFunction() from mySecondFunction() ? I tried this.myFirstFunction() and it's not working so maybe there's some kind of mysterious trick here that I don't know. var myNameSpace = { myFirstFunction: function(){ alert("Hello World!"); }, mySecondFunction: function(){ myNameSpace.myFirstFunction(); } } Thanks for your help as usual, people of SO! :)
