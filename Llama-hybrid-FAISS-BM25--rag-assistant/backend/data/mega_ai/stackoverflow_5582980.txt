How do I archive multiple targets with one action in xcode 4

I have a project with multiple targets that are all for different iOS Apps. For instance one traget for the lite version and another one for the pro version. I want to build and archive all of my Apps at once. Currently I have a scheme for every target which I use to archive each app independently. But now I have to start the archiving, wait until it is done and then start the next one. Is there a way to archive all apps with one single action in xcode 4 or using the command line?
