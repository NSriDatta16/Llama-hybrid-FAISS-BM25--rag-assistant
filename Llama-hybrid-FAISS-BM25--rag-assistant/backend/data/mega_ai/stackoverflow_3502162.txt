Cannot expire cached fragment by default methods in Ruby on Rails + Devise

I'm using Devise as authenticating solution in Rails and I have a cached fragment :recent_users. I want this fragment to expire when a new user is registered, changed or removed, so I put in my(manually created) users_controller.rb class UsersController [:create, :update, :destroy] ... But my fragment does not expire when new creates or changes. My user_sweeper contains basic prescriptions class UserSweeper What am I doing wrong?
