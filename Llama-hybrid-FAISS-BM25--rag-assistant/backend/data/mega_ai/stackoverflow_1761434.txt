Browser detection isn't deprecated in jQuery. Doc page for jQuery.browser , which states: We recommend against using this property, please try to use feature detection instead (see jQuery.support). Deprecation means "slated for future removal." This advice about sniffing for capabilities rather than user agents is just good general advice, and not specific to jQuery. All they're saying is they're making it easier to do the right thing. There's always going to be a need for user agent sniffing however. Unless jQuery.support is updated daily by an army of developers, there's just no way it can keep up with every bug and every feature in every minor point version of every browser. I think the confusion about this arose from the fact that, internally, jQuery no longer does browser sniffing. But the utility API jQuery.browser will continue to exist.
