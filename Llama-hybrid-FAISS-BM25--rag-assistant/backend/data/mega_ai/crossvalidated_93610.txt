How to get the regression from a plot?

I have a dependent variable C and an independent variable VPT . VPT is the average volume per tree (in cubic foot) of a timber stand. C ist costs resulting from a cost function , that calculates the harvest costs per cubic foot (in $). The plot between the two looks like this: The abrupt change at roughly 28 cubic feet results from interaction within the cost function. I want to create a regression model for the two. Based on the graph I assume it must be something like this: fit Is there a way to determine what the best fit is? Do I just have to try around until I get something that fits, or is there a more efficient way? The cost function takes in four parameters: Volume per tree (VPT) Trees per acre (TPA) Skidding Distance (SD) Slope (S) Ultimately I want to create a regression that represents the cost function. Something like this: fit
