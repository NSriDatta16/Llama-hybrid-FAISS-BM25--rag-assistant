Magento Disable Filter Field to Admin Grid

I have a custom module with a backend page. In the grid, I show the customer email as the user name. By default, Magento adds a filter to every column in the grid. Now, when I try to filter by the customer's email, I get an exception saying that my custom table doesn't have an email column. Magento is trying to find that in my custom table. How can I fix this problem, or how can I remove the field of that column so that the admin can't filter by that field. Thanks.
