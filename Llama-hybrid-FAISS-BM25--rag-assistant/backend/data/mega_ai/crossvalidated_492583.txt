How to run logistic regression in R?

I am getting very confused at my data. I want to run a simple logistic regression: IV is called FIRST_cat: High or Low (grouping on a questionnaire) DV is called InsomniaT3: High or Low(Grouping on a questionnaire) Both are scored as factors on R. Code sample below: REGRESSION |z|) (Intercept) -0.8232 0.2827 -2.911 0.00360 ** FIRST_catHigh 1.3247 0.3425 3.868 0.00011 *** --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 (Dispersion parameter for binomial family taken to be 1) Null deviance: 239.68 on 172 degrees of freedom Residual deviance: 223.67 on 171 degrees of freedom AIC: 227.67 Number of Fisher Scoring iterations: 4 I don't understand this output at all. Could someone explain if this is correct? Do i have to dummy code variables? Also when i add in other continuous predictors, they don't seem to show up in the output.
