How to calculate compression ratio when using autoencoder in neural network

For example, if I use an autoencoder to compress a 1000 dimensional data set to 25 dimensions. Is the compression ratio is 40:1? Other info: The dataset contains 5000 samples. 2 million parameters are needed for the encoder. Another 2 million parameters are needed for the decoder. Does these numbers have something to do with the compression ratio calculation?
