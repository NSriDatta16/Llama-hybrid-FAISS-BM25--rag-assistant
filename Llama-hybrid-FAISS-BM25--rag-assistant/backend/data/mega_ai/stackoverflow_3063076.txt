With MVC, you'll need to have a good handle on the browser side: html, css, javascript and/or a javascript library like JQuery. Depending on the UI design, you might find yourself looking at various UI widgets, adding to the learing curve. Like queen3, I too love good architecture and MVC shines when you're building an application that has a significantly large and complicated domain and that will need to be extended and maintained into the future. To make the most of MVC, you may also want to pursue unit testing and Test Driven Design, TDD. TDD doesn't only mean you're doing unit tests but also designing your code to support unit testing; paying attention to concepts like loose coupling and high cohesion. For a "minor" intranet site, I'd stick with webforms, unless you have the luxury and buy-in from management to use this opportunity for learning MVC. I too recommend Sanderson's excellent book.
