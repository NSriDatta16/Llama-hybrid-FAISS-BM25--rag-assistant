Thanks for your response Princess, However in a few other scenarios it fails. I'm using this input: Regex.Replace(@"\L\\A\", @"\\(.)", "$1") It's returning: L\A\ When it should return L\A . I understand you are seeking any other character with the ".", but not sure how to fix it as sometimes there will not be other chars. I managed to put together a working (yet slightly long-winded) approach in C#: for (int i = 0; i But would prefer something more elegant.
