Embedding a web based game into an Android Application

I've created a simple web based game (text driven) in PHP and have recently become very interested in moving this onto Android - originally i thought the game could be rewritten in Java but after some investigation i found you can embed pages straight into an Android application. Am i missing something or will i be able to simply embed my web application into Android and expect it to work flawlessly? Is there any issues i should be aware of? My app uses a login system utilising sessions / cookies - will this pose a problem for Android users? I'd be interested in hearing anyones thoughts that have done something similar and any issues they've encountered. The only issue i forsee is how the page renders on different phones (although this i imagine this can be somewhat nullified by good markup and well thought out javascript) and any issues in regards to sessions / cookies? If anyone has any good resources for doing this sort of work i'd be grateful. As a final thought it'd be good to hear peoples thoughts on whether i should rewrite it or keep it embedded, what are the benefits of rewriting it? Thanks
