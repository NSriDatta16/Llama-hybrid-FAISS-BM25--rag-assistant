I would try incorporating time interval explicitly into the model. For instance, a conventional time series models such as autoregressive AR(p) can be thought of as discretizations of continuous time model. For instance, AR(1) model: $$y_t=c+\phi y_{t-1}+\varepsilon_t$$ can be thought of as a version of: $$y_t=c\Delta t+e^{-\gamma\Delta t}y_{t-\Delta t}+\xi_t\sigma\sqrt {\Delta t}$$ You could draw analogies to time series models from RNN. For instance, $\phi$ in AR(1) process can be seen as a memory weight in RNNs. Hence, you could plug the time difference between observations into your features this way. I must warn that it's just an idea, and I didn't try it myself yet.
