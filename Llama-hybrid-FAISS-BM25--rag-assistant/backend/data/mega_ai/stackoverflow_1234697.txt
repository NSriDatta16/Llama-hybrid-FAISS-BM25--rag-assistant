Are you trying to organize the dlls generated by the app after compilation or the 3rd party and external dlls used by your app? If it is the latter and you are not doing so already you can organize these into any hierarchy you choose outside the app (but inside the solution). You can then reference the dlls from there. Trying to organize the asp.net compiler generated files feels like swimming upstream.
