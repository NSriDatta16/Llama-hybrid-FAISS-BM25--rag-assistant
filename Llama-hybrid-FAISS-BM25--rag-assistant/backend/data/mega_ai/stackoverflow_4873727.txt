Please see BashFAQ/050 : I'm trying to put a command in a variable, but the complex cases always fail! It's best to avoid putting commands in variables for the reason you've experienced, among others. You should use a function and pass it arguments. Why do you want to do this rather than simply executing the command directly? If you must do it, use an array: A=(curl http://123.196.125.62/send -H 'Host: poj.org' -e http://poj.org/send) ${A[@]} Regarding the treatment of single quotes within double quotes, they are treated literally and as part of the rest of the string. Here is the relevant paragraph from man bash : Enclosing characters in double quotes preserves the literal value of all characters within the quotes, with the exception of $, `, \, and, when history expansion is enabled, !. The characters $ and ` retain their special meaning within double quotes. The backslash retains its special meaning only when followed by one of the following characters: $, `, ", \, or . A double quote may be quoted within double quotes by preceding it with a backslash. If enabled, history expansion will be performed unless an ! appearing in double quotes is escaped using a backslash. The backslash preceding the ! is not removed.
