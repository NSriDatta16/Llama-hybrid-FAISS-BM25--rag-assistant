This quote is a bit of an ambiguous statement if not a typo per se . Bayesian statistics fully exploits the fact that the data $x$ is the realisation of a random variable, $X=x$ , with $$X\sim f(x|\theta)$$ by actualising the prior distribution $\pi(\theta)$ into the posterior $$\pi(\theta|x) = \dfrac{\pi(\theta)f(x|\theta)}{\int_\Theta\pi(\theta)f(x|\theta)\,\text{d}\theta}$$ It would thus have been clearer to avoid such a statement and replace it with the data set is directly observed and so is conditioned upon
