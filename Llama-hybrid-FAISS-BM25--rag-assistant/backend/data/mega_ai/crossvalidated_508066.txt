Choosing metric for regression problem RMSE or MAE

I have a regression task where I want to predict no of product sold by manufacturer. My data is time series with each day having a certain no of units sold. I'm slightly torn as to which metric to use. In the past I must confess I've used RMSE without thinking. RMSE - since this penalizes predictions far from truth isn't this what you would want ? MAE why would I use this vs RMSE. I guess it is more intuitive.. But how can I choose which metric? I don't know why you wouldn't want the model to penalize large deviations as RMSE does..
