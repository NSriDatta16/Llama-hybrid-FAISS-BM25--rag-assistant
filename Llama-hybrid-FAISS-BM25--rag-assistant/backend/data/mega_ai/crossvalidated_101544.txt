I think the model is incomplete. Why not consider her hands as a forest of SIR models? There are some things that "die on the vine" and for that "R" applies. Here are links on SIR: http://www.maa.org/publications/periodicals/loci/joma/the-sir-model-for-spread-of-disease-the-differential-equation-model http://www.iaeng.org/IJAM/issues_v44/issue_2/IJAM_44_2_06.pdf http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic_model It seems that lognormal distributions may apply to some limited set of special cases of disease, but they are not general enough for unilateral applicability. I have my head in random forests and a forest of SIR models (see IJAM link) is going to account for variation, give you robust answers, and have a basis that is generally applicable to the problem.
