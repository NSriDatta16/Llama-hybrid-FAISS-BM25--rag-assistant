Thats because you are embedding http://webfe.omega.studiocoast.com.au/media/Assets/Maps/EppingMap.html into an iframe that does not fit the whole screen (you are actually cutting the image and only showing the right corner of the map).. I would rather embed the map directly from google as you can copy the map in the exact size you want.. If you want to do it your way I would suggest you take a look at the javascript found when embedding directly from google.. Open this link in firefox and use firebug to analyze it.. then I guess you will find what you need. http://maps.google.no/maps/empw?url=http:%2F%2Fmaps.google.no%2F%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ll%3D61.143235,9.09668%26spn%3D14.594437,39.506836%26z%3D5%26output%3Dembed&hl=no&gl=no
