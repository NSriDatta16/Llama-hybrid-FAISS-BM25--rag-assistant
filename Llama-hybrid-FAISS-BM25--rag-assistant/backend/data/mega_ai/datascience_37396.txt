Cross validation for anomaly detection using autoencoder

I am using autoencoder for anomaly detection in warranty data. I don't have any ground truth labels to confirm whether the anomalies detected by the model is really an anomaly or not. Since I don't have the labels, I would like to know if there is a way to do cross validation in that case? Any help is much appreciated
