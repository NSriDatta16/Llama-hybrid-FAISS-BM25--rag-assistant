Relationship between cointegrating relationship found via PCA and that found via a Johansen test

Thanks to the explanation given here: PCA on prices or returns I understand how PCA can be used to derive cointegrating relationships. However there is of course another well known method to identify cointegrating relationships: the Johansen test. I attach a matlab toolbox that provides this functionality. http://www.spatial-econometrics.com/ However when I apply the same Rates data from the example shown here (this example shows how to derive cointegrating relationships using PCA): http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/24120-review-of-statistical-arbitrage--cointegration--and-multivariate-ornstein-uhlenbeck/content/MultivariateOUnCointegration/Empirical/S_StatArbSwaps.m The resulting eignevectors/values from johansen() are quite different both in terms of scale and in terms of the patterns produced. The PCA based eigenvectors produces the well known level, slope, and curvature one would expect. The johansen eigenvectors don't seem to have such clear patterns at all? However as both results represent the cointegrating relationship present int he data there must be a link between the two results? 1.) I'd like to understand the link between the PCA based eignevectors and those produced by the Johansen test? Thanks
