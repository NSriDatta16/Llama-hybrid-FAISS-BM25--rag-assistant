Seeking floorplan design VCL toolbar

I'm looking for a VCL component for C++ builder. It should preferably have a toolbar with drag & drop functionality. I want to define a building or area (which might not be rectangular) and split it into "rooms" (or areas, or whatever you want to call them). And I want to be able to put "doorways" (or passages, etc) from a room into its neighbours. is there such a thing? Preferably free. Thanks. In case anyone wants to know the answer, I have verified with TMS that the diagram studio can indeed do this. Although they said "You can use TMS Diagram Studio for that, itâ€™s not that complicated to create new custom blocks, like L-shaped rooms", so I still need to verify that it can handle triangles & lost parrots (polygons).
