Those files belong to the Mail Transfer Agent and maybe the user's mail client. Other programs should tread very softly or better yet keep out altogether. Or is your program a mail client? The "clean" way to do this would be to open up an SMTP or IMAP connection to the mail server / MTA and ask it for pieces of mail on behalf of your user, using his credentials that he gives you. There's a Java mail API for this that knows how to do this well: http://java.sun.com/products/javamail/ .
