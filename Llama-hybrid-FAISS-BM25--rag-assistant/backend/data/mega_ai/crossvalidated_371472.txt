Repeated measures - Just because your data is set up where you have multiple rows per participant doesn't necessarily mean you have repeated measures. From your description of the data it sounds like the survey software output the measure of attractiveness of five different people on separate rows. This would not be repeated measures, if you had them rate the attractiveness of the same person 5 different times then you would be correct in treating this data as repeated measures. I believe what you need to do is restructure your data so that each participant has one row with 5 columns of the attractiveness of the 5 people who's picture they were exposed to as well as whatever other variables you measured. With the missing data, it sounds like you know what social media platforms participants use, therefore if they said they were not on a specific platform you can assume that this is actually not missing data but a NO or a zero or a "Not at all likely" or whatever other value you want to give it but the missing data is not actually missing its just impossible because they don't use that platform. Missing data on the outcome - this is a similar answer to the perceived missing value on the social media platforms question. If a participant was given one group of five pictures, out of four groups of pictures, then they are not missing data on the other three groups of pictures because this was the design of your study. Therefore, in order to compare between participants you will have to take measurements at the group level of the pictures provided so that each person has an average attractiveness score per group of pictures but not for each individual person's photo within those groups. If every participant had the chance of seeing every picture but some opted not to or missed an answer, then this would be considered missing data. Please let me know if this made sense to you!
