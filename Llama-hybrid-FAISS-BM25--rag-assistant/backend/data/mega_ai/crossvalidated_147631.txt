How do you interpret SPSS output for reference groups with multiple levels?

I am using binary logistic regression. My dependent variable is referred or not referred. I have set a reference category for location of subjects. I have chosen to use the largest site with the most number of subjects as my reference group which is site 6. My question is when I look at my output, the sites are listed as numbers, site 6 is not listed, but I coded it as the reference group, so is that site on this output? the values listed in the variable view do not translate over to the output i.e. the cities. Is there a way to get the cities listed when performing the analysis? site (Hollywood) site 1 (Davis) site 2 (Irvine) site 3 (los Angeles) site 4 (San Diego) site 5 (san Francisco) can I assume that site is site 6 or Hollywood? If I reversed the decision and decided to use site 1 (DAvis) as my reference group, would I then assume that Hollywood is now coded as site 5 and and san Francisco is now 4, San Diego is now 3 etc? Finally is there anyway to get the labeling of the sites using language vs. numbers into the output? I know I can go in and change the output manually, but looking for a way to code it into the output when setting reference groups as it is very confusing to look at what site I am looking at with just the numbers. Thanks in advance for your assistance.
