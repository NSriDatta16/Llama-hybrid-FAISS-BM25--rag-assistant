Make a wpf child window and parent window synchronized? i.e Dragging, resizing etc?

I have wpf child window overlayed on top of a parent wpf window. I want to synchronize both of them in terms of dragging , resizing etc. In other words, If I drag the Parent window the child window should also move the same amount in real time. I also am planning not to let the child window go out of bounds of its parent window. Also , resizing the parent window should automatically adjust the child windows size proportionately and so on. How would I go about setting up the framework for this? As I am a relative beginner in this regard , any code samples will be really appreciated! Thanks to one and all!
