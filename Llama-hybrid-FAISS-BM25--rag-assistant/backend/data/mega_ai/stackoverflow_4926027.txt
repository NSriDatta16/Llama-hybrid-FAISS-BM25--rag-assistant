What file system path is used by Android's Context.openFileOutput()?

Re the openFileOutput() method on the Context class to open a file for writing, what internal storage file path does it write to? http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context.html http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/data-storage.html#filesInternal
