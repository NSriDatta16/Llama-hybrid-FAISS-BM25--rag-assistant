Visualizing the variable DAG in a stan / brms model

I would like to visualize the relationships between variables in the brms / stan models I write. I could make these myself for each model, but I'm hoping there's a package to generate them automatically. Does this exist? Here are examples from pymc3 and greta: pymc3: For some model you can call pm.model_to_graphviz(model) and get a result like this: greta: Pulling from the 8 schools example , plot(model) produces a graph like this: In case the pictures above are unclear or fail to appear, let me describe in a little more detail. I'd like to visualize the model itself, seeing a DAG of how the parameters relate to one another (before doing any sampling). This is different than bayesplot or other tools that plot priors, posteriors, or MCMC draws.
