Asp.net mvc small amount data storage

I am writing some learning tests (i.e. what's the answer for...; choose correct options...). Now my question is, how should I store them. SQL db seems quite an overkill, but I really don't know what would be the best choice if I wanted to select random subset of questions etc. Perhaps some simple xml files? Thanks for advice.
