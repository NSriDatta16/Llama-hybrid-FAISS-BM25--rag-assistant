I want to trigger the CRUD row Update operation in a javascript function for an Infragistics WebDataGrid

I have the following Infragistics WedDataGrid (version 2.9.2), and JavaScript function. The first column in the WedDataGrid is a checkbox in a templated field and the javascript function is called on the checkbox click event. I want to trigger the CRUD row Update operation from within the javascript function on the row that was checked. What is the call I need to use? Or can you recommend another way of doing this? I don't want to trigger it on rowselection changed, just when the checkbox is checked. the js: function RowSelectedByCb(id) { // trigger a row Update, but how? } the wdg: Rest of the columns... Other stuff...
