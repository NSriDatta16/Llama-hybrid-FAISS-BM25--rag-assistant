You need to rework your session management, unfortunately. This is a major problem when dealing with Hibernate and Spring, and it's a gigantic hassle. Essentially, what you need is for your application layer to create a new session when it gets your Hibernate object, and to manage that and close the session properly. This stuff is tricky, and non-trivial; one of the best ways to manage this is to mediate the sessions through a factory available from your application layer, but you still need to be able to end the session properly, so you have to be aware of the lifecycle needs of your data. This stuff is the most common complaint about using Spring and Hibernate in this way; really, the only way to manage it is to get a good handle on exactly what your data lifecycles are.
