No, you don't need to include response variables. The (major) purpose for PCA is to find directions that could spread data as much as possible, and some dimensions can be eliminated. There is a natural correspondence for the data after PCA dimension reduction. If the original data is $n$-by-$d$, and after dimension reduction, it becomes $n$-by-$d'$. So the correspondence to the response variables does not change. To incorporate response information, you may what to look for LDA or QDA .
