Tokenize sentence based on a dictionary

I have few key words say - RAM, Speaker, Brand, Display etc. I have made a dictionary of all possible values these keys can have. Like - RAM can have 12, 12gb, 12GB; Display can have 12inch, 12", 12 inch. I am given a title say - "Apple iPhone 5s (Space Grey, 16GB)" I have to extract tokens from these titles and map to the dictionary values and assign appropriate keyword to each token. Like for this - Brand - Apple, Color - Grey, Storage - 16GB How should i tokenize these sentences? Doing it just by space will not be enough- like in this title - "Samsung Guru Music 2 SM-B310E (White)" 2 will be one token and can map to RAM,Display anything. Will any NLP library help with this? I am using python to code and new to NLP.
