:first-letter having difficulty in Firefox

I have a simple style for a 'dropcap' type design for p tags in my CSS. p.introduction:first-letter { float: left; font-family: 'Times New Roman' , Times, serif; font-size: 300%; line-height: 1em; margin-right: 0.08em; margin-bottom: -0.25em; } This seems to be working fine across all browsers, however I am getting peculiar behavior in Firefox. The letter drops down into the text below it. Normally, I would debug it in Firebug, but here's the strange part - It doesn't show up in Firebug! I really have no clue what is causing it. I have reproduced it in the following jsFiddle. http://jsfiddle.net/4zMex/ My standard browser is Chrome. This works in Safari and IE9 as well. Only Firefox exhibits the strange behavior.
