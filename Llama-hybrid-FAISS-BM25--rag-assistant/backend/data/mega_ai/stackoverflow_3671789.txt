Using Visual Studio 2010 Profiler for ASP.NET web pages. Anything helpful besides 'tier interactions'? code coverage?

Does anyone out there run the profiler on thier ASP.NET web page when running locally. I guess it is like a poor mans load tester. The tier interactions seems to be the only real usesful part since that show all the queries made and that is normally the bottleneck in a ASP.NET app... There are alot of other options though... Anyone out there using this can tell me what they are using and how useful they find profiling? Also, can you do CODE COVERAGE on a profiling session ? It seems CODE COVERAGE is only for 'tests' ?
