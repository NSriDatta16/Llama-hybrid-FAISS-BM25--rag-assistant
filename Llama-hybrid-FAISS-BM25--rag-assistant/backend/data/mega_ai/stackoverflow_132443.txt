I've personal experience with both Trident and Gecko. TomTom HOME 1.x hosts Trident, as an ActiveX control. There have been projects to adapt the COM interfaces to Gecko, but they seemed rather far-fetched. We've tried embedding Gecko, and that wasn't too hard. In the end, we reversed our approach though. TomTom HOME 2.x is a XulRunner application. One problem, don't get tempted to write anything but your UI in Javascript. With XulRunner, you can do most things JS can in C++ too, using XPCOM. Licensing under MPL is no big deal; your private code is just a "plugin" not subject to the MPL.
