Homes is an Array, so your first accessor is index based. homes[0] Agents is an Object, and Object containing two keys of the same name. That is a no-no. If you are defining this data yourself, you should change "Agents": { "name" : "Bob Barker", "name" : "Mona Mayflower" } to "Agents": [ {"name" : "Bob Barker"}, {"name" : "Mona Mayflower"} ] Then you could access the data in question by homes[0].Agents[1].name
