Transforming matrix diagonals to ragged array?

I'm trying to come up with a non brute-force solution to the following problem. Given a matrix of arbitrary size: [6 0 3 5] [3 7 1 4] [1 4 8 2] [0 2 5 9] Transform its diagonals to a list of vectors, like so: (0) (1, 2) (3, 4, 5) (6, 7, 8, 9) (0, 1, 2) (3, 4) (5) (Working from bottom left to top right in this example) Is there an elegant way to do this short of iterating up the left column and across the top row?
