Finding the attribute that affects the outcome the most

Lets say I have a medical data set of cause of deaths. df.columns Index(['Cause of Death', 'Community Area', 'Community Area Name', 'Cumulative Deaths 2006 - 2010', 'Cumulative Deaths Rank', 'Average Annual Deaths 2006 - 2010', 'Average Crude Rate 2006 - 2010', 'Average Crude Rate Lower CI', 'Average Crude Rate Upper CI', 'Crude Rate Rank', 'Average Adjusted Rate 2006 - 2010', 'Average Adjusted Rate Lower CI', 'Average Adjusted Rate Upper CI', 'Adjusted Rate Rank', 'Average Annual Years of Potential Life Lost (YPLL) Rate 2006 - 2010', 'YPLL Rate RANK', 'WARNING'], dtype='object') One of the causes of death is "Diabetes." Now If I want to find the single or few attributes in the data that have the most impact on cause of death being "Diabetes," what should I do? If you can, please provide code samples (in Python or pandas) too as I'm a novice.
