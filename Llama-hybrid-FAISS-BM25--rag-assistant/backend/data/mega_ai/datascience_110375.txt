Good sources about advanced scraping?

I build many scraping based on node + puppeteer + PostgreSQL as data storage and queue. Everything works great, but I want to develop myself, my next goal to scraping data from + 100 000 000 pages (I have my proxy server with squid). When I can find sources to learn advanced scraping data, optimize performance, etc? What would you recommend to me?
