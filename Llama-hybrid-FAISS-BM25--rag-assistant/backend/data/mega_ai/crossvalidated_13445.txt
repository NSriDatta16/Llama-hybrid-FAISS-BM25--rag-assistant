How to express an hypothesis that something has increased?

I am trying to express a hypothesis to test for the following claim: A biologist is presented with the data that shows an increase in the average number of bacterias, though he suspects there was no actual change. I came up with the following: $H_0:\; \mu = 40.10^2$ [no change had occurred] $H_A:\; \mu > 40.10^2$ [there is an increase]
