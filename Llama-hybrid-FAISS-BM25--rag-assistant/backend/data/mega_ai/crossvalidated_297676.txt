Logistic regression result interpretation as probability

IIUC, logistic regression can be thought of as performing linear regression on $ \log(\frac{p}{1-p}) $. When that's the case, it's understandable why $\frac{1}{1+e^{-w^Tx}}$ represents the probability (p) of success. What I'm missing is why it makes sense to view the points ($x_i$,$y_i$) as ($x_i$, $\log(\frac{p_i}{1-p_i}))$ to begin with.
