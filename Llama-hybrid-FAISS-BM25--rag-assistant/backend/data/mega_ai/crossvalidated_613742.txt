Efficient sampling of tournament match-ups for Bradley-Terry modeling

I am training an AI to learn to play a game through reinforcement learning. The procedure has produced a set of $N$ agents: $A_1, A_2, \ldots A_N$ . I wish to estimate a skill rating $\beta_i$ for each agent $A_i$ , according to the Bradley-Terry model . In the Bradley-Terry model, the probability of agent $A_i$ defeating $A_j$ in a match is given by: $$ \frac{e^{\beta_i}}{e^{\beta_i} + e^{\beta_j}} $$ If my compute budget were infinite, I could run a full round-robin tournament, playing $G$ games for each of the $\binom{N}{2}$ possible match-ups, and then estimating each $\beta_i$ by maximizing log likelihood. However, my compute budget is finite, so I would like to approximate this ideal approach with a smaller number of match-ups. My question is, what is a principled way to decide which match-ups to run? In other words, given a sequence of match-ups I have run thus far, together with their results, how can I decide on a next match-up to run, with the aim of accelerating convergence to the ratings I would have calculated in the ideal approach? Some relevant details: When I run a match-up of $G$ games between two fixed agents, the computational cost is actually sublinear in $G$ . This is due to some computational details (the ability to batch neural network inference on a GPU). In other words, we can assume that $G$ is a reasonably large constant, meaning that if we schedule one game between two agents, we can get many more "for free". The iterative nature of the reinforcement learning procedure affords me certain expectations (but not guarantees ) about the relative skill levels of the players. I can encode these expectations in an $N\times N$ bool matrix, $M$ , where $M[i, j]$ is true if I expect that $\beta_i \leq \beta_j$ . The transitive nature of skill in the Bradley-Terry model implies that this matrix can represent the edges of a DAG. I mention this in case this matrix can help with match-up selection.
