In general case it is not true. The linear equation parameters estimations depend on the mathematical model of classifier and assumptions made on data (and in practice, on the optimization algorithm applied to solve the learning problem). The following function \begin{equation} f(\sum_i x_iw_i + c), \end{equation} has a strong influence on the parameters of the linear equation. For example, using the sigmoid function in perceptron could result in getting the model parameters close to the logistic regression ones. But another activation function would result in getting linear equation parameters estimation different from those.
