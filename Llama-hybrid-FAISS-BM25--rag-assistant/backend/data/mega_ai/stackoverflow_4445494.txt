Short answer: I haven't heard of anything available. What would you visualize about the schema? It would be hard to generate a visualization of the relationships between tables because there's no explicit data stored about that. (No schema I've encountered actually uses mnesia's (exotic) foreign_key functionality.) I can imagine some visualization of the replication layout of the schema (which nodes have which fragments of which copies of which tables), but due to the lack of table inter-relationship information, I don't think there are visualizations available for that.
