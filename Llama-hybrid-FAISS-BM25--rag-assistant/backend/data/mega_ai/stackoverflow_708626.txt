There is an open ticket for this bug here: https://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/188-single-table-inheritance-bug-only-in-production-environment The solution is listed at the bottom of this ticket: https://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994-ruby-on-rails/tickets/2389-sti-changes-behavior-depending-on-environment To quote: You must explicitly name subclasses in the parent class class ProjectFeedEvent def self.subclasses [ProjectAddedEvent] end end Part of the reason this issue has been around for a while and has not received much attention is that STI is not commonly necessary in Rails. Most contributors to Rails have decided not to use it in their own projects and therefore do not put time into making sure that it is well supported. Here's a blurb that briefly explains why you should not use it and suggests an alternative: http://www.matthewpaulmoore.com/ruby-on-rails-code-quality-checklist#sti My own personal experiences using STI at my company was that is seemed very useful at first, but as time went on we determined that we simply didn't need it enough to warrant the complexity. Since then, our project has grown dramatically and we have not missed it at all.
