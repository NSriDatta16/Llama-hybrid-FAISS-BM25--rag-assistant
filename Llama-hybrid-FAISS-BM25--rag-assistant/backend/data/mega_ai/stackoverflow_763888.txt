Is MS Access (JET) suitable for multiuser access?

I have a product designed to be a desktop product using MS Access file as a DB. Now, some users need to install it in a few PCs (let's say 2 or 3) and SHARE the database. I thought to place the MS Access file in a shared folder and access it from the PC, but... the JET Engine is designed for multiple user access? Any tips or things to be aware of doing this? EDIT: The app is a .net one, using the database as storage (not using the database as frontend)
