You can use cross entropy. See the wikipedia page especially the part on logistic regression. The idea is if Boston wins you evaluate $\ln(x)$ and when Boston losses you evaluate $\ln(1-x)$ where $x$ is the probability your model outputs. You can combine this into one formula: $y\ln(y) + (1-y)\ln(1-x)$. $y$ is the actual result (win or loss). You can use this to evaluate your model and use this as your loss function.
