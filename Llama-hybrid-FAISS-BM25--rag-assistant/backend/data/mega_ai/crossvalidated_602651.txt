Do random forests use weak learners (like XGBoost) or fully grown trees?

So it sounds like boosting techniques (eg. XGBoost) uses weak learners (stumps) to gradually learn sequentially. This is not in dispute I hope. However, with bagging techniques (eg. Random Forest) I'm not sure if it grows weak learners (like stumps) in parallel, or fully grown trees in parallel? Since the definition of "Ensemble modeling" is using many weak learners to form 1 powerful model, I'm leaning towards Random Forests using stumps, but I can be swayed the other direction as well?
