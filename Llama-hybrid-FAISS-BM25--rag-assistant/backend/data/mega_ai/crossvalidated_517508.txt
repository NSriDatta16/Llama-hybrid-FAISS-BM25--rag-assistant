How to add a correction to the parameters in logistic regression s.t. the decision boundary is corrected?

Sometimes we would like to correct the decision boundary of a pretrained logistic regression model $p(y_{temp}=1|x)$ , for example by multiplying by a prior in pursuit of adapting better to the distribution of the real data. Considering a transformation of the form: $p(y_{real}=1|x) = \frac{p(y_{temp}=1|x)}{\alpha}$ How is this going to modify the decision boundary? I was really hoping that this could be something like modifying the log odds s.t. the new scores become $\theta^Tx + \theta_0 + log(\frac{1}{\alpha})$ but in some other sources I have seen the correction to become rather $\theta^Tx + \theta_0 + log(\frac{2-\alpha}{\alpha})$ which really looks "much better" when looking at the decision boundary plot. Am I missing something here? Thanks!
