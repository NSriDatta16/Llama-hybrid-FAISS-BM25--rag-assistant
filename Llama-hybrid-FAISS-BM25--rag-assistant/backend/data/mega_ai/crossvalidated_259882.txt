It really depends on the machine learning tactic that you would like to employ. This seems like a prototypical problem for a random forest using binary classification. In this case, you would choose splits in the data that increases the purity the of the child groups the most. Here's a good article on this: http://people.revoledu.com/kardi/tutorial/DecisionTree/how-to-measure-impurity.htm You continue this process iteratively until the tree is entirely built and all leaves (sub groups of sub groups) have only 1 person in it (bike owner or not). By building a number of trees, you can average their predictions and get very robust results.
