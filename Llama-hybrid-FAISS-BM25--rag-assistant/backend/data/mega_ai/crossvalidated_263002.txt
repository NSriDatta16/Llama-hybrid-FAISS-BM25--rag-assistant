MCMC acceptance rate decreases when proposal variance gets smaller

I am drawing a sample Y of size n from a p-dimensional Normal ($\mu, \Sigma$). Typically, p is 5. I have $\bar{Y}$ and $V = YY'$, the sum of squares. Now I want to draw samples from this $\bar{Y}$, given V. The density of $\bar{Y}$ given V is proportional to $det(v - n \bar{y} \bar{y}')^{(n - p - 2)/2}$ with support$ \bar{y} : v - n \bar{y} \bar{y}'$ is positive definite. This is not a Bayesian framework, but possibly (at least I wasn't able to figure out) MCMC is the only way to draw samples from this not-so-well-known density. I used Metropolis-Hasting's algorithm with a normal proposal density, mean being this $\bar{y}$ and proposal variance being the observed variance-covariance matrix, divided by n. This is the unconditional distribution of $\bar{y}$. This gives me good-looking traceplots but an acceptance rate of about 2%! I tried lowering the proposal variance (say, multiplying by 0.2), but that makes the acceptance rate even low! Isn't acceptance rate supposed to increase if you lower the proposal variance? Is there any simpler way out other than using adaptive MCMC? I've also been thinking of using other proposal distributions but couldn't come up with anything reasonable.
