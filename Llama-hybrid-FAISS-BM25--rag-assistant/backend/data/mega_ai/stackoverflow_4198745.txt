Using braces on the same line as the function declaration is proper JavaScript coding style (see Crockford). Using braces on the same line as the opening block is recommended due to the way JavaScript inserts semicolons wherever possible. Take, for example, this code: return { hello: "world" }; JavaScript parsers will rewrite this as: return; { hello: "world" }; This has a substantially different meaning, and there is no warning to the developer that this has happened, other than incorrect behavior from their script. While function declarations are ok, since function foo(); is not valid JavaScript, and parsers will therefore not insert a semicolon there, such formatting is still strongly discouraged. If you still want to do this, you can alter this setting: Tools - Options - Text Editor - JScript - Formatting - Place open brace on new line for functions.
