What you most probably want is Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. This fig nicely shows how it works: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expectation%E2%80%93maximization_algorithm#/media/File:Em_old_faithful.gif EM works with unlabeled as well as labeled examples. In fact, it can even work with only unlabeled examples and sometimes produce reasonably good models. The downside is that, of course, it is not guaranteed to reach any correct solution, and moreover, it is non-deterministic at its heart. If you want to learn about the idea of such algorithms in general, look for Unsupervised methods or Partially Supervised methods in regression. Your idea sounds also reasonably good, but if you think about it, most probably you will classify incorrectly a lot of unlabeled samples, while EM algorithm will probably classify them better. In closing, surely you can derive an adaptation of logistic regression for your problem, if you are interested in theory. In practice you would most probably need to switch to another model.
