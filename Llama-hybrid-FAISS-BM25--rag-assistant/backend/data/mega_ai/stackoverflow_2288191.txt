Update: please check logan's answer below for a solution available in recent versions of GWT. I had (actually, have) the same problem as you do - after migrating to GWT 2.0 I had a properties file I wanted to use in my UiBinder files. Unfortunately, I couldn't get it to work like I wanted to - it seems the GWT devs want people to use the syntax described in the i18n guide for UiBinder - where a Message interface is created during compile for every UiBinder template, etc. Anyway, you can still use external Messages interfaces like this: .required { color: red; font-weight: bold; } .right { text-align: right; } .textBox { margin-right: 7px; } Though, that only works for stuff like Button 's title, etc, not content of divs :/ You can fill those in the class behind the UiBinder template, but there should be a better way. I was hoping that you could set the inner HTML via innerHTML (since UiBinder should recognize that method and allow to set it's value via XML/UiBinder template) but alas, last time I checked it didn't work :/
