Entity Embeddings of email address

I have a set of email address e.g. guptamols@gmail.com, neharaghav@yahoo.com, rkart@gmail.com, squareyards321@ymail.com..... Is it possible to apply ML/Mathematics to generate category (like NER) from Id (part before @). Problem with straight forward application of NER is that the emails are not proper english. guptamols@gmail.com > Person neharaghav@yahoo.com > Person rkart@gmail.com > Company yardSpace@ymail.com > Company AgraTextile@google.com > Place/Company
