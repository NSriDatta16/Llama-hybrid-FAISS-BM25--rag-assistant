How to distribute iPhone application among 50 specific users?

I am developing an iPhone application which I need to distribute to an organization of about approximately 50 people, no. of users can increase or decrease in future. I checked my iPhone developer account, there I got that I can distribute my application via Adhoc Distribution up to 100 iPhone or iPod touch users. So I think it should be best way to distribute my application to that XYZ organization. On further searching I found that there is also an - iPhone Developer Enterprise Program, which is available to companies with 500 or more employees and a Dun & Bradstreet number. So I want to know - which will be the best way for me according to my requirements ? Also I want to know that say if I choose Adhoc distribution then is there any way for automatic up-gradation in it ie. to install new version of my application on user's iPhone or iPod without deleting the old version. Thanks, Miraaj
