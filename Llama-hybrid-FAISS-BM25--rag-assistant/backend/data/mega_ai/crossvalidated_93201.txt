What you are talking about is a standard holdout set. Test on big subset A and validate on small subset B. Cross validation is different. For 10 fold cross validation you will split the data into 10 subsets of 10 each. For 10 iterations choose one subset of 10 to be the validation set and train a model on the remaining 90 instances and record performance, RMSE for example, on the validation set. Average the 10 performance metrics and this is your estimate of how the final model will perform on out of sample data. The final model you deploy will be built on all 100 instances.
