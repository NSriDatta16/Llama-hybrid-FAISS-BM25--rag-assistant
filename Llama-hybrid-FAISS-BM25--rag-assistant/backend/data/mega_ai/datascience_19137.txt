Similarity between an n-dimensional curve and selected subsets of them

I'm asking here to get some advice. My goal is to detect similar patterns in an n-dimensional data. For example (extreme simple) you have two axes: X-Axis is Time (in seconds) and Y-Axis is Power (in Watt). So you get time-series with a specific pattern. My goal is to select a subset of the time-series and calculate the similarity of other input data to the selected subset. In the end, I want to define multiple patterns and the output predicts which pattern comes most closely to the given input data. Is it suitable to use Machine Learning e.q. pattern recognition for that problem or is it a pure overkill? (I got the advice to use ML; also under the condition that I have an generic n-dimensional data) If ML is suitable for this problem, can you give me some advice where I could start? I don't ask for a solution in any way, I just want to have some suggestions in which direction I should look, because ML is a very new topic for me and I don't have much experience in practice. Thank you.
