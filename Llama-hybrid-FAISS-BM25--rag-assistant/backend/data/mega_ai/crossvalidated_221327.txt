multiple imputation and propensity scores

I have a dataset with 1300 observations and 30 variables. One of the variables has 10% missing data, another has 5% and a third has 3%. Seeing Propensity score matching after multiple imputation I created an averaged propensity score based on the imputed data from MICE. Also based on the work by Mitra et al . Now I need to do the matching procedure - preferably I´d like to use MatchIt , but it does not allow the propensity score to be pre-generated which is needed because of the averaging in the prior step. I can do it in Matching - However, I´m not very familiar with it. Does anyone know if a pre-generated propensity score can be used in MatchIt? I need to supply some proof that the matched groups are similar with regards to the covariates used in the generated propensity score. However, how can this be done is uncertain since the generated propensity score is based on multiple imputed datasets? Would it be OK just to average the imputed values and generated an 'averaged' imputed dataset and use this for the balance check?
