The only reason it is not perfectly obvious that the distribution remains unchanged (provided at least one ball remains) is that there is too much information. Let's strip out the distracting material. Ignore, for a moment, the color of each ball. Focus on one ball. Assume $k$ balls are about to be randomly removed (and not observed), and then a $k+1$st ball will be drawn and observed. It makes no difference what order the selection occurs in, so you might as well observe the very first ball drawn (and then remove another $k$ balls if you insist). The distribution obviously has not changed, because it will not be affected by removing the other $k$ balls. This argument--although perfectly valid--could make some people feel uneasy. The following analysis might be accepted as more rigorous, because it does not ask us to ignore the selection order. Keep focusing on your ball. It will have some probability $p_k$ of being selected as the $k+1$st ball. Although $p_k$ is easy to compute, we don't need to know its value: all that matters is that it must be the same value for each ball (because all balls are equivalent) and that it be nonzero. But if it were zero, no ball would have any probability of being selected: so as long as at least one ball remains, $p_{k}\ne 0$. Pay attention to the colors again. By definition, the chance that a particular color $C$ will be chosen (after $k$ balls are randomly removed) is the sum of the chances of all the original $C$-colored balls divided by the sum of chances of all original balls. When there originally are $k_C$ balls of color $C$ and $n$ balls total, that value is $${\Pr}_k(C) = \frac{k_c p_k}{n p_k} = \frac{k_c}{n}.$$ When $k\lt n$ it does not depend on $k$, QED .
