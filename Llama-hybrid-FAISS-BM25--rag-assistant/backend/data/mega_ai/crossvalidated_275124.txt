unexpected logistic regression coefficients - opposite to chi square/cross tabs

I'm interpreting the coefficients of a regression with all categorical variables and all but one make sense, in that I was expecting the association/direction from my descriptive statistics. I know that the regression controls for other variables, but one coefficient makes no sense - in other words the opposite to what I was expecting. It's social science, so the model itself is weak (can't actually predict using just these variables) but I'm interpreting the coefficients anyway as per my supervisors advice. I was expecting multicollinearity but correlations not showing anything out of the ordinary. My sample size is enormous (25,000). Any advice greatly appreciated.
