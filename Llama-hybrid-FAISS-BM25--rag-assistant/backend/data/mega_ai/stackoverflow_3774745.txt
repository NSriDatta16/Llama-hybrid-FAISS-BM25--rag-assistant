With positive inputs, the function is monotonic. As soon as you cross the origin that is no longer the case. I think you may need to allow non-zero bias in order to develop a neural network with non-monotonic output. Also, make sure that your implementation isn't doing bounded optimization, many optimization algorithms incorporate a non-negativity assumption.
