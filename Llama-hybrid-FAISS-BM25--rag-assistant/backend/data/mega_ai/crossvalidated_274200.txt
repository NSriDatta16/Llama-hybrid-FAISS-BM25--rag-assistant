What you are describing as: 'condense this into three variables so that I can look at the time points together' and 'combined the two variables with two time points into one variable with one time point', could be a perfectly good analysis, called the 'between estimator'. This entails taking the average over the two time points for each individual, for both the dependent and the independent variables. You then just estimate these combined variables in a normal linear regression model. Note two things however: You only model the variation 'between' individuals, i.e. how their independent variables react to the dependent variable, only based on how they differ. Variation over time is not taken into account. For correct inference the between estimator assumes that the individual-specific constant (the unobserved characteristic of each individual) is uncorrelated with the regressors (consult the theory on random and fixed effects and their assumptions). If you are also or additionally interested in effects over time, consider fixed or random effects models.
