You can essentially use antialiasing. To do this, perform the computation and generate the histograms for a few (say 8) values of r within some desired range and with a high density of x values (you should have 8n bins for each x, for some large enough n). You then average each 8x8 (if you are using 8 values of r for your column) block of that column to get a single column of pixels which will appear smoother than the traditional plot. Go to the next group of r values and repeat.
