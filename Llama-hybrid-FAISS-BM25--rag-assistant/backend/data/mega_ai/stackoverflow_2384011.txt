I would agree with darrint. All you need do is include Comparable and define and then you will be able to do all the other comparisons for free! Giving you a lot more flexibility than just defining '>' on it's own. In the words of the pickaxe book: "The Comparable mixin can be used to add the comparison operators ( =, and >), as well as the method between?, to a class. For this to work, Comparable assumes that any class that uses it defines the operator . So, as a class writer, you define the one method, , include Comparable, and get six comparison functions for free." A full example is available in the (free online) pickaxe book: http://ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/html/tut_modules.html#S2 (scroll down a couple of paragraphs to 'Mixins give you a wonderfully controlled way..')
