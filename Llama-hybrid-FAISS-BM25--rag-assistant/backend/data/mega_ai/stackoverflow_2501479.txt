After much searching I stumbled upon this blog entry from the CLR team which not only confirms that CAS is going away in .NET 4, but also gives a great guide on what will break and how to migrate toward the new sandbox model: New Security Model: Moving to a Better Sandbox . From the article: In versions of .Net Framework before v4, we had many ways to restrict the permissions of an assembly or even certain code path within the assembly: Stack-walk modifiers: Deny, PermitOnly Assembly-level requests: RequestOptional, RequestRefuse, RequestMinimum Policy changes: caspol, and AppDomain.SetPolicyLevel Loading an assembly with a Zone other than MyComputer In the past, these APIs have been a source of confusion for host and application writers. In .Net Framework 4, these methods of restricting permissions are marked obsolete and we hope to remove them at a point in the future. Most distressing is the fact that all these deprecated methods of creating a sandbox will start throwing a NotSupportedException . This is exceptionally precarious for any poor souls (like myself) that for whatever reason are required to implement CAS in their organization at this time. You have been warned.
