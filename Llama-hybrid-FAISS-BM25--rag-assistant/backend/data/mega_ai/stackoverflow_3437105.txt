Why doesn't gettext have a db storage option?

I'm doing some i18n on a web-based app using Django, which uses gettext as its i18n foundation. It seems like an obvious idea that translations should be stored in the database, and not difficult to do, but po files on the filesystem are still being used. Why is this? My current suspicion is that the benefits of developing a db backaged are simply outweighed by the reliability/familiarity of gettext as a well-established package. Are there other significant reasons for continuing to store the translations on the filesystem?
