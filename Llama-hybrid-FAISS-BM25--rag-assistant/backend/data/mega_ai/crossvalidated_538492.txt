Liver fibrosis score as dependent variable in multivariable logistic regression that includes elements of the score as independent variables

There is an index for liver fibrosis called the FIB-4 score which is calculated from blood concentrations of the liver function enzymes AST and ALT, platelet count and age. The score is included in different algorithms used as screening for non-invasively predicting patients with advanced fibrosis. We are considering a multivariable logistic regression using one of those algorithms (as a proxy for the presence of advanced liver disease) as the dependent variable in an analysis that includes the factors in the FIB-4 score (AST, ALT, age and platelet count). With the exception of age and the liver enzymes, all these factors are highly correlated with another (P
