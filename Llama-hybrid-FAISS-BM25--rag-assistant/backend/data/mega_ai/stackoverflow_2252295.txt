Projects are organized as decribed in Eclipse. The folder where the project is stored contains all of the significant data. However you have the considerably more powerful paradigm of workspace. A workspace is a set of preferences and projects somehow related. If you want to work with a project you copied (as in "copy the folder") you have to import it in a workspace, but that's it: it's still a single comprehensive folder. On the other hand if you want to have one single project open in the IDE at once you have different choices: use a different workspace for every project close other projects (right click, "close all unrelated projects") and setup a filter to hide closed projects use working sets with a single project This way you are giving up some really cool features, though, such as importing projects into other projects.
