My personal answer to the question as asked is "yes". You may view it as a pro or a con that there are an infinite number of choices of features to describe the past.Try to pick features that correspond to how you might concisely describe to someone what the market has just done [eg "the price is at 1.4" tells you nothing if it is not related to some other number]. As for the target of the SVM, the simplest are the difference in prices and the ratio of prices for two consecutive days. As these correspond directly to the fate of a hypothetical trade, they seem good choices. I have to pedantically disagree with the first statement by Jason: you can do k-fold cross-validation in situations like that described by raconteur and it is useful (with a proviso I will explain). The reason it is statistically valid is that the instances of the target in this case have no intrinsic relationship: they are disjoint differences or ratios. If you choose instead to use data at higher resolution than the scale of the target, there would be reason for concern that correlated instances might appear in the training set and validation set, which would compromise the cross-validation (by contrast, when applying the SVM you will have no instances available whose targets overlap the one you are interested in). The thing that does reduce the effectiveness of cross-validation is if the behavior of the market is changing over time. There are two possible ways to deal with this. The first is to incorporate time as a feature (I've not found this very useful, perhaps because the values of this feature in the future are all new). A well-motivated alternative is to use walk-forward validation (which means testing your methodology on a sliding window of time, and testing it on the period just after this window. If behaviour is changing over time, the saying attributed to Niels Bohr "Prediction is very difficult, especially about the future" is especially appropriate. There is some evidence in the literature that the behaviour of financial markets does change over time, generally becoming more efficient, which typically means that successful trading systems deteriorate in performance over time. Good luck!
