Posting fyneworks star rating data

I am implementing a star rating system on a sports website for users to rate events after they have happened. I then stumbled on this post: JQuery Star Rating It appears to be exactly what I am looking for but I am having some trouble getting it to work as wanted. The examples on the website suggest that I should have the form submit to send the data to be dealt with, however, I would like it to send the data live as the user clicks on the stats. I am also trying to implement multiple instances of the ratings on one page all clickable. Jquery: $(function(){ $('.auto-submit-star').rating({ callback: function(value, link){ var id = $(this).attr('id'); $.post('http://mysite.com/ratings', { "type":"type", "eid":"eventid", "item": id, "rating": value, "uid":"userid" }); } }); }); Some of my ratings: organisation event rating The jquery succeeds in getting to my php code to handle the input but on adding to the database I am finding that nothing is coming through. I have firebug installed as well but can find no record of the post (though am not sure I'm looking in the right place). Any help would be grand, I checked with an alert and value and id are both working as they should within the page.
