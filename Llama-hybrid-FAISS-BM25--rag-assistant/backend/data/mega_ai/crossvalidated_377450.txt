Which SAS output should be used to determine model adequacy for logistic regression

I have the following data: x y 400 0 220 1 490 0 210 1 500 0 270 0 200 1 470 0 480 0 310 1 240 1 490 0 420 0 330 1 280 1 210 1 300 1 470 1 230 0 430 0 460 0 220 1 250 1 200 1 390 0 I'm tasked with fitting a logistic regression model with a logit link to the data and to determine if the model deviance indicates that the model is adequate. However, SAS gives two conflicting outputs. I think I should use the bottom output below with the likelihood ratio, which indicates that the model is useful in explaining $y$ . The reason I think that is because in the past, in R, I would do something like this to determine the model adequacy: model which gives the same test statistic and p-value as the bottom picture. The deviance in the top picture would indicate that the model is inadequate. Where does the deviance in the top picture comes from? What does it tell us?
