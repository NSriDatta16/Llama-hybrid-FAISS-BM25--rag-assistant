Proper Test for Type of Data

Warning: I have not done any statistical analysis since 2012. Problem: I have a list of lists of lists: Each of the $289$ ( $17\times 17$ ) element is $\{\phi_{j,1},\phi_{j,2},f(\phi_{j,1},\phi_{j,2}),\{s_j\}\}$ where $s_j$ is a set of randomly sampled values for a given input $\phi_{j,1},\phi_{j,2}$ . Index $j$ runs from $1$ to $289$ . Function $f(\phi_{j,1},\phi_{j,2})$ is the predicted mean of set $s_j$ . In the language I'm used to the mean $ $ is the "observed" value while $f(\phi_{j,1},\phi_{j,2})$ is the "expected" value. It's worth noting that $f$ can equal $0$ for some (actually many) inputs. If I want to compare the $289$ sampled means $\langle s_j\rangle$ to the predicted means $f(\phi_{j,1},\phi_{j,2})$ , which statistical test do I do? I'm tempted to use $\chi^2$ but the "expected" value is often $0$ and I don't know enough to proceed. What I have done: Beyond just toying with the data, I've done a sort of $\chi^2$ test which I'll call $X^2$ because it's kinda like a $\chi^2$ I think except it's divided by "observed" instead of "expected" to avoid divergence from $1/0$ . $$ X^2\equiv\sum_{j=1}^{289}\frac{\left( -f\left(\phi_{j,1},\phi_{j,2}\right)\right)^2}{f\left(\phi_{j,1},\phi_{j,2}\right)} $$ and then I plugged $X^2$ into the following equation with $k=2$ degrees of freedom: $$ \Gamma\left(\frac{k-1}{2},X^2\right)/\text{ }\Gamma\left(\frac{k-1}{2}\right)\rightarrow \pi^{-1/2}\Gamma\left(\frac{1}{2},X^2\right) $$ which outputs a number that's somehow related to the $p$ -value, maybe? I've also done something similar with $$ 2\sum_{j=1}^{289}\frac{ -f\left(\phi_{j,1},\phi_{j,2}\right)}{ +f\left(\phi_{j,1},\phi_{j,2}\right)} $$ because that's just difference divided by average. However, I'm not sure how to interpret that either! Finally, I messed with the previous equation by putting in absolute values into the variables to take differences and averages in magnitude. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks! Edit: $\{s_j\}$ is a list of $L$ measurements from a simulated quantum system defined by parameters $\phi_{j,1}$ and $\phi_{j,2}$ ; there are $289$ different lists of $L$ measurements corresponding to the $289$ different combinations of $\phi_{j,1},\phi_{j,2}$ . According to physical theories $f(\phi_{j,1},\phi_{j,2})$ should exactly equal $\langle s_j\rangle$ for a given $\{s_j\}$ in the limit $L\rightarrow\infty$ . At the risk of overexplaining there is a second function $v(\phi_{j,1},\phi_{j,2})$ which predicts the variance of set $\{s_j\}$ . Essentially I'm trying to see if the function $f$ is a good fit for the data where data point $j$ is described by $\{\phi_{j,1},\phi_{j,2},\{s_j\}\}$ . The data is simulated but we want to analyze it before running in a real quantum system.
