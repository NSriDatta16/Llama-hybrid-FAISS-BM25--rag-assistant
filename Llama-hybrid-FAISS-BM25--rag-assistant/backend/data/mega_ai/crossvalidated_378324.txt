I think you can determine a dataset whose columns are your time series and add a further column as indicator (NO, YES) of the error/anomaly you want to predict. You can split such dataset in a training and test dataset as made of subsets of time contiguous values. Then, you can fit your model by taking advantage of partial least square learning algorithm, capable to reveal the most influential x‚Äêvariables with respect to the predicted response. As predictors you may choose any time series value at current time except the one where such errors/anomalies occurs. You may anyway include as predictors lagged values from any of your time series.
