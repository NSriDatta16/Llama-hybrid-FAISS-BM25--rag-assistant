Instead of doing diff() with the actual time series data, use instead the d parameter in auto.arima function to define it. lets say your data series is val.ts and you want to do differencing only until first order to make your series stationary, then instead of using auto.arima(diff(val.ts)) , do auto.arima(val.ts,d=1) . I have answered it here to my actual question here Convert double differenced forecast into actual value
