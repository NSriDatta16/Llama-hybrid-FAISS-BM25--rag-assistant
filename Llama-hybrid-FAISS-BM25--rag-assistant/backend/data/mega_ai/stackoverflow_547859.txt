How can i get a BitmapData object out of a File object from a local jpeg file in AIR?

So I am trying to create an image gallery. My AIR application accepts files that are dragged and dropped onto a TileList component. I am using the images as icons but the problem is that they take a long time to load so i want to compress the file data first (I have that part done) The problem is that I can't figure out how to open the file and put the data into a BitmapData object. Any ideas?
