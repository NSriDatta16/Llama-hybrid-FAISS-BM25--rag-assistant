The use of Target-Action will work...It's not practical, but yes you can build a full blown application with just Interface Builder. For a window (NSWindow) you can use these actions... makeKeyAndOrderFront - Brings a window to the front of the window list and makes it the key window orderFront - Brings a window to the front of the window list orderOut - Takes the window out of the window list Assuming you are using the same xml nib file (xib), you can add a window and add a button to that window. Add other windows and set them to not be visible at launch (uncheck visible at launch). Ctrl drag from the button to your windows selecting the desired action. Good luck
