The cookie gets created when you check for it on HttpContext.Current.Response. I worked around this by sticking a copy of the cookie in HttpContext.Current.Items when I set it. Then when I need to check if it's been set or not, I check Items instead of Response.Cookies. Not the most elegant solution, but it gets the job done.
