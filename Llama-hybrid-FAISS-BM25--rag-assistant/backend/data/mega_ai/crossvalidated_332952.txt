I think @jbowman gets the maths spot on, and I agree that the final inequality should be ≤. I will give a more descriptive slant to the derivation as the maths is covered well above. Total variance is the sum of all independent variances plus any covariances present in the dataset. A key assumption you make is zero covariance between Z and $\mathcal{E}$, and the outcome would indicate if that assumption is met or violated. I’m ignoring any variables outside of Z and treatment effect $\mathcal{E}$ here. In the case of unpaired randomly selected samples you assume that there is no correlation between group assignment and variable Z. This means that with very many samples on average the difference in Z between T and C is 0. However, in individual trails there is a a distinctly finite number of samples and there is a risk of imbalance (inversely related to sample size, you can test this your self by generating independent vectors of random numbers of different lengths and measuring the average correlation achieved over many repetitions). This will inflate the apparent effect size, leading to a positive pressure on the estimated $\mathcal{E}_1$. If there is any breakdown in the assumption that Z and treatment are unrelated then there will be an increase in covariance and then what we would see is that a bias creeps in proportion to the covariance. This means that the difference in Z between T and C will become non-zero, leading to an upwardly biased estimate of $\mathcal{E}_1$ no matter how many trials you undertake. Now if you pair based on Z you either get 0 difference in all pairs, or you have an intentionally minimised solution to the difference in Z between the pairs. This means that the influence of the confounding element in Z is intentionally reduced as close to zero as possible. This means that when you sum the differences between pairs you get a sum of squares as close to zero as is possible BY DESIGN. If you have designed your algorithm for pairing correctly it should not be possible to get a less biased estimate of $\mathcal{E}$ The overall conclusion is that paired samples derisk having an upwardly biased and over optimistic $\mathcal{E}$. $\mathcal{E}_1$ will at best equal $\mathcal{E}_2$ over many trials if no correlation is present, but will generally exceed $\mathcal{E}_2$ and certainly will if there is a confounding effect, which will artificially inflate the apparent effect size.
