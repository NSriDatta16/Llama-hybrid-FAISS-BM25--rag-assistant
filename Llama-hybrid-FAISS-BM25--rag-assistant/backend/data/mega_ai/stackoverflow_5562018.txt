Providing an API that accepts an InputStream is probably the most general approach in this area. If the API will often/sometimes be called with the goal of loading from files, then providing an additional overload that accepts File can be advantageous. In the end it boils down to how often something will be used: adding an additional overloaded method doesn't cost much, but if your API is littered with unused methods, it can get less elegant.
