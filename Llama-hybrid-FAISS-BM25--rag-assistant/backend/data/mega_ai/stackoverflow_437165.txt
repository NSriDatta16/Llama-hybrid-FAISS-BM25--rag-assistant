Not sure if you're at liberty to redesign the table, but if the ordinal position of the column is significant, your data is not normalized and you're going to have to jump through lots of hoops for many common tasks. Instead of having table MyTable with Column1... ColumnN you'd have a child table of those values you formerly stored in Column1...ColumnN each in their own row. For those times when you really need those values in a single row, you could then do a PIVOT: Link Edit: My suggestion is somewhat moot. Ash clarified that it's "de-normalization by design, it's a pivot model where each row can contain one of any four data types." Yeah, that kind of design can be cumbersome when you normalize it.
