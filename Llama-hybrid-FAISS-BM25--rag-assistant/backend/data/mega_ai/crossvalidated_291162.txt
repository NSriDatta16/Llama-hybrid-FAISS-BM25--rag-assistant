Dependency in group, what test (Mann–Whitney U) to use?

I have data of the following experiment: A group of 10 people performing task A six times. Another group of 10 people performing task B six times. I want to perform a statistical test to see if B is more difficult than task A, but I'm not sure what test and/or what data I should use. I thought about using the Mann–Whitney U test as it is nonparametric. But I'm not sure what data I should use for this test. I can't compare all the 6 trials of all 10 people performing task A (so 60 trials in total) with all the 6 trials of all 10 people performing task B (again 60 trials) because then there is dependency within a group, right? Should I compare only the last or best trials of everyone? So 10 of Task A vs 10 of Task B. Or should I compute an average for every person and compare the 10 averages for Task A with the 10 averages for Task B?
