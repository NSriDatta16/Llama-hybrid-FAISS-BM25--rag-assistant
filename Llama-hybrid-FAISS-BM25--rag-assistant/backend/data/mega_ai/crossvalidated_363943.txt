Interpreting the robust linear regression

Is the way that we interpret the coefficients of a robust linear regression (rlm function in R) is the same as the OLS regression? Can I interpret the coefficient of a robust regression (forexample) in the following way: Suppose that Age is a predictor and Systolic is a dependent variable, so we can say that with every increase of one year in age, the systolic BP (on the average) increases by 1.051 (95% CI 0.752 to 1.350) units
