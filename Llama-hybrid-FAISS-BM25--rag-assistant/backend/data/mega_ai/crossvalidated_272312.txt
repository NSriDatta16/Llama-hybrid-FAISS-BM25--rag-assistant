Took some digging, but if you look at the MATLAB documentation it uses the SVD function to accomplish this task. If you look at the SVD documentation it states: https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/svd.html [m-by-n matrix A] m > n — Only the first n columns of U are computed, and S is n-by-n. m = n — svd(A,'econ') is equivalent to svd(A). m And then if you take what @user3348782 said you lose 1 degree of freedom when you do PCA and the result is a m-by-(m-1) matrix.
