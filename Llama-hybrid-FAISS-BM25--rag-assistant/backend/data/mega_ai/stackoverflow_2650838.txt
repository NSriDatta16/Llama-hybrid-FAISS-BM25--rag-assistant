If you definitely want to keep the #define 's I would go with Michael's elegant #define STR(code) answer. But defines are more C than C++, and the big downside to defines is you can't put them in a namespace. They will pollute the global namespace of any program you include them in. If it's in your power to change it, I would recommend using an anonymous enum instead: enum{ NO_ERROR ONE_KIND_OF_ERROR ANOTHER_KIND_OF_ERROR } This is exactly the same as the #define s you have, and you can put it in a namespace. And now you can use Michael's other answer involving the static const char* const error_names array yo do what you had originally asked.
