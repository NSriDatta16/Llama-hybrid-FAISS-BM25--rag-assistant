How to model binomial data when the dependent variable is LITERALLY dependent on the independent variable

I am designing an experiment where a subject makes a choice between two options ("low value" (LV) and "high value" (HV)). The subject will experience both options during a trial that takes place before their choice is measured. I want to test whether subjects choose the HV option. To avoid any potential effect of which side the option is presented, I intend to switch the HV option from left to right (and vice versa) between first exposure and the choice test trial. I need to account for subject ID (random effect), so cannot use a simple Chi-square test. I was hoping to use a binomial logistic regression to test whether subjects are more likely to choose the HV option, but obviously this doesn't make sense as the dependent variable is the same as the independent variable. I thought about using the right-left data instead (i.e. choose L/R ~ HV on L/R ) but I think this would just tell me whether HV being on the right or left makes a difference to the choice, rather than whether the subjects choose the HV option. Could anyone tell me how I can overcome this issue? Is there an appropriate test out there that can do this with additional variables, or is there a different way I could prepare the data to make it work?
