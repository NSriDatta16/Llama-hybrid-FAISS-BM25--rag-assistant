your model is not able to discriminate between the positive and negative classes that good, not just because of the data distribution, but also the predictors in both of your classes are not that much efficient to seperate the same. I would suggest to do some feature engineering on top of that, may be removing some can boost the probability. If you are able to share the dataset, then I can also take a look at it. Share your results anyway.
