After doing some more research here I'm pretty convinced this isn't possible with the current implementation of JSF. There just isn't an opportunity to transform the value. http://java.sun.com/javaee/javaserverfaces/1.2/docs/tlddocs/f/selectItem.html The tld shows the itemLabel property as being a ValueExpression and the body content of as being empty. So nothing is allowed to exist inside one of these tags, and the label has to point to a verbatim value in the Java model. So it has be be formatted coming out of the Java model.
