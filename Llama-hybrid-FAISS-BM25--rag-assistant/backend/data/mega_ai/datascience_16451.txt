Let's see (broad strokes ahead) There are two ways of doing it supervised learning and unsupervised learning. For supervised learning we either need previous years data (with the final enrollments) or you need to calculate the probability of some of the applications(Enough so that the model can predict accurately for new data). Then it becomes a problem of linear regression(as probability will be a continuous variable). If you decide a certain cutoff(threshold) that probability(y =0 below and y =1 above ) then it becomes a problem of logistic regression. Once the data is ready machine learning can be done in half an hour. Now to answer your questions. Yes, Regression model is a correct approach but it's a broad term. Not a problem, you need to make the categorical fields factor using as.factor() in R. you should use same information for all the applicants but that doesn't mean you can't use that info. If the fact that information is available has a bearing on the outcome then make a variable and put it 1 or 0 accordingly. If what's available in that information has a bearing then it gets a little tricky, may be count the number of common relevant words and put that number in a variable.
