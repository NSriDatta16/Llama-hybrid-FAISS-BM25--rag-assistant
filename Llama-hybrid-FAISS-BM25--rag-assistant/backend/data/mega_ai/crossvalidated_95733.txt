svm classification visualization

I wish to make a visualization of the separating hyperplane in the SVM algorithm along with my training features. As my feature vectors have 8 dimensions, we cannot directly visualize this. The only potential solution I can think of is to get a projection down to 2 dimensional space. Will this solution even make sense? I know that SVMs will often make the data linearly separable in higher-dimensions and this may not occur in 2 dimensional space. Would this at least be a decent approximation? How do people visualize their classification and their training features in practice? Hi
