I think your choices are to either use some JNI library (though I'm not familiar with one offhand and that would tend to be platform specific), or just try making a network connection to some known IP (google for example). Neither solution is elegant, but I don't believe there is a pure Java API in 1.5 for determining this. In Java 1.6, you could use java.net.NetworkInterface.isUp(), but obviously that won't help for your case of using 1.5.
