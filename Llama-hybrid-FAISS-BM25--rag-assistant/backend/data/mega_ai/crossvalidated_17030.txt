Alright, here's my attempt at an answer, from my (admittedly imperfect) understanding of your question. "Categorical data" is something of a fuzzy and problematic term to begin with. Similar to the "I know it when I see it" definition of obscene material. There are some very clear cases of categorical data, where the values of a variable fall into a small number of clearly defined categories. Beyond that, there be dragons. At some point you get enough categories that your "categorical" variable could likely be treated as a continuous variable. Or alternately, using either subject matter knowledge or a description of a distribution, you can break a continuous variable up into categorical chunks and treat it as categorical. So there's really two answers to your question: Theory Answer: No. You could have infinitely many categories, but for some reason decide not to call it a continuous variable. If you allow for decimal-based categories of an utterly unbounded variable, there's no reason I can see it wouldn't be be uncountably infinite. I'm not sure how often this ends up coming up. In my experience at least, fairly rarely. Applied Answer: The cardinality of most things that would ever reasonably be called categorical data have a cardinality vastly below the cardinality of N . As noted above, there are exceptions, often subject to vague judgement calls.
