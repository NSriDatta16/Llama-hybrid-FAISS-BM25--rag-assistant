Rob, I set up two test pages which are basically copy-and-paste from your instantiation code: http://ericmiraglia.com/yui/demos/storage.php When I go from one to the other I get the success popup each time. The only significant difference between my code and yours is the omission of jQuery (note: this ultimately has no impact on functionality) and the addition of the SWF location (which is important as a fallback for browsers that don't support HTML5 storage; UPDATE: this is what solved the problem Rob was having). But I tested in Safari 5 and FF 3.6, so it should have just been using HTML5 support directly. Do those pages work for you? -Eric
