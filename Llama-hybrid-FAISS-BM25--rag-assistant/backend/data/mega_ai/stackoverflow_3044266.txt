solr schema for article->paragraph structure

I want to index some articles and show the paragraph number in the search result. So I guess the solr schema should looks like this: article_id, paragraph_number, paragraph_content Therefore, I need to parse article first, extract paragraphs and index it one by one. I'm worried about the performance since one article can contain 100 paragraphs. Any suggestion?
