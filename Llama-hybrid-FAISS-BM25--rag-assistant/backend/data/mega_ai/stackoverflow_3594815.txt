C++ comments are not allowed as per the MISRA-C 2004 standard. Certain industries (automotive, specifically) prize MISRA compliant code and therefore, C++ comments are not allowed. I believe the same goes for other static code checking tools such as LDRA, etc... This doesn't make them inherently bad, but it does mean that if you get into certain industries and want to work professionally, you will be actively discouraged from using C++ style comments.
