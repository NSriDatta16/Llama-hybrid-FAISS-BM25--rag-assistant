Don't use forward declaration of ClassB, when ClassA has a data member of this type. It's OK to use it, when it has a pointers to ClassB, as in: #pragma once #include "Father.h" #include "StructC.h" class ClassB; class ClassA : public Father { StructC struct_c_obj; ClassB *class_b_obj; // Some implementation };
