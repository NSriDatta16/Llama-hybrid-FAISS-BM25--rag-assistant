Time series clustering for a dataframe

I have a data frame with multiple ids which have their own time series data. Here, I only provide a simple example. I would like to cluster them into 2 (in real data 10) classes. I have tried to use the time series clustering in this tutorial , however it does not work for me (since it has time and etc.) Could you help me with that? Here is my dataframe: import pandas as pd df = pd.DataFrame() df['id'] = [1, 2, 3, 4] df ['value_1'] = [2, 3, 4, 6] df ['value_2'] = [5,1, 4, 6] df ['value_3'] = [2, 2, 4, 9]
