Can MCMCglmm in R be used similarly to lmer?

I am trying to predict the dispersal distance of plants via plant traits. I also want to include the phylogenetical relationships between species into the model, and add two random factors (species and plot ID). The response variable is continuous and the explanatory variables are a mix of continuous and categorical. Specifically I want to find out what traits of plant species best predict the dispersal distance of species (i.e. building the most parsimoniuous model). The model based on the lmer function would be: mod1 The according MCMCglmm model would like this (?): # specify the prior distribution prior My questions are: 1) Can the MCMCglmm function be used like this or is this approach total nonsense? 2) Can interactions and polynomial terms be used in MCMCglmm? 3) If the MCMCglmm model is not applicable, are there any appropriate solutions for including phylogenetic relationships into a prediction model?
