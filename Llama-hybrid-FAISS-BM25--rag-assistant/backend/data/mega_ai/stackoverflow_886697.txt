I found two things important to understand: Eclipse does not automatically realize if files were changed outside of Eclipse. clicking Refresh on a project does that, so does F5. You can also change a setting to refresh automatically, which, however, does not detect changes instantly (my gut feeling says up to 10 secs delay) Working with servers has the concept of "Publishing" files to Tomcat. This normally happens automatically within a second after any change. Changing many classes can cause many server reloads, which can be a drag if a context reload takes some time (as complex Spring apps certainly do). So I changed a setting to not publish automatically (double-click Server instance)
