nnet package for OLS

First, I simulated some data according to the OLS condition: n Then, I scaled the data and fit a neural network: range11 $y y) d Unfortunately, the predictions are flat and don't capture the line. This code works really well for a non-linear pattern and so I'm confused as to why it won't work in this simpler case. Interestingly, if I scale differently, it works like a charm here and is awful in the non-linear case. anntrain $y y/max(anntrain $y) d y) The reason I scaled to (-1,1) was that I had an issue in a non-linear case and I found this post to be helpful. In fact, scaling to (-1,1) helped in that case but hurts in this case. Is there a consistent way to scale that works ``well" for most cases or did I just happen upon a weird case?
