It sounds like what you want is something from the family of ARIMA models. Auto-regressive integrated moving averages. What those models do is take past means and the rate of change between means annually to predict a future value. So you are asking if an additional predictor (e.g. attrition) will make your predicative model better? Yes it will. Will it make it much more predicative? probably not. Attrition is also auto correlated. Unless you have an idea of what a "seasonal" influence would be, an ARIMA would probably be enough.
