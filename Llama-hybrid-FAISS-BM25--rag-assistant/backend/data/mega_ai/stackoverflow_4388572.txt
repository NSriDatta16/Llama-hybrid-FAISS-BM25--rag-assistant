Use GetModuleHandle(NULL) and GetCurrentThreadId() to get the handle and the thread id you need to pass to that function. Sample: hookHandle = SetWindowsHookEx(WH_CBT,CBTProc, GetModuleHandle(NULL), GetCurrentThreadId()); As Logan says, that would hook only the current process. You need to put the code in a dll to develop a system hook.
