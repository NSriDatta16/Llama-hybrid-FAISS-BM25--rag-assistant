What is the intuition behind SVD?

I have read about singular value decomposition (SVD). In almost all textbooks it is mentioned that it factorizes the matrix into three matrices with given specification. But what is the intuition behind splitting the matrix in such form? PCA and other algorithms for dimensionality reduction are intuitive in the sense that algorithm has nice visualization property but with SVD it is not the case.
